                    <p><title level="m">The Fairy of the Lake</title> is a "dramatic romance in three acts" written by the
                        romantic radical John Thelwall during the 3 year exile (1798-1801) that
                        provides the halfway breathing-space between the well-known political phase
                        of his life, and the little-known elocutionary phase. Thelwall's notoriety
                        ensured that it would never be accepted for performance, and probably he
                        never intended it for the stage; yet like all of his work, this mix of
                        heroic drama, falstaffian farce, and musical spectacle is charged with his
                        trademark eloquence and theatricality, and the success of previous staged
                        readings of Thelwall suggested to several Thelwall scholars that the Fairy
                        too might be revived, and even given a full dramatic production to satisfy
                        once and for all the question of whether Thelwall could speak to the modern
                        world.</p>

                    <p>This was proven beyond a doubt in autumn 2009, when the play was performed as
                        centerpiece of <ref target="http://myweb.dal.ca/jthompso/conference/aac.html">The Art and the Act: John Thelwall in Practice</ref>, the second
                        Thelwall memorial conference, in a premiere collaboration between Halifax's
                            <ref target="http://www.zuppatheatre.com/about.php">Zuppa Theatre
                            company</ref> ("theatre that uses the whole animal") and <ref
                            target="http://theatre.dal.ca/DalTheatre%20Productions">Dalhousie

                        season). A surprise hit, the sold-out run was acclaimed by Halifax media as
                        "innovative," "infectious" and "sparkling". For scholars who attended the
                        conference, it provided one of several opportunities to hear Thelwall's
                        long-silenced voice, including a choral student performance of his 1822
                        doggerel "Auto-biography", a moving recitation of his 1797 conversation poem
                        <title level="a">To the Infant Hampden,</title> and a rousing extempore oration that revived the
                        raucous spirit of 19th century reform dinner in authentic premises of 19th
                        century Halifax privateer's pub. None of the latter was recorded, and thus
                        they share the ephemeral fate of so much of Thelwall's work. But Thelwall's
                        <title level="m">Fairy</title> has escaped that fate, for the organizers of the <title level="m">Art and the Act</title>
                        ensured that it would be filmed, so that the process of its transformation
                        from dusty page to modern stage would be available as a lasting and
                        accessible resource for scholars, students and practitioners of Thelwall,
                        Romanticism and modern theatre alike.</p>

                    <p>This volume presents <title level="m">The Fairy of the Lake,</title> from both scholarly and popular
                        perspectives, to suit a variety of audiences. My introductory essay offers
                        historical background and context. It is followed by a multi-part video
                        documentary by Brooke Fifield, Dalhousie honours theatre student and
                        filmmaker, which includes interviews with Dr. Roberta Barker, chair of the
                        Dalhousie Theatre department, and myself as organizer of the <title level="m">Art
                        and Act</title> conference, as well as several mini-documentaries on various aspects
                        of the production. These combine interviews with Zuppa Theatre directors,
                        and commentaries by student actors, musicians, costumers and stage
                        designers, with rehearsal and production footage, to highlight the creative
                        challenges, practical considerations and unexpected delights involved in
                        bringing a long-neglected romantic text to modern audiences.</p>

                    <p>The highlight of the page is a film of the full production, also by Brooke
                        Fifield, with cast and crew credits and copies of local media reviews.</p>
