                <p>William 
                    Blake&#8217;s <title level="m">An Island in the Moon</title>, written c. 1784, is 
                    a spirited prose satire with extravagant dialogue and humorous as 
                    well as poignant songs and poems, three of which were used five years 
                    later in <title level="m">Songs of Innocence</title>. The title comes from the first 
                    words of a 16-page manuscript that Blake never published and which 
                    ends abruptly, missing its last page or so. Blake was 27 years old, 
                    five years a professional engraver, two years married, and a new co-proprietor 
                    of a print-selling business, hoping, as he makes clear in <title level="m">Island</title>, 
                    to make money and a reputation, but also, no doubt, to buy time for 
                    his other loves, poetry and painting. Blake was also the author of 
                    <title level="m">Poetical Sketches</title>, songs and poems written primarily during 
                    his engraving apprenticeship, when he was a teenager. The printing 
                    of these early literary works in 1783 was sponsored by John Flaxman, 
                    the great English sculptor and classicist, and other friends who, 
                    like Blake and Mrs. Blake, attended the literary salon of Mrs. Mathew. 
                    Blake sang and read his songs and poems at these &#8220;most agreeable 
                    conversaziones&#8221; and, according to one participant, &#8220;was 
                    listened to by the company with profound silence, and allowed by most 
                    of the visitors to possess original and extraordinary merit.&#8221;<note type="editorial" place="foot" n="1">J. T. Smith, <title level="m">A Book for a Rainy Day</title> (London, 1845), 81; 
                        see also Bentley, G. E., Jr. <title level="m">Blake Records</title> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 
                        1969), 26.</note></p>
                <p>The characters and scenes parodied 
                    in <title level="m">Island</title> are almost certainly drawn from the salon environment 
                    of Mrs. Mathew&#8217;s and the gatherings Blake and Mrs. Blake attended 
                    at the houses of his other friends. The boisterous Quid, one of three 
                    philosophers and a self-professed cynic, represents Blake himself. 
                    His name refers to money, specifically a pound, and is Latin for &quot;what&quot;--an 
                    inquisitive &#8220;what?&#8221; as well as an exclamatory &quot;what!&quot; 
                    He mocks everyone's ambition and vanity, including his own; Suction 
                    the Epicurean, also a philosopher, is based on his younger and much 
                    beloved brother Robert, who was 17 in 1784 and whom Blake was teaching 
                    to become an artist. Around the same age as Robert was William Henry 
                    Mathew, Mrs. Mathew&#8217;s son, who was the model for Sipsop the 
                    Pythagorean, the third philosopher. There has been much speculation 
                    on the identities or sources for the other characters. Obtuse Angle 
                    probably represents Thomas Taylor, the Platonist; Inflammable Gass 
                    represents either Joseph Priestley or William Nicholson, both of whom 
                    experimented with inflammable gases; Mrs. Gittipin may be based on 
                    Nancy Flaxman, wife of the artist, and Etruscan Column represents 
                    Rev. John Brand, the secretary of the Society of Antiquaries.

                <p>But knowing the historical references is 
                    unnecessary, for, as Blake says, &quot;the people are so much alike 
                    and their language so much the same that you would think you was among 
                    your friends.&quot; Indeed, God's plenty populates this stage and 
                    are all easily recognized: the wide-eyed student, the insensitive 
                    teacher, the drunken artist, the pseudo-intellectual, the fashion 
                    slave, the gas bag, the religious fanatic, the sexual hypocrite, the 
                    sexually repressed or obsessed. And, as one would expect, communication 
                    among this eclectic crew is highly ironic and continually breaking 
                    down or rendered absurd. Only songs appear communal, with the islanders 
                    quite literally coming together at the end as a chorus.</p>
                <p>Translating one medium into another always 
                    requires compromises to a greater or lesser degree. I believe those 
                    made here have been to the lesser degree while retaining the spirit 
                    of the original. As written, <title level="m">Island</title> has five different settings, 
                    a narrator and 15 characters. I consolidated the action into one place, 
                    a tavern, over one evening, where they &#8220;try&#8217;d every method 
                    to get&#160;good humour,&#8221; and I used 14 characters instead of 15, 
                    merging Steelyard the Lawgiver with either Estruscan Column or Obtuse 
                    Angle, and conflating Tilly Lally and the narrator. I transposed Mrs. 
                    Nannicantipot&#8217;s four lines of text to Mrs. Gimblet and Mrs. 
                    Gittipin. I cut Handel&#8217;s instrumental <title level="m">Water Music</title>, 
                    which was written for a large orchestra, and added two songs that 
                    I felt fit thematically, one from an 1803 letter to Thomas Butts and 
                    one from <title level="m">Songs of Experience</title> of 1794. And I moved the last 
                    scene earlier in the play in order to end with all the characters 
                    coming together in song, a triumphant moment among the disputing group.</p>
                <p>I first read <title level="m">Island</title> in 1977, 
                    while a graduate student at Columbia University, in Geoffrey Keynes&#8217; 
                    <title level="m">Blake Complete Writings</title> (Oxford U. P. 1966). I was immediately 
                    struck by its playfulness, energy, and ribald humor and thought its 
                    characters and actions were perfectly suited for the stage as a one-act 
                    play.<note type="editorial" place="foot" n="2">Island had been staged once before, in Edinburgh in 1971, as <title level="m">Conversations 
                        at Mr. Quid&#8217;s</title>, by Roger Savage, a fact that I discovered while creating 
                        this Website (see Philips, Michael, ed. <title level="m">William Blake, An Island in the 
                            Moon. A Facsimile of the Manuscript</title>. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 
                        in association with the Institute of Traditional Science, 1986, 23 n35).</note> 
                        I had recently finished curating a traveling exhibition and writing 
                        its catalogue on l9th-century British theatre prints and co-authoring 
                        with the actor-musician David Patrick Kelly <title level="m">Tiny Kingdoms</title>, 
                        a cabaret verse-drama performed at the Other End Cafe, Greenwich Village, 
                        23-30 November 1976. It seems that at the time I was inclined to see 
                        nearly every text and event as inherently theatrical, suitable for 
                        farce, melodrama, burlesque, tragedy, or comedy. I wrote the adaptation 
                        that year but did not get 
                    a chance to test my supposition until spring of 1983, during my second 
                    year as a Mellon Fellow in Art History and English Literature at Cornell 
                    University. I had the very good fortune to meet Evamarii Johnson and 
                    Robert Gross, young professors in Cornell&#8217;s Theatre Department. 
                    Evamarii directed the play and Robert played Tilly Lally, the narrator 
                    and owner of the tavern in which the action is set. The rest of the 
                    cast was made up of talented undergraduates and two graduate students. 
                    The music, 21 songs arranged for voice, piano, and flute in the 18th 
                    century ballad mode and central to the play&#8217;s meaning and success, 
                    was composed by the flautist Margaret LaFrance and performed by her 
                    on piano with Maura Malarcher, one of her students, on flute. </p>
                <p><title level="m">Island</title> was performed in Cornell&#8217;s 
                    Kaufmann Auditorium, 7-8 April 1983, as part of &#8220;Blake: Ancient 
                    and Modern,&#8221; a two-day symposium (8-9 April) at Cornell featuring 
                    lectures by Karl Kroeber, Morris Eaves, Albert Roe, Peter Kahn, Robert 
                    Essick, John Stallworthy, Reeve Parker, and myself. For the symposium 
                    I had organized three exhibitions, <title level="m">Blake, Illustrator and Poet</title> 
                    at Olin Library, <title level="m">The Art of Illuminated Printing</title> at the Art 
                    History Gallery, and <title level="m">Prints by Blake and his Followers</title> at 
                    the Herbert F. Johnson Museum. Cornell was awashed in Blake events 
                    that spring, but of them all, I am sure the exuberant performance 
                    and music of <title level="m">An Island in the Moon</title> stole the show. Its success 
                    enabled an encore presentation on 11-12 May in Cornell&#8217;s Drummond 
                    Studio, which we videotaped with two cameras each night. I edited 
                    the 3/4&#8221; videotapes for Ithaca Public Television, which aired 
                    it on 2 December 1983 and a few other nights the following spring. 
                    The tapes were then transferred to 1/2&#8221; videotape for home and 
                    classroom showings. And that is the state in which the performance 
                    had remained for nearly twenty years. Now, with the advances in digital 
                    technology--and the assistance of Todd Stabley, multimedia consultant 
                    at UNC's Center for Instructional Technology--I am able to rebroadcast 
                    the play. The present Website includes the entire 48-minute video, 
                    audio and video clips of each song, dramatis personae and credit pages, 
                    and the text of the adaptation with illustrations of key scenes. I 
                    am delighted to once again introduce students to this humorous and 
                    satirical side of Blake, a side little seen or known but present in 
                    one way or another in nearly all his literary works. </p>
