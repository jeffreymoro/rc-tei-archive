            <p><i>The Fall of Robespierre; an Historic Drama. By S.T. Coleridge, of Jesus College, Cambridge</i>. 8<i>vo</i>. 1<i>s</i>. <i>sewed</i>. Lunn, Cambridge. 1794.</p>
            <p><span class="stagesm">The</span> fall of Robespierre was an event of the greatest importance to the affairs of France, and is a very proper subject for the tragic muse. It may, however, be thought by some to be too recent an event to admit of that contrivance which is essentially necessary in unravelling the plot of the drama. Indeed, we have been informed, that the work before us was the production of a few hours exercise, and must, therefore, not be supposed to smell very strongly of the lamp. Several parts too being necessarily made up of such reports of the French convention, as have already been collected through the medium of newspapers, may be expected to have little of the charms of novelty.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; By these free remarks, we mean not to under-rate Mr. Coleridge's historic drama. It affords ample testimony, that the writer is a genuine votary of the Muse, and several parts of it will afford much pleasure to those who can relish the beauties of poetry. Indeed a writer who could produce so much beauty in so little time, must possess powers that are capable of raising him to a distinguished place among the English poets.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; In the first act, the scene lies in the Thuilleries. Barrere is first introduced thus speaking of Robespierre:</p>

            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; At the end of this work, Mr. Coleridge has subjoined, proposals for publishing by subscription, Imitations from the modern Latin Poets, with a critical and biographical Essay on the Restoration of Literature: a work in which we most heartily wish him success. The present is a very agreeable specimen of Mr. Coleridge's poetical talents, and as the writers, from whose works he proposes to frame imitations are but little known to English readers, though many of them possess much merit, he will render, we doubt not, an acceptable service to the public.</p>
