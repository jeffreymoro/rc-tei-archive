            <blockquote>
                <p>"<span class="stagesm">Power</span> usurp'd like stol'n delight,<br/>
                    "Is more bewitching than the right:"<br/>
                    To gain this pow'r is my grand aim,<br/>
                    My brother <i>Danton's</i> is the same;<br/>
                    But to accomplish this great job,<br/>
                    We must impose upon the mob &#8212;<br/>
                    By craft get such prevailing name,<br/>
                    As may the rabble please or tame.<br/>
                    Then all such men as wish a King,<br/>
                    Or dare to whisper such a thing,<br/>
                    I'll punish with the guillotine &#8212;<br/>
                    Their heads shall never more be seen.<br/>
                    &#160;&#160; Next, Religion I'll abolish,<br/>
                    And the churches all demolish,<br/>
                    Melt down gold and silver flaggons &#8212;<br/>
                    Pay the mob &#8212; they'll fight like dragons.<br/>
                    &#160;&#160; If any bellow for the Church,<br/>
                    Or think their souls left in the lurch,<br/>
                    I'll prove that men have no more souls,<br/>
                    Than dogs, or cats, or very owls; &#8212;<br/>
                    That Religion is a trick,<br/>
                    Of which all wise-men are quite sick;<br/>
                    And those vile creatures called Priests,<br/>
                    The most detestable of beasts.<br/>
                    &#160;&#160; One thing there is that grieves me sore &#8212;<br/>
                    I never yet was puzzled more:<br/>
                    This is a scarcity of corn &#8212;<br/>
                    The like not known since I was born.<br/>
                    It is hard to keep mob quiet,<br/>
                    Without any sort of diet.<br/>
                    I much dread to hear them grumble,<br/>
                    Lest they give me horrid tumble.<br/>
                    But I'll a remedy devise,<br/>
                    That will all Europe much surprise.<br/>
                    They shall see the mob &#8212; as cattle,<br/>
                    Drove, or led to go to battle.<br/>
                    I'll tell them those who boldly fight,<br/>
                    May fill their bellies day and night;<br/>
                    Choose as they please, or cock, or hen,<br/>
                    Or flesh of Kings, and Noble-men,<br/>
                    Or what's better in some cases,<br/>
                    Tender flesh of am'rous lasses;<br/>
                    That when they sup, and when they dine,<br/>
                    They may get drunk with best of wine &#8212;<br/>
                    Or with what they'll find more handy,<br/>
                    A good bellyful of brandy.<br/>
                    This is the liquor I advise<br/>
                    'Twill make them fight, and death despise.<br/>
                    When death's despis'd and thousands slain,<br/>
                    Then where's the scarcity of grain?<br/>
                    Whoever heard men, when they're dead,<br/>
                    Grumble &#8212; roar out &#8212; or cry for bread?<br/>
                    Those that remain of these my tools,<br/>
                    Shall find themselves a pack of fools.<br/>
                    As soon as they have done my work,<br/>
                    I'll Lord it o'er them like a turk &#8212;<br/>
                    And make every man to fear,<br/>
                    The very name of <span class="stagesm">Roberspierre</span>.</p>
