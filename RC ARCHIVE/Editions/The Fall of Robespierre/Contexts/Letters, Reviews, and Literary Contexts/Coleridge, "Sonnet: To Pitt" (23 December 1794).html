                            More blasting, than the mildew from the South!<br/>
                            And kiss'd his country with Iscariot mouth<br/>
                            (Ah! foul apostate from his Father's fame!)<br/>
                            Then fix'd her on the cross of deep distress,<br/>
                            And at safe distance marks the thirsty lance<br/>
                            Pierce her big side! But &#244;! if some strange trance<br/>
                            The eye-lids of thy stern-brow'd Sister press,<br/>
                            Seize, <span class="stagesm">Mercy</span>! thou more terrible the brand,<br/>
                            And hurl her thunderbolts with fiercer hand!</p>
