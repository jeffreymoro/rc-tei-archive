    from <i>Collected Letters</i> [to Lord Byron, 22 October 1815]</p>

    <div class="c2">
    <p>Encinctur'd with a twine of Leaves,<br/>
    That leafy Twine his only Dress!<br/>
    A lovely Boy was plucking fruits<br/>
    In a moon-light Wilderness.<br/>
    The Moon was bright, the Air was free,<br/>
    And Fruits and Flowers together grew<br/>
    On many a Shrub and many a Tree:<br/>
    And all put on a gentle Hue<br/>
    Hanging in the shadowy Air<br/>
    Like a Picture rich and rare.<br/>
    It was a Climate where, they say,<br/>
    The Night is more belov'd than Day.<br/>
    But who that beauteous Boy beguil'd,<br/>
    That beauteous Boy to linger here?<br/>
    Alone, by night, a little child,<br/>
    In place so silent and so wild&#8212;<br/>
    Has he no <i>Friend</i>, no loving Mother near?</p>
