    <p><b>[*]</b> Notebook 22 (11 x 18 cm). Written across three pages near the back of the notebook, upside down and continuing towards the front. The first two sides (on facing pages) are written in portrait (with a soft page break at "covers / the child with sand") . The third side, beginning "How wide," is written in landscape in a deteriorating script. Left and right margins increase, as if the writer is avoiding an object resting on the page, possibly the source of the small stain in the bottom right quarter.<br/></p>

    <p><b>[1]</b> This phrase appears as "Roaring and Whitening" in the cancelled passage to Book V of the <i>Five Book Prelude</i> (see William Wordsworth, <i>The Five Book Prelude</i>, ed. Duncan Wu [Oxford: Blackwell, 1997] Appendix 1, p. 203 line 120). Wordsworth's struggle with this portion near the end of his planned work seems to have been the catalyst for his sudden decision to recast it in thirteen books. Coleridge was given a revised version of Books I-IV and the portion in question (known as the 'analogy passage had been cancelled by the time the Thirteen Book version was complete in 1805. The appearance of the phrase "roar'd and whitened" in CN2780, then, offers compelling evidence to suggest that Coleridge read or heard the analogy passage on his return from Italy in 1806.<br/></p>

    <p><b>[2]</b> The "H" character looks quite similar to Coleridge's "Th" construction; however, Coburn's reading of "How" fits the sentence.<br/></p>

    <p><b>[3]</b> "Raphael's God": this is likely a reference to Raphael's fresco, <i>La Disputa</i>, in the Vatican.<br/></p>
