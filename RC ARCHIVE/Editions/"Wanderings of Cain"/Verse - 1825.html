    <blockquote>
    <div class="c2">Encinctur'd with a twine of Leaves,<br/>
    That leafy twine his only Dress!<br/>
    A lovely Boy was plucking fruits<br/>
    In a moonlight wilderness.<br/>
    The Moon was bright, the air was free,<br/>
    And Fruits and Flowers together grew<br/>
    On many a Shrub and many a Tree:<br/>
    And all put on a gentle hue,<br/>
    Hanging in the shadowy air<br/>
    Like a Picture rich and rare.<br/>
    It was a Climate where, they say,<br/>
    The Night is more beloved than Day.<br/>
    But who that beauteous Boy beguil'd,<br/>
    That beauteous Boy! to linger here?<br/>
    Alone, by night, a little child,<br/>
    In place so silent and so wild&#8212;<br/>
    Has he no friend, no loving mother near?</div>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p><a name="note*"> </a><br/></p>
    <p><b>*</b> The verse lines were first published in <i>Aids to Reflection</i> (London: Taylor &amp; Hessey,1825), 383. They were inserted to illustrate an allegory in which a pilgrim chances upon an oasis in the form of a garden, "such as in the creations of my youthful fancy I supposed Enos the Child of Cain to have found." The verse lines appear in a footnote; however, the difference to the main text in font size is minimal and therefore this "first stanza" is quite prominent on the page.<br/></p>
