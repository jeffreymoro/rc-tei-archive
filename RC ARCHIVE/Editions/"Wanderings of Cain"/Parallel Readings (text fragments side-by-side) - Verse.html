<p>from <i>Collected Letters</i> (to Lord Byron, 22 October 1815)</p>
<p><b>Encinctur'd</b> with a twine of <b>Leaves</b>,<br/>
That leafy <b>Twine</b> his only <b>Dress</b>!<br/>
A lovely Boy was plucking <b>fruits</b><br/>
<b>In a moon-light Wilderness.</b><br/>
The <b>Moon</b> was bright, the <b>Air</b> was free,<br/>
And <b>Fruits</b> and <b>Flowers</b> together grew<br/>
On many a <b>Shrub</b> and many a <b>Tree</b>:<br/>
And all put on a gentle <b>Hue</b><br/>
Hanging in the shadowy <b>Air</b><br/>
Like a <b>Picture</b> rich and rare.<br/>
It was a <b>Climate</b> where, they say,<br/>
The <b>Night</b> is more <b>belov'd</b> than <b>Day</b>.<br/>
But who that beauteous Boy beguil'd,<br/>
That beauteous <b>Boy</b> to linger here?<br/>
Alone, by night, a little child,<br/>
In place so silent and so wild&#8212;<br/>
Has he no <b><i>Friend</i></b>, no loving <b>Mother</b> near?<br/>
