<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Boys,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">On Thursday next I expect to see you. I shall be in Gracechurch Street at about 11 o&#8217; Clock to meet the Tooting Coach; unless I hear from you to the contrary. I shall rely on your coming at that hour. My Lord Sands and the Marquis of Carrots, my illustrious Nephews,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> will be met at the same time, by their father,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> at the other end of the Town. On Saturday Miss Jin and Miss Fanny,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> with half a dozen other Misses, (my sweetheart Emma<sup><a class="fn" href="#note5" name="5">5</a></sup> among them) are to try how much Cake it will be possible to consume at one sitting. And on Easter day we are all invited to dine at M<sup>r</sup> Davenport&#8217;s.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note6" name="6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="body">Your Uncle<sup><a class="fn" href="#note7" name="7">7</a></sup> has this morning begun to move off from Wentworth Place. I don&#8217;t like it at all. He has taken a house in Westminster to be near Master Charley at the school. You will be sorry not to find them my next door neighbours. M<sup>r</sup> Brawne<sup><a class="fn" href="#note8" name="8">8</a></sup> has taken the house.</p>
<p class="body">Present my Comp<sup>ts</sup> to M<sup>r</sup> Lord, and request to know when the first <u>full</u> school day will take place after the holidays.</p>
