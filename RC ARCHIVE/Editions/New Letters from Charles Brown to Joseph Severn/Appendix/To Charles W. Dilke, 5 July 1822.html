<p class="body">Yesterday I deposited in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Robert Skynner,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> of N<sup>o</sup> 62 Great Portland Street, my last Will and Testament, wherein I have appointed you my Executor, together with M<sup>r</sup> Thomas Richards of the Storekeeper&#8217;s Office in the Ordnance Department in the Tower; and likewise I have appointed him and you Guardians to my natural Son, Charles Brown, during his minority. In order to prevent any mistake, I hereby declare that my said natural Son, Charles Brown, is the child who lately resided with me in Wentworth Place, Hampstead, and who at present resides with M<sup>r</sup> Thomas Richards in his house at N<sup>o</sup> 9 Providence (or Sidney) Place, near Vauxhall Gardens, and whom I have hitherto always acknowledged as my Son. I intend to take him with me to Italy. He was baptized in the Spanish Chapel in London, and will have completed the second year of his age on the 16<sup>th</sup> of this month.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="body">Wishing you health and happiness, and no trouble as my Executor, I remain,</p>
