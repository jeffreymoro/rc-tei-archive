<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">Here is Trelawney&#8217;s letter at last. When you have read it, return it for Kirkup, who will, I expect, be with me in a week. I must set Trelawney right about your character, &#8212; you&#8217;re not a sad flighty fellow; and I also hope to assure him Kirkup is not a sad lazy one. Ah! K: is coming! It&#8217;s done at last, &#8212; all right and tight; but be you careful not to breathe a word in one&#8217;s ear in Rome respecting his <u>private affairs</u>, &#8212; nothing will vex him or me more.</p>
<p class="body">I wrote to you about a week ago. The matter that was on my mind to tell you at the close of my letter, and which I could not recollect, came full upon me in half an hour after. It was that I had promised Dilke to remind you about the landscape in the Madonna di Foligno picture,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> &#8212; and that he wishes said landscape to be the <u>exact size</u> of the original, &#8212; all "tale quale"<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> except the bowl, which he desires may be omitted, &#8212; and further he hopes you will see it is properly executed.</p>
<p class="body">My dog is going, &#8212; off somewhere, &#8212; or I must hang him; the wretch has gnawed one of my books, and broken another china plate, &#8212; plate! what do I say? &#8212; a large dish!!!</p>
<p class="body">Remembrances to all friends,</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="note2" name="note2"><sup>2</sup></a> During Dilke&#8217;s visit to Rome with Brown in October 1826 Severn had agreed to arrange for a copy to be made of a detail of Raphael&#8217;s "Madonna of Foligno" in the Vatican. Much to Dilke&#8217;s annoyance, it was ten years before Severn delivered it (KC, ii.10). Brown sent Severn several more reminders. See his letters of <a href="/editions/brownsevern/letters/2jan1827.html">2 Jan. 1827</a>, <a href="/editions/brownsevern/letters/16aug1828.html">16 Aug. 1828</a> and <a href="/editions/brownsevern/letters/13dec1828.html">13 Dec. 1828</a>.
