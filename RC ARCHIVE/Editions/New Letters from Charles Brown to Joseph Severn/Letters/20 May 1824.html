<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">Do not think me unkind for not having until this time made you acquainted with a matter of the utmost moment concerning myself. Indeed it would have been useless in me to ask your advice on such a point, as no opinion of your&#8217;s could have changed my resolution. You who know me well must be aware that though I have heedlessly, perhaps too heedlessly, gained among my friends and associates a character at times approaching to folly and buffoonery, (for which I am now as repentant as I ought to be,) yet that I have always, beneath that trivial behaviour, entertained the most serious reflections; &#8212; you, I say, know this well, and ought not to be surprised at the step I have taken. My future happiness has been the constant idea in my mind ever since I left you; and hating as I do the vain and gaudy glitter of this world, and feeling that nothing but a religious retirement can give ease to my soul, I have determined to enter a Convent. I am now bound by law to remain there for five months, and at the end of that period I cannot believe I shall once desire to bid adieu to so blissful a habitation. Before this reaches you I shall have entered within its holy walls. Hunt speaks very kindly to me under these circumstances, &#8212; I know he means kindly, &#8212; but nothing he can say shall make me waver, &#8212; indeed it is now too late. My Italian friends Gianetti and Magini, when I first acquainted them with this change in my situation, not only refused to believe me, but when I assured them of the fact, they began<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> &#8212; would you credit it? &#8212; to jeer me! &#8212; yet what was their astonishment when I let them into the secret that I was going to live in a Convent of Nuns! Fol-de-rol-lol-fal lal lal la! Yes, you rogue, I have taken half a suppressed nunnery for a villa, with 4 rooms and a pantry on the ground floor, and five rooms and a kitchen on the first. I am buying furniture at a
swinging rate. By the by, I occupy the Abbess&#8217;s apartments. Charley and I intend to be as merry as grigs there. Hunt talks of taking the other half of the Nunnery next October. I pay only 31&#189; crowns per annum. I forgot to tell you I&#8217;ve a glorious romping place, as big as a ballroom, at the top of the house. Did I take you in, as you read the former page? Yes, Severn, thoughts of my future happiness make me retire to this Convent! For the benefit of myself and friends, be it known to all travellers to Florence, that I live at a Nunnery "nel&#8217; soppresso Convento di. S. Baldassarre, a Coverciano, in via che conduce a Settignano",<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> about 1&#189; mile out of "Porta Croce". I have such fine views out of my consecrated windows, &#8212; you must really come and look at them. Mind you give Kirkup my address, &#8212; or, if he has set off for Florence, instantly send it to him per post. Tell him I do not write to him personally, &#8212; yes, I will, &#8212; so here goes: &#8212; My dear Kirkup, How is Madama? and how are you? As for lodgings; give me your orders, viz: the price, in or out of the walls, how many rooms, and so on. I have enquired, and heard of some handsomely furnished rooms, five I think, near the Porta Pinti, and with a bath, &#8212; looking on a beautiful garden and all that, &#8212; but the terms, I understand, are 8 zechins per month, about half a crown per diem. What say you? I remain, Dear Kirkup, your&#8217;s most truly, Cha<sup>s</sup> Brown. Now, Severn, how are you again? O, I rejoice you&#8217;ve earned 20 guineas so easily, and that the Chess-players have nearly finished their game.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> You must not go to England; shall I write to your father?<sup><a class="fn" href="#note5" name="5">5</a></sup> Remember me, in as kind a way as you can, to M<sup>rs</sup> Erskine and the two graces attending her.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note6" name="6">6</a></sup> No, Hunt has not got a Piano. He desires me to ask you if M<sup>r</sup> Finch gave you the two crowns which Thornton<sup><a class="fn" href="#note7" name="7">7</a></sup> borrowed of you, and which M<sup>rs</sup> Hunt gave to M<sup>r</sup> Finch to be returned to you in Rome. I have nothing to say to West for a few days, when I intend to send him a seperate letter, &#8212; so you need not remember me to him. Hunt sends Comp<sup>ts</sup> to many, but waiteth for your promised letter, when, quoth he, he will respond. Make my love to Gott and Gott&#8217;s wife, and eke unto the little Gotts. Tell Teresa<sup><a class="fn" href="#note8" name="8">8</a></sup> to continue to be a good woman. I&#8217;ve hired a man servant, instead of a sham maid, and hope he&#8217;ll turn out a second Gaeturio, &#8212; he has begun well. Signor Bartolemei<sup><a class="fn" href="#note9" name="9">9</a></sup> is banished for a time to Volterra, and his wife is still conventised. Oh! Florence! what delicious wine at 6 crazie a flask! what green peas! what salted tongues! what a paradise altogether! Westmacott<sup><a class="fn" href="#note10" name="10">10</a></sup> is off, &#8212; yet just before he went, there was a doubt about his going, as an odd sort of a second-thought letter came from his father. It is possible he may not go to England this year, but return to Rome from Milan; and if he goes, it is very possible he may turn to the right about again. Wishing you a good appetite to a shabbily cooked dinner, I remain</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="note2" name="note2"><sup>2</sup></a> Playing on Severn&#8217;s gullibility, Brown intentionally delayed the page turn until here to maintain the ruse that he had undergone a deep religious conversion and was now doing penance for his sins in a Convent. For Brown&#8217;s more serious reflection on his religious principles, see his letter of <a href="/editions/brownsevern/letters/11oct1838.html">11 Oct. 1838</a> to Trelawny (appendix). <a href="#2">[Return to the letter]</a></p>

He was a good friend of Severn, one of the leaders of the British artistic colony in Rome where he arrived in 1820, and one of the few to attend Keats&#8217; funeral (KC, i. 227). Brown got to know him during the winter he spent in Rome in 1823-4. According to Gunn&#8217;s <em>Dictionary of British Sculptors</em>, he spent six years in Italy before returning to work in his father&#8217;s busy sculptural practice in London. In 1824 he may have returned temporarily to England, but was back in Italy in 1825 (Severn to Maria Severn, 4 Oct. 1824 [Scott 260-63]). <a href="#10">[Return to the letter]</a></p>
