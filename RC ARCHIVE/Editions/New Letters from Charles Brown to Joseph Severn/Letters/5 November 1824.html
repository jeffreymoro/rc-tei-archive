<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">I waited for the order from Freeborn,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> which you said was coming directly, post after post, that I might make my handsome acknowledgments together with my answer to your last.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> Then I was in the thick of moving from the country to town, and found it convenient to wait still longer. The very minute I received your letter at the Post office, telling me the money was coming directly, away I speeded to the Bookseller&#8217;s and expended the amount in certain volumes which had long since won my heart; &#8212; improvident green goose that I was not to consider that the money must necessarily stick on the road for at least a couple of months more! &#8212; however though I&#8217;ve had <u>no news of or from M<sup>r</sup> Freeborn</u>, thank my stars I&#8217;ve got my dear precious books! Oh! M<sup>rs</sup> Wakefield!<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> I&#8217;m in love with her! I never met with such a woman in my life; and she&#8217;s married! &#8212; and what is worse (or better, I can&#8217;t tell which,) she is gone &#8212; gone to England, and I may never behold her again. What right had you, inconsiderate fellow that you are, to bring me into such a dangerous acquaintance? She with her husband, and the little girl just recovered from the fever, dined with me in the country, &#8212; and there was Hunt and two of his children, &#8212; quite a party, &#8212; and Hunt fell in love with her also, &#8212; and when she went away, we looked at each other, like two men who had been savagely deceived, and I sighed, and he shook his head, and we both sang forth her praises. Really, without any jesting, she haunts my imagination more painfully than pleasantly. M<sup>r</sup> Wakefield and I took a trip together to the Camaldoleri, and there were the Monks just as we left them last year, a set of good and gentlemanly fellows; he was delighted
with them and the scenery. Then we crossed the mountains to La Verna,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note5" name="5">5</a></sup> where we were utterly disgusted at the dirty, sullen, atrocious Franciscans. I astonished M<sup>r</sup> W. by my flow of eloquence in their abuse. Nothing can repay a visitor for his sufferings at the sight of such nasty animals, &#8212; albeit the scenery is very romantic, though in a small compass. I was not so delighted as I expected &#8212; it is extraordinary, but wants the grandeur of extent. The weather was not quite favourable, but I believe we saw every thing. I prefer the scenery at the Camaldolere, though, for a painter, that at La Verna is preferable. In old times Laverna was the Goddess of thieves, pick-pockets, and all sorts of pilferers, &#8212; a connexion of names that gave me no small satisfaction. M<sup>r</sup> &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> W. related to me the whole story of the Misses Erskine&#8217;s conduct towards you;<sup><a class="fn" href="#note6" name="6">6</a></sup> and you ask me if I think you are not greatly to blame. Not only I, but every one else say <u>No</u>. The conduct of the daughters, and your own imagination together, may induce you for a time to think otherwise, but still the old lady&#8217;s death was a matter for which I and the Emperor of China are as much accountable as yourself. Both those daughters want sense; Westmacott, in the midst of his praises, was obliged to acknowledge they were dull and indeed stupid; this is the fact, which joined to a little love-spite on the part of Maria,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note7" name="7">7</a></sup> form the unreasonable reason for their unladylike and unfeeling conduct. You will be glad to hear, because I am delighted at the news, that my friend Mancur<sup><a class="fn" href="#note8" name="8">8</a></sup> is about to be married to my niece, &#8212; the natural daughter of my brother James.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note9" name="9">9</a></sup> I am one of her guardians,
and as she is worth about &#163;2,000, I was always afraid of her being married to a man who would only regard her money, &#8212; but with Mancur it will be otherwise, &#8212; so much so, that I know no man in whose care I would intrust her so cheerfully as in his. Now for bad news, &#8212; poor Daniells has written to me from Malta, a very distressing letter mixed with attempts at joking and deep feeling; he cannot, I am afraid, recover, &#8212; he has lost the use of his legs, and seems wasting away in an awful and rapid manner. Then I have just heard that Lord Charles Murray is dead, who was not, by any means, an indifferent person to me, &#8212; quite the contrary; his own misfortunes, his goodness of heart, and his reliance on my friendship, were matters that joined him to my feelings, though his rank in life seemed to keep him at a distance from me. Kirkup and Madama and Hunt dined with me yesterday; we are all very angry at your obstinacy in remaining in that filthy Rome, where fevers are to be caught at every turn, and fits in every street. Young master John,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note10" name="10">10</a></sup> for some time past, has been a much better boy, under a strict discipline. Did I tell you that Kent,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note11" name="11">11</a></sup> the rival of Kean<sup><a class="fn" href="#note12" name="12">12</a></sup> in London, is M<sup>rs</sup> Hunt&#8217;s brother? I saw M<sup>r</sup> Craufurd lately, as discontented with Florence as ever. I like to give you a puzzle, &#8212; so I&#8217;ll tell you that something is expected to happen here, aye, and shortly, that will please and astonish you to the utmost; when you hear of it, your brains will be working on it for a month after; I dare not, at present, give you the slightest hint of what it is, or who it is, therefore you must indulge yourself in all sorts of guessings; in a fortnight or three weeks perhaps the murder will be out. My parlour is every day becoming more comfortable,
&#8212; a fire-place, (that smoketh no{t}) with a marble chimney-piece, &#8212; sets of book-shelves round the room, &#8212; a good matting under my feet, &#8212; cosey arm-chairs, and the window-curtains in preparation; &#8212; oh! I forgot the sofa! Nor shall I live so solitary as you may imagine, but hush! &#8212; to tell you more of that would make you guess too nearly at my puzzle, &#8212; though what I <u>have</u> said cannot lead your brains the right road. How you will lift up your hands and eyes at the wonderful fact when it reaches your ears! Did West write to you, as he promised, that the Duke of Northumberland<sup><a class="fn" href="#note13" name="13">13</a></sup> has, in England, a copy of the School of Athens, as large as the original, painted by Raphael Mengs?<sup><a class="fn" href="#note14" name="14">14</a></sup> Ought not this fact to make you pause?<sup><a class="fn" href="#note15" name="15">15</a></sup> M<sup>r</sup> Uwins<sup><a class="fn" href="#note16" name="16">16</a></sup> is here, and will, as I understand, soon set off for Rome. Do not pretend to solve my puzzle by saying I am going to take a wife, &#8212; as what I have written I perceive may make you suppose, &#8212; for, (blushes apart,) you will be mistaken. In the mean time I&#8217;ll solve one of your former riddles, if M<sup>r</sup> Wakefield has not been before-hand with me, &#8212; the reason why M<sup>rs</sup> Cooke<sup><a class="fn" href="#note17" name="17">17</a></sup> would not admit you to her acquaintance was that you have a bastard! My Carlino now understands English, and speaks it a little, &#8212; besides which he well nigh has mastered the alphabet, &#8212; a promising child. M<sup>r</sup> Craufurd desires to be remembered to you; he says there will be very few English in Rome this winter. Remember me to all our friends in the Papal dominions. We have quite a throng of Britons in Florence; and the city is superlatively gay with three Operas, and all sorts of goings on,
and the weather is so mild that I almost always sit with the windows open, &#8212; this is quite a warm dry and clear atmosphere compared to the Roman, as far as my experience tells me. How are M<sup>r</sup> &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Finch and Miss Thompson? And how is M<sup>r</sup> Ewing? I&#8217;m charming,</p>
