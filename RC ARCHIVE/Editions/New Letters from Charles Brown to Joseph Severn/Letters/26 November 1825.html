<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">Kirk sends his love to you, &#8212; there&#8217;s a good beginning. M<sup>r</sup> Wightwick,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> a student in architecture, will be in Rome this day week. He will present a letter of introduction to you from M<sup>r</sup> Wakefield. He brought one to me from him, and he will deliver a <u>parcel</u> of introduction from me to your worship, &#8212; viz: Fuseli&#8217;s Lectures, your Music, and "Bacchus in Tuscany"<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> a present from Leigh Hunt, &#8212; who by the by is safe in London, and writes to me merrily.</p>
<p class="body">I have just read in the Roman Papers that the picture painted to order for our George IV by the brothers Ripenhaussen<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> is now exhibiting. This is the chief reason for my writing to so unworthy a correspondent, and I want you to give me some account of it, if possible within &lt;four days&gt; a week after receipt of this, for my "Italian Chat".<sup><a class="fn" href="#note5" name="5">5</a></sup> Tell me what you think of it in <u>expression</u>, <u>composition</u>, and <u>colouring</u>, and give your opinion freely, relying on my not giving up you, to any one or in any way, as my authority. I see its size is 19 by 30 palms. Let me also know if it is going to London, or to Germany; and what sum his Majesty has paid or agreed to pay for it. This will make me a good paragraph, but it must <u>appear</u> to the readers that I have seen it, and that I know all about it. Do, my good fellow, attend to this, and you will much oblige me.</p>
<p class="body">A letter from Westmacott has this moment reached me, without a single anecdote from Rome or <u>Naples</u> for my "Italian Chat". I&#8217;ll write to him, and scold him, in a few days.</p>
<p class="body">I&#8217;m up to my ears in Magazine work. Now I&#8217;m busy with a tale of horror that shall stand as a scare-crow in the Magazine; the scene is laid in Rome, and I think I have invented something to counteract a soporific, &#8212; or if the reader can sleep within four and twenty hours after it, I promise he shall have the ugliest dreams imaginable. To make it the more interesting, I insist upon its being matter of fact. The articles already printed of mine are, so they tell me, liked.</p>
<p class="body">Westmacott writes flamingly about your goings-on. Give me a list of the principal orders you have had, with the names of the parties and the subjects of the pictures.</p>
<p class="body">I must go and fetch Charley from school,</p>
