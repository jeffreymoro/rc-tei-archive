<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">"Ecco<u>mi</u>"<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> by return of post. I enclose an order on Torlonia for 50 crowns. As you did not tell me when you wanted the money, I was afraid you might want it directly, so, not having cash in the house, I purposely drew on London for &#163;30, and send your share, till I come to dun you for it back again. Great cry and little wool! quoth I, for Mancur has <u>not yet sent me a penny</u> of my windfall.</p>
<p class="body">I&#8217;ll annoy Hazlitt. He told his lies to Richards, and Richards to Dilke. Dilke wrote to me about it,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> not saying whether he believed or disbelieved, but merely regretting that the brute might play you a savage trick. I don&#8217;t agree with you, &#8212; a man might have credited Hazlitt&#8217;s lies, without thinking ill of you; &#8212; for instance I &#8212; (and I&#8217;m not quite a wretch), have been guilty of laughing over his shoulder, &#8212; and that&#8217;s no great crime, &#8212; only I said you had not done so, because it is not in <u>your</u> character, &#8212; <u>it is</u> <u>in mine</u>.</p>
<p class="body">This money I send rather unwillingly, as it may tend to make you idle. What a story have you sent me! Just as if you could not tell a gentleman, "Sir, you must leave me alone, and undisturbed, while I am painting."</p>
<p class="body">Fire and fury! You have not yet settled my wager. Can&#8217;t you? or won&#8217;t you? or what? what? what?</p>
<p class="body">It is not likely that Dilke and I will go to Rome in October; but it is very likely we shall be there in Sept<sup>r</sup>, &#8212; the latter half of the month.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> Whither does M<sup>r</sup> Finch flit in Oct<sup>r</sup>?</p>
<p class="body">I&#8217;m delighted to read your good news of all sorts.</p>
<p class="body">I do know of Capt<sup>n</sup> Baynes&#8217;s trip to France &amp;c. You see I&#8217;m a gentleman, and <u>answer questions</u>.</p>
</div>
<div id="closing">
<p class="close">Your&#8217;s most sincerely,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Cha<sup>s</sup> Brown.</p>

<div id="postscript">
<p>Be sure to acknowledge receipt of this money-order immediately, or I shall think it has miscarried, or been purloined.</p>
