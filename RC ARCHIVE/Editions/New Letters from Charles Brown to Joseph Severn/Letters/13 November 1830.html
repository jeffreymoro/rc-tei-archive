<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">We all want to know how the lady and the young gentleman<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> are going on. Perhaps I was bound to write earlier, &#8212; time has slipped away; of course we arrived safe and sound. The Wilsons<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> are here, and have engaged for an apartment, while I do my best in putting them up to Florentine management. I was surprised, on my return, to hear that the hotels were full of English; it appears they are for the most part of the middling classes, &#8212; "pochi signoroni,"<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> &#8212; and we have an army of native servants out of place, with their families, I am told, in great distress; &#8212; besides which, there are a great many furnished lodgings to be let. Carlino has begun music, which will put 60 crowns a year into the Florentines&#8217; pockets, &#8212; see what a charitable man am I! As the vettura dragged me along the road, I discovered why Mons<sup>r</sup> Robert&#8217;s<sup><a class="fn" href="#note5" name="5">5</a></sup> picture is at fault: there were a man and a girl standing on a bank, backed by a clear sky; though very near them, I could not distinguish their features, scarcely their forms, owing to their being cut to pieces by myriads of rays of light; but, as we moved on, they became backed by a house, when, in a moment, they were as distinct as in Robert&#8217;s picture, which proved to me he had (to speak Irish-wise) committed an impossibility. This must have been the reason of our feeling that his picture was out of nature; but since neither Uwins nor you explained it to me, I do the needful by you. While I was away Kirkup had literally done nothing to his picture; never was a fellow like him for sticking fast in a work. I found Trelawny nursing his little girl, his attendant having left him. She is the most respectable servant I have met with in Italy; and, were you not provided, I would
recommend her to you, &#8212; she is a good sempstress, and an excellent nurse. Now mind you let me know how M<sup>rs</sup> Severn is, and tell us if Claudia has picked up a bit. Carlino sends his love to all parties. I did not much approve of your boasted fish sauce; and, as I have made the best essence of anchovies I ever tasted, here is the receipt. Put 24 anchovies, as they come from the barrel with their proportion of liquor, in a small pan, and pour two tumblers of water on them; scale, bone, behead, betail, and wash them in that water, leaving all the bones, heads &amp;c therein, which should be boiled (covered) for &lt;three&gt; two hours and then strained; then put on the strained liquor again to boil with the anchovies cut into very little bits; boil (covered) for two hours and strain again, and pound in a mortar the parts of the fish that remain in the sieve till perfectly smooth, &#8212; then mix all together. If you wish the sauce to be of a darker red, boil a little pounded cochineal with it. A table spoonfull of brandy may be added to keep it. Give this receipt and my love to M<sup>rs</sup> Severn. Remembrances to the Leaches, Gibson, Uwins, and all I like in Rome. N. B. In Florence a glass the size of Fabri&#8217;s Sistine chapel engravings costs only 10 pauls, &#8212; so I think I shall treat myself to the whole set.</p>
