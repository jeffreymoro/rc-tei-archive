                Ravenna. June 7th 1820</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="epigraph">Dear Murray,<br/>
                Enclosed is something which will interest you&#8212;/ to wit/ the opinion of <u>the</u> Greatest man of Germany&#8212;;perhaps of Europe upon one of the great men of your advertisements. (Of all "famous hands" as Jacob Tonson <a href="#n1">[1]</a> used to say of his ragamuffins) in short a critique of <u>Goethe's</u> <a href="#n2">[2]</a> upon <u>Manfred</u>&#8212; Here is the original&#8212;Mr Hoppner's <a href="#n3">[3]</a> translation, and an Italian one. Keep them all in you [original says you or your?] archives for the opinions of such a man as [paper torn] Goethe whether favourable or not are always interesting and this is moreover favourable. His <u>Faust</u> I never read&#8212;&#8212;for I don't know German&#8212;but Matthew Monk Lewis <a href="#n4">[4]</a> in 1816 at Coligny translated most of it to me <u>viva voce</u> and I was naturally [much&#8212;added above the line] struck with it; but it was the Staubach &amp; the Jungfrau&#8212;and something else&#8212;much more than Faustus that made me write Manfred. &#8212;The first scene however &amp; that of Faustus are very similar. Acknowledge this letter</span></p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<div align="left"><br/>
    <strong><a name="n1"> </a>1.</strong> Jacob Tonson (1656-1736) a London publisher; he published many of Dryden's works. Also secretary of the Kit Kat club and, together with Buckley, he published the <em>Spectator</em> from 1712.<br/></div>



<div align="left"><br/>
    <br/>
    <strong><a name="n2"> </a>2.</strong> Byron apparently enclosed Goethe's comments on his 1816 poem <em>Manfred</em>. His obvious admiration for Goethe and his denial that his own poem is derivative are particularly interesting in the context of this web resource, which demonstrates the importance of <em>Manfred</em> to Hemans.<br/></div>
<div align="left"><br/></div>


<div align="left"><br/>
    <strong><a name="n3"> </a>3.</strong> Richard Hoppner, British Consul at Venice and one of Byron's circle.<br/></div>
<div align="left"><br/></div>


<div align="left"><br/>
    <strong><a name="n4"> </a>4.</strong> Matthew Monk Lewis had been a friend of Byron since 1813; his real name was Matthew Gregory Lewis.<br/></div>
<div align="left"><br/></div>


<div align="left"><br/>
    <strong><a name="n5"> </a>5.</strong> Scott was another of Murray's authors and the publisher had obviously enclosed a copy of <em>Ivanhoe</em> in a parcel of books he had sent to Byron.<br/></div>
<div align="left"><br/></div>


<div align="left"><br/>
    <strong><a name="n6"> </a>6.</strong> <em>Whistlecraft</em> was a satirical poem written by John Hookham Frere.<br/></div>
<div align="left"><br/></div>


<div align="left"><br/>
    <strong><a name="n7"> </a>7.</strong> Barry Cornwall was the pen name of Bryan Waller Procter, who had been at Harrow with Byron. Cornwall edited several of the annuals in which Hemans published.<br/></div>
<div align="left"><br/></div>


<div align="left"><br/>
    <strong><a name="n8"> </a>8.</strong> This is Byron's somewhat irascible response to Murray's enclosure of Felicia Hemans's 1820 poem, <em>The Sceptic</em>.<br/></div>
<div align="left"><br/></div>


<div align="left"><br/>
    <strong><a name="n9"> </a>9.</strong> All three men were political killers: Charles Sandt had assassinated Kotzebue, Louvel, the Duc de Berri and Arthur Thistlewood was hanged on May 1st 1820 for his part in the Cato Street Conspiracy, a plot by militant radicals to murder the entire cabinet.<br/></div>
<div align="left"><br/></div>


<div align="left"><br/>
    <strong><a name="n10"> </a>10.</strong> Byron is here referring the generally held belief that, on his deathbed, Voltaire (1694-1778) was badly frightened and called in a priest to hear his confession, thus recanting his scepticism. However the account of his deathbed indicates that Voltaire's sceptical position did not waver. On the other hand, Frederick the Great was noted for his Christian faith and his deathbed statement was: "I am convinced that nothing is destroyed in nature. So I know for certainty that the more noble part of me (that is, the soul) will not die. Though I may not be a King in my future life. I shall nevertheless live an active life."<br/></div>



<div align="left"><br/>
    <strong><br/>
        <a name="n11"> </a>11.</strong> Helga Herbert&#8212;refers to William Herbert, one of the early <em>Edinburgh</em> reviewers; his poem "Helga" was published in 1815. Byron comments here on his 1820 poem, <em><i>Hedin</i></em><i>, or the <em>Spectre of the Tomb</em></i>, which had a rather unusual metre.<br/></div>
