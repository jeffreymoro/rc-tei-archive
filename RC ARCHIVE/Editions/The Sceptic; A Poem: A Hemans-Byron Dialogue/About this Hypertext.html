    <h3>The Text</h3>
    <p>This edition presents and excavates the text and context of Felicia Hemans's 1820 pamphlet-poem <i>The Sceptic</i>. Neglected by the poet's current editors, <i>The Sceptic</i> places Hemans in direct contention with Byron over belief in an afterlife in a time of uncertainty for both poets. The edition includes letters, reviews, poems, and images. A set of critical essays by Anne Hartman and Andrew Elfenbein and editors Barbara Taylor and Nanora Sweet probe Hemans's work for its engagement with Byron, allusions to topics of the day (from Peterloo to scientific debate in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>), exploitation of a poetry of praise and blame shared with Byron, and negotiation of gender through poetic style and philosophical argument.</p>
