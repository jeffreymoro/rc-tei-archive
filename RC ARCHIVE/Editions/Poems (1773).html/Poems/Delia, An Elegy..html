    Y ES, DELIA  loves! My fondest vows are blest ;<br/>
    Farewel the memory of her past disdain ;<br/>
    One kind relenting glance has heal'd my breast,<br/>
    And balanc'd in a moment years of pain.<br/>
    <br/>
    O'er her soft cheek consenting blushes move,<br/>
    And with kind stealth her secret soul betray ;<br/> </td>

    Sure as the red'ning east foretells the day.<br/>
    <br/>
    Her tender smiles shall pay me with delight<br/>
    For many a bitter pang of jealous fear ;<br/>
    For many an anxious day, and sleepless night,<br/>
    For many a stifled sigh, and silent tear.<br/>
    <br/>
    DELIA shall come, and bless my lone retreat ;<br/>
    She does not scorn the shepherd's lowly life ;<br/>
    She will not blush to leave the splendid seat,<br/>
    And own the title of a poor man's wife.<br/>
    <br/>
    The simple knot shall bind her gather'd hair,<br/>
    The russet garment clasp her lovely breast :<br/>
    DELIA shall mix amongst the rural fair,<br/>
    By charms alone distinguish'd from the rest.<br/>

    <br/>
    How sweet to muse by murmuring springs reclin'd ;<br/>
    Or loitering careless in the shady grove,<br/>
    Indulge the gentlest feelings of the mind,<br/>
    And pity those who live to aught but love !<br/>

    When DELIA's hand unlocks her shining hair,<br/>
    And o'er her shoulder spreads the flowing gold,<br/>
    Base were the man who one bright tress would spare<br/>
    For all the ore of India's coarser mold.<br/>
    <br/>
    By her dear side with what content I'd toil,<br/>
    Patient of any labour in her sight ;<br/>
    Guide the slow plough, or turn the stubborn soil,<br/>

    To watch the firstlings at their harmless play ;<br/>
    With welcome shade to screen the languid flowers,<br/>
    That sicken in the summer's parching ray.<br/>
    <br/>
    Oft will she stoop amidst her evening walk,<br/>
    With tender hand each bruised plant to rear ;<br/>
    To bind the drooping lily's broken stalk,<br/>
    And nurse the blossoms of the infant year.<br/>
    <br/>
    When beating rains forbid our feet to roam,<br/>
    We'll shelter'd sit, and turn the storied page ;<br/>
    There see what passions shake the lofty dome<br/>
    With mad ambition or ungovern'd rage :<br/>
    <br/>
    What headlong ruin oft involves the great ;<br/>
    What conscious terrors guilty bosoms prove ;<br/>
    What strange and sudden turns of adverse fate<br/>
    Tear the sad virgin from her plighted love.<br/>

    <br/>
    For love has sworn (I heard the awful vow)<br/>
    The wav'ring heart shall never be his care,<br/>
    That stoops at any baser shrine to bow :<br/>
    And what he cannot rule, he scorns to share.<br/>

    My heart in DELIA is so fully blest,<br/>
    It has not room to lodge another joy ;<br/>
    My peace all leans upon that gentle breast,<br/>

    Our silent hours shall steal unmark'd away<br/>
