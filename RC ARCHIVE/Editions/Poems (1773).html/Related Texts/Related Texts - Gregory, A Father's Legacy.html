        hope you will make it with the utmot circumpection. Do not
        give way to a udden ally of paion, and dignify it with the
        name of love.--Genuine love is not founded in
        caprice&nbsp;; it is founded in nature, on honourable
        views, on virtue, on imilarity of tates and ympathy of
        ouls.<br />

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have thee entiments,
        you will never marry any one, when you are not in that
        ituation, in point of fortune, which is neceary to the
        happines of either of you. What that competency may be, can
        only be determined by your own tates. It would be
        ungenerous in you to take advantage of a lover's
        attachment, to plunge him into ditres&nbsp;; and if he has
        any honour, no peronal gratification will ever tempt him to
        enter into any connection which will render you unhappy. If
        you have as much between you as to atisfy all your demands,
        it is ufficient.<br />

        endeavouring to remove a difficulty which mut naturally
        occur to any woman of reflection on the ubject of marriage.
        What is to become of all thee refinements of delicacy, that
        dignity of manners, which checked all familiarities, and
        upended deire in repectful and awful admiration? In anwer
        to this, I hall only oberve, that if motives of interet or
        vanity have had any hare in your reolutions to marry, none
        of thee chimerical notions will give you any pain&nbsp;;
        nay, they will very quickly appear as ridiculous in your
        own eyes, as they probably always did in the eyes<br />
