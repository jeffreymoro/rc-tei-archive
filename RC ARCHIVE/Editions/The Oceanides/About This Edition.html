<h3><b><a name="design" id="design"> </a>The Design and Markup of the Edition</b></h3>
<p>The text for this edition was prepared by Wesley Kisting. This hypertext edition was designed and marked up by <a href="mailto:lmantoni@glue.umd.edu">Lisa Antonille Rhody</a> at the University of Maryland. Mariah Steele and Eun-Jung Yook sought out information for the Jewsbury chronology and for the poem annotations. Kate Singer carried out substantial revision of the edition, implementing many last minute corrections of text and format. Making extensive use of tables and style sheets for layout and presentation, it will work best when viewed with Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator versions 5.0 and 4.7, respectively, and higher. Aside from two deviations from the standard, the HTML markup is HTML 4.01/Transitional compliant, as set out by the World Wide Web Consortium.</p>
