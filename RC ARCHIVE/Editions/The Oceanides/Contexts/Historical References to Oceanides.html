    <p align="left">from Agamemnon's account of the aftermath of the death of Achilles:</p>
    <p align="left">At length we bore into the Greecian fleet<br/>
    Thy body from the field; there, first, we cleansed<br/>
    With tepid baths and oil'd thy shapely corse,<br/>
    Then placed thee on thy bier, while many a Greek<br/>
    Around thee wept, and shore his locks for thee.<br/>
    Thy mother, also, hearing of thy death<br/>
    With her immortal nymphs from the abyss<br/>
    Arose and came; terrible was the sound<br/>
    On the salt flood; a panic seized the Greeks,<br/>
    And ev'ry warrior had return'd on board<br/>
    That moment, had not Nestor, ancient Chief,<br/>
    Illumed by long experience, interposed,<br/>
    His counsels, ever wisest, wisest proved<br/>
    Then also, and he thus address'd the host.<br/>
    Sons of Achaia; fly not; stay, ye Greeks!<br/>
    Thetis arrives with her immortal nymphs<br/>
    From the abyss, to visit her dead son.<br/>
    So he; and, by his admonition stay'd,<br/>
    The Greeks fled not. Then, all around thee stood<br/>
    The daughters of the Ancient of the Deep,<br/>
    Mourning disconsolate; with heav'nly robes<br/>
    They clothed thy corse, and all the Muses nine<br/>
    Deplored thee in full choir with sweetest tones<br/>
    Responsive, nor one Greecian hadst thou seen<br/>
    Dry-eyed, such grief the Muses moved in all.</p>

    <p>from Book 18, following Achilles' discovery of the death of Patroclus:<br/></p>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So terribly he mourn'd,<br/>
    That Thetis, sitting in the deeps of her old father's seas,<br/>
    Heard, and lamented. To her plaints the bright Nereides<br/>
    Flock'd all, how many those dark gulfs soever comprehend.<br/>
    There Glauce, and Cymodoce, and Spio, did attend,<br/>
    Nes&#230;a, and Cymothoe, and calm Amphithoe,<br/>
    Thalia, Thoa, Panope, and swift Dynamene,<br/>
    Act&#230;a, and Limnoria, and Halia the fair<br/>
    Fam'd for the beauty of her eyes, Amathia for her hair,<br/>
    I&#230;ra, Proto, Clymene, and curl'd Dexamene,<br/>
    Pherusa, Doris, and with these the smooth Amphinome,<br/>
    Chaste Galatea so renown'd, and Callianira, came,<br/>
    With Doto and Orythia, to cheer the mournful dame.<br/>
    Apseudes likewise visited, and Callianassa gave<br/>
    Her kind attendance, and with her Agave grac'd the cave,<br/>
    Nemertes, M&#230;ra, follow&#233;d, Melita, Ianesse,<br/>
    With Ianira, and the rest of those Nereides<br/>
    That in the deep seas make abode; all which together beat<br/>
    Their dewy bosoms; and to all, thus Thetis did repeat<br/>
    Her cause of mourning: "Sisters, hear, how much the sorrows weigh,<br/>
    Whose cries now call'd ye. Hapless I brought forth unhappily<br/>
    The best of all the sons of men; who, like a well-set plant<br/>
    In best soils, grew and flourish&#233;d; and when his spirit did want<br/>
    Employment for his youth and strength, I sent him with a fleet<br/>
    To fight at Ilion; from whence his fate-confin&#233;d feet<br/>
    Pass all my deity to retire. The court of his high birth,<br/>
    The glorious court of Pele&#252;s, must entertain his worth<br/>
    Never hereafter. All the life he hath to live with me<br/>
    Must waste in sorrows. And this son I now am bent to see,<br/>
    Being now afflicted with some grief not usually grave,<br/>
    Whose knowledge and recure I seek." This said, she left her cave,<br/>
    Which all left with her; swimming forth, the green waves, as they swom,<br/>
    Cleft with their bosoms, curl'd, and gave quick way to Troy. Being come,<br/>
    They all ascended, two and two, and trod the honour'd shore,<br/>
    Till where the fleet of Myrmidons, drawn up in heaps, it bore.<br/>
    There stay'd they at Achilles' ship; and there did Thetis lay<br/>
    Her fair hand on her son's curl'd head, sigh'd, wept, and bade him say<br/>
    What grief drew from his eyes those tears? "Conceal it not," said she,<br/>
    "Till this hour thy uplifted hands have all things granted thee.<br/>
    The Greeks, all thrust up at their sterns, have pour'd out tears enow,<br/>
    And in them seen how much they miss remission of thy vow."<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He said, "'Tis true, Olympius hath done me all that grace,<br/>
    But what joy have I of it all, when thus thrusts in the place<br/>
    Loss of my whole self in my friend? Whom, when his foe had slain,<br/>
    He spoil'd of those profan&#233;d arms, that Peleus did obtain<br/>
    From heav'n's high Pow'rs, solemnizing thy sacred nuptial bands,<br/>
    As th' only present of them all, and fitted well their hands,<br/>
    Being lovely, radiant, marvellous. O would to heav'n thy throne,<br/>
    With these fair Deities of the sea, thou still hadst sat upon,<br/>
    And Peleus had a mortal wife; since by his means is done<br/>
    So much wrong to thy griev&#233;d mind, my death being set so soon,<br/>
    And never suff'ring my return to grace of Peleus' court!</p>

    <p>from an account of the daughters of Tethys and Okeanos:<br/></p>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She brought forth also a race apart of daughters, who with<br/>
    Lord Apollo and the Rivers have the young in their keeping<br/>
    all over the earth, since this right from Zeus is given them.<br/>
    They are Peitho, Admete, Ianthe and Elektra,<br/>
    Doris and Prymno and Ourania like a goddess,<br/>
    Hippo and Klymene, Rhodeia and Kallirho&#235;,<br/>
    Zeuxo and Klytia, and Idyia and Pasitho&#235;,<br/>
    Plexaura and Galaxaura and lovely Dione,<br/>
    Melobosis and Tho&#235;, and Polydora the shapely,<br/>
    Kerke&#239;s of the lovely stature, and ox-eyed Plouto,<br/>
    Xanthe and Akaste, Perse&#239;s and Ianeira,<br/>
    Petrai&#235; the lovely, and Menestho, and Europa,<br/>
    Metis and Eurynome, Telesto robed in saffron,<br/>
    Chryse&#239;s, and Asia, and alluring Kalypso,<br/>
    Eudora and Tyche, and Amphiro and Okyro&#235;,<br/>
    and Styx, who among them all has the greatest eminence.<br/>
    Now these are the eldest of the daughters who were born to Tethys<br/>
    and Okeanos, but there are many others beside these,<br/>
    for there are three thousand light-stepping daughters of the Ocean<br/>
    scattered far and wide, bright children among the goddesses, and all<br/>
    alike look after the earth and the depths of the standing water;<br/>
    and as many again are the rest of the Rivers, murmurously running,<br/>
    sons of Okeanos and the lady Tethys was their mother,<br/>
    and it would be hard for a mortal man to tell the names<br/>
    of all of them; but each is known by those who live by him.</p>

    <p><a name="georgics" id="georgics"> </a><b><i>The Georgics and Eclogues of Virgil.</i> Trans. Theodore Chickering Williams. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1915. 111 - 13.</b></p>
    <p>from an account of the response the shepherd Aristaeus receives after he complains to Cyrene of the many woes that have befallen him:<br/>
    <br/></p>
    <p>Now from her chamber deep below the wave<br/>
    His mother heard his voice. Her nymphs hard by<br/>
    Sat in a circle spinning from their looms<br/>
    Rare fleeces dipped in hues of hyaline:<br/>
    Ligea, Xantho, with Phyllodoce<br/>
    And Drymo, o'er whose snowy necks flowed down<br/>
    Their gleaming hair, Cydippe and gold-tressed<br/>
    Lycorias, the one a virgin free.<br/>
    The other to the labors lately come<br/>
    Of motherhood; there were the sisters twain<br/>
    Clio and Beroe, ocean's daughters both,<br/>
    In golden zone and gorgeous mantles clad;<br/>
    Deiopea, Opis, Ephyre<br/>
    And fleet-foot Arethusa, who at last<br/>
    Had laid her arrows by. This sea-nymph throng<br/>
    Was listening to the tales of Clymene:<br/>
    Of Vulcan's fruitless caution and the guile<br/>
    Of amorous Mars that gained him stolen joy;<br/>
    And of unnumbered loves of gods she told,<br/>
    Since first the world began. So while their hands<br/>
    Twirled from the spindles the soft threads of wool,<br/>
    They heard th' enchanting burden of her song.<br/>
    But once again upon his mother's ear<br/>
    Smote Aristaeus' cry, and those sea-nymphs<br/>
    Listened amazed upon their crystal thrones.<br/>
    Then Arethusa, ere her sisters spoke,<br/>
    Uplifting from the wave her golden brow,<br/>
    Thus called from far: "Cyrene, sister mine,<br/>
    Hear not in vain that terrifying cry.<br/>
    Behold thy darling and thy chiefest care,<br/>
    Unhappy Aristaeus, stands in tears<br/>
    On brink of Peneus' wave, and on thy name<br/>
    Calls loud to tell thee of thy cruelty."<br/>
    Once more the mother with unwonted fear<br/>
    Trembled at heart: "Oh, hither where we dwell<br/>
    Show him his way," she said, "Grant him the boon<br/>
    To cross yon threshold of divine abodes."<br/>
    Straightway she gave command that far and wide<br/>
    The opening river floods should yield free path<br/>
    To the young shepherd's feet.&#160; And lo! the waves<br/>
    Rose like a hilltop round him and received<br/>
    In vast embrace, letting the hero pass<br/>
    Deep down below the river. Now his eyes<br/>
    Gazed wondering on his goddess-mother's realm.<br/>
    He passed through watery kingdoms, by dark lakes<br/>
    All cavern-girdled, by loud-roaring groves.<br/>
    Then by the noise of mighty floods struck dumb<br/>
    He saw vast rivers flowing under earth<br/>
    Each in its region due. The Phasis there<br/>
    And Lycus he could see, and that first well<br/>
    Whence breaks to birth Enipeus' stream profound.<br/>
    There Father Tiber rose, and Anio's<br/>
    Swift current, rock-bound, echoing Hypanis,<br/>
    Caicus, Mysia's stream; there golden-horned,<br/>
    His countenance a bull, Eridanus<br/>
    That with more fury than all floods beside<br/>
    Sweeps through rich farms to meet the purple sea.<br/></p>
    <p>Soon came the youth beneath the pendent stone<br/>
    That roofed his mother's halls. Cyrene saw<br/>
    Her son's unfruitful tears. Her sisters brought,<br/>
    In order due, ablution for his hands<br/>
    And napkins of shorn fringe; they piled the board<br/>
    With feasting and with wine-cups oft refilled.<br/>
    The sacred altars blazed with fragrant fires.<br/>
    The mother cried: "Bring forth a brimming bowl<br/>
    Of Lydian vintage. We make offering<br/>
    Unto the ocean's god."&#160; Wherewith she prayed<br/>
    To ocean the great parent, and the nymphs:<br/>
    A hundred haunt the groves, a hundred guard<br/>
    The rivers, and they are her sisters all.</p>
