    <p><b>Curiosity and Scandal</b></p>
    
    <p>There are some folks whom oft we see,<br/>
    With such a taste for pedigree,<br/>
    The moment a fresh face is found,<br/>
    Enquiring whispers murmur round,<br/>
    Of who she is, and where has been,<br/>
    And what she says, and what has seen,<br/>
    Who she is with, and what she knows,<br/>
    The cut and colour of her clothes&#8212;<br/>
    These folks remind me of the Bee,<br/>
    (But not of useful industry)<br/>
    Who range untir&#8217;d throughout the fields,<br/>
    And suck the meanest flower it yields;<br/>
    For they to gain their worthy end,<br/>
    To every means will condescend,<br/>
    With simple children e&#8217;en to try,<br/>
    To make them a domestic spy;<br/>
    They, if they could, would wish to gather<br/>
    The history of their great-grandmother.<br/>
    But be folks good, or full of flaws,<br/>
    None can escape from Scandal&#8217;s claws;<br/>
    All these fair with honied tongues<br/>
    And blessed with &#8216;adamantine lungs&#8217;,<br/>
    Unlike the bee which stings but once,<br/>
    And only then in self-defence,<br/>
    With them it is a <i>constant</i> humour,<br/>
    They cannot sup without a rumour;<br/>
    To take their <i>tea</i> would be surprising,<br/>
    Without a hint of strange surmising:<br/>
    Oh! were it only understood,<br/>
    How <i>much</i> they <i>seek their neighbour&#8217;s good</i>,<br/>
    A grateful country sure would raise<br/>
    An edifice to <i>note</i> their praise,<br/>
    With deaf and dumb it should be graced,<br/>
    These ladies over them be placed,<br/>
    And I am sure they soon would teach&#8212;<br/>
    Their pupils liberty of <i>speech</i>.</p>
