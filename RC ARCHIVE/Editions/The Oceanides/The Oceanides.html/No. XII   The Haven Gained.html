            <p>THE HAVEN GAINED.</p>
            <p><i>Inscribed to Captain C. Biden, Commander of the ship Victory.</i></p>
            <p>And we are parting, glorious Sea!<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And thou art anchored, gallant ship!<br/>
                Strange, that the hour which makes me free,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Should be the one that tempts to weep;<br/>
                Strange, strange that through my heart should flow<br/>
                Regrets, I never dreamed to know.<br/></p>
            <p>How often, in a wayward mood,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Upon our thronged and sultry deck,<br/>
                I've sat and longed for solitude<br/>
                &#160; &#160;&#160;And silence&#8212;fondly tracing back<br/>
                The fresh and stilly evening air,<br/>
                All that made England dear and fair.<br/></p>
            <p>How often have I looked with scorn<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On what I deemed my prison home;<br/>
                Sick of the vastness daily born<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In ocean's circle, heaven's high dome,&#8212;<br/>
                Turned from the sun with evil eye,<br/>
                Nay, greeted moonlight with a sigh!<br/></p>
            <p>But this is over: long relieved,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I have rejoiced in Night and Day;<br/>
                Loved our sea-life, and only grieved<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That Time, like waters, lapsed away;<br/>
                Not lately, Discontent, old Sea,<br/>
                Hath bent a wrinkled brow on thee.<br/></p>
            <p>My cabin, that I thought a tomb,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite its neat and bright array,<br/>
                Seems now a smiling summer room<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where only Peace hath leave to stay;<br/>
                And Occupation's Eden-state,<br/>
                Light, mirthful, earnest, and elate.<br/></p>
            <p>And I have learned to read the face<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of many a rude yet kindly tar;<br/>
                So loves the human eye to trace<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lines of brotherhood afar;<br/>
                So longs the human heart to love<br/>
                Something, beneath, around, above.<br/></p>
            <p>But hark, that sound!&#8212;the boat is lowered,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I never thought 'twould vex mine ear;<br/>
                I thought not when I came on board<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To leave at last with sigh and tear;&#8212;<br/>
                But then, I did not dream to find<br/>
                Such friendship as I leave behind.</p>
