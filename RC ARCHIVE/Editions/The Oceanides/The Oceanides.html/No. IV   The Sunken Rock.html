            <p>THE SUNKEN ROCK.</p>
            <p><i>By Mrs. Fletcher, (late Miss Jewsbury).</i></p>
            <p>A gentle ship was sailing<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Upon the Indian seas,<br/>
                O lovely looked she sailing,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So fair were wave and breeze:<br/>
                Yet sunken rocks were near her,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And but one seaman grey<br/>
                Of all who had to steer her,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Knew the dangers of the way:<br/>
                But they hearkened not the fearer,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/oceanides/notes/syren.html?width=500&height=400">syren-song</a> that day.<br/>
                <br/>
                In air, the waves were flinging<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their silver crowns of spray,<br/>
                And these their words of singing,&#8212;<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Away, bold ship, away;<br/>
                To-day, all fair together<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We bear thee o&#8217;er the sea,<br/>
                And who talks of stormy weather,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A moody <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/oceanides/notes/wight.html?width=500&height=400">wight</a> is he.<br/>
                <br/>
                "So white the furrow streameth,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As strewn with pearls are we,<br/>
                And who of danger dreameth,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A moody wight is he.<br/>
                Light hearts are in thee dancing,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Light steps are on thy deck,<br/>
                The sun is cloudless glancing,&#8212;<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sail on&#8212;who dreams of wreck?<br/>
                <br/>
                "We are thine, bold ship, and bear thee<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Home, home,&#8212;trust us, not him;<br/>
                Ay, home, bold ship, we bear thee,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Trust us, trust us, not him:<br/>
                The pilot&#8217;s trade is caution,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And with talk of rocks and sands,<br/>
                He tells foul tales of ocean,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And us, his wandering bands.<br/>
                <br/>
                "Brave bark, bound on, and heed not,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Let rocks be sunk or seen,<br/>
                The chart and line they need not,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where once we&#8217;ve pilots been.<br/>
                On, on, and end thy roaming,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are many look for thee,<br/>
                Who will laugh to greet thy coming.<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ay, kiss thy sides for glee.<br/>
                <br/>
                "Thou hast never heard such laughter<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As that will greet thee soon;<br/>
                Thou wilt never hear such after,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beneath the sun or moon.<br/>
                We will love and leave thee never;<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We will tell our secrets thee; &#160;<br/>
                And thou shalt be for ever,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our nursling of the sea!"<br/>
                <br/>
                "Ha! ha! we have won! and the silly ship<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That braved us so long, is ours;<br/>
                She sinks in our arms as if drunk or asleep;&#8212;<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Down with her, fathoms, fathoms deep,&#8212;<br/>
                And laugh we, and leap, with conquering roar;<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her wreck hath displaced some waves a score,<br/>
                And to all upon earth she&#8217;s a name and no more!"<br/></p>
            <p>The waves were hushed, the song they spoke<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In cruel triumph o&#8217;er the waters;<br/>
                And other, milder music broke,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From other, milder ocean&#8217;s daughters.<br/></p>
            <p>"Well, too well, the depths are cloven,<br/>
                Soon, too soon, the work is done;<br/>
                Many a weedy shroud is woven&#8212;<br/>
                Many a mortal course is run!<br/>
                <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/oceanides/notes/fathom.html?width=500&height=400">Fathom deep their bodies lie</a>,<br/>
                Stiffened limb and stoney eye;<br/>
                Wrapped about with slimy things,<br/>
                Who were Beauty&#8217;s queens and kings;<br/>
                Wealth, with all his gold outspread,<br/>
                Sleeps upon a rocky bed;<br/>
                And the salt and hungry spray<br/>
                Eateth Valour&#8217;s sword away,<br/>
                Once, as flashing as the day:<br/>
                Wisdom charmeth now no longer,<br/>
                Weaker brain is as the stronger,<br/>
                And the man of giant size<br/>
                With the little infant lies:<br/>
                Whilst afar the taper burneth,<br/>
                And the watcher&#8217;s bosom yearneth,<br/>
                Each, for one who ne&#8217;er returneth;<br/>
                Buried by our father sea,<br/>
                Where none know their graves but we!<br/>
                We are <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/oceanides/notes/daughters.html?width=500&height=400">daughters of the deep</a>,<br/>
                Yet, because his daughters, weep<br/>
                That the sound of human woe<br/>
                Through our caverned halls should flow,<br/>
                And that he, so calm to us<br/>
                And the fragile nautilus,<br/>
                Stern and full of death should be<br/>
                To a mightier race than we!<br/>
                We would save, but we are weak;<br/>
                And when mighty tempests break,<br/>
                And a ship with all her crew<br/>
                Sink, as if a drop of dew<br/>
                Fell upon an ocean weed,<br/>
                We may pity their great need,<br/>
                And, when hushed is foam and surge,<br/>
                Sing, as now, their funeral dirge;<br/>
                Hide awhile the limbs of youth<br/>
                From some monster&#8217;s ravening tooth,<br/>
                Bind sea blooms round beauty&#8217;s locks<br/>
                Sadly floating on our rocks;<br/>
                Or remove a hoary head<br/>
                From its lacerating bed<br/>
                Unto soft sea-weeds instead&#8212;<br/>
                But 'tis all that we can do,<br/>
                Mortals, yet our love is true!"<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus, upon the self-same seas,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sang the Oceanides!</p>
