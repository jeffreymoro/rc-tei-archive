            <p>ADDRESS TO THE DEEP.</p>
            <p><i>By Mrs. Fletcher, (late Miss Jewsbury).</i></p>
            <p> WONDROUS , fearful restless Sea,<br/>
                What have I to do with thee?<br/>
                Thou so strong, and I so weak,<br/>
                Ev&#8217;n when health is on my cheek;<br/>
                Now so worn, and sad withal,<br/>
                Sense of life but sense of thrall;<br/>
                REST , sole pleasure I would keep,<br/>
                In the guise of slumber deep;<br/>
                Yes, but let it dreamless be&#8212;<br/>
                Day hath dreams enough for me,<br/>
                Ever the vain memory haunting,<br/>
                Till the vainer heart is panting<br/>
                After all those visions dear,<br/>
                So far off, and yet so near&#8212;<br/>
                Roses wet with summer dew,<br/>
                And the dwellings where they grew,<br/>
                Many a healthy mountain walk,<br/>
                Many an evening&#8217;s fire-light talk,<br/>
                Held with friends&#8212;no more, no more,<br/>
                Ocean, let thy boiling roar<br/>
                Hide in pity from my ear,<br/>
                Voices, but too kind and dear.<br/></p>
            <p>Wild, ferocious, wrathful Sea,<br/>
                What have I to do with thee?<br/>
                Never, never won to spare,<br/>
                Death thy banquet; and despair<br/>
                With its agonizing cry,<br/>
                Famine with its horrid eye,<br/>
                Human misery, human sin,<br/>
                That which thou delightest in;<br/>
                Journeying ever, yet unsped;<br/>
                Still devouring, yet unfed;<br/>
                With thy dull or deafening roar,<br/>
                Ever asking, craving more!<br/>
                Giant of the thousand hands,<br/>
                Prisoning many lovely lands&#8212;<br/>
                Isles, that midst thy bitter brine,<br/>
                Harbourless in verdure pine,<br/>
                Blessing no man, blessed by none&#8212;<br/>
                O that thy dark reign were done!<br/>
                And thy angel-sentenced doom<br/>
                Left the world a world of bloom,<br/>
                And of perfect brotherhood;<br/>
                Man no more athirst for blood,<br/>
                Thou, no more, dire element,<br/>
                Brotherhood&#8217;s admeasurement!</p>
            <p>Gloomy, weary, restless Sea,<br/>
                Yes, I have to do with thee;<br/>
                Not on frame, nor yet in power,<br/>
                But on evil&#8217;s sadder dower:<br/>
                Have I called thee one dark name<br/>
                Human spirits may not claim?<br/>
                Have I blamed in thee a deed<br/>
                Human nature doth not breed?&#8212;<br/>
                Named one ravage wrought by thee,<br/>
                Man hath never mated?&#8212;Sea,<br/>
                Deathful, terrible, and strong,<br/>
                God&#8217;s great work, I did thee wrong;<br/>
                Thou but smit&#8217;st at his command&#8212;<br/>
                Thou the weapon, His the hand.<br/>
                Art <i>thou</i> passive, Human Will?<br/>
                Answer, human grief and ill!</p>
