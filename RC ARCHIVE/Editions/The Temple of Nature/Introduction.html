        <p class="edprose">Erasmus Darwin's last, defiant, densely-packed scientific poem
                <i>The Temple of Nature, or The Origin of Society</i> was a crucial
            influence on both the Shelleys, suggesting the opening imagery of Percy's
                <i>Queen Mab</i> and the conversation between him and Byron about
            spontaneously-animated "vermicelli" which helped to inspire Mary's
                <i>Frankenstein</i>.<sup><a
                    href="#n1" class="style1"
                    >1</a></sup> The poem also compresses into its four cantos and extensive
            annotation a great deal of the hard knowledge, speculative brilliance and poetic
            daring of previous works in verse and prose which had in their turn greatly
            influenced Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge and many others. In what Desmond
            King-Hele has called "a life of unequalled achievement," Darwin touched base
            with almost every aspect of the age of revolutions we label, somewhat
            inadequately, The Romantic Period. With fellow members of the Birmingham-based
            Lunar Society<sup><a href="#n2"
                    class="style1">2</a></sup> such as James Watt, Matthew Boulton, Josiah
            Wedgwood and Joseph Priestley, he was a prime mover of the Industrial
            Revolution, and his agricultural treatise <i>Phytologia, or The Philosophy of
                Agriculture and Gardening</i> (1800) put the weight of his massive botanical
            knowledge behind the Agrarian one. He was also the period's most successful
            physician, whose medical treatise <i>Zoonomia, or The Laws of Organic Life</i>
            (1794-6, revised 1801) helped to initiate the radically materialist psychology
            which Alan Richardson terms "neural Romanticism," and the need to suppress which
            Edward S. Reed sees as the source of a soul-based nineteenth-century psychology.
            In the other sciences, Darwin attempted and often achieved new syntheses of the
            most recent, cutting-edge work in geology, astronomy, chemistry and the study of
            electricity; while in zoology his arguments for the evolution of
            species&#8212;anticipating those of his grandson Charles by more than half a
            century&#8212;have been described by Roy Porter as providing "the British
            Enlightenment's most sublime theory of boundless improvement" (443).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="edprose">Politically, Darwin was a radical-progressive Whig. His
            enthusiasm for the American Revolution was boosted by personal friendship with
            one of its fathers, Benjamin Franklin; his support for the early stages of the
            French one was never&#8212;as it was by many other erstwhile
            "jacobins"&#8212;explicitly retracted.<sup><a
                    href="#n3" class="style1"
                    >3</a></sup> Though perhaps unwilling to notice the new kinds of misery
            caused by the industrial innovations of friends such as Boulton and
                    Wedgwood,<sup><a href="#n4"
                    >4</a></sup> he strongly opposed the slave trade,<sup><a
                    href="#n5">5</a></sup>
            wrote against the eviction of the powerless "people of agriculture" by the
            enclosure of farm land<sup><a
                    href="#n6">6</a></sup> and,
            in <i>A Plan for the Conduct of Female Education in Boarding Schools</i> (1797),
            supported womens' right to a rounded education in the arts and sciences. Such
            radical progressivism played well to an intensely admiring public in his first
            literary breakthrough, the two-poem work collectively titled <i>The Botanic
                Garden</i> (1791), comprising <i>The Economy of Vegetation</i> and the
            earlier-published <i>The Loves of the Plants</i> (1789). The latter of these
            courted controversy on three counts: by espousing the still-shocking
            classification of plants according to their sexual traits with which the Swedish
            Carl Linnaeus had recently revolutionized the study of botany;<sup><a
                    href="#n7">7</a></sup> by
            representing these traits in terms of a series of increasingly
            promiscuous-seeming human love affairs; and by explicitly addressing women and
            children as its primary audience.<sup><a
                    href="#n8">8</a></sup>
            <i>The Economy of Vegetation</i>, placed first though published second, is
            primarily a physico-chemical account of matter and the formation of the earth,
            which thinly veils its underlying materialism under the figure of the Goddess of
            Botany addressing the sprites of the four traditional elements, in a structure
            loose enough to allow for many celebrations of fellow Lunar Society members'
            scientific and industrial achievements, and for many assaults on tyranny and
            religious "superstition." But by the later 1790s the same attitudes were
            considered dangerously libertine, irreligious and hence (in an increasingly
            common conflation) pro-French. The <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> magazine's 1798 parody,
            "The Loves of the Triangles,"<sup><a
                    href="#n9">9</a></sup>
            devastated Darwin's reputation, deliberately confusing his views with those of
            more declared radicals such as William Godwin and libertines such as Richard
            Payne Knight,<sup><a href="#n10"
                    >10</a></sup> and poking&#8212;admittedly hilarious&#8212;fun at his
            common poetic device of fanciful personification as at once outmoded and&#160;
            heartlessly frivolous.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="edprose">The substantial debts of Blake, Wordsworth and Coleridge to
            Darwin&#8212;especially to <i>The Botanic Garden</i> and
            <i>Zoonomia&#8212;</i>have been increasingly acknowledged since Desmond
            King-Hele's <i>Erasmus Darwin and the Romantic Poets</i> (1986)<i>.</i> Blake
            engraved some of <i>Botanic Garden</i>'s illustrations, and clearly drew on its
            plant-personifications for his <i>Songs</i> and <i>Book of Thel</i>.<sup><a
                    href="#n11">11</a></sup>
            Despite a similar degree of influence on their youthful work, Wordsworth's and
            Coleridge's coming of age as the Romantic poets we recognize coincided with
            their rejection of the Augustan poetic style of which Darwin was then the
            leading representative. In 1796, the then-footloose Coleridge spent several
            months in Derby, largely drawn thither by opportunities for conversations with
            Darwin, who had moved there from Lichfield in 1783 and seems to have tried to
            help him find work.<sup><a
                    href="#n12">12</a></sup>
            Coleridge's remark "I absolutely nauseate Darwin's poem" (i.e. <i>The Botanic
                Garden</i>) needs to be set against many borrowings<sup><a
                    href="#n13">13</a></sup>
            and against his clearly overwhelmed response to "the first <i>literary</i>
            character in Europe, and the most original-minded man": Darwin was "the
            everything, except the Christian! [with] a greater range of philosophical
            knowledge than any other man in Europe. . . . He thinks in a <i>new</i> train on
            every subject," though the recent Unitarian convert needed to add, "except
                    religion."<sup><a
                    href="#n14">14</a></sup>
            Wordsworth's careful separation, in the 1802 <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> Preface, of
            the "immediate" pleasures of poetry from the more recondite ones of
            un-"familiarized" scientific knowledge, as well as its rejection of
            personification and the "inane phraseology" of poetic diction, suggests Darwin
            as the key reference-point against which Wordsworth's new poetic defines itself.
            However, the same Preface's claim that the ballad-form of "Goody Blake and Harry
            Gill" will give the psychological "<i>fact</i>" it embodies its first real
            currency constitutes a more complex mix of acknowledgment and disparagement of
            its source in <i>Zoonomia</i>, which Wordsworth borrowed and read closely in
                    1798.<sup><a href="#n15"
                    >15</a></sup> Darwin's psychosomatic treatise also underlies <i>The
                Prelude</i>'s derivation of the "infant babe's" later love of nature from
            its experience at its mother's breast&#8212;whose earliest version was probably
            written in 1798-9.<sup><a
                    href="#n16">16</a></sup> If
            not quite part of the Romantic literary revolution, then, Darwin gave its
            formative stages something to kick against, &#160;&#160;after first supplying
            some of its key ideas and images.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="edprose">In its dependence on the closed heroic couplet Darwin's own
            poetic style is clearly grounded in the eighteenth century, but the extent to
            which this mode was displaced by the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>' experiments can
            easily be overstated.&#160; In one area his technique was strikingly radical:
            his insistence that poetry should "show, not tell." As Anna Seward, his most
            perceptive contemporary critic, put it, "he seldom mixes with the picturesque
            the (as it is termed in criticism) <i>moral epithet</i>, meaning that quality of
            the thing mentioned, which pertains more to the mind, or heart, than to the eye"
            (174). In one of the three prose Interludes inserted between the cantos&#160;of
                <i>The Loves of the Plants</i>, Darwin argues that:</p>
        <blockquote>as our ideas derived from visible objects are more distinct than those
            derived from the objects of our other senses, the words expressive of these
            ideas belonging to vision make up the principle part of poetic language. That
            is, the Poet writes principally to the eye, the Prose-writer uses more
            abstracted terms. Mr. Pope has written a bad verse in the Windsor Forest:<br/>
            <br/> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And
            Kennet swift for silver eels <i>renown'd</i>."<br/>
            <br/> The word renown'd does not present the idea of a visible object to the
            mind, and is thence prosaic. But change this line thus,<br/>
            <br/> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And
            Kennet swift, where silver Graylings <i>play</i>."<br/>
            <br/> And it becomes poetry, because the scenery is then brought before the
            eye.<br/> (<i>The Loves of the Plants</i>, Interlude I, p. 48)</blockquote>
        <p class="edprose">Perhaps fortunately, Darwin does not always stick to this
            exacting standard of non-discursiveness. In <i>The Temple of Nature</i>, for
            instance, the key-words "young" and "nascent" often derive their poetic force
            from the double-image of a newborn child and a newly-evolved life-form: a
            fertile ambiguity which would be destroyed if we could visualize either state
            completely clearly.<sup><a
                    href="#n17">17</a></sup>
            Nonetheless, his usual prioritizing of the visual keeps his poetry firmly to its
            purpose of clarifying abstruse science through a series of mental
            pictures&#8212;as in his own image, in the playful "Proem" to <i>Loves of the
                Plants</i>, of "diverse little pictures suspended over the chimney of a
            Lady's dressing-room, <i>connected only by a slight festoon of
            ribbons</i>"(viii-ix). The "slightness" of the ribbons holding the pictures
            together can be compared to the temporal, narrative dimension of all writing,
            which Darwin finds many ways to downplay in favour of the synchronically
            viewable pictures which&#8212;as in his repeated use of &#160;extended similes
            introduced by "So" or "Hence"&#8212;he often asks us to juxtapose and compare
            quasi-spatially rather than merely as diachronically successive. Even his
            favourite poetic device of chiasmus&#8212;the sandwich-like enclosure of lines,
            couplets or larger units between two forceful verbs or, sometimes,
            nouns&#8212;can be seen as a way of containing the onward impetus of language
            within a structure appealing to the spatial sense of symmetry.<sup><a
                    href="#n18"
            >18</a></sup></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="edprose">While conducive to scientific clarity, this insistence on the
            visual also relates to Darwin's intense engagement with broader questions of
            myth, metaphor and symbolic language. Throughout his poetry, Darwin uses Greek
            and Roman myths as extended similes for scientific phenomena: a procedure which
            might seem unproblematically neoclassical unless we notice how, in his notes, he
            is actually conducting a parallel examination of the sources of those myths
            themselves. Repeatedly, he concludes that they are based on real ancient
            scientific knowledge, derived from Egypt but converted into linear narratives by
            those unable to decipher the hieroglyphics in which this knowledge was encoded
            before the invention of writing. It had, however, been more accurately
            transmitted to the Graeco-Roman world through the Eleusinian Mysteries, secret
            ritual performances which revealed only to an initiated elite that the "vulgar"
            mythology was a misreading of such real material truths as the conservation
            of&#160; matter from organism to organism.<sup><a
                    href="#n19">19</a></sup>
            The belief in lost Egyptian wisdom, accessible through a rarefied symbolism, has
            roots in the pre-Enlightenment science of Hermetic alchemy, its offshoot
            Rosicrucianism and their eighteenth-century successor Freemasonry.<sup><a
                    href="#n20">20</a></sup> In
            ways&#160;I shall explore below and in my notes, Darwin draws on all of these
            traditions for the richest and most seriously meant of all his poetic images:
            that of his last poem's eponymous Temple of Nature. The contrast between
            emblematic visual denotations, which is what he took the hieroglyphics to be,
            and the misleadingly temporal and casually metaphorical connotations of ordinary
            written language, runs through many of the poem's notes, from his call for a
            "dignified pantomime" like the Eleusinian Mystery performances to be reinstated
            to "explain many philosophical truths by adapted imagery, and thus both amuse
            and instruct," to his arguments for extending the "universal language of the
            eye" from such recognized emblems as the saint's halo, devil's tail and cap of
            liberty to a more fully "comprehensive language for painters, or for other
                    arts."<sup><a href="#n21"
                    >21</a></sup> It is true that what is virtually his last published
            sentence, at the end of <i>Temple's</i> last Additional Note (XV) <i>,</i> calls
            for a more accurate use of prose whereby "metaphors will cease to be necessary
            in conversation, and only be used as the ornaments of poetry," but this
            apparently rather sad downgrading of the poetic function needs to be set against
            the rich counterpointing of the two types of language represented by&#160; the
            verse and notes of all his three major poems, and of <i>The Botanic Garden</i>'s
            opening promise "to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science; and to lead
            her votaries from the looser analogies, which dress out the imagery of poetry,
            to the stricter ones which form the ratiocination of philosophy" (v).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="edprose">His chief model in the project of combining poetry with science
            was the Roman poet Lucretius's great scientific and philosophical poem <i>De
                Rerum Natura</i> ("Of the Nature of Things"), written in the First Century
            BC. Based on the teachings of Epicurus, this poem insists that the universe
            consists only of atoms and empty space: the earth came about through a chance
            atomic convergence, is still developing and will one day inevitably fall apart.
            Though gods may exist in some alternative realm of their own (perhaps simply the
            poetic imagination), they have no impact at all on the material universe or
            individual human destiny. People should therefore work out how to live
            rationally, without fears of punishment after death or divine anger. In its
            astonishingly wide-ranging fifth book, the poem traces the history of the earth
            from its first fortuitous formation to the emergence of the various living
            species from "wombs" in the earth&#8212;with only the best-adapted species
            managing to survive&#8212;and thence to the development of human society through
            various stages of technological development, political organization and (usually
            misguided) religious belief (V, 807-10).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="edprose">Though he disagreed with the Lucretian/Epicuran idea that matter
            is governed by "blind chance" rather than binding Laws of Nature,<sup><a
                    href="#n22">22</a></sup>
            Darwin repeatedly echoes <i>De Rerum Natura</i>'s imagery as well as its
            specific content in his own work, especially <i>The Temple of Nature</i>. Many
            of the detailed parallels between the two poems are explored in my notes; but
            the one most worth drawing attention to at a general level is their shared
            picture of life emerging directly from inorganic matter. Darwin was careful to
            stress that this can only have happened at a microscopic level, whereafter the
            various modern species developed only very gradually;<sup><a
                    href="#n23">23</a></sup>
            nonetheless, it is impossible to believe that this idea&#8212;on which his
            grandson Charles's development of it into the evolutionism we know must
            certainly have been partly if tacitly modelled<sup><a
                    href="#n24"
            >24</a></sup>&#8212;did not find part of its own model in the fifth book of
            Lucretius's <i>De Rerum Natura</i>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="edprose">The link was certainly noticed by the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>
            magazine's team of writers headed by the future Tory Prime Minister George
            Canning, whose father had translated into English the eighteenth century's most
            celebrated attack on Lucretius's godless materialism, Cardinal Melchior de
            Polignac's <i>Anti-Lucretius</i>. In "The Loves of the Triangles" (1798), the
            spoof-poem in the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> which helped to blast Darwin's reputation
            by successfully linking his metaphorical extravagance with his "jacobinical"
            science, a mock-solemn note works deliberately to confuse the Lucretian and
            Darwinian theories of life as spontaneously generated through "the FILAMENT

                and it is likely that it discouraged him from proceeding with the
                technological epic he was working on at the time of its appearance. This was
                    <i>The Progress of Society</i>, to be modelled on Lucretius's fifth book
                and bearing a strong resemblance to <i>The Progress of Civil Society</i>, a
                similarly-modelled&#160; poem by Richard Payne Knight, to whose existence
                the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>'s deliberate yoking of it with his own work may have
                alerted Darwin for the first time. His own planned <i>Progress</i> was also
                peopled by "genies" of each age resembling the ethereal personifications of
                plants and elements so effectively ridiculed in "The Loves of the
                Triangles." But if Darwin did abandon his already substantial and
                extraordinarily ambitious draft poem for such reasons, it was not in order
                to draw in his horns. The poem he wrote instead, <i>The Temple of Nature, or
                    The Origin of Society</i>, reads as a prolonged act of defiance, for the
                first time integrating his evolutionary arguments within a single sustained
                theory of the material basis of the formation of the universe and, finally,
                of the human psyche and social organization; investing this vision with an
                imagery far grander than the somewhat ingratiating nymphs and sylphs of his
                earlier poems, but also&#8212;through its battery of sometimes essay-length
                notes&#8212;daring his critics to counter it on its own scientific

                >Darwin's evolutionism is only part of a radical scientific vision
                stretching from the first cosmic explosion to the most refined aspects of
                human taste and feeling. Though, in Coleridge's words, Darwin "thinks in
                    a&#160;<i>new</i> train" on many subjects, this is often a matter of
                tracing new connections between existing ideas, many of whose sources are
                traced in my notes. For the purposes of this general introduction, I shall
                simply draw attention to one significant grouping of such sources: the
                extraordinary confluence of scientists and philosophers known collectively
                as the Scottish Enlightenment. As a medical student at Edinburgh from
                1753-6, Darwin imbibed a great deal of its intellectual atmosphere, and it
                is arguable that, with the presence of James Watt and Darwin's Edinburgh
                friend, the industrial chemist James Keir, the Lunar Society itself&#160;can
                be seen as a Scottish Enlightenment outpost in the English Midlands. In
                    <i>Temple</i>, Darwin's theory of the formation of a stable universe
                after the big bang leans strongly on the discovery of latent heat by Watt's
                Edinburgh mentor Joseph Black;<sup><a

                    >26</a></sup>his physiological theories of human and animal health and
                behaviour as largely dependent on levels of physico-mental stimulation
                derive from the main sources of his own Edinburgh medical training, William
                Cullen and John Brown;<sup><a

                the world developing into its current form from "the activity of its
                inherent principles" and for his tripartite division of the ways in which we
                associate ideas;<sup><a
                        href="#n28"
                    >28</a></sup> but also draws on the leading philosophical opponent of
                Hume's scepticism, Thomas Reid, for his theory of the natural basis of

                >Published the year after his death, Darwin's last work is really a final
                synthesis of all his others. After its introductory 222 lines, it largely
                discards the extended poetic conceits of <i>The Botanic Garden</i> to
                present a total vision of life in a continuous sequence. This moves from the
                big bang and the start of evolution (Canto I) to the emergence of sexual
                reproduction (Canto II) and the development of the human mind and hence of
                society (Canto III), concluding with an attempt to outweigh the awareness of
                life's cruelties with a vision of ever-increasing organic happiness (Canto
                IV). As even this brief outline might suggest, Canto I contains echoes (and
                even extended quotations, especially in the notes) from <i>Economy</i> and
                    <i>Zoonomia</i>; Canto II from <i>Loves</i> and <i>Phytologia</i>; III

                >Before we arrive at this admirably clear sequencing of all Darwin's most
                radical and exciting ideas, however, the poem presents certain difficulties,
                which may have played a part in discouraging readers not already put off by
                the political assaults on his reputation. While the Preface does little to
                alert us to the poem's real themes, the second of its three brief paragraphs
                strangely insists that the classical myths may really have been based on the
                deeds of actual people and, at the start of the poem, lines 9-14 promise an
                account of the joys and woes of five "successive Ages" of human society.
                Neither theme reappears at all clearly in the poem itself; instead the first
                222 lines plunge us into a bewildering switchback ride of images: an
                invocation to Love (15-32) is followed by a possibly ironic retelling of the
                story of the Garden of Eden, which is suddenly replaced by a howling desert
                surrounded by rocks, through a tunnel in which the poet's "Muse" and readers
                seem to enter the central space (33-64). This in turn gives way to a vision
                of the Temple of Nature itself, which we now seem to have entered because we
                are taken on a tour of its artworks and its separate realms of pleasure,
                pain and death (64-128), with the hundred-breasted goddess Nature enshrined
                in the centre (129-36). She is not to be confused with her Priestess or
                Hierophant Urania (also the Muse of Astronomy), whose answers to the
                questions of the poet's Muse (163-222) constitute the bulk of the poem. Long
                "trains" of virgin supplicants and assorted "Loves and Graces" complete the
                crowded cast of largely female figures in this somewhat overburdened
                opening, which also contains detailed descriptions of Orpheus's descent to
                Hades (181-204) and the rituals of the ancient Greek Eleusinian Mysteries
                (137-54).</span></p>

                alternative to <i>The Progress of Society</i> as the main title of a poem
                about the five ages of human technology, from hunting to the present
                scientific age. The page-headers of the published <i>Temple</i> name it
                    <i>The Origin of Society</i>, an echo of the draft <i>Progress</i> title
                which the publisher Joseph Johnson seems to have changed after Darwin's
                death to the less-controversial <i>Temple</i>
                <i>of Nature</i>, which appears on the title page only (<span

                            <i>Life</i>, 354-5). In the <i>Progress of Society</i> drafts,
                        we are told about the five ages by a Muse or Priestess of Nature in
                        a Temple which clearly occupies the site of Eden, as if to symbolize
                        the way in which man had to invent his own means of subsistence
                        after the Fall. When Darwin changed the poem's theme to the origins
                        of life, this symbolism became far more blasphemous: the temple's
                        scientific account of creation now replaces rather than succeeds the
                        Eden story. Perhaps to disguise this implication in a more general
                        confusion, Darwin retained much of now-dubious relevance from the
                            <i>Progress of Society</i> drafts, and added the theme of the
                        Eleusinian Mysteries, whereby only fit-minded initiates can uncover
                        the true meaning of a set of symbolic images.<sup><a

                >From line 223, Urania's account of the origin of life takes us rapidly from
                the inaugural cosmic explosion we would now call the big bang to the
                formation of the sea-covered earth round a molten core (226-34), and then to
                the submarine coalescence of chemicals to produce primeval organisms
                (235-50), whose growth from specks to lines to rings to ingestive tubes
                (253-6) closely mirrors the growth of the human embryo in <i>Zoonomia</i>
                (II, 221). From here the account is pulled in two directions: following the
                growth of the individual organism until it develops the full human
                psychosomatic system (251-314); and following the history of the earth, as
                the first organisms lay down the deposits which will enable the emergence of
                land, and hence of more developed life-forms, whose marine ancestry is still
                often discernible in vestigial gills and placental fluid (315-64). Apart
                from this dramatic development&#8212;seen as the true meaning of the story
                of the birth of Dione (Venus) from the sea (365-78)&#8212;Darwin gives no
                systematic picture of the sequence by which one species developed from
                another, but does encapsulate it imagistically in an account of
                microscopically-observed organisms from mould to the "Mite enormous," whose
                swelling heart and writhing limbs already ally it unmistakeably with higher,
                emotionally equipped animals such as man (281-94). It is the Additional Note
                (I) to which this passage refers us that seems to have inspired Shelley's
                and Byron's discussion of the possibility of artificially creating new life,
                which in turn gave Mary Shelley the nightmare on which she based

                II, pp. 194-327), Canto II chiefly echoes <i>Phytologia</i>'s corresponding
                section "The Organs of Reproduction in Vegetables" (pp. 89-131). Urania's
                opening move from mourning the brevity of life to celebrating the
                immortality bestowed by reproduction (1-20) also suggests that we may indeed
                be following the Eleusinian Mysteries' move from death to marriage. As in
                    <i>Economy</i>, the myth of Adonis is used to illustrate the continuous
                recycling of organic matter (45-60); then a long section (61-176) considers
                asexual reproduction, from plant buds to oysters to the birth of Eve from
                Adam's rib (seen in Additional Note X as Moses' misreading of Egyptian
                scientists' understanding of how species such as the aphid can progress from
                asexual to sexual birth). The melancholy musings on species degeneration to
                which this theme gives rise (185-220) are assuaged by a celebration of Cupid
                and Psyche, "the Deities of Sexual Love" (244), who preside over a return to
                the material of <i>Loves</i> and then a passage on how "the demon Jealousy"
                (307) arms male animals such as man in the war of sexual competition.
                Nonetheless, the Canto ends on a note of celebration, with Urania's
                attendants cheerfully feeding the poet's Muse beneath the Tree of Knowledge
                with its fruit's "no longer interdicted taste" (442).</span></p>

                >Elaborating on <i>Zoonomia</i>'s psychological ideas and linked to the
                Eleusinian "return of light" scene through a pervasive imagery of
                enlightenment, Canto III on "Progress of the Mind" is the densest canto
                Darwin ever wrote. Pleasantly opening with the two Muses conducting
                scientific experiments (1-34), it goes on to set out <i>Zoonomia</i>'s
                division of all physical and mental responses into the four faculties of
                irritation, sensation, volition and association (55-92) before turning to
                the importance of the opposable thumb in distinguishing man from other
                animals. By relating visual to precise tactile impressions we gain "clear
                ideas" (126) of objects, prompting the curiosity to explore them further and
                giving us a sense of beauty, ultimately derived from the shape of the
                mother's breast (as explored in <i>Zoonomia</i>, "Of Instinct," vol. I, pp.
                200-202). The sense of beauty gives rise to that of "Sentimental Love,"
                embodied&#160; by Eros (not the sexual Cupid of Canto III), who may or may
                not be the son of the Dione (Venus) whose beautiful form he platonically
                worships. From 207-68 the presiding personification is Taste, seen musing in
                turn over scenes of beauty, sublimity, melancholy, tragedy and the
                picturesque. From 269 we plunge into the nature of thought, which begins
                with accumulations of "sensorial power" not discharged through action (270).
                By various mixtures of irritation, sensation, volition and association, we
                learn to connect ideas and imitate others, or external reality in general,
                and then to communicate by gestures and ultimately language, which boils
                down highly complex ideas through "Abbreviation" (391), hailed by Darwin's
                grammatical hero Horne Tooke as "the wings of Hermes" (Additional Notes, p.
                93). In its turn, language helps us to develop reason, the power of planning
                towards specific ends which&#8212;lest we get too proud&#8212;we should
                remember we share with wasps and other nest-building insects (411-34). In
                another return to the Eden myth, Darwin speculates that the real "knowledge
                of good and evil" may have been the realization of the cruelty involved in
                hunting animals for sustenance (449-60)&#8212;which leads to a concluding
                celebration of Sympathy (derived from Imitation) as the basis of all social
                morality, in reminiscence of <i>Female Education</i>'s stress on Christ's
                injunction to do to others as we would be done by (485n).</span></p>

                >Continuing this theme Canto IV, "Of Good and Evil," starts by both
                demonstrating the power of sympathy and lamenting its lack in the universe
                as a whole. In her longest solo passage, the poet's Muse repeats
                    <i>Phytologia</i>'s image of the world as a slaughterhouse (66),
                bemoaning the human propensity to war, the bloody depredations of the food
                chain (11-40) and even the "vegetable war" for resources between plants
                (42). Human vices and natural disasters add to the Muse's inability to
                "prove to Man the goodness of his God" (134). Urania's answer begins by
                enumerating life's benefits, from the simple "bliss of being" (150) and the
                direct pleasures of the eye and ear (151-82) to the idealizations of Fancy,
                which have inspired patriots, philanthropists and scientists to make the
                world a better place&#8212;though such achievements depend on the freedom of
                the Press, currently under attack (like Darwin himself) from an increasingly
                reactionary government (182-290). Such cultural achievements as history,
                poetry, architecture, painting, dance and music continue the list (291-336).
                Finally, Urania repeats <i>Phytologia</i>'s arguments that every death is
                matched by an increase in&#160; life and general happiness (337-462),
                weaving in Thomas Malthus's argument, in <span class="MsoEndnoteText"><span
                        style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><i>Essay on the Principle of
                            Population</i> (1798), that "war and pestilence, disease and
                        dearth" (373) are necessary brakes on human population, but not
                        embracing his notorious corollary that all attempts at improvement
                        are a waste of time. The poem climaxes with a mass choric
                        celebration of Nature, followed by Urania's final unveiling of her
                        "Truth Divine" (463-524).</span></span></span></p>
