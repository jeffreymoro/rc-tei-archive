Irritative ideas are those which are preceded by irritation, which is excited by objects external to the organs of sense: as the idea of that tree, which either I attend to, or which I shun in walking near it without attention.

The extremities of other animals terminate in horns, and hoofs, and claws, very unfit for the sensation of touch; whilst the human hand is finely adapted to encompass its object with this organ of sense. Those animals who have clavicles or collar-bones, and thence use their fore-feet like hands, as cats, squirrels, monkeys, are more ingenious than other quadrupeds, except the elephant, who has a fine sense at the extremity of his proboscis; and many insects from the possessing finer organs of touch have greater ingenuity, as spiders, bees, wasps.</span><br/></p>

Hence when we acquire the idea of solidity, we acquire at the same time the idea of figure; and this idea of figure, or motion of a part of the organ of touch, exactly resembles in its figure the figure of the body that occasions it; and thus exactly acquaints us with this property of the external world.<br/>

The fetus in the womb must experience many sensations, as of resistance, figure, fluidity, warmth, motion, rest, exertion, taste; and must consequently possess trains both of waking and sleeping ideas. Surprise must therefore be strongly excited at its nativity, as those trains of ideas must instantly be dissevered by the sudden and violent sensations occasioned by the dry and cold atmosphere, the hardness of external bodies, light, sound, and odours; which are accompanied with pleasure or pain according to their quantity or intensity.<br/>

The same distressful circumstance attending an ugly or wicked person affects us with grief or disgust; but when distress occurs to a beauteous or virtuous person, the pleasurable idea of beauty or of virtue becomes mixed with the painful one of sorrow and the passion of Pity is produced, which is a combination of love or esteem with sorrow; and becomes highly interesting to us by fixing our attention more intensely on the beauteous or virtuous person.<br/>
    <b class="citecolor">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b>Other distressful scenes have been supposed to give pleasure to the spectator from exciting a comparative idea of his own happiness, as when a shipwreck is viewed by a person safe on shore, as mentioned by Lucretius, L. 3. But these dreadful situations belong rather to the terrible, or the horrid, than to the tragic; and may be objects of curiosity from their novelty, but not of Taste, and must suggest much more pain than pleasure.</span><br/></p>

Whence the pain of cold and of hunger, and the irksomeness of a continued attitude, and of an indolent life: and hence the propensity to action in those confined animals, which have been accustomed to activity, as is seen in the motions of a squirrel in a cage; which uses perpetual exertion to exhaust a part of its accumulated sensorial power. This is one source of our general propensity to action; another perhaps arises from our curiosity or expectation of novelty mentioned in the note on 1. 145. of this canto.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the immediate cause of our propensity to imitation above that of other animals arises from the greater facility, with which by the sense of touch we acquire the ideas of the outlines of objects, and afterwards in consequence by the sense of sight; this seems to have been observed by Aristotle, who calls man, "the imitative animal;" see Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXII.</span><br/></p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 9.</b> From here to line 34 we are given a crash-course in modern science. "First" (9-16) Urania and the Muse look at the big picture, with occasional "or's" indicating successive aspects rather than strict alternatives. A glance at the sky, sea, equator ("burning line," 11), poles and earth's crust is followed by more cutting-edge observations on the gaseous formation of air and water. "Oxygen," "azote" (i.e. nitrogen) and "hydrogen" were terms coined by Lavoisier but (according to the OED) first used in English by Darwin in <i>Economy of Vegetation</i>&#8212;the first term in preference to his friend Priestley's "dephlogisticated air" (which, though Priestley discovered oxygen, tied it to an outmoded chemical theory). See Desmond King-Hele, <i>Erasmus Darwin: A Life of Unequalled Achievement</i>, p. 246; and also p. 176 for the possibility that Darwin prompted the Priestley/Lavoisier discovery that water consisted of oxygen and hydrogen, in a letter written as early as 1781.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 17.</b> "Next" (17-34) they explore light, electricity, magnetism, gravity and heat, returning finally to Canto I's theme of the creation of life. Their hands are "illumined" by the light shining on the prisms they are holding, but also perhaps because the two Muses are "Illuminati" or teachers of enlightenment. The "sevenfold threads" are the colours of the spectrum into which light is broken up by a triangular prism; the hairs of day become pencils as the rays surrounding the sun's face are focussed by a convex lens to inscribe a single bright dot.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 21.</b> Unlike the previous light experiments, which go back to Newton, the discovery of continuous electric current was brand new. "Resinous and vitreous fire" are negative and positive electricity&#8212;known as such because resin and glass were thought to produce different kinds of static electricity when rubbed. The power of electric shocks was long known about from such sources, from Benjamin Franklin's experiments with lightning and from certain fish&#8212;the gymnotus or electric eel and torpedo or electric ray (23-4)&#8212;but Darwin's picture, here and in 21n, of electricity as a combination of positive and negative "streams" points to the single bipolar force first produced artificially by Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) in 1800. "Galvanic chain-work" (25) denotes the interleaving of different metals in a conductive fluid&#8212;some of which becomes converted into gas (26)&#8212;which made up Volta's ur-battery or "pile," known for a while as the "Galvanic pile" after Luigi Galvani (1737-98), who anticipated some of Volta's results. For more on this period's electrical discoveries, see Patricia Fara, <i>An Entertainment for Angels: Electricity in the Enlightenment</i>.</p>
    <p class="notes"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote12.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note XII</a>, "Chemical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism" is, at thirty-two pages, by far the longest of the Additional Notes. It ambitiously tries to synthesize the groundbreaking electrical findings of the scientists named above, and others including the young Humphry Davy (a proteg&#233; of Darwin's Bristol-based friend Thomas Beddoes), and to unify these in turn with magnetism, gravitation and chemical combination in a wider theory of attractive and repulsive "ethers" (i.e. forces) operating almost universally. Darwin's tentative final renaming of these as "masculine" and "feminine" (p. 76) fills out the opening invocation's promise to show how Immortal Love works to "Press drop to drop, to atom atom bind, / Link sex to sex, or rivet mind to mind" (I, 25-6). The theory of attractive and repulsive ethers also underlies the account of the production of life in I, 235-42 and 239n, and is briefly hinted at at the very start of <i>Zoonomia</i> (vol. I, p.1). For a discussion of Ruggiero Boscovich's influence on Darwin 's theory of atomic repulsion, see my note on I, 235.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 27.</b> As throughout, "ether" is virtually equivalent to the modern term "force." The "How's" from here to 24 are dependent on line 21's "Then [they] mark." The "Or" of line 25 relates to the activities of the "electric streams" or currents, not of the two Muses, who now "mark" or observe how compass-needles show the bipolarity of the earth's magnetic field. 21n links this bipolarity of electricity and magnetism to the interplay between gravity (attractive ether) and heat (repulsive ether), in a brief reprise of the notes to I, 235 and 239. Lines 33-4 bring us back to the production of life from these two forces, as described in I, 235-50.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 38.</b> The image of Urania's vision piercing Chaos, Night and unmeasured space carries faintly blasphemous echoes of the victorious shout from Hell which "Frighted the Reign of <i>Chaos</i> and old Night" and Satan's ensuing journey through these regions in <i>Paradise Lost</i> (I, 540; II, 960-7), and continues the imagery of spreading light ushered in by Hymen's torch at the end of Canto II.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 42.</b> "The progress of the mind" is of course the topic of this canto. Having considered some of the most important recent advances in knowledge&#8212;the "now no longer interdicted" fruit of II, 442&#8212;the Poet's Muse asks Urania how we became able to know such things in the first place. She stresses the apparently unpromising starting-points of the "piles immense" of human knowledge (46): the transient sense-data on which our finer feelings are based (43-4), the soft skin and unfixed gaze which distinguish us from other animals, and also perhaps evoke the childhood in which the foundations of knowledge are laid. "Elf" (47), i.e. "small being," continues this double meaning: the baby already has a potentially gigantic mind when born, but even adults are "puny" compared to other species. Line 48 carries an echo of Pope's "The proper study of Mankind is Man" (<i>Essay on Man</i>, II, 2): without accepting Pope's implication that other knowledge is pointless, the Muse rounds off the poem's information-packed first half with the suggestion that the real mystery we need to understand is ourselves.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 55.</b> Urania's answer returns us to the first canto's tracing of rudimentary psychological development (I, 269-80) in terms of irritation, sensation, volition and association (see my notes to I, 270 and 273 for discussion of the relevant passages in <i>Zoonomia</i>, IV-V, copied as <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote2.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note II</a>). Human psychology starts from the excitation (55) or irritation (63) of the senses by external forces ("appulses," 56): these give either pain or pleasure, which become ingrained in our perceptions of them.</p>

We might expect lines 63-4 to be in the reverse order, but 64n seems concerned to stress the difference between full perception, where the mind is engaged, and the unthinking awareness which is "simply an irritative idea."</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 65.</b> A somewhat difficult line. "Acts" here are the mental perceptions just discussed, which only begin with ("rise from") the pleasurable or painful contact between sensory nerve and outside world. Through repetition, these habitual perceptions fill our imaginations and either give us nightmares or beautiful dreams, each attached to painful or pleasant images.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 72.</b> "Sensation" is not just the initial contact between sensory nerve and outside world but its impact on the whole "sensorium" which consists of mind and nerves together. 72n quotes again the definition from <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote2.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note II</a> and <i>Zoonomia</i>, but emphasizes that the initial contact is only the start of the process. It now seems that only some mental impressions, i.e. "sensitive ideas," arise from pleasure or pain and constitute our imaginations. Darwin's thinking here is clearly influenced by the special valuing of such ideas known as "Sensibility."</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_73" id="l_73"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 73.</b> As the note explains, "Volition" covers a series of responses to our sensations, some of which we might normally consider involuntary. "Recollection" is deliberate remembering for a purpose (such as saying the alphabet backwards, or the more poetic and/or useful purposes evoked 75-8), while "Reason" involves summoning up two trains of thought and comparing their similarities and differences. When able to relate new ideas to "the known system of nature" successfully (81n), it becomes the "judgment" needed to restrain uncontrolled Fancy (81-2), but cannot do so in dreams or poetic reverie (83-4).</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_85" id="l_85"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 85.</b> "Suggestion" is the third ("And last" ) aspect of Volition. "Ideal hosts" are groups of ideas, comprising "trains" or linear sequences whereby one automatically triggers another, and "tribes," or collections of logically similar ideas. However, though this may sound much like the Lockeian "association of ideas," explored to comic effect in Sterne's <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, Darwin's idea of "association" starts with the firmly physical. As 91n indicates, its basic application is to muscles so used to working together that they do so automatically, in response to each other or to given physical stimuli. The application of this to a singer accompanying herself on the harp without consciously thinking about each note ("unwill'd," 90) echoes <i>Zoonomia</i> (vol. I, pp. 63-4): "In learning any mechanic art, as music, dancing, or the use of the sword, we teach many of our muscles to act together or in succession by repeated voluntary efforts; which by habit become formed into trains or tribes of association." As in 91n, the purely mental association of ideas is seen as closely modelled on this physical process. For these ideas, Darwin is strongly indebted to <i>Observations on Man, His Frame, His Duty, and His Expectations</i> (1749) by David Hartley, whose psychosomatic theory of the movement of "tribes" of ideas around the mind-body continuum caused the young Coleridge to eulogize him as: "he of mortal kind / Wisest, he first who mark'd the ideal tribes / Down the fine fibres from the sentient brain / Roll subtly-surging" (<i>Religious Musings</i> [1796], ll. 391-4). See also Roy Porter, <i>Flesh in the Age of Reason</i>, pp. 378-84.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 93.</b> With an apparently complete switch of subject, Urania lists some animal powers of self-preservation which man lacks. Predatory foxes and hawks have speed on their side, as do the hares and doves on which they prey; vultures and dogs have a keen sense of smell, owls and flies of sight, and lions and horses of hearing. 103-16 lists various weapon-like appurtenances from the large to the minute.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 122.</b> Man's secret weapon is the naked hand, whose accurate sense of touch and opposable thumb enable it to feel, hold and hence understand the objects surrounding it. The note's reference to Buffon may remind us that II, 122n credits Buffon and others with the suggestion that humans arose from a single family of apes which had learned to use their opposable thumbs and hence "acquired clear ideas." The accurate ideas produced by our grasp of "form" in objects then enable us to consider changes of form and hence measure movement, time, number, weather-shifts, etc. (129-30; 125n).</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_131" id="l_131"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 131.</b> The hand or "tangent (i.e. touching) organ" cannot gauge very large or small objects: it would take too long to feel a mountain, and it cannot distinguish the contours of mites or baby ants. However, touch is supplemented by sight: the eye's lens ("clear glass," 136) projects the light reflected from objects onto the retina, as a magic-lantern projects moving images onto a sheet in an itinerant entertainment travelling from village to village (139-42). As 144n stresses, we constantly relate visual stimuli to our tactile knowledge of objects (of which sight is thus "the mute language," 144): presumably this compensates us for the keener vision of other animals such as the owl and fly described earlier (100). <i>The Essay towards a New Theory of Vision</i> (1709) by George Berkeley, later Bishop of Cloyne (1685-1753) radically questions the received idea that sight conveys an accurate, unmediated awareness of the physical world to the brain, asserting that "our judging objects perceived by sight to be at any distance, or without the mind, is entirely the effect of experience" (<i>A New Theory of Vision and Other Select Philosophical Writings</i>, Section XLI) and concluding "the proper objects of vision constitute a universal language of the Author of nature. . . . And the manner wherein they signify, and mark unto us the objects which are at a distance, is the same with that of languages and signs of human appointment, which do not suggest the things signified, by any likeness or identity of nature, but only by an habitual connexion, that experience has made us to observe between them" (Section CXLVII).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 145.</b> "Life's portico" is birth: literally the mouth of the womb but perhaps with overtones of the Stoic Portico as a place of education (see I, 424). The retreating step and expanded eyes belong to the personification of Surprise, possibly based on conventional actors' mannerisms, rather than physically to the baby, whose shock at such a complete change of environment is vividly described in 145n. As the note goes on to explain, Surprise is the first stage of a continuum: as the sense of shock decreases, it is replaced by the pleasant sense of Novelty, leading to Curiosity, the conscious desire to repeat it. We do not experience these in dreams, either because the outside world cannot impinge on our senses, or because we have no voluntary power to compare dream-events with reality.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_152" id="l_152"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 152.</b> Whereas Novelty was personified as a seductive object of desire (148-52), Curiosity is given the traits of the child she inspires: the use of mouth as well as hands to determine shapes, and the "restless eye" recalling the "rolling eye" mentioned in the Muse's account of the human "elf's" apparent weakness (45).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 155.</b> 155-8 seem like a somewhat hasty attempt to cover the other forces which may determine the child's development, in an echo of Thomas Gray's "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College" (1747), 51-70. Whereas all the melancholic Gray's schoolboys succumb to one or other of the "murth'rous band" of "vulture Passions" which stand "in ambush" for them, however, the optimistic Darwin makes half his passions positive and offsets the "nameless Vices" of 158 with the more fully described prospects offered by Philanthropy.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 163.</b> The "pure language of the sight" refers us back to 144, where sight is the "language of the touch" or, as 144n puts it, "a language, which by acquired associations introduce the tangible ideas of bodies": i.e. we only understand what we learn from touch by reference to visual ideas.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_167" id="l_167"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 167.</b> The way we move from tactile sensations to the visual sense of beauty is explored in terms of Darwin's relationship with the mother's breast. Initially attracted by its warmth, after the shock of losing that of the womb, the baby progresses from tactile to oral to visual enjoyment. As 169n indicates, 169-76 are taken directly from Dewhurst Bilsborow's "To Erasmus Darwin, on his Work entitled <i>Zoonomia</i>," prefaced to <i>Zoonomia</i> (1794), and based on a passage from it (vol. I, pp. 200-202)&#8212;which in turn is partly copied in <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote13.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note XIII</a>). Bilsborow (1776-?), a young devotee of Darwin's, was at Cambridge with William Wordsworth's brother Christopher and, according to Desmond King-Hele, told him that Darwin admired William's work (<i>Erasmus Darwin: A Life of Unequalled Achievement</i>, p. 288; see too H.W. Garrod, <i>Wordsworth</i> [1927], pp. 55-6): since this was in 1793, this probably referred to the heroic-couplet, politically radical and Darwin-influenced <i>Descriptive Sketches</i> of that year. Despite Wordsworth's repudiation of this style in the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> Preface and his own later practice, the important passage in <i>The Prelude</i> (1805, II, 237-80), describing the child's transferral of love from its mother to Nature as a whole, arguably owes much either to Bilsborow's poem or to the passage from <i>Zoonomia</i> which it versifies. We know Wordsworth read (or re-read) <i>Zoonomia</i> in 1798 when working on <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, using it as the source for "Goody Blake and Harry Gill" (<i>Erasmus Darwin: A Life of Unequalled Achievement</i>, 318); he wrote the "Blessed the infant babe" passage in 1798-9, as part of what is now known as the "Two-Part Prelude" (II, 267-310 in William Wordsworth, <i>The Prelude</i>).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 176.</b> "Ideal Beauty" here means the mental idea underlying all beauty. Though "Paphian" (174) refers to the home of Venus, 176n distinguishes the sense of "Ideal Beauty" to which the mother's breast gives rise from the "animal passion" of sexual love with which, however, "it is frequently accompanied." (Darwin may stress the distinction because "Paphian" is Bilsborow's word, not his.)</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_178" id="l_178"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 178.</b> 178n continues to distinguish the two kinds of love, identifying "Sentimental Love" with the Greek Eros, who is also the "Immortal Love" of Canto I (15-32). "Sentimental" here means to do with "mental feelings" (OED) rather than sexual passion, which is represented by the more recent god, Cupid, who dominated Canto II (221-50, 361-410). The "Graces" who attend him symbolize Beauty.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_181" id="l_181"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 181.</b> Indeed, his birth makes the whole natural world appear more beautiful. 181n quotes from Lucretius's <i>De Rerum Natura</i>: "Before you the winds flee, and at your coming the clouds forsake the sky. For you the inventive earth flings up sweet flowers. For you the ocean levels laugh, the sky is calmed and glows with diffused radiance" (I, 6-9). Interestingly, this passage comes from the same opening invocation to Venus quoted in II, 261n. The fact that Dione (Darwin's usual name for Venus) appears in 189 as Eros's beloved makes for something of a confusion of love deities, especially when we remember that in most versions of their relationship Venus (or Aphrodite) is the mother of Cupid&#8212;not usually so firmly distinguished from Eros as here. The <i>Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology</i> does, however, mention a variant in which he predates her and welcomes her to Cyprus (149). Along with Robert Graves (<i>The Greek Myths</i> p. 49), Larousse identifies Dione as of an older generation than Aphrodite/Venus, and in some stories as her mother (which would make her Eros's grandmother).</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_187" id="l_187"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 187.</b> In this passage, Dione seems to represent beauty in general, perhaps with a memory that in I, 372 her sea-birth made her represent "the beauty of organic nature" in particular. It is hard to be certain how far Darwin is playing with the ambiguity of her relationship with Eros&#8212;as mother or beloved&#8212;to continue the link between the mother's breast and "ideal beauty" (175).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 205.</b> The oxymoron "chaste seduction" is apt, but the overall application of the myth is somewhat ambiguous. Either a display of "sentimental love" is a good way for men to win women over, or we should forget Eros's gender and consider sentimental love as the particular province of women themselves. Either way (or perhaps both), it is the basis for social harmony.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 230n.</b> The <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote13.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note XIII</a> referred to at the end of 230n constitutes a major essay on "The Analysis of Taste" (which in fact refers itself to 221-2, where Darwin has omitted his usual note guiding us to it). Partly derived from <i>Zoonomia</i>, and sometimes actually overlapping with borrowings therefrom in the footnotes, Additional Note XIII leans heavily on William Hogarth's <i>The Analysis of Beauty</i> (1753). Like Hogarth's, Darwin's aesthetic theory starts with a high valuation of novelty or variety (pp. 81-4; see Hogarth, ch. II, pp. 27-8), which can be linked to his medical interest in the pleasurable disruption of habit as a defence against old age (see <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote7.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note VII</a>). Also like Hogarth (ch. III, pp. 28-30) he next turns with more puzzlement to repetitive and regular forms, which allow him to include musical and verse metres (p. 85) in an aesthetic which is primarily and overwhelmingly visual. Noting that the pleasures of novelty and repetition can easily tip over into the displeasures of mere surprise and tedium, he stresses the new aesthetic category of the Picturesque as a successful balance of the two, only then moving into the more familiar Burkeian categories (see note on 342n) of the Sublime and Beautiful, with the "Romantic" as an interesting halfway point between the two. The next section, on "Melody of Colours," draws on his son Robert Darwin's research into "ocular spectra" or after-images, which Darwin also incorporated into <i>Zoonomia</i> (II, pp. 328-74) as evidence that the eye actively seeks to counter visual exertions with their opposites, thus (once again) prioritizing change and novelty as primary aesthetic motives. The proposal for a "luminous music" of shifting colour-projections (p. 89) anticipates the disco light-show while also again indicating Darwin's preference for
    visual over aural pleasures. It is only after these demonstrations of natural, "irritative" pleasures that he moves to those based on that bedrock of eighteenth-century psychology, the association of ideas, of which his primary example is so deeply embedded and universally shared as to be quasi-natural: the mental association of the Hogarthian "line of beauty" (see Hogarth, ch. IX, pp. 48-9) with the memory of the mother's breast.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 269.</b> A new section begins, focusing on active rather than passive uses of the mind. During physical rest, the senses (i.e., more or less, the mind) accumulate energy which needs to be used (in "contraction," 271) to avoid the unpleasant consequences detailed in 270n. They thus drive us to original thought (though whether the senses get the "change" they need as the ideas "act" (272), or the latter are constantly being changed by the activity of the former, is not quite clear). Darwin's view of both physical and mental health as dependent on the correct balance between under- and over-stimulation derived from William Cullen (1710-90) and John Brown (1735-88), whose theories were particularly prevalent at Edinburgh University, where Darwin studied Medicine.

Our minds and bodies are so closely and intimately connected, that one is incapable of pain or pleasure without the other." (Part IV, section 4, p. 178). Darwin also refers to ch. IV, section II of Thomas Reid's <i>An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense</i> (1764), the founding text of the Scottish "Common Sense" school which attempted to refute Hume's radical scepticism by insisting on a natural, intuitive basis for language and, ultimately, our beliefs in consistent causality and external reality itself.</p>

The last Additional Note in the book, this analyses all European speech-sounds into groups which it then boils down to thirteen basic sounds. Darwin rounds off with a description of a speech-machine he himself constructed some time after 1771 with the ability to say "m," "p," "b" and "a" (see Desmond King-Hele, <i>Erasmus Darwin: A Life of Unequalled Achievement</i>, pp. 102-4), and with a plea for the creation of an accurately phonetic alphabet. Acknowledging that this would make it harder to trace the etymologies of words, he concludes this will not matter "as metaphors will cease to be necessary in conversation, and only be used as the ornaments of poetry." As arguably his last published words, these are a somewhat sad indication of the growing separation of poetic and rational functions against which Darwin in many ways stood.</p>

Our first speech produces symbolic representations (borne on "airy rings" because each sound spreads in circles from its starting-point) of concrete objects we are thinking about ("ideal things"), which we wish to name when they impinge (i.e. are "appulsive") on our senses. "Abstracted" and "reflex" ideas are also types of noun, as explained in 371n, paragraph 2. The adjectives ("sounds adjunctive" ) of 379-80 are themselves originally derived from nouns (as in "musky," stormy," etc.), and so are the verbs of 381-2, as in 371n's discussion of "to whip" in its first paragraph, and generally in its third. 383-4 convey, highly elliptically, the idea that the verb "to be" really refers to the nounal idea "existence," and that verb tenses refer to the division of the noun "time" into past, present and future. These complex (and somewhat barmy) ideas are more fully laid out in <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote14.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note XIV</a>, "The Theory and Structure of Language," to which 371n directs us for the first time, though the Additional Note itself refers us back to 365&#8212;which explains why it precedes Additional Note XV, discussed above.</p>

Either way (and Darwin seems unsure himself), they constitute a form of "reason" which links "reptiles" (i.e. "creeping things," including insects) to mankind, whose pride in his essential difference from such humble creatures is lambasted in a couplet pithily conveying Darwin's evolutionist conviction of the fundamental unity of life (433-4).

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 449.</b> We return to the Garden of Eden: this time, however, Darwin finds more human significance in the myth than in Canto I's wholesale deconstruction of the story, Canto II's reading of it as an Egyptian allegory for the emergence from hermaphroditism, or the subsequent happy picnic on its "no longer interdicted" fruit. The word "mystic" (450) is usually a sign that Darwin believes a real truth is being allegorized: here that the knowledge of good and evil is, precisely, the power of "Reflection" (458). De-inverted, 453 means that the hours flowed with sweet innocence; "gather'd" (456) involves a nice play on the ideas of physical fruit-collecting (the fruit was "right and wrong") and mental "gathering," or understanding of these concepts. This is followed by another play on "Reflection," literalized as a mental mirror which shows us the true moral nature of our trains of thought. "Blood by Hunger spilt" (459) seems to refer to the necessity to hunt animals for survival, but it might also include the first human warfare over scant resources. Very elliptically, the "shame" might even include the vegetarian Cain's reasons for killing his animal-sacrificing brother Abel. The suggestion that "sympathy" accompanies guilt suggests that the "Fall" into self-knowledge has a positive as well as negative side. 456n. takes a more cynical line on the myth as "inculcating" the valuing of ignorance, and argues that "knowing" good and evil helps us maximize the former and minimize the latter.</p>

Through visual observation or even physical imitation ("brandishes her hands," 462) of others' emotional signals, we come to feel the same things, thanks to the association between these signs and the feelings they denote. 466n refers us to the very start (I.I.1, pp. 10-13) of <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> (1759) by Adam Smith (1723-90), now better known as the father of modern economics.</p>

His shining ("beamy") forehead, heavenly warmth ("ardour") and "sparkling wings" ally him with the torches appropriate to the Eleusinian Mysteries" third stage (also adumbrated earlier by the torch of Hymen). From 471, his power to observe hidden suffering and bring it out of confinement is especially stressed: the imagery of unbarring prisons (475) looks forward to the next canto's account of the prison reformers Howard, Moira and Burdett, whose way is lit by "Pity's torch" (IV, 205-222).</p>

The many references to heaven in this whole passage (e.g. 467, 477, 483) are probably sincere: for Darwin, the divine is the first cause, as expressed in the natural "laws" or principles which enabled the universe to come about.
