Those who have combined an extensive class of ideas by the contiguity of time or place, are men learned in the history of mankind, and of the sciences they have cultivated. Those who have connected a great class of ideas of resemblances, possess the source of the ornaments of poetry and oratory, and of all rational analogy. While those who have connected great classes of ideas of causation, are furnished with the powers of producing effects.

But as those remains of former life are not again totally decomposed, or converted into their original elements, they supply more copious food to the succession of new animal or vegetable beings on their surface; which consists of materials convertible into nutriment with less labour or activity of the digestive powers; and hence the quantity or number of organized bodies, and their improvement in size, as well as their happiness, has been continually increasing, along with the solid parts of the globe; and will probably continue to increase, till the whole terraqueous sphere, and all that inhabit it shall dissolve by a general conflagration, and be again reduced to their elements.<br/>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 7.</b> 7n means "Blessed is he whose mind had power to probe / The causes of things and trample underfoot / All terrors and inexorable fate / And the clamour of devouring Acheron" (Virgil, <i>The Georgics</i>, II, 490-2). The passage is generally recognized as Virgil's homage to Lucretius for prioritizing the scientific study of nature over superstitious fears about this or the next life. Despite local arguments with Lucretius on whether the universe was formed from atoms by chance or inevitable natural laws (see 147n below), Darwin presents himself here as an unequivocally Lucretian scientist-poet.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 17.</b> From the absence of sympathy in human warfare we move to the animal kingdom. As her milk dries up, the mother wolf teaches her cub to hunt&#8212;perhaps deliberately, the image of cruelty is complicated by the mother's concern for her child (the "storge" of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote9.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note IX</a>).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 19.</b> The passage from Virgil's <i>Eclogue II</i> (63-4) quoted in 19n applies broadly to the whole passage from 17-22, rather than specifically to the lines on the eagle: "The wild-eyed lioness pursues the wolf; the wolf pursues the kid; the kid herself goes gambolling in search of flowering clover." In <i>Eclogue II</i> (which Byron called "That horrid one / Beginning with Formosum pastor Corydon" [<i>Don Juan</i>, I, 42]), the speaker Corydon uses this description of violence right down the food-chain to convey the power of his same-sex passion for Alexis, continuing "And I chase you." Similar erotic implications seem to surface in 23-8, where the "sweet notes" (24) of the nightingale ("minstrel of the night") betray it to the owl who, though amorously "smit[ten]," does not "spare" it (23). In a continuation down the pecking-order, the owl's treatment is repeated in its victim's similar amorousness to its prey the "radiant" (25) glow-worm, and the latter's murderous "slay[ing]" (28) of the flower, another emblem of beauty.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 31.</b> We now descend to the insect kingdom, starting with the parasitic horrors amplified by the coolly scientific tone of 29n and 33n. "Living way" (31) indicates how the bot-fly larva journeys through living flesh; "mines its silky course" (35) how the ichneumon larva steals the host's silk while burrowing through it. Compared to these horrid intimacies, the predatory and military aggression of dragonflies and bees seem fairly straightforward.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 41.</b> Continuing down the scale, plants too show aggression in their contest for resources above and below ground, and the lethal parasitism of ivy. "Mancinella" (49) is the manchineel or hippomane, a poisonous South American tree, described thus in <i>The Loves of the Plants</i>, III, 188n: "the dew-drops, which fall from it, are so caustic as to blister the skin, and produce dangerous ulcers; whence many have found their death by sleeping in its shade."</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 51.</b> According to <i>Phytologia</i>, mildew is a fungus which grows on corn whose upper leaves are too dense, or when overshadowed by other plants; it can be prevented by "thinning the plant, or removing those in its vicinity, so as to admit more light, and greater ventilation" (<i>Phytologia</i>, p. 321).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 55.</b> We continue physically downwards, underwater. The shark's attack is "descending" (57) because the extension of its nose over its mouth prevents it striking upwards (see 57n), in contrast to the upward-opening jaw of the crocodile (59n). The whale's gape is "sepulchral" because it is its victims' tomb, but there is also a subliminal evocation of a deep, bored yawn of indifference.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 63.</b> This devastating summation of a Nature driven by hunger into murderous competition at every level&#8212;rather than just in the shape of a few ferocious animals&#8212;echoes <i>Phytologia</i>, p. 556: "Such is the condition of organic nature! whose first law might be expressed in the words, "Eat or be eaten!" and which would seem to be one great slaughter-house, one universal scene of rapacity and injustice!" As noted by Desmond King-Hele (<i>Erasmus Darwin: A Life of Unequalled Achievement,</i> pp. 74-79), such passages anticipate Tennyson's vision of "Nature, red in tooth and claw" (<i>In Memoriam</i>, lvi) which, though perhaps a response to Robert Chambers's <i>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</i> (1844), is often seen as a striking prevision of Charles Darwin's <i>Origin of Species</i> (1859). Note, however, how 66n optimistically envisions the artificial production of food which will&#8212;somehow&#8212;stop animals murdering plants and each other.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 67.</b> The Muse returns to the miseries of man. 67 is on one level clear enough, but perhaps carries the evolutionary implication that though we are lifted ("elate") by thought almost physically into a standing position ("erect") which appropriately places the organ of thought ("brow") at the top, this process is reversed by death. The love of others for us (and perhaps vice versa) cannot save us, nor can the virtues of even the best&#8212;a theme which will be taken up later in Urania's response.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 71.</b> 71-74 lists various things which "oppress" us. Cold and hunger do so by "defect" of action (as explained 71n); heat and overindulgence ("Repletion"&#8212;see too the "Luxury" of 75 and "Ebriety" or drunkenness of 77-82) by excess of it. The latter also applies to overwork, especially when combined with torture in the form of slavery (73-4)&#8212;which Darwin had attacked at greater length in <i>The Economy of Vegetation</i> (II, 421-30), as part of a concerted Lunar Society campaign. The British slave trade was only abolished in 1807, and slavery itself within the Empire in 1834.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_77" id="l_77"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 77.</b> An example of the chains of unhealthy consequences ("Disease's trains," 75) brought on by a generally excessive lifestyle ("Luxury") is drunkenness ("Ebriety"), personified as a harlot (81) who kills more people than war does, not by venereal disease but through gout, dropsy, paralysis and other ailments such as (perhaps) the chronic pain and ("grinning"?) insanity brought on by torpor of the liver. All these are listed in <i>Zoonomia</i> (vol. I, 367-8), where Darwin argues that gout is caused solely by alcohol rather than overeating as generally thought; he also attacks drunkenness in <i>The Loves of the Plants</i> (III, 363-8). Though Darwin's anger at cruelty to animals is laudable, the idea of alcohol as their revenge (82) seems rather a side-leap, though the thought is probably suggested by the quotation in 77n: "Luxury, more ruthless than war, broods over Rome, and exacts vengeance for a conquered world." It is not, however, from Horace but Juvenal (<i>Satire VI</i>, 292-3).</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_83" id="l_83"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 83.</b> As on 89, "There" balances the "Here" of 77, adding superstition and madness to the things which "oppress" mankind (71) or possibly to the consequences of Luxury (75). But though no connection with drunkenness is logically needed, <i>Zoonomia</i> (vol. I, pp. 362-3) lists madness and "superstitious fear" among the effects of its suspension of voluntary power. As in many coded infidel attacks on "superstition" (irrational religious belief), Darwin's account of fears of damnation throwing a "deeper shadow" (87) over the grave could clearly be applied to most forms of Christianity, even though 87n applies it particularly to Methodism, ingeniously prescribing theatrical ridicule as a cure for the "intellectual cowardice" its "theatric preachers" play on. The most successful of over twenty farces by Samuel Foote (1720-1777) was his satire of Methodism, <i>The Minor</i> (1760).</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_89" id="l_89"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 89.</b> Whereas madness unthrones reason, melancholy claims to <i>be</i> reason, using the "voluntary" power absent in madness to see things at their worst. For Darwin's complex definition of "association" (93n), see Canto III (85-92): here the main idea is that past displeasurable associations trigger unnecessary, purely mental ("ideal") sufferings, as when childhood experiences of biting glass cups still set our teeth on edge at similar sounds (94n). Though the "Call for the dead" drowned in the sea of Time (95) could apply to any such reliving of past associations, the whole passage from 90-96 evokes the melancholic "graveyard poetry" of Young, Gray and others.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 97.</b> A new "Here"/"There" list segues from mental torments to vices. The miser "guards" his treasure from the poor in not giving charity, but perhaps also in denying with his bolts the right their hunger would give them to steal it. 97n quotes Juvenal's <i>Satire XIV</i>, 136-7: "It's craziness, no doubt about it, plain lunatic folly, / spending your life in squalor, just to die a millionaire" (Juvenal, <i>The Sixteen Satires,</i> 109). De-inverted, 101-2 mean: "Imposture, your false appearances fool unthinking crowds: the apparently humbly religious (like the Methodists of 87n) may be wolves in sheep's clothing."</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 109.</b> The often-deadly effects of Ambition, Envy and Jealousy are followed by those of floods, volcanoes, earthquakes and starvation. "Involves" (112) means "wraps"; "inhumes" (113) means "buries"; "nations" (114) can be "native" communities of various sizes, "living" only for the brief moment of their entombment by the earthquake. Famine is "unsated" (116) because she takes millions of victims, but also as a personification of them.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_117" id="l_117"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 117.</b> Famine ("Dearth") is often accompanied by epidemic diseases. Though "shuddering earth" (118) and "airs volcanic" (119) could simply be taken as metaphors for the fearfulness and noxiousness of epidemics, 119n insists that these are actually caused by volcanoes and their accompanying earthquakes. The indicated passage from <i>The Economy of Vegetation</i> relates this to the desert wind the Simoom, and those near Vesuvius; a following note (<i>The Economy of Vegetation</i>, IV, 82n) states "The volcanic vapours which cause epidemic coughs, are to be ranked amongst poisons, rather than amongst the miasmata, which produce contagious diseases." These latter are bred wherever organic matter is decaying: the "putrid vaults" (120) into which Pestilence dips her arrows.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 123.</b> The Muse concludes her list of horrors by pointing out that the "sympathy" earlier celebrated as good in itself (see III, 467-96) simply adds to the pain of living in such a cruel world. Her sighs and tears over the fact of death temporarily identify her with "the Muse of Melancholy" glimpsed in Canto I's description of the Temple, in a passage (I, 105-28) closely prefiguring this whole section. "Sublunary" (124) means "beneath the moon," i.e. "of this world," though the literal sense is particularly apt when discussing changefulness.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 130.</b> The first time we have heard the word "sentimental" separated from "love" (see III, 177-86)&#8212;which has now become "pain." 130n exemplifies the debate raging in this period about the proper limits of "sentiment" and "sensibility" (two terms often used interchangeably). Darwin's stern insistence that to destroy one's own happiness through excessive sympathy with others is reprehensible in decreasing "the sum total of public happiness" echoes the "happiness calculus" of utilitarians such as Jeremy Bentham. The note summarizes parts of Darwin's <i>A Plan for the Conduct of Female Education in Boarding Schools</i> (1797), Section XVII, "Compassion" (pp. 48-9).</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_131" id="l_131"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 131.</b> We are reminded that Sympathy is an attribute of Reflection (III, 445-78) by the imagery of the mind seeking external brightness and light. Like "sublunary," "terrene" (133) means "of this world," and perhaps builds us towards an expectation that Man must seek "the Goodness of his God" (134) outside it. The Muse's questions echo <i>Phytologia</i>, p. 556, which follow Darwin's ruminations on the world as a slaughter-house: "Where shall I find a benevolent idea to console us amid so much apparent misery?" His response prefigures parts of Urania's reply to the Muse throughout the rest of this canto.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_135" id="l_135"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 135.</b> Urania ("The Nymph") takes over, her indignation at mortals' bewailing of the fact of death echoing that of the personified Nature in Lucretius's <i>De Rerum Natura</i> III, 931-62. "Ye Sons of Time" reminds us that we are created by time as well as destroyed by it, and her address to us over the Muse's head reminds us that sometimes the poetic imagination can be led astray through the subjective feelings of the moment ("melancholy mood," 139). The scales weighing good against evil must be held firmly not tremulously, and everything must be included. "Libration" (143) can mean either "balance" or "oscillation," here clearly the latter: the beam of the scales "nods" and "subsides" on the good side (144).</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_145" id="l_145"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 145.</b> The repeated "Hear, O ye Sons of Time!" lends an incantatory note as Urania starts to sum up the good points described in the poem so far. Life's "arrest" of the elements of matter (see II, 37-44) prompts the highly condensed deistic argument of 147n: the "ancient philosophers, who contended that the world was formed from atoms" were Democritus, Epicurus and Lucretius who, however, ascribed their combination into larger objects to blind chance. For Darwin, these thinkers' atomism was correct, but not their failure to realize that atoms combined according to "immutable" attractive forces such as gravity, chemical affinity and (at the organic level) active desire. Had they realized this, the doctrine of atoms would have strengthened our belief in cause and effect, because the same laws produce the same results in so many cases. Since, for Darwin, the idea of causality leading back to an ultimate "first cause" is the only basis for belief in God, atomism should be seen as supporting this belief rather than the "atheism" for which the Epicureans were notorious. Darwin may also have in mind Hume, whose scepticism as to whether causation could ever be proved led to a devastating assault on deistic "natural religion," the shared ground between orthodox Christians and rational materialists such as Darwin.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_149" id="l_149"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 149.</b> "The powers of life" (145) enable the potentially organic matter to absorb other particles (see I, 255-8), and thus give it the initial happiness of existence as a living organism. (See <i>Phytologia</i>, p. 559: "a degree of pleasurable sensation must be supposed . . . to attend this activity of their systems [i.e. ingestion, digestion and secretion].") Starting with this one, many other new "trains" (152) or sequences of pleasures arise from the purely physical processes of "irritation"&#8212;rolling their blue eyes to indicate that they are "young" or born in us alongside existence itself. The capitalization of "Irritation" alerts us that Urania also plans to take us through the pleasures of Sensation, Volition and Association, the other three "faculties of the sensorium" (see <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote2.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note II</a>). <i>Phytologia</i> (p. 556) apologizes for listing only the pleasures of irritation, but promises that the "happiness derived from imagination and volition may be treated of in some future work."</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 153.</b> In enumerating life's good points, Urania skips the rest of evolution to follow up the pleasures of Irritation at the human level, starting with such pleasures of nature as cool breezes, sunshine, smelling flowers, eating fruit, birdsong and falling in love.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_159" id="l_159"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 159.</b> The pleasures of landscape are conveyed through a carefully composed scene combining elements of the sublime, picturesque and beautiful. The "huge rocks" (161) are sublime in their size, the suggestion of violence in "opposing," and their nakedness; the ragged "fringe" of the woods (163) and "checker'd shadows" on the water (164) are picturesque in their relish of unevenness; the smoothly sloping grassland ("lawns," 165) are beautiful in themselves and in the sense of calm orderliness with which they "construct" the scene which unfolds to one side of the sublime rocks ("sidelong," 165), "guiding" the stream, "conducting" the gentle wind ("pausing gale," 167) and even seeming to ensure that the echoes "talk" in subdued tones (168) along a valley which leads our eyes to the distance where dim hills rise to close the scene in approved Claudian manner. 160n gives three reasons&#8212;two irritative and one associative&#8212;for our enjoying such scenes: simply exercising the eyes; allowing one action or impression to "relieve" the other by variety; and evoking such associations as sublimity and beauty. III, 230n, to which he refers us, relates the picturesque to objects "neither sublime nor beautiful" but conveying "an agreeable sentiment of novelty," by a combination of "variety and intricacy" with "a due degree of regularity or uniformity."</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="l_171" id="l_171"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 171.</b> We move to the pleasures of music. Despite the eighteenth-century abundance of other great German and Austrian composers, the British-domiciled George Frederick Handel (1685-1759) is usually taken as the composer par excellence in writing of this period. Again we move from the potentially terrifying sublime (174) to the smoothly melodious beautiful (178), here with religious music (perhaps from Handel's <i>Messiah</i>) transcending both (181). 178n again gives priority to the simple pleasures of physical "irritation": music exercises our hearing in itself, and by allowing one auditory "action" to relieve another through contrast. Unlike with landscape, however, the third point involves the idea of "volition," arising from our active involvement in the music through the expectations of rhythmic or metrical repetition&#8212;and those of rhyme, if we extend this idea to verse. Fourth ("lastly"), there are again the pleasures built up by past pleasurable associations with certain musical forms.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 183.</b> "Next by SENSATION led" notifies us that we are moving through "Pleasure's trains" systematically, in terms of what <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote2.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note II</a> calls the four "faculties of the sensorium": irritation (153-82), sensation (183-222), volition (223-90), and association (291-336). Existing somewhere between the raw sense-data of irritation and the mental activity based on this, sensation is perhaps the hardest of Darwin's quaternity to define. Here, the "new joys" (183) of sensation are produced in the mind ("in swarms ideal," 185) from the raw materials of irritative pleasure ("excited sense," 184). As Fancy, these lend an extra pleasure to everything around us ("o'er all," 187), create new, imaginary phenomena ("unreal things," 188) and provide us with the aesthetic sense ("sentiment and taste," 190) which enables us to create works of art such as architecture ("the level and the rule," 191), painting, sculpture (192), and poetry in both pastoral and epic modes (193-4). All our ideas of beauty and love arise from Fancy, personified as a "nymph" (195).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 197.</b> "So" means "thanks to Fancy," which enables the Patriot to love and idealize his country, in a way that will lead him either to the laurels of victory (199) or honoured death (200). Fancy also provides the religious visions of the cloistered nun (201), while washing or dressing at her "toilet" (202) or asleep in her dreams (203).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 205.</b> Far less ambiguous examples of Fancy's idealizing power are the prison reforms instigated by John Howard (1726-90), Francis Rawdon, Second Earl of Moira (1754-1826) and Sir Francis Burdett (1770-1884). Though Darwin presents them acting together as "The Friends of Man" (212), the three operated at different times and sometimes for different ends: whereas Howard's investigations led to a general amelioration of prison conditions in the 1770s, Burdett had placed himself at the head of the radical movement by agitating on behalf of a specific group of imprisoned radicals, as recently as 1799. (Moira's prison reforming activities do not loom particularly large in his biography.) "Want, or woe, or guilt" (206) succinctly summarizes progressive objections to the penal "bloody code" in which debt or petty theft&#8212;into which many were driven by poverty&#8212;were punished equally with cases of real "guilt." "Pity's torch" (207), bringing light into darkness, recalls the "beamy forehead" of "the Seraph Sympathy" who "Unbars the prison" at the end of Canto III (468, 475).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 217.</b> The three reformers are greeted by "Imagination" partly because they are inspiring to others, but mainly because it is she (or Fancy) who has inspired their own efforts: it took sympathetic imagination to realize that the Law's "stern behest" (214) needed to be "assuaded" (213) to change. The whole passage has a feeling of triumphant crescendo, in which Darwin's support for the still controversial Burdett is protected by association with the more universally revered Howard.</p>

All the fertile land within the branches of the Nile Delta could be described as an "isle" (254); Isis was the Nature-goddess who legendarily taught the Egyptians (255; poetic diction allows "taught" to be used without a specific object) how to separate, spin and weave flax. Sir Richard Arkwright (1732-92) was the inventor of the water-powered spinning-frame and, with the 1771 establishment of his cotton mill at Cromford, Derbyshire, one of the early giants of the Industrial Revolution. According to Desmond King-Hele (<i>Erasmus Darwin: A Life of Unequalled Achievement</i>, pp. 202-4), Darwin defended Arkwright's right to his patents in 1785, and persuaded fellow "Lunaticks" Watt and Boulton&#8212;who disliked him&#8212;to do likewise. The lack of an object to "taught" in 261&#8212;though conventionally allowed, see 255&#8212;helps to elide the slaves who actually pick the cotton with the mill-workers who extract ("cull") it from the pods and the machines which stretch and spin it. <i>The Loves of the Plants</i>, II, 87n (indicated in 261n) describes the process at greater length, and predicts that (as in 264) cotton cloth "will become the principle clothing of mankind."</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 273.</b> The most political moment in the poem, intertwining the themes of the liberty of the press and the making or maintenance of peace with France (which lasted from the Treaty of Amiens, March 1802 until May 1803, though preliminaries were in the air from 1801, when Darwin may have written this passage). Since "shake the senate" (276) conventionally means to address Parliament brilliantly from within rather than threaten it from without, the "patriot heroes" (273) are probably the Foxite Whigs, who were broadly opposed both to the war and to the Pitt government's increasing suppression of freedom of the press through the 1790s. With Pitt's (temporary) fall in 1801, the still essentially conservative new government of Henry Addington (later Lord Sidmouth) began peace negotiations and made overtures to the Whigs, some of whose supporters may have now felt they at last had a chance of power (though this was blocked by George III). "Patriot" more often meant "radical" than "jingoistic" at this time, and these patriots' dedication to Mercy and Liberty as well as Justice and Law, their appeal to the younger generation, their senate-shaking performances and general dash and "energy" (278) suggest the brilliant Fox, Sheridan and Erskine rather than either the anti-press Pitt or the somewhat lacklustre Addington team. 279-82 establish the context of what were becoming the Napoleonic Wars; 283-4 combines the image of the "tree of knowledge" audaciously celebrated in Canto II (439-42) with the radical symbol of the Tree of Liberty, constantly threatened by the "axe" of government repression. 285-6 spell out the twin planks of Darwin's favoured policy, taking it for granted that the fears engendered by war underlay the various gagging acts leading to the prosecutions of radical writers and reading societies throughout the 1790s, as well as attacks by government-funded publications such as <i>The Anti-Jacobin</i> on Darwin's own

The key to 299-318 is given in 299n, copied verbatim from <i>Zoonomia</i> (vol. I, p. 66). In <i>A Treatise of Human Nature</i> (1739-40), the sceptical philosopher David Hume (1711-76) argues that "The qualities, from which [the association of ideas] arises, and by which the mind is . . . conveyed from one idea to another, are three, viz. resemblance, contiguity in time or place, and cause and effect" (Book I, Part 1, section 4). The first two of these correspond to the two main sources of fanciful figures of speech we would now call metaphor and metonymy. By aligning causality with these, as a fundamentally mental operation, Hume initiates the <i>Treatise</i>'s general strategy to demote causation from objective status to that of a habit of mind: something Darwin would probably not agree with, given the high value he places on the scientific ability to identify real causes and effects.</p>

Directed by Association ("thy voice," as in 299), Resemblance classes ideas in terms of "sister"-like similarity (306), providing the "loose analogies" (308) by which Imagination decorates poetry and prose. The term "loose analogy" recalls the manifesto-like opening sentence of the "Advertisement" to <i>The Botanic Garden</i>: "The general design of the following sheets is to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science; and to lead her votaries from the looser analogies, which dress out the imagery of poetry, to the stricter ones which form the ratiocination of philosophy." These stricter, scientific analogies can perhaps be related to the "rational analogy" mentioned in 299n. 309n refers to the well-known definition of wit in Book II, chapter 11, section 2 of <i>An Essay concerning Human Understanding</i> (1690) by John Locke (1621-1704), and to the further comment by Joseph Addison (1672-1719) in <i>The Spectator</i> (11 May, 1711) that "every Resemblance of Ideas is not that which we call Wit, unless it be such an one that gives Delight and Surprize to the Reader."</p>

While accepting Malthus's argument that war, disease and famine are necessary to remove the "superfluous myriads" (374), Darwin shows no sign of accepting his anti-progressive corollary (aimed particularly at radicals such as William Godwin) that all attempts to better the living conditions of the masses are doomed to failure.

"Kindle" (382) can mean "give birth" as well as "catch fire," though the second meaning subliminally helps the beautiful image of the earth coming alive before our eyes as a single vast organism (see too "every pore of Nature," 380), in a way reminiscent of James Lovelock's idea of the earth as "Gaia" (see James Lovelock, <i>Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth</i>).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 383.</b> The juxtaposing of monarchs and mushrooms has a nicely republican ring, as well as reaffirming Darwin's constant theme of the unity of all organic life. The idea that decaying bodies "add to the sum total of human happiness" (387n) by having "every part" of their organic matter recycled, to produce more beings than existed before, has its macabre side. The idea that the new insects and plants which feed off dead bodies feel "finer goads" and "purer flames" (390) can be related to the argument in <i>Phytologia</i> (p. 557) that new organisms are "more irritable and more sensible" than those they feed on, and hence "more pleasurable sensation exists in the world, as the organized matter is taken from a state of less irritability and less sensibility, and converted into a state of greater." In <i>Phytologia</i>, this leads into the argument (earlier encountered in Canto II, 3n of this poem) that "before mankind introduced rational society . . . old age was unknown on earth" since ageing creatures were immediately killed. As a "ray of light" to comfort the Muse (IV, 133), this insistence on the young constantly destroying and feeding off the old is not wholly convincing.</p>

Despite the irony, this probably inspired the battle-scene of 393-4. "The wrecks of Death are but a change of forms" (398) sums up the Eleusinian hierophant Urania's response to the Muse's, or Mystery initiate's, fears of death.

The star crowning the young phoenix (414) has a cosmic significance in <i>The Economy of Vegetation</i>, where the phoenix-image is used to illustrate the inevitable future implosion of the universe, leading to the recreation of its stars in another "big bang."

Conversely, the awareness of lack of virtue strikes the guilty through their consciences, and tyrants are generally overthrown as a result of their crimes (505-8): the aftermath of the French Revolution gave plenty of examples to choose from, including most dramatically the executions of Louis XVI and Robespierre. While "realms unknown" (507) suggests the Christian Hell, "furies" could simply imply a level of mental torment that ordinary people cannot imagine.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 515.</b> An accepted Latinate construction allows a "with" to be understood: "With the voices mute and harp-strings still, Silence hovers." Urania ascends the altar-steps, swings the censer of burning incense with "illumined hands" (520) both lit by the flame and more generally enlightened, and bows to the Goddess Nature, from whom she now fully withdraws the veil she partly lifted in I, 165. Orthodox readers may wish to see Nature as the veil shrouding the divine truth of the Godhead, but the more straightforward reading is that Nature, fully understood, is herself the ultimate divine principle.</p>
