    <p>My dear Brothers,</p>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; You shall have the Papers. <a href="#six">[6]</a> <a name="sixa" id="sixa">I</a> lent the last to Dilke and he has not returned it--or rather I have been in Town two days gelding <a href="#seven">[7]</a> <a name="sevena" id="sevena">the</a> first Book [of <i>Endymion</i>] which is I think going to the Press today. It will not be in Quarto, nor shall I have my head therein.<a href="#eight">[8]</a> <a name="eighta" id="eighta">Taylor</a> on looking attentively through it has changed his Mind. I have got five pounds but these I owe him Brown and have been delaying these two or three days to give it him, I must owe him still. Perhaps this will do till Haslam sends you some. 10<sup>&#163;</sup> to M<sup>rs</sup> Bentley 10<sup>&#163;</sup> to Crip[p]s and the 5<sup>&#163;</sup> to Brown nearly swallowed up the Balance M<sup>r</sup> A<a href="#nine">[9]</a> <a name="ninea" id="ninea">gave</a> me. I understand about M<sup>r</sup> Fry and will speak to M<sup>r</sup> A about it. I am convinced now that my Poem will not sell. Hope, they say, so I will wait about three Months before I make my determination--either to get some employment at Home or abroad or to retire to a very cheap way of living in the Country. Haydon will take my Likeness all the same--but I think he will keep it--however we can get it engraved.</p>
    <p>Horace Twiss dined the other day with Horace Smith--now Horace Twiss has an affectation of repeating extempore verses--which however he writes at home. After dinner Horace T. was to recite some verses, and before he did he went aside to pretend to make on the spot verses composed before hand. While H. T. was out of the Room H. S. wrote the following and handed it about, when H. Twiss had done his spouting.</p>
    <blockquote>'What precious extempore verses are Twiss's<br/>
        Which he makes ere he waters, and vows as he pisses,<br/>
        'Twould puzzle the Sages of greece to unriddle<br/>
        Which flows out the fastest his verse or his piddle,<br/>
        And 'twould pose them as much to know whether or not<br/>
        His Piss or his Poems go quickest to Pot!<a href="#ten">[10]</a><br/></blockquote>
    <a name="tena" id="tena">I</a> wrote the following which has pleased Reynolds and Dilke beyond any thing I ever did. I was thinking of Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher and the rest who used to meet at the Mermaid in days of yore and to finish did this.<br/>
    <blockquote>Souls of Poets dead and gone<br/>
        What Elysium have ye known,<br/>
        Happy field, or mossy cavern<br/>
        Fairer than the Mermaid Tavern?<br/>
        &#160;&#160;&#160; Have ye tippled drink more fine<br/>
        Than mine host's canary wine;<br/>
        Or are fruits of Paradise<br/>
        Richer than those dainty pies<br/>
        Of venison. Oh! generous food!<br/>
        Dress'd as though bold Robin Hood<br/>
        Would, with his Maid Marian,<br/>
        Sup and bouze from Horn and Can.<br/>
        &#160;&#160;&#160; I have heard that on a day<br/>
        Mine Host's sign board flew away,<br/>
        Nobody knew whither till<br/>
        An Astrologer's old Quill<br/>
        To a Sheepskin gave the story:<br/>
        Says he saw ye in your glory<br/>
        Underneath a new old sign<br/>
        Sipping beverage divine,<br/>
        And pledging with contented smack<br/>
        The Mermaid in the Zodiac!<br/>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Souls of Poets dead and gone<br/>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Are the Winds a sweeter home,<br/>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Richer is uncellar'd Cavern<br/>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Than the merr[y] mermaid Tavern?<a href="#eleven">[11]</a><br/>
