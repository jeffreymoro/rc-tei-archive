<h2>THE DEVIL'S WALK</h2>
<h2>by Southey and Coleridge</h2>
</center>
<p>This on-line version of "The Devil's Walk" by Robert Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge was prepared as part of <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/index.html"><i>The Devil's Walk: A Hypertext Edition</i></a>, edited by Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat. An earlier version of this poem, entitled <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/devil.stc1799.html">"The Devil's Thoughts,"</a> was first published in the <i>Morning Post and Gazetteer,</i> 6 Sept 1799; this retitled and revised version, entitled "The Devil's Walk," is taken from <i>The Poetical Works of Robert Southey,</i> with a Memoir by Henry T. Tuckerman (Boston: Little, Brown, 1860, volume 3, pages 75-91). Southey first made the revisions in early 1827 and sent them in a letter dated 24 February 1827 to Grosvenor C. Bedford. In this hypertext, we also include <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/dev29vs35.html">Coleridge's 1829 and 1835 versions</a> of "The Devil's Thoughts" (in parallel frames).</p>

<h2>THE DEVIL'S WALK.</h2>
</center>
<center>ADVERTISEMENT.</center>
<p>A FTER the "Devil's Thoughts" had been published by Mr. Coleridge in the collection of his Poetical Works, and the statement with which he accompanied it, it might have been supposed that the joint authorship of that Siamese production had been sufficiently authenticated, and that no supposititious claim to it would again be advanced. The following extract, however, appeared in the "John Bull" of Feb. 14, 1830:--</p>
<p>"In the 'Morning Post' of Tuesday, we find the following letter:--</p>
<center>"'<i>To the editor of the Morning Post.</i></center>
<p>"'S IR,--Permit me to correct a statement which appeared in a recent number of the "John Bull," wherein it is made to appear that I have the means of settling this question, since I possess the identical manuscript copy of verses, as they were written by my uncle, the late Professor Porson, during an evening party at Dr. Beloe's.</p>

</tr>
</table>
<p>"We are quite sure that Mr. Porson, the writer of the above letter, is convinced of the truth of the statement it contains; but, although 'The Devil's Walk' is perhaps not a work of which either Mr. Southey or Mr. Porson need be very proud, we feel it due to ourselves to restate the fact of its being from the pen of Mr. Southey. If we are wrong, Mr. Porson may apply to Mr. Southey; for, although Mr. Porson's eminent uncle is dead, the poet-laureate is alive and merry.</p>
<p>"The lines--poem they can scarcely be called--were written by Mr. Southey one morning before breakfast, the idea having struck him while he was shaving. They were subsequently shown to Mr. Coleridge, who, we believe, pointed some of the stanzas, and perhaps added one or two.</p>
<p>"We beg to assure Mr. R. C. Porson that we recur to this matter out of no disrespect either to the memory of his uncle, which is not likely to be affected one way or another by the circumstance, or to his own veracity, being, as we said, quite assured that he believes the statement he makes: our only object is to set ourselves right." . . . .</p>
<p>"Our readers, perhaps, may smile at the following, which appears in yesterday's 'Court Journal:'--</p>
<p>"'We have received a letter, signed "W. Marshall," and dated "York," claiming for its writer the long-contested authorship of those celebrated verses which are known by the title of "The Devil's Walk on Earth," and to which attention has lately been directed anew by Lord Byron's imitation of them. There have been so many mystifications connected with the authorship of these clever verses, that, for any thing we know to the contrary, this letter may be only one more.'"</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>A week afterwards there was the following notice: "We cannot waste any more time about 'The Devil's Walk.' We happen to know that it is Mr. Southey's; but, as he is alive, we refer anybody who is not yet satisfied to the eminent person himself,--we do not mean the Devil, but the Doctor."</p>
<p>The same newspaper contained the ensuing advertisement: "On Tuesday next, uniform with Robert Cruikshank's 'Monsieur Tonson,' price one shilling: 'The Devil's Walk; a Poem, by Professor Porson.' With additions and variations by Southey and Coleridge. Illustrated by seven engravings from R. Cruikshank. London: Marsh and Miller, 137, Oxford Street; and Constable and Co., Edinburgh."</p>
<p>Professor Porson never had any part in these verses as a <i>writer;</i> and it is for the first time that he now appears in them as the <i>subject</i> of two or three stanzas written some few years ago, when the fabricated story of his having composed them during an evening party at Dr. Vincent's (for that was the original <i>habitat</i> of this falsehood) was revived. A friend of one of the authors, more jealous for him than he has ever been for himself, urged him then to put the matter out of doubt (for it was before Mr. Coleridge had done so); and, as much to please that friend as to amuse himself and his domestic circle, in a sportive mood the part which relates the rise and progress of the poem was thrown off, and that also touching the aforesaid professor. The old vein having thus been opened, some other passages were added; and so it grew to it present length.<br/>
