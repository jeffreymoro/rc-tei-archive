<h2>The Devil's Thoughts</h2>
<h3>by Coleridge and Southey</h3>
</center>
<br/>
<p>This text is from the <i>Morning Post and Gazetteer</i>, 6 Sept. 1799 (No. 9569), which went through various reprintings, but which represents the text of the poem as Shelley would have known it. However, we also include in this hypertext Robert Southey's 1827 revision of the poem, which he retitled <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/devil.rs1860.html">"The Devil's Walk"</a>, as well as Coleridge's <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/dev29vs35.html">1829 and 1835 versions (in parallel frames)</a>.</p>
