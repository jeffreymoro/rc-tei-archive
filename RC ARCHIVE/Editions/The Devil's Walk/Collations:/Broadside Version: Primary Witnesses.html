<p>This part of the editorial apparatus for P.B. Shelley's <i>The Devil's Walk</i> is slightly modified from the way it will appear in <i><a href="/editions/shelley/devil/CPPBS.html">The Complete Poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley</a></i>, edited by Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat and published by The Johns Hopkins University Press. Listed here are the primary variants from our <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/devilcol.html">critically edited text</a> of the <b>1812</b> broadside in the Public Record Office (<b>1812.PRO</b>). You can also browse the lists of comprehensive variants from either the <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/variantsb.html">broadside</a> or <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/variantsl.html">letter</a> versions as collated against other selected editions (the same lists of variants that can be reached directly from the critically edited text [broadside version] or the diplomatic text [letter version]).</p>
