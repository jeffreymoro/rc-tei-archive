    <h3><a name="Editorial" id="Editorial"> Brief Description of Edition: </a></h3>
    <p> <cite>The Complete Poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley</cite> is intended to provide critically edited texts of all the poems that Shelley released for circulation, accompanied in Supplements by drafts and verse fragments pertaining to these public poems. Following these will be diplomatic texts of all Shelley's known poetry left incomplete or unpolished at his death. </p>
    <p> The released poems will usually appear in the order in which Shelley transmitted them to their intended audiences: each finished poem or poetic volume will appear in a sequence based on the date that Shelley either submitted that version to a press for publication or (in the case of some poems containing sentiments reserved for his intimate circle) prepared a finished copy for perusal by the person(s) in his intended audience. These poems are being edited critically to represent, as accurately as the surviving evidence permits, the text that Shelley intended his first reader(s) to see at the time he released them. We try to correct errata in Shelley's manuscripts and first editions, whether or not these were later noted by the poet himself, as well as attempt to uncover and extirpate errors of the press and later editorial emendations that reflect the judgment of later times and other consciousnesses, including Mary W. Shelley's. </p>
