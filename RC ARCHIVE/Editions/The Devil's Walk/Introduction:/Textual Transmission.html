<p>Though W. M. Rossetti, R. Garnett, Mac-Carthy, and Dowden had earlier made copies and published excerpts from <b>Shelley</b>'s letters to <b>Elizabeth Hitchener</b>, that correspondence, including his letter of ?16 January 1812 containing the early draft of<i><b>The Devil's Walk</b></i>, was first published in full by T. J. Wise in 1890 (see De Ricci 105, 112). Thus the public's first knowledge of <i><b>The Devil's Walk</b></i> came when Rossetti, alerted by someone at the <b>Public Record Office</b> to the <b>Shelley</b> materials there, published the text of the <b>1812</b> broadsheet and its accompanying letters in <i>Fortnightly Review</i> for January 1871 (n.s., IX [XV of full sequence], no. xlix, 67-85). H. B. Forman, after checking the text at the <b>Public Record Office</b>, included <i><b>The Devil's Walk</b></i> in his edition of <i>1876-77</i> (IV, 371-77). Though Rossetti accepted several of Forman's corrections in <i>1878</i> (III, 371-76), he retained much of his own revised punctuation and orthography, rather than returning to that of <b>1812</b>. Rossetti's most important innovation was the addition of quotation marks around <b>lines 45-79</b>, which embody his insight that these seditious lines were meant to be Satan's own words, thereby allowing <b>Shelley</b> to evade prosecution by claiming that the attacks on the Regent are presented as being from the lips of the Father of Lies.<br/>
