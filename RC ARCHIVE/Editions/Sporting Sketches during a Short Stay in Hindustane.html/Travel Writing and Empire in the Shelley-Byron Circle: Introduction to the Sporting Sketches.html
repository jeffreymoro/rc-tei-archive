                <p>This online edition presents for the first time, in its entirety, Edward Ellerker
                    Williams's travel journal to India, entitled "Sporting Sketches during a Short
                    Stay in Hindustane." Williams is best known to historians as the friend who
                    drowned with Percy Shelley, and his travel narrative is interesting to us in
                    part because of his associations with Lord Byron and with the Shelleys.
                    Williams's travel notebook was widely circulated amongst these friends, and we
                    must assume that it helped to shape the conversations about India and the East
                    that took place amongst these literary figures. However, in addition to
                    supplying one of the textual contexts of Romanticism, the "Sporting Sketches" is
                    also interesting for what it reveals about attitudes toward the travel genre and
                    its relationships to imperialism, science, and plagiarism in the early
                    nineteenth century.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The relationship between travel writing and strategies of imperial expansion has
                    been the subject of sustained scholarly attention over the last decade, and we
                    now know a great deal about the ways in which its rhetorical conceits of
                    scientific objectivity and disinterested observation are articulated within
                    these popular texts.<a
                        href="#1">[1]</a> Mary
                    Louise Pratt, in particular, has examined how the discourse of natural history
                    is brought to bear on the processes of imperialism, arguing that scientific
                    travel narratives frequently employ a "narrative of 'anti-conquest,' in which
                    the naturalist naturalizes the bourgeois European's own global presence and
                    authority" (<i>Imperial Eyes</i> 28).<a
                        href="#2">[2]</a>
                    Williams's travel notebook is a vivid example of how persuasive and familiar
                    these strategies were to Romantic-era readers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Embedded within Williams's Indian journal is a series of scientific discourses
                    that participate in an encyclopedic effort to catalog and to systematize, with a
                    naturalist's eye, the Eastern races, culture, and geography, and the whole is
                    presented as a documentary account. At moments in the text, Williams's impulse
                    to catalog is overt, as when he offers the measurements of a lion and tiger or
                    when he references current phrenological literature and records corroborating
                    details. However, even in its more narrative moments, his journal continues to
                    employ the strategies of a naturalist, as he stealthily investigates the harem,
                    in order to expose its curious customs, and as he records the activities of the
                    "natives" preparing for a hunt. Written during a brief leave of absence from his
                    Indian commission in the British Army, the occasion for Williams's journal is,
                    both literally and figuratively, authorized by colonial administration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>While Williams's travel account, then, clearly illustrates the ways in which
                    Romantic exploration literature mobilized scientific discourses in the service
                    of imperialism, his work also demonstrates the impulse toward "anti-conquest"
                    that Pratt observes. Perhaps most tellingly, his narrative is inhabited by a
                    series of local "guides" who willingly reveal the East to him; by placing
                    himself in the role of the passive observer and the "natives" in the role of the
                    inquisitor, he disguises the real economic and social relationships at stake.
                    However, his travel account also performs an apologetic function that should be
                    read as part of an effort to justify his presence and that of British colonial
                    authority. A large section of his journal is concerned with providing an account
                    of Eastern history, which he characterizes with disgust as "little more than one
                    long, and dreadful narration of bloodshed, of treasons and assassinations"
                        (<i>MS</i> 22). His point, throughout, is to illustrate that India had
                    always been ruled by cruelty and despotism, under a succession of rulers from
                    Tamerlane and Aurengzebe to Nadir Shah. Part of what this history suggests is
                    the comparative benevolence of British colonial rule, justified by the inability
                    of the native Indians to govern themselves rationally. Indeed, Williams's
                    narrative incorporates particular details on two of Britain's most celebrated
                    colonial representatives, governor-general Marquis Wellesley and resident
                    ambassador Charles Metcalfe, both of whom are represented as preserving Indian
                    culture; Metcalfe's efforts to restore the dilapidated gardens of Shalimar, in
                    particular, become an extended topic of discussion that points to the
                    benevolence and even advantages of British presence. More generally, the
                    attention drawn to Wellesley suggests that the governor-general's scandalous
                    administration (1798-1805) might have been one of the reasons that Williams felt
                    compelled to defend British activities; by the end of his administration,
                    Wellesley had not only expanded British control into central and southern India
                    by force but had placed his residents on the princely thrones of formerly
                    independent states, and his policies were the subject of extended political
                    debate in contemporary periodicals, including the <i>Quarterly</i> and
                        <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The considerable attention given to the gardens of Shalimar in the "Sporting
                    Sketches" also points to Williams's interest in tourism, which emerges as one of
                    the identifiably Romantic features of his account. The difference between travel
                    and tourism literature has not been adequately articulated, although each
                    engages different discourses and ideologies and although modern tourism might
                    properly be said to have emerged in the Romantic period. Whatever myriad
                    investments are expressed through the rhetoric of the "traveler" (ranging from
                    scientific naturalism to landscape aesthetics), the Romantic "tourist" (much
                    like the contemporary tourist) is concerned with the programmatic and mediated
                    repossession of cultural symbols for purposes of entertainment and leisure-class
                        status.<a href="#3"
                        >[3]</a> As is very frequently the case, in Williams's narrative both
                    discourses operate simultaneously, one expansively cataloguing the East and the
                    other limiting the markers of its culture. Thus, his journal describes
                    "sight-seeing" in India, particularly the monuments of Delhi, following an
                    entirely predictable itinerary through its mosque, audience hall, fortress, and
                    gardens.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This tension between traveler and tourist&#8212;or perhaps more generally, simply
                    the tension between the aims of original scientific observation and the
                    representation of stereotypical and fantastic cultural symbols&#8212;is what
                    characterized the Romantic travel narrative as a genre. Simultaneously invested
                    in documentary and in imaginative impulses, Romantic travel writing presented
                    its readers with competing rhetorical objectives, and its texts occupied an
                    unstable position between categories of knowledge. This perhaps accounts for
                    part of the reason the Romantics were so interested in travel writing as a
                    genre. Poised between fact and fiction and between history and romance, these
                    texts explore the same dichotomy that Romanticism was most invested in
                    reconciling&#8212;the relationship between the real and the imagined.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Certainly, the simultaneously documentary and fantastic elements of travel texts
                    were one of the reasons these works were so prone to plagiarism. As scholars
                    have demonstrated, Romantic writers routinely borrowed from works of travel,
                    and, although contemporary periodical reviewers frequently remarked upon these
                    "plagiarisms," in fact borrowing from travel texts was customary.<a
                        href="#4">[4]</a> The
                    issue is complex, and the assimilation of the representations of previous
                    travelers into a work accomplished several objects, ranging from gestures of
                    authenticity to increased sales figures. Whatever an author's individual
                    purpose, these borrowings were authorized by the rhetorical instability of the
                    genre itself, which claimed even its imagined representations as implicitly
                    authorless "records" of objective, documentary fact.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This tension between documentary and literary impulses is clearly evident in
                    Williams's travel journal, which assimilates materials from a range of other
                    writings on the Romantic East. In the "Sporting Sketches," Williams borrows from
                    some half dozen narratives and histories, including James Fraser's <i>History of
                        Nadir Shah</i> (London, 1742), James Rennell's <i>Memoirs of a Map of
                        Hindustane; or the Mogul Empire</i> (London, 1788), and W. Franklin's
                        <i>History of the Reign of Shah-Aulum</i> (London, 1798). Undeniably, his
                    borrowings are extensive and largely unacknowledged, and yet they need to be
                    read within the context of the more relaxed Romantic attitudes toward
                    appropriation from travel materials, which constituted part of the genre and its
                    popular appeal. As I demonstrate in my textual summary below, Williams's travel
                    journal was also the object of borrowing within the Shelley/Byron circle, and
                    its reemployment within literary texts associated with the coterie indicates the
                    degree to which intertextuality, travel writing, and the rhetoric of
                    "anti-conquest" shaped the context of literary Romanticism.</p>
                <p><b>Textual Summary</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edward Ellerker Williams had been lieutenant in the British Army in India, and in
                    his Indian journal he claimed to have recorded the events of 1-12 March 1814,
                    including a visit to the ancient ruins, mosques, and harems of Delhi, a stay in
                    Shalimar with Charles Metcalfe, big game sport in the jungles of Rhotuk, and
                    phrenological observations on the Eastern races and animal species. After
                    Williams's death on 8 July 1822, Edward John Trelawny, self-proclaimed corsair
                    and an intimate of the Shelley/Byron circle in Pisa, continued the entries with
                    his own accounts of adventures on the East Indian seas and of his readings in
                    contemporary travel literature. The Williams-Trelawny notebook, listed by the
                    Bodleian Library, University of Oxford, as MS Shelley adds.e.21, has received no
                    critical attention. Indeed, the edition of Williams's journal presented here
                    marks its first complete publication.<a
                        href="#5">[5]</a> However,
                    the notebook provides significant information concerning the travel narrative as
                    a Romantic genre, the processes of literary composition and exchange within the
                    Shelley/Byron circle, and the representations of orientalism in Romantic
                    culture.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Bodleian manuscript is a calf notebook in a red morocco box, and it presently
                    contains ii+254 of its original ii+266 pages.<a
                        href="#6">[6]</a> The
                    front pastedown end-paper of the notebook bears the stamp of an early
                    nineteenth-century bookseller and exporter, William Heather; the conjoint front
                    flyleaf contains Williams's illustrated frontispiece, inscribed with the title
                    "Sporting Sketches during a Short Stay in Hindustane by E.W."<a
                        href="#7">[7]</a> The
                    watermark BUDGEN | 1804 | appears both on this initial bifolium and on the
                    bifolium paginated 243/4 and 257/8. The notebook poses several editorial
                    problems. Its current pagination, which predates the Bodleian's 1961
                    acquisition, is especially difficult.<a
                        href="#8">[8]</a> The back
                    end-paper and the front flyleaf are both paginated, as are loose pages that do
                    not properly belong to the manuscript; several loose leaves belonging to the
                    seventh quire were paginated out of their proper order. Finally, the absence of
                    six leaves from the notebook appears not to have been noticed.<a
                        href="#9">[9]</a> These
                    codicological concerns are compounded by the difficulty of Trelawny's text. His
                    subject matter shifts quickly and varies widely, ranging from lucid narrative
                    accounts to impossibly elliptical passages. Legibility and syntactical
                    incoherence frequently are problems in the latter part of the manuscript. There
                    are a number of internal contradictions, especially in regard to dates and other
                    factual information, and, finally, Trelawny's reputation as an untrustworthy
                    narrator is well known.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The notebook can be considered in four sections. The first section, comprising
                    manuscript pages 3-115, contains Edward Williams's Indian travel journal and is
                    the section of the notebook published in the present <i>Romantic Circles</i>
                    edition. The entries are dated early March 1814. His narrative includes an
                    account of Delhi's mosques, palaces, and inhabitants, excerpts from Alexander
                    Dow's <i>History of Hindustane</i> (London, 1770), a description of Metcalfe's
                    residence at Shalimar and of Lieutenant Fraser's zoological gardens, detailed
                    narratives of hawking and of hunting lions and tigers in Rhotuk, and discussions
                    of comparative anatomy. Pages 117-122 are written in a second hand, and they
                    contain the drafts of a poem on lion hunting and an account of a social event,
                    possibly a ball at Mrs. Beauclerc's residence in 1822.<a
                        href="#10">[10]</a> On
                    page 122 the notebook has been turned upside-down, and the inverted script of
                    this third section continues through page 148. These entries contain a
                    discussion of the nature of poetry, reading notes from contemporary works of
                    travel literature, thoughts on the English character supplemented by
                    phrenological observations on various human races, and an excerpt from the
                        <i>Courier</i>'s 1832 review of Trelawny's <i>Adventures of a Younger
                        Son</i>. Although the handwriting of the third section is not obviously the
                    same as the earlier script, both can be positively identified as Trelawny's.<a
                        href="#11">[11]</a> Pages
                    149-257 continue in the third hand, but the position of the manuscript has been
                    righted (with the exception of page 181). This final section includes lists of
                    Persian and Hindi vocabulary, two passages identified by William St. Clair as
                    excerpts of 1828 letters from Claire Clairmont and Mary Shelley to Trelawny, an
                    account of Percy Shelley's genius, of the events in Italy before Shelley's
                    death, and of Shelley's opinion of the critics and of Leigh Hunt's poetry, some
                    notes on Eastern travels and fragmentary translations from Persian poems, and an
                    extensive account of Mauritius and adventures on the high seas as a privateer.<a
                        href="#12">[12]</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A typed insert included with the Bodleian manuscript (<i>MS</i> 1a) mistakenly
                    suggests that Williams's wife, Jane, is the author of the latter sections of the
                        manuscript.<a href="#13"
                        >[13]</a> The events recorded in this part of the notebook are military,
                    scientific, and literary in nature, and its discussion of certain sexual matters
                    makes female authorship improbable. The additional reference to "Mrs. Williams"
                    in the third person, in the account of Shelley's fearful vision at Lorenza,
                    seems to exclude Jane particularly. Trelawny's authorship can be confirmed (and
                    Jane's discounted) through handwriting comparisons, but Trelawny also provides
                    ample evidence of his personality and prejudices throughout the text. His
                    disdain for bluestockings, for example, is well known, and the sexualized
                    diatribe against rusty spinsters "in want of being used," "libidinous old
                    matrons," and "blues" of all sorts (<i>MS</i> 121) certainly doesn't belong to
                    Jane Williams. In fact, the contents of the latter part of the manuscript are
                    consonant with Trelawny's knowledge and interests, and the entire manuscript
                    seems to have functioned as his draft notebook for what became the <i>Adventures

                    initial section of the manuscript, and Edward John Trelawny is the author of the
                    remainder.</p>

                <p>Edward Williams was born in India on 22 April 1793 and, apart from a brief
                    education at Eton and a few years of service in the Royal Navy, resided in the
                    East until his retirement at half-pay from the Eighth Dragoons on 28 May 1818.<a
                        href="#14">[14]</a> The
                    events recorded in the Bodleian journal occurred during this period of residence
                    and travels in India. Presumably, this notebook is the one referred to by the
                    Williamses and the Shelley circle as the "Indian Journal." After the deaths of
                    Williams and Shelley, Williams's journal came into Trelawny's keeping. Although
                    in September 1822 Jane Williams wrote to Mary Shelley asking her to remind
                    Trelawny "to send with my things, Edwards [sic] Indian Journal" (<i>Maria
                        Gisborne</i> 164), he seems to have retained possession of the notebook.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Bodleian notebook is an important document for biographical and literary
                    studies of the Italian circle in at least two respects. First, its central
                    relationship to the orientalist works published by the minor figures surrounding
                    Percy Shelley and Lord Byron provides a means of assessing the involvement of
                    the Pisan circle in Eastern questions of the day. Second, the origins of
                    Williams's material and the manner in which it is put into use offers a point of
                    inquiry from which to consider the function of the travel journal in Romantic
                    print culture and the environment of literary exchange and appropriation in
                    which both Percy Shelley and Byron composed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The circulation of Williams's journal and the patterns of assimilation and
                    exchange that it reveals are complex. Williams's own construction of the journal
                    as a scientific account and "documentary" record of Indian hunting practices
                    implicitly authorizes Trelawny's and Medwin's reemployment of his materials
                    within their own self-consciously "literary" projects. Yet, at the same time,
                    the "Sporting Sketches" functions as a highly constructed (if not entirely
                    successful) work of "fictional" travel narration, which itself borrows freely
                    from other (Western) accounts of Moghul India in its representations. Williams's
                    journal problematizes the distinctions between fact and fantasy, popular and
                    literary, and source and product in ways that will prove important for
                    understanding Byron's and Percy Shelley's relationship to travel materials and
                    the representational instability that characterized the genre.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the first instance, Williams seems to have intended for his travel journal to
                    be used as a source of raw material, presenting his text as a simple record of
                    fact, apparently unmediated by literary forms of representation. In many
                    instances, his narrative engages consciously scientific discourses. For example,
                    there are obviously documentary objectives to his detailed descriptions of
                    natural scenery and sport hunting in Rhotuk, which reference current
                    phrenological literature and record corroborating details. Williams's scientific
                    observations, although brief, are powerful&#8212;some notations on the
                    physiognomical differences between the lion and the tiger and several
                    phrenological anecdotes, providing evidence that "established the thickness of a
                        <u>blackfellow's</u> skull and proves Lavater's assertion" (<i>MS</i> 72-3,
                    Williams's emphasis). The journal seems to have been composed with an eye toward
                    establishing a "scientific" record of the East, despite the personal nature of
                    the events.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Williams may also have been the first person to use this notebook as a source of
                    material, when writing his encyclopedia article on travels in the Near East.
                    Frederick Jones has suggested that it is from the Indian journal that Williams
                    took the account of capturing hyenas in India, which he published in 1820 in the
                        <i>Biblioth&#232;que universelle des Sciences, Belle-lettres, et Arts</i>,
                    under the title "Extrait d'un Journal de chasses pendant un s&#233;jour dans
                    l'Inde" (<i>Maria Gisborne</i> 14). The editorial note included with Williams's
                    article, which indicates that the material was extracted from a hunting journal,
                    seems to confirm Jones's suggestion that the two texts are connected, but the
                    Bodleian notebook, unfortunately, does not contain an account of hyena
                    hunting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Although it cannot be positively established, several factors indicate that the
                    Bodleian manuscript may be Williams's incomplete copy of a more extensive
                    sporting journal. After all, Williams used only a small portion of the notebook,
                    and its contents cover only a brief part of his travels in India. There are few
                    errors and very little evidence of revision. Williams titled each page that he
                    wrote and neatly lined-in headers and margins for twenty-four more pages than he
                    eventually used. Moreover, the marked similarity between the subjects and the
                    titles of the <i>Biblioth&#232;que</i> article and of "Sporting Sketches"
                    suggests that they were viewed as related projects. Most importantly, the
                        <i>Biblioth&#232;que</i> article specifies that the essay was taken from a
                    hunting journal with contents extraordinarily similar to the Bodleian
                    manuscript; as the editor writes: "Il [Williams] a bien voulu nous offrir de
                    nous faire part de divers morceaux curieux tir&#233;s du journal de ses chasses
                    dans l'Inde, principalement de celles du lion et du tigre, contre lesquels on
                    employes les &#233;l&#233;phants" ("Journal de chasses" 387, n. 1). This
                    characterization accurately and quite specifically describes the central
                    narrative of "Sporting Sketches." Further, Williams indicates in the article
                    that this curious piece of natural history that he is reporting occurred, as in
                    the case of the Bodleian journal, while he was in the service of "mon
                    r&#233;giment (le 8e de dragons legers)" ("Journal de chasses" 388). The
                    relatively narrow dates of Williams's service as an officer in the Eighth
                    Dragoons (1813-1818) and the apparently identical subjects of these "two"
                    journals indicate that the <i>Biblioth&#232;que</i> article may be an excerpt
                    from a longer, draft version of this Indian journal.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The possible relationship between these "two" hunting journals is most strongly
                    suggested, however, by the presence of several loose leaves found in the
                    Bodleian notebook, in which Williams describes his hyena-hunting expedition in
                    India. Listed by the Bodleian as MS Shelley adds.c.12, these notes were removed
                    from Williams's notebook and catalogued separately, but their original placement
                    in the Indian journal indicates a clear connection between these materials.<a
                        href="#15">[15]</a> These
                    notes are, of course, closely related to Williams's <i>Biblioth&#232;que</i>
                    article, which offers an expanded and more polished version of precisely the
                    same events. This suggests that the Indian journal may have existed, either
                    textually or conceptually, in a more complete form.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Trelawny's section of the notebook is difficult to follow and does not sustain
                    the lucid narrative that characterizes Williams's account, although it
                    participates in the same effort to represent fantasy as simple fact. Although
                    the notebook is interspersed with drafts of poems and personal correspondence,
                    the bulk of Trelawny's journal records his reading notes on contemporary travel
                    narratives and phrenological studies and his own observations on natural history
                    and racial characteristics. These observations initially take the form of a
                    travel account, but, as Trelawny's journal progresses, it becomes increasingly
                    difficult to read the manuscript as the documentary narrative it purports to be.
                    By page 199, although entries are often given dates or headings, the
                    descriptions do not make any geographical sense, and the chronology becomes
                    impossible. For example, on 15 September 1824, Trelawny records being in Moscow
                    (or perhaps aboard a ship called the "Moscow"); a paragraph later, he is
                    describing Ceylon and, in succeeding entries, Delhi, the Himalayas, Calcutta,
                    and Guzerat. The next dated entry describes sailing off the coast of Mauritius
                    in 1810, followed by records of Bengal, and then back to Madagascar. Although
                    this part of the manuscript can certainly be dated after Williams's own entries
                    of 1814, Trelawny cites a second 1810 date; with this entry it becomes apparent
                    that Trelawny has been using the travel journal as a narrative device. The
                    population of Mauritius, he records, "in 1810 is said to have been only
                    20-000&#8212;[it] is now near 80" (<i>MS</i> 223), a clear indication that
                    Trelawny is writing at a date significantly later than 1810. Thus, although many
                    of Trelawny's entries read as the present tense observations of a traveler
                    turned naturalist, the section of his journal from pages 199-243 is more
                    profitably viewed as a series of "observations" written within the fictional
                    framework of a travel journal.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The improbably fantastic events that Trelawny describes soon lead the wary reader
                    to suspect that his observations have only the most casual relationship to
                    historical reality and an intimate relationship to the <i>Adventures of a
                        Younger Son</i>. He records, for instance, being in the privateering service
                    of "Gen. de R." (<i>MS</i> 201), in the course of which he "saves" an Arab
                    maiden (who does not remain a maiden for long and soon "brings forth an heir on
                    board," (<i>MS</i> 202), hunts lions with native princes, plunders ships, and
                    quells rebellions. These same events, and the earlier erratic travels all over
                    the East Indies, comprise a condensed version of the plot line of the
                        <i>Adventures</i>. In fact, it seems that the entire final section of
                    Trelawny's journal (<i>MS</i> 149-257), which contains plot sketches, outlines,
                    and various researches, as well as the fictional travel narrative sequence, was
                    used as a draft notebook for the <i>Adventures</i>. There are many striking
                    correspondences: Trelawny's vocabulary lists reappear in the mouths of fictional
                    natives, and the fragmentary translations from Persian poetry in the notebook
                    are quoted by the narrator's Eastern lover. In the manuscript, Trelawny even
                    illustrates the orang outang scene that was to appear in the <i>Adventures</i>,
                    sketching a crude dwelling and its inhabitant, with the caption "Orang Outangs
                    dwelling at Borneo Junglee [sic] admee" (<i>MS</i> 203). The verbal equivalent
                    of this image appears toward the end of the <i>Adventures</i>, where this native
                    man's dwelling is described as "a shelter under a remarkably thick and beautiful
                    tree covered with white blossoms [...] a neat hut, built of canes wattled
                    together" (<i>Adventures</i> 300). Interspersed with reading notes, working
                    drafts, and reminiscences, the Bodleian notebook reveals the range of personal
                    and textual resources that Trelawny drew upon when composing the
                        <i>Adventures</i>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>However, Trelawny's adoption of Williams's notebook also attests to his
                    willingness to appropriate materials for his project from other places. The
                        <i>Adventures</i> is full of material "borrowed" directly, often word for
                    word, from Williams's travel journal. Trelawny uses Williams's material, it
                    seems, to create verisimilitude for his own conventionally exoticized travel
                    narrative by saturating the text with detailed, documentary observations,
                    implicitly treating the "Sporting Sketches" as a scientific and factual record.
                    The majority of the passages taken from Williams's "Sporting Sketches" describe
                    local customs or natural history; Trelawny reemploys Williams's descriptions of
                    hawking, hunting, and of Delhi's haunted ruins, as well as a number of details
                    concerning local practices. For example, Trelawny's entire account in the
                        <i>Adventures</i> of lion and tiger hunting in Rhotuk owes a great deal to
                    Williams's journal, as one brief instance can effectively illustrate: Trelawny's
                    narration of the manner in which "De Ruyter, with as much coolness as if he had
                    been pigeon-shooting, put a rifle to its [the lion's] ear, and almost blew its
                    head off" (<i>Adventures</i> 318) is immediately recognizable as another version
                    of the lines in which Williams describes how "Fraser with all the coolness that
                    marks his character . . . placed a double-barrell'd rifle to her head, which was
                    nearly blown off" (<i>MS</i> 106-7). Significantly, these borrowed scenes are
                    typically violent, and Trelawny's revisions often make them more graphically
                    brutal.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>While the entire Bodleian manuscript was adopted as Trelawny's draft notebook for
                    the <i>Adventures</i>, Thomas Medwin had already used Williams's Indian journal
                    for background material several years earlier, when composing <i>Oswald and
                        Edwin</i> and "Sketches in Hindostan." According to Medwin, "Williams and
                    myself had hunted the tiger in another hemisphere [and] had been constant
                    correspondents in India."<a
                        href="#16">[16]</a>
                    Although big game sport hunting may have been a joint adventure, the description
                    of this event, which appears in both versions of Medwin's poems, is clearly
                    Williams's, and several of the images are taken directly out of the Williams
                    notebook. According to H. Buxton Forman, "one gathers that Medwin's description
                    of a lion hunt in 'Sketches' . . . was taken from a letter written to him by
                    Edward Williams, who, and not Medwin, seems to have witnessed the hunt" (<i>Life
                        of Shelley</i> 500). If Williams sent such a letter, its contents were
                    intimately connected to the Bodleian journal; Medwin's description of the line
                    formation of the elephants during the hunt, the appearance of the tiger, and the
                    surrounding vegetation, stench, and ruins are all available in Williams's
                    notebook. For example, where Williams describes "five sporting Elephants with
                    Howdahs . . . follow'd by seven others" (<i>MS</i> 64), all "ranged in a firm
                    line" for the "order of battle" (<i>MS</i> 66), Medwin writes, in <i>Oswald and
                        Edwin</i>: "Twelve stately Elephants a front combine / In mimic war&#8212;a
                    formidable line! / Unhowdahed all save five" (<i>Oswald</i> 17). This moment
                    reflects just one of several instances in which Medwin's text becomes a poetic
                    rendition of Williams's journal.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This quiet assimilation of Williams's material into Medwin's oriental poetry is
                    later half-acknowledged, when the "Sketches in Hindoostan" are reworked into
                    Medwin's "biographical" travel memoir, <i>The Angler in Wales</i> (1834). In
                    this work, Medwin clearly identifies Williams as the source for some of his
                    information on Indian hunting, claiming in one instance that: "It was from
                    Williams's description...I wrote, almost in his own words, the following lines"
                        (<i>Angler</i> 264) from the "Sketches in Hindoostan." Yet, much of
                    Williams's material, including the extended account of the hyena hunt that he
                    had published for the <i>Biblioth&#232;que universelle</i>, is presented as the
                    narrator's own experience of the East. This inconsistency of attribution is
                    itself suggestive. Acknowledgement of borrowing emerges as more or less
                    incidental, and, significantly, neither the citation nor the concealment of
                    one's travel sources seems to have been at issue in this climate of exchange and
                    appropriation, apparently because as avowedly "documentary" records these travel
                    accounts were viewed more as "materials" than as "texts."</p>

                <p>Medwin had also turned repeatedly to Williams's notebook for material when
                    composing his explanatory notes to accompany <i>Oswald and Edwin</i> and the
                    "Sketches in Hindoostan." In these notes, the borrowing is the most direct,
                    often corresponding word for word. For example, Medwin's observation that "It is
                    a religious custom observed by the natives to burn off the whiskers of the dead
                    Lion or Tiger; lest they should be preserved and administered in the nature of
                    poison" (<i>Oswald</i> 43, n. 38) differs from Williams's account of this same
                    superstitious practice only in the exclusion of particular details. Williams,
                    for example, specifies the method in which the poison is said to be
                    administered&#8212;the whiskers are "chopp'd up, and taken with a little water"
                        (<i>MS</i> 74). Significantly, Percy Shelley's critical interest in Medwin's
                    poems was focused specifically on these notes; whether he was conscious of the
                    fact that they were borrowed from Williams's notebook or not, Shelley also read
                    sections of the Indian journal.<a

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>These borrowings from Williams's journal and its circulation among the Italian
                    circle are significant in at least three respects. First, the borrowings from
                    Williams's notebook confirm that Romantic travel narratives were employed as
                    sources of material&#8212;particularly of a scientific character&#8212;for other
                    works designated as literary. This pattern of circulation suggests that travel
                    journals, although highly rhetorical and imaginative, were not viewed as
                    fictional projects, but as a species of oriental scholarship and documentation.
                    Second, this particular set of texts raises the question of plagiarism within
                    the context of the Shelley/Byron circle. The obvious exchanges of materials,
                    without either acknowledgment or, by all indications, hostility, suggest that we
                    may need to revise our idea of what constitutes plagiarism in the Romantic
                    period, at least in respect to travel narratives. "Literary" works were given
                    considerable license to borrow from "popular" publications, and plagiarism
                    constituted only a failure to borrow successfully. This sort of reemployment of
                    travel material was endemic in the early nineteenth century, and plagiarism was
                    not limited to friends' private journals. In light of Byron's recurring troubles
                    with charges of travel plagiarisms during the Italian years, the manner in which
                    the contents of Williams's notebook were disseminated suggests that these minor
                    figures and the open exchanges among their orientalist projects reflect
                    important aspects of the intellectual environment in Italy. Finally, the
                    notebook records significant information on the orientalist discourses produced
                    in the midst of the Italian circle and on the complex political climate in which
                    Byron and Shelley composed. These various orientalist projects and Williams's
                    Indian journal functioned as sources of entertainment within the circle at
                    large, and Shelley, in particular, gave both care and criticism to the authors.
                    A certain tolerance and even enthusiasm for the British colonial project
                    characterizes both Williams's and Trelawny's notebooks and, it seems, the
                    interests and literary endeavors of the Byron/Shelley circle at Pisa.</p>

        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="7"> </a>7</sup> This stamp on the notebook advertises
            William Heather's establishment at 157 Leadenhall Street, London. The listing of his
            navigation warehouse at this address can be confirmed from 1805-7. See <i>Holden's
                Triennial Directory for 1805, 1806, and 1807</i>. Although the Bodleian Library's
                <i>Summary Catalogue of Post-Medieval Western Manuscripts</i> identifies the
            illustrated frontispiece as Trelawny's work (II, 1151), this is almost certainly
            incorrect. Williams's sketches and watercolors in the Keats-Shelley Association
            collection (Bodleian Dep.b.159) resemble the illustrated title page of "Sporting
            Sketches" in several characteristic ways. The fine hatching of the ink design and the
            foliage patterns are particularly distinctive; most importantly, the title-page of the
            Bodleian manuscript suggests a formal training in drawing that Trelawny did not have. My
            thanks to Dr. Bruce C. Barker-Benfield for his assistance here and for his generous
            suggestions on other textual matters; this textual summary also owes much to the
            attentive eye of Professor Donald H. Reiman, whom I gratefully acknowledge; any errors
            are, of course, my own.<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="8"> </a>8</sup> The positive location of the Williams
            notebook after 1832 has not been established, although it is likely that Trelawny
            retained possession of the manuscript until his death in 1881. Donald H. Reiman notes
            that the journal emerges again in the 1920 H. Buxton Forman sale of eight of Williams's
            notebooks, and the journal was bequeathed to the Bodleian in 1961 by Sir John
            Shelley-Rolls. See <i>Shelley and His Circle: 1773-1822</i>, Kenneth Neill Cameron and
            Donald H. Reiman, eds., VI, 832.<br/>

        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="9"> </a>9</sup> Although the manuscript pagination is
            irregular, it has been retained for the sake of consistency in all quotations here. This
            pagination in the notebook appears to have been done by Sir John Shelley-Rolls, although
            certain additions were made to unnumbered blanks when the Bodleian Library acquired the
            manuscript. As it stands, the pagination in the manuscript begins on the front flyleaf,
            which contains Williams's illustrated frontispiece (<i>MS</i> 3) and an original blank
                (<i>MS</i> 4), to which has been added a lightly penciled aphorism concerning lions.
            Page 1a is a twentieth-century typed addition identifying the important contents of the
            manuscript; page 2a is a twentieth-century typed transcription, with several errors, of
            manuscript page 157. Pages 1b and 2b are blank. Separating Williams' and Trelawny's
            entries is a blank page 116, and the back end-paper has been numbered (<i>MS</i> 259).
            The first, fifth, and eighth leaves are missing from the seventh quire; offsets
            throughout this gathering also indicate that the leaf paginated 151/2 was numbered out
            of order and that it should be placed between pages 164 and 165. The eleventh and
            twelfth leaves are missing from the final quire, as is the back flyleaf.<br/>

                The Incurable Romancer</i>, suggests Mrs. Beauclerc's ball as a possible occasion
            (51).<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="11"> </a>11</sup> Both hands can be identified as Trelawny's
            on the basis of his correspondence with Mary Shelley (Bodleian Dep.c.510). Extant
            letters also confirm that neither Thomas Medwin nor Jane Williams are possible authors
            (Bodleian Dep.b.211 and Deps.c.518-519, respectively).<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="12"> </a>12</sup> St Clair's biography of Trelawny contains
            several brief transcriptions from the Bodleian notebook. Among these transcriptions are
            two passages that St Clair identifies as letters to Trelawny from Mary Shelley
                (<i>MS</i>, 153-4) and Claire Clairmont (<i>MS</i>, 155-6). St Clair suggests that
            the letters are responses to marriage proposals that Trelawny may have made to the two
            women in 1828. See <i>Trelawny</i>, 130-32. Shelley's and Clairmont's most recent
            editors seem to agree; Mary's letter is included in <i>Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft
                Shelley</i>, ed. Betty T. Bennett, II, 140; Claire's letter is available in <i>The
                Clairmont Correspondence</i>, ed. Marion Kingston Stocking, I, 258-9.<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="13"> </a>13</sup> This insert (<i>MS</i>, 1a) identifies the
            Williams notebook as "a record of Travel and Adventure in India and is partly in the
            hand of Williams and partly in his wife's hand. She was a sister of Gen. John Wheeler
            Cleveland of the Madras Army." Unable to divorce her brutal husband, John Johnson, Jane
            (n&#233;e Cleveland) lived with Williams as his wife from 1818 until his death.<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="14"> </a>14</sup> The largest part of the biographical work
            on Edward Williams has been done by Frederick L. Jones in his edition of Williams's
            1821-22 journal, <i>Maria Gisborne and Edward E. Williams: Shelley's Friends</i>, and by
            Donald H. Reiman in volumes V and VI of <i>Shelley and His Circle</i>. In several
            instances biographical accounts and dates disagree. Reiman suggests 28 May 1818 as the
            date of Williams's retirement and, in his recourse to Robert Murray's <i>History of the
                VIII King's Royal Irish Hussars, 1693-1927</i>, is probably working from the more
            reliable source. Jones suggests 30 December 1816 and refers his readers to Trelawny's
                <i>Records of Shelley, Byron, and the Author</i> (1878). Regardless, by 1819 Edward
            and Jane Williams had moved from England to the Continent, as Edward's private journal
            of that year attests (<i>Pforzheimer MS</i>, SC 525).<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="15"> </a>15</sup> According to the Bodleian Library's
                <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, these are "notes by Trelawney [sic] on the hyena, removed
            from 52624 [MS Shelley adds.e.21]. . . . Bequeathed by Sir John Shelley-Rolls, received
            1961" (II, 1152). The attribution of this work to Trelawny is clearly incorrect, as both
            the hand and the subject are distinctly Williams's. The manuscript is a single folded
            sheet, measuring 21.3 x 18.5 cm, with the watermark JW 1815 running length-wise. A
            transcription of adds.c.12 has been appended to this electronic edition.<br/>
