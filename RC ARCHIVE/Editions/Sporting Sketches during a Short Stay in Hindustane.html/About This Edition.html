    <p align="left"><a name="text" id="text"> </a><b>The Text</b>: This edition provides an introduction to Edward Williams's Indian travel journal, focusing on the role of exploration writing within the Shelley/Byron circle. Because the journal was circulated among the Shelley circle in Italy, Williams's journal is particularly relevant for our understanding of P.B. Shelley's attitudes toward India and empire. In addition to offering a consideration of the travel narrative within the Romantic cultural context, the introduction addresses the textual and historical concerns surrounding Bodleian MS Shelley adds.e.21 and its transmission within literary Romanticism. The edition includes the first complete edition of Williams's journal (including Bodleian MS Shelley adds.e.21), with complete editorial apparatus.</p>
