<p><i>Editorial Procedures:</i></p>
<p><i>Numbers in brackets [ ] at the beginning of each page break indicate the manuscript pagination; in all other cases, brackets indicate an editorial addition or deletion, typically notes. One point of confusion for modern readers may be Williams's use of the colon [:], which he uses as a modern author would employ a hyphen [-], both to indicate divisions in words interrupted by line breaks and to hyphenate compound nouns and adjectives. Throughout, I have retained the punctuation of the original MS, leaving spelling and punctuation irregularities unaltered; underscoring has also been reproduced as in the original. Cancellations in the manuscript have been indicated, when legible, by a line through the letters; when the cancellation cannot be read, I place arrow brackets [&lt; &gt;] with a cancellation line of the approximate length between them. Williams titled each page of his notebook in a header, and these have been represented, in italics, at the beginning of each page break.</i></p>

"Sporting Sketches during a Short Stay in Hindustane,"<br/>

March 1st, 1814.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>A long state of senseless<br/>
inactivity, made worse by<br/>
sickness both of frame and<br/>
mind strengthed the<br/>
desire I had for some<br/>
time nourished of revisit:<br/>
:ing England, and the war<br/>
on the Continent together<br/>
with the hopes that a<br/>
cold climate might<br/>
restore a constitution<br/>
evidently impair'd by a<br/>
<s>short</s> residence in India<br/>
determin'd me in this<br/>
resolution.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>Leave of absence was<br/>
easily procured through the<br/>
kindness of my friend<br/>
<br/>
[6] <i>Delhi</i><br/>
Colonel Westenra, and<br/>
as the snows on the<br/>
mountains had not<br/>
yet melted sufficiently to<br/>
render the Ganges com:<br/>
:fortably navigable I<br/>
set off on a visit to<br/>
Delhi, as well to pass a<br/>
few happy hours with a<br/>
much esteemed friend, as<br/>
to loiter away time at the<br/>
Imperial City.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>Delhi, the nominal<br/>
capital of all Hind&#246;stan<br/>
was once the pride of<br/>
Asia's Monarchs, but now<br/>
presents a strange mixture<br/>
of falling greatness, and<br/>
wretched poverty.<a href="#2">[2]</a> The<br/>
Palace still affords a<br/>
<br/>
[7] <i>Delhi</i><br/>
faint idea of its ancient<br/>
splendour; and that<br/>
little which does remain,<br/>
I was concerned to observe,<br/>
is allowed gradually to<br/>
decay, as many magnifi:<br/>
:cent edifices around<br/>
have done, into disregarded<br/>
ruin.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>Delhi is a city of<br/>
considerable antiquity.<br/>
Shah J&#235;han was, I believe<br/>
the first Emperor who<br/>
made it his residence, to<br/>
avoid it is said, the heats<br/>
of the City of Agra, indeed,<br/>
by some of the higher orders<br/>
of natives, Delhi, is better<br/>
known by the name of<br/>
Shah J&#235;hanaband, though<br/>
Indraput was its more<br/>
<br/>
[8] <i>Delhi</i><br/>
ancient name.<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/>
In its present state<br/>
it may be said to be<br/>
about seven miles in<br/>
circumference, the streets<br/>
in general extremely<br/>
narrow, and like all other<br/>
Eastern cities extremely<br/>
filthy.<a href="#4">[4]</a> To the left of the<br/>
Town as you approach<br/>
from the river from the<br/>
river Jumna, are the<br/>
remains of many splendid<br/>
palaces, with baths of<br/>
marble, the beautiful mosaic<br/>
work of which, has been<br/>
much more defaced by the<br/>
plundering <s>hand of</s> man,<br/>
[than] the mould'ring one of Time.<a href="#5">[5]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The shapeless heap of<br/>
<br/>
[9] <i>Ruins of the ancient City</i><br/>
ruin here, is incredible&#8212;<br/>
far as the eye can reach,<br/>
nothing presents itself but<br/>
desolation, and the toute<br/>
ensemble more resembles<br/>
the wreck of an overthrown<br/>
Empire than the destruction<br/>
of a City.&#8212;<a href="#6">[6]</a> I had once<br/>
occasion to pass through these<br/>
ruins at midnight&#8212;<br/>
Every thing around was<br/>
still&#8212;the moon shone un:<br/>
:usually bright, and as I<br/>
carefully wound with my<br/>
friend Fraser as a guide,<br/>
thro' the intricacies of this<br/>
vast wilderness, it awoke<br/>
no unpleasing reflection at<br/>
the instability of human<br/>
affairs&#8212;how fall'n these<br/>
<br/>
[10] <i>Goorjahs</i><br/>
monuments of kingly pride?&#8212;<a href="#7">[7]</a><br/>
Where is all the hum of<br/>
this once populous city?&#8212;<br/>
I confess I was not a little<br/>
pleased to view the glitt'ring<br/>
Lamps of the Town; for as<br/>
we had no <s>guide</s> guard, &amp;<br/>
being unarm'd should have<br/>
prov'd an easy prey to the<br/>
horde of robbers who infest<br/>
this dreary spot. These<br/>
Go&#246;rjahs as they are termed<br/>
may be considered as a<br/>
distinct race of beings from<br/>
the inhabitants of the City,<br/>
with whom they are at per:<br/>
:petual war.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Thro' the vigilance<br/>
of the police however they<br/>
are considerably diminished,<br/>
but these ruins still afford<br/>
<br/>
[11] <i>Mosques</i><br/>
a hiding:place to every<br/>
outcast villain, in which<br/>
Delhi&#8212;Imperial City!<br/>
abounds.&#8212;<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>Near these ruins there<br/>
still remain in tolerable<br/>
order, many superb mau:<br/>
:soleums, but the tomb of<br/>
the Emperor Hamai&#246;on is<br/>
most worthy notice&#8212; Of<br/>
this tomb, I perhaps had<br/>
heard too much in praise<br/>
of its beauty to be particu:<br/>
:larly struck by it, for I con:<br/>
:fess I was infinitely more<br/>
pleased with the Jumn&#228;<br/>
Mosjid, or principal mosque<br/>
of Delhi. The view from the<br/>
minarets of this mosque is<br/>
uncommonly grand&#8212; It is<br/>
situated nearly in the centre<br/>
<br/>
[12] <i>The Palace</i><br/>
of the City, and the surrounding<br/>
country flat and fertile to<br/>
the Eastward&#8212; to the West:<br/>
:ward ruinous and deserted,<br/>
with the winding and rapid<br/>
Jumna dividing, as it<br/>
were these strange extremes.<a href="#9">[9]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>I visited the Palace<br/>
one morning when the King<br/>
was at the Co&#246;tub:Minar<br/>
attending a religious cere:<br/>
:mony called the Moh&#252;rrum,<br/>
and all the rigidly:righteous<br/>
Muss&#252;lm&#228;ns had of course<br/>
accompanied him, more<br/>
thro' form than from any<br/>
devout motives, so that<br/>
the court seem'd quite de:<br/>
:serted.<a href="#10">[10]</a> Here then I had an<br/>
opportunity of looking around<br/>
unobserved, for I was only<br/>
<br/>
[13] <i>The Palace</i><br/>
accompanied by an old<br/>
Priest, who seem'd as anxious<br/>
to shew as I was sanguine<br/>
to observe these abodes of<br/>
Eastern Royalty. I saw<br/>
indeed&#8212;here Time and<br/>
civil wars have made sad<br/>
ravages, and it was dis:<br/>
:gusting to contemplate the<br/>
corruption and degeneracy<br/>
from those principals of<br/>
Monarchy which mark'd<br/>
the ancestors of this weak<br/>
man&#8212;Every thing around<br/>
appeared to be indolently<br/>
neglected, without even a<br/>
struggle to bear up against<br/>
the misfortunes which have<br/>
from time to time been<br/>
heaped upon this &lt;&#8212;&gt; now<br/>
<br/>
[14] <i>The Palace</i><br/>
degraded race of Timur.<br/>
A kind of cold gloom<br/>
pervaded my whole frame,<br/>
as I followed the old Priest<br/>
thro' the long and dark<br/>
galleries of this once mag:<br/>
:nificent court of Mog&#252;l S&#252;ltans.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>When we came to the<br/>
Audience Hall, the old<br/>
man exultingly pointed out<br/>
the separate beauties of this<br/>
superb chamber. It is<br/>
built after the Hind&#246;stanu<br/>
style of Architecture, much<br/>
resembling our ancient<br/>
Gothic structures, is of<br/>
highly polished white<br/>
marble supported by carved<br/>
square pillars of the same,<br/>
delicately gilded, and inlaid<br/>
<br/>
[15] <i>Audience Hall</i><br/>
with precious stones of<br/>
various colors, fancifully<br/>
arranged into wreaths of<br/>
flowers, medallions, and<br/>
birds of variegated plumage.<br/>
The ceiling appear'd to be<br/>
a persian carpet interwoven<br/>
with gold, and round the<br/>
arches was hung in festoons<br/>
a persian curtain, of<br/>
crimson and gold, presented<br/>
by Marquis Wellesley, and<br/>
only drawn in close durbar.<a href="#11">[11]</a><br/>
In the centre is erected a<br/>
Throne, or block of black<br/>
marble raised about two<br/>
feet from the floor, about<br/>
eight feet long and six<br/>
broad&#8212;the floor of white<br/>
marble, and over the whole<br/>
is spread a richly embroidered<br/>
<br/>
[16] <i>Audience Hall</i><br/>
persian carpet.<a href="#12">[12]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>While admiring this Fairy<br/>
Scene, the old man was<br/>
extremely eloquent in re:<br/>
:lating the brilliant abilities<br/>
of the statesmen of other<br/>
days&#8212;here said he where<br/>
we stand is the spot where<br/>
the old King Shah A&#252;lum<br/>
had his eyes put out.<br/>
and this continued he<br/>
as we entered a costly<br/>
bath (corresponding in<br/>
beauty with the chamber<br/>
we had just left) where<br/>
he was dragg'd and left<br/>
bleeding, not only to de:<br/>
:plore the loss of sight, but<br/>
to lament the loss of a<br/>
crown wrested from him, by<br/>
the hand of merciless sedition.<br/>
<br/>
[17] <i>The haram</i><br/>
From this chamber we pass'd<br/>
through another gallery, and<br/>
arrived at the Private Ap:<br/>
:partments, or, royal Zenanah,<br/>
where the old man begg'd in<br/>
vain I would not enter.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>&#8212;On I went (but without<br/>
my guide, who stood <s>mu</s><br/>
mumbling at the door)<br/>
pass'd a second room, and<br/>
came to one tolerably fur:<br/>
:nished; a third part of this<br/>
was divided by a crimson<br/>
curtain, (the much talked<br/>
of Purhd&#228;h) and peeping<br/>
behind, I discovered a<s>s</s><br/>
female as <s>ol</s> old and ugly<br/>
as age and debauchery could<br/>
make her, sitting cross:leggd<br/>
upon a mat near the bed,<br/>
<br/>
[18] <i>The haram</i><br/>
which had silver feet and<br/>
raised about a foot from<br/>
the ground, with a covering<br/>
of crimson and gold, and<br/>
a number of pillars of<br/>
the same stuff, with <u>beetle<br/>
boxes</u>, <u>uts-d&#228;ns</u>, and pigd&#228;:<br/>
:nis scattered about in all<br/>
directions &amp;.<a href="#13">[13]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The range of apartments<br/>
beyond this one brought very<br/>
forcibly to my mind, the<br/>
gloomy cells of a monas:<br/>
:tery, being destitute of all<br/>
finery, at least as far as<br/>
I could discover, and<br/>
seemd better intended for<br/>
those religious votaries,<br/>
whom bigotry and supersti:<br/>
:tion have doomed to the<br/>
cloister, than for the haram<br/>
<br/>
[19] <i>The haram</i><br/>
of an Eastern Monarch.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>Here the girls enjoy all<br/>
the comforts of close impris:<br/>
<s>on</s>:onment which Native<br/>
jealousy can impose, and<br/>
yet after all the supposed<br/>
security of iron:grated win:<br/>
:dows and brass doors<br/>
Intrigue has even found its<br/>
way through these, in defiance<br/>
of their strength. If such<br/>
precautions, together with a<br/>
most vigilant suspicion,<br/>
can effectually preserve<br/>
the chastity of Delhi's black:<br/>
:eyed maids, Heav'n knows,<br/>
they must be true to Delhi's<br/>
Lord&#8212;! but this is a Country<br/>
where points of this kind are<br/>
not over scrupulously observed<br/>
among Ladies, and 'tis even<br/>
<br/>
[ 20] <i>The haram</i><br/>
necessary &lt;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&gt;<br/>

<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>I retired from the curtain<br/>
a good deal disappointed, but<br/>
not without going to the<br/>
window at the end of the room<br/>
which overlooked the gardens<br/>
&#8212;On looking down I observed<br/>
several females old, and<br/>
young sitting &#225; conversatsione<br/>
immediately under me. I<br/>
<br/>
[21] <i>Nadir Sh&#228;h's Mosque</i><br/>
was soon discovered by the<br/>
younger ones, most of whom<br/>
with a wild laugh skipped<br/>
away, while the elder ones<br/>
more <u>modestly</u> drew their<br/>
doputtah (or veil) more<br/>
closely around. Fearful<br/>
of the alarm my intrusion<br/>
might occasion, I hastily<br/>
join'd and retreated with my<br/>
old friend, who was not<br/>
backward in rebuking<br/>
me. but the <u>silver</u> soon<br/>
allayed both his fear and<br/>
anger.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>On my way home I stop'd<br/>
at the Mosque of Nadir Sh&#228;h,<br/>
so called from his having been<br/>
convey'd to the top of one of its<br/>
minarets that he might the<br/>
better behold the massacre<br/>
<br/>
[22] <i>Dreadful Massacre</i><br/>
in 1739 in which above <u>One<br/>
Hundred Thousand</u> of the<br/>
inhabitants were slaughter'd.<a href="#15">[15]</a><br/>
This mosque is interesting<br/>
enough on account of its<br/>
antiquity, but not particularly<br/>
so on any other accounts.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>On my arrival at the<br/>
Residency I looked into the<br/>
History of this unfortunate<br/>
Country, which indeed is little<br/>
more than one long, and<br/>
dreadful narration of bloodshed,<br/>
of treasons and assassinations.<br/>
Take the following abridged<br/>
account of it from "Dow's<br/>
Hindo&#246;stan."<a href="#16">[16]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The first invader of this<br/>
country, India, whose ex:<br/>
:pedition is authentically re:<br/>
<br/>
[23] <i>History &amp;c</i><br/>
:corded, was the famous<br/>
Alexander of Macedon.<br/>
Zingis K'han also directed<br/>
his force thither in the year<br/>
1221, and the Emperor forsake<br/>
his Capital. Long before<br/>
Timur, or Tamurlane, descen:<br/>
:ded in the female line from<br/>
that conqueror, Mahommedan<br/>
princes had entered, made<br/>
conquests and established<br/>
themselves in India. Walid,<br/>
the sixth of caliphs named<br/>
Ommiades, who ascended the<br/>
throne in the 708 year of the<br/>
Christian ara, and the 90th<br/>
of the Hegira, made conquests<br/>
in India; so that the Kor&#228;n was<br/>
introduced very early into this<br/>
country.<a href="#17">[17]</a> Mahmoud son of<br/>
S&#235;hbegtechin, prince of Gazna<br/>
<br/>
[24] <i>History</i><br/>
the capital of a province sepa:<br/>
:rated by mountains from the<br/>
north:west parts of India, and<br/>
situated near Kand&#228;har, car:<br/>
:ried the Kor&#228;n with the sword<br/>
into <s>Persia</s> Hindo&#246;stan, in<br/>
the year One Thousand or<br/>
one thousand and two of the<br/>
Christian ara.<a href="#18">[18]</a> He treated<br/>
the Indians with all the<br/>
rigour of a conqueror, and<br/>
all the fury of a zealot, plun:<br/>
:dering treasures, demolishing<br/>
temples, and murdering idol:<br/>
:aters throughout his route.<br/>
The wealth found by him in<br/>
Hindoostan is represented to be<br/>
immense. The successors of<br/>
this Mahmoud are called the<br/>
dynasty of the Gaznadines, and<br/>
maintained themselves in<br/>
<br/>
[25] <i>History</i><br/>
a great part of the countries<br/>
which he had conquered in<br/>
India until the year 1155, or<br/>
1157, when Kosron Sh&#228;h, the 13th<br/>
and last prince, of the Gaz:<br/>
:naride tribe, was deposed by<br/>
Kussans Gaur&#239;, who founded<br/>
the dynasty of the Gaurides,<br/>
which furnished five princes,<br/>
who possessed nearly the same<br/>
dominions as their predecessors<br/>
the Gaznadines.<a href="#19">[19]</a> Sche&#228;bbedin,<br/>
the fourth of the Ganride em:<br/>
:perors during the life of his<br/>
brother and predecessor<br/>
Garathed&#239;n, conquered the king:<br/>
:doms of Moult&#228;n and Delhi<br/>
and drew from thence prodigious<br/>
treasures.<a href="#20">[20]</a> But an Indian who<br/>
had been rendered desperate<br/>
by the pollutions and insults<br/>
<br/>
[26] <i>History</i><br/>
to which he saw his god and<br/>
temples exposed made a vow<br/>
to assassinate Sch&#235;abeedin,<br/>
and executed it. The race<br/>
of Gaurides finished in the<br/>
year 1212, in the person of<br/>
Mahmond, successor and<br/>
nephew to Sche&#228;bbend&#239;n, who<br/>
was also cut off by the swords<br/>
of assassins.<a href="#21">[21]</a> Several <s>rel</s><br/>
revolutions followed 'till the<br/>
time of Tamerlane, who<br/>
entered India at the end of the<br/>
year 1398 descending more<br/>
terrible than all its former<br/>
inundations from the centre<br/>
of the northern part of the<br/>
Indian Caucasus. This<br/>
invincible barbarian, met<br/>
with no resistance sufficient<br/>
to justify, even by the Military<br/>
maxims of Tartars the many<br/>
<br/>
[27] <i>History</i><br/>
cruelties with which he mark'd<br/>
his way. But after an im:<br/>
:mense slaughter of human<br/>
creatures, he at length ren:<br/>
:dered himself Lord of an<br/>
Empire, which extended from<br/>
Smyrna to the banks of the<br/>
Ganges. The history of the<br/>
successors of Tamerlane, who<br/>
reign'd over Hindoostan with<br/>
little interruption more than<br/>
356 years- has been variously<br/>
represented; but all writers<br/>
agree; that they were magni:<br/>
:ficent and despotic princes,<br/>
and that they committed their<br/>
provinces to rapacious go:<br/>
:vernors, or to their own sons,<br/>
by which their empire was<br/>
often miserably torn in pieces.<br/>
At length the famous Au:<br/>
:rungz&#235;be, in the year 1667, tho'<br/>
<br/>
[28] <i>History</i><br/>
the youngest among many<br/>
sons of the reigning Emperor,<br/>
after defeating or murdering<br/>
all his brothers, mounted the<br/>
throne of Hindo&#246;stan, and<br/>
may be considered as the<br/>
real founder and legislator<br/>
of the Empire.<a href="#22">[22]</a> He was a<br/>
great and a politic prince,<br/>
and the first who extended<br/>
his dominion, though it<br/>
was little better than nominal<br/>
over the peninsula within<br/>
the Ganges, which is at pre:<br/>
:sent so well known to the<br/>
English. He liv'd so late as<br/>
the year 1707; and it is said<br/>
that some of his great officers<br/>
of state were alive in the year<br/>
1750.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>In 1713 four of his grand:<br/>
<br/>
[29] <i>History</i><br/>
:sons disputed the Empire,<br/>
which, after a bloody struggle<br/>
fell to the eldest, Manzold&#239;n<br/>
who took the name of Jeh&#228;nder<br/>
Sh&#228;h.<a href="#23">[23]</a> This prince was a<br/>
slave to his pleasures, and<br/>
was governed by his mistress<br/>
so absolutely, that his great<br/>
omrahs conspired against<br/>
him, and raised to the throne<br/>
one of his nephews, who struck<br/>
off his uncle's head. The<br/>
new Emperor whose name<br/>
was Furrusk'hs&#235;r was gov:<br/>
:erned and at last enslaved<br/>
by two brothers of the name<br/>
of Seyd, who abused their<br/>
power so grossly, that being<br/>
afraid to punish them publicly<br/>
he ordered them both to be<br/>
privately assassinated.<a href="#24">[24]</a> They<br/>
<br/>
[30] <i>History</i><br/>
discovered his intention, and<br/>
dethroned the Emperor, in<br/>
whose place they raised a<br/>
grandson of Aurungz&#235;be, by<br/>
his daughter a youth of 17<br/>
years of age, after imprisioning<br/>
and strangling Furrukhsir.<br/>
The young Emperor proved<br/>
disagreeable to the brothers,<br/>
and being, soon poisoned,<br/>
they raised to the Throne his<br/>
elder brother, who took the<br/>
title of Sh&#228;h J&#235;han.<a href="#25">[25]</a> The<br/>
rajahs of Hindo&#246;st&#228;n, whose<br/>
ancestors had entered into<br/>
stipulations, or what may<br/>
be called paeta conoenta,<br/>
when they admitted the<br/>
Mog&#252;l family, took the<br/>
field against the two<br/>
brothers, but the Latter were<br/>
<br/>
[31] <i>History</i><br/>
victorious, and Sh&#228;h J&#235;han<br/>
was put in tranquil possess:<br/>
:ion of the Empire, but died<br/>
in 1719. He was succeeded by<br/>
another prince of the M&#246;gul<br/>
race, who took the name of<br/>
Mohummed Shah, and enter'd<br/>
into private measures with<br/>
his great rajahs, for destroying<br/>
the Seyds, who were declared<br/>
enemies to Nizam al Mo&#246;luk,<br/>
one of Aurengzebe's favorite<br/>
generals.<a href="#26">[26]</a> Nizam it is said<br/>
was privately encouraged by<br/>
the emperor to declare him:<br/>
:self against the brothers,<br/>
and to proclaim himself<br/>
Soubah of the Deccan, which<br/>
belonged to one of the Seyds<br/>
who was assassinated by the<br/>
Emperor's order, and who<br/>
<br/>
[32] <i>History</i><br/>
immediately advanced to<br/>
Delhi to destroy the other<br/>
brother; but he no sooner<br/>
understood what had hap:<br/>
:pened, than he proclaimed<br/>
the Sult&#228;n Ibrahim, another<br/>
of the Mogul princes, Emperor.<a href="#27">[27]</a><br/>
A battle ensued in 1720 in<br/>
which the emperor was vic:<br/>
:torious. He is said to have<br/>
used his conquest with<br/>
great moderation, for he<br/>
remitted Ibrahim to the<br/>
prison from whence he had<br/>
been taken; and Seyd being<br/>
likewise a prisoner, was<br/>
condemned to perpetual<br/>
confinement; but the Em:<br/>
:peror took possession of his<br/>
vast riches. Seyd did not<br/>
long survive his confine:<br/>
:ment; and upon his death<br/>
<br/>
[33] <i>History</i><br/>
the Emperor abandoned him:<br/>
:self to the same course of<br/>
pleasures that had been so<br/>
fatal to his predecessors.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>As to Nizam, he became now<br/>
the great imperial General,<br/>
and was often employed<br/>
against the Mahrattahs,<br/>
whom he defeated, when they<br/>
had almost made them:<br/>
:selves masters of Agra and<br/>
Dehli. He was confirmed<br/>
to his soubahship, and was<br/>
considered as the first sub:<br/>
:ject in the Empire. Authors<br/>
however are divided as to<br/>
his motives for inviting<br/>
Nadir Sh&#228;h, otherwise Kouli<br/>
K'han, the Persian Monarch,<br/>
to invade Hindo&#246;stan. It<br/>
is thought that he had in:<br/>
:telligence of a strong party<br/>
<br/>
[34] <i>History</i><br/>
formed against him at Court,<br/>
but the truth perhaps is,<br/>
that Nizam did not think<br/>
that Nadir Sh&#228;h could<br/>
have success and at first<br/>
wanted to make himself<br/>
useful by opposing him.<br/>
The success &lt;&#8212;&gt; of Nadir Shah<br/>
is well known and the<br/>
immense treasure which<br/>
he carried from Hindo&#246;stan<br/>
in 1739. Besides those<br/>
treasures he obliged the<br/>
Mogul to surrender to him<br/>
all the lands to the west of<br/>
the rivers Attock and Sind,<br/>
comprehending the provinces<br/>
of Peyshor, Cabul, and<br/>
Gazna, with many other rich<br/>
and populous principalities,<br/>
the whole of them almost<br/>
equal in value to the<br/>
<br/>
[35] <i>History</i><br/>
crown of Persia itself.<a href="#28">[28]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The invasion cost the<br/>
Mogul empire Two hundred<br/>
thousand lives. As to the<br/>
plunder made by Nadir<br/>
Shah, some accounts and<br/>
those too strongly authen:<br/>
:ticated, make it amount<br/>
to the incredible sum of 2 H'd<br/>
&amp; Thirty one millions {231,000,000}<br/>
sterling! The most moder:<br/>
:ate say that Nadir's own<br/>
share amounted to con:<br/>
:siderably above seventy<br/>
millions. Be that as it<br/>
may, the invasion of Nadir<br/>
Shah, may be considered as<br/>
putting a period to the great:<br/>
:ness of the Mogul Empire in<br/>
the house of Timur. Nadir<br/>
however, when he had raised<br/>
all the money he could in<br/>
<br/>
[36] <i>History</i><br/>
Delhi, reinstated the Mogul<br/>
Mohummud Shah as the<br/>
sovereignty, and returned<br/>
into his own country. A<br/>
general defection of the pro:<br/>
:vinces soon after ensued,<br/>
none being willing to yield<br/>
obedience to a prince de:<br/>
:prived of all power to<br/>
enforce it. The provinces<br/>
to the north: west of the<br/>
Indus had been ceded to<br/>
Nadir Shah, who being<br/>
assassinated in 1747 Achmet<br/>
Abdallah, his treasurer, an<br/>
unprincipled man, but<br/>
possessed of great intrepidity<br/>
found means in the general<br/>
confusion occasioned by the<br/>
tyrant's death, to carry<br/>
off three hundred camels<br/>
loaded with wealth, whereby<br/>
<br/>
[37] <i>History</i><br/>
he was enabled, to put him:<br/>
:self at the head of an army<br/>
and march against Delhi<br/>
with fifty thousand horse.<a href="#29">[29]</a><br/>
Thus was the wealth drawn<br/>
from Delhi made the means<br/>
of continuing those miseries<br/>
of war, which it had at first<br/>
occasioned. Prince Achmet<br/>
Shah, the Mogul's eldest son,<br/>
and the visier, with other lea:<br/>
:ding men, in this extremity<br/>
took the field with eighty<br/>
thousand horse to oppose the<br/>
invader.<a href="#30">[30]</a> The war was car:<br/>
:ried on with various suc:<br/>
:cess, and Mohammed Sh&#228;h<br/>
died before its termination.<br/>
His son Achmet Shah, then<br/>
mounted the imperial throne<br/>
at Delhi: but the Empire<br/>
fell every day more into<br/>
<br/>
[38] <i>History</i><br/>
decay.<a href="#31">[31]</a> Abdallah erected<br/>
an independant kingdom<br/>
of which the Indus is the<br/>
general boundary.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The Mahrattahs, a<br/>
warlike nation of the south:<br/>
:western peninsula of India,<br/>
had before the invasion of<br/>
Nadir Sh&#228;h, exacted a chout<br/>
or tribute from the empire,<br/>
arising out of the revenues<br/>
of the province of Bengal,<br/>
which being withheld in con:<br/>
:sequence of the enfeebled<br/>
state of the empire, the<br/>
Mahrattahs became clam:<br/>
:ourous. The Empire began<br/>

torn to pieces by civil<br/>
wars, and groaned under<br/>
every species of domestic<br/>
misery. Achmet Shah<br/>
regned only seven years,<br/>
after which much disord:<br/>

in Hindoostan and the<br/>
people suffer'd great cala:<br/>

imperial dignity of Hindoostan<br/>
is vested in Shah Aulum<br/>
Zadah, who is universally<br/>
acknowledged to be a true<br/>
heir of the Tamerlane race;<br/>
but his pow'r is feeble; the<br/>
city of Delhi, and a small<br/>
territory round it, is all<br/>
that is left remaining of<br/>
the house and heir of Timur, who<br/>

of their fraternity, so have I<br/>
observed when schoolfellows<br/>
meet in remote parts of the<br/>
globe, they are irresistibly drawn<br/>
together from the herd of their<br/>
assembled countrymen, and<br/>
seem to claim, as a right a<br/>
certain attention from each<br/>
other; whence this feeling<br/>
springs I know not, unless<br/>
from the pleasure we derive<br/>
in going over with another,<br/>
the scenes of other days, but<br/>
so it was at Delhi, for the<br/>
resident Mr. Metcalfe no<br/>
sooner heard I was an<br/>

[42] <i>Shalimar</i><br/>
Etonian than I was invited<br/>
to his house at Shalimar.<a href="#33">[33]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>This splendid residence<br/>
at Shalimar, which signifies<br/>
Garden of Delight, is situated<br/>
about seven miles from<br/>
the City. The gardens were<br/>
laid out by the order of the<br/>
Emperor Sh&#228;h Jeh&#228;n, and<br/>
though not more than two<br/>
miles in circumference, are<br/>
said to have cost one<br/>
million sterling in rich &amp;<br/>
profuse decorations, and to<br/>
have been nine years in com:<br/>

it was are now to be seen,<br/>
nor indeed can imagination<br/>
well conceive what it could<br/>
have been, though within<br/>

the last two years Mr. Metcalfe<br/>
has not been unsuccessful<br/>
in his &lt;e&#8212;&gt; exertions to restore<br/>
some of its natural beauties.<br/>
Nearly in the centre of these<br/>
grounds he has erected a<br/>
villa, truly classical, and<br/>
this style of building, together<br/>
with the chaste architecture<br/>
of the outhouses, assist, very<br/>
forcibly to recal the one so<br/>
beautifully described by<br/>
Pliny, after whose model<br/>
the virtues of Mr. Metcalfe<br/>
seem moulded, and when<br/>
seated in his favourite room<br/>
that overlooked the grounds<br/>
I have often imagined he<br/>
presented no inadequate con:<br/>
:ception of that great and<br/>
good man. I staid here<br/>
<br/>
[44] <i>Shalimar</i><br/>
several days, seeing everything<br/>
that could interest, was<br/>
received with all possible<br/>
civility and magnificently<br/>
entertain'd.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>It was one evening that<br/>
I happened to be seated near<br/>
Fraser when our conversation<br/>
turn'd upon the subject of<br/>
Tiger hunting, and as I had<br/>
never seen any sport of the<br/>
kind, I was anxious to glean<br/>
every particular from so<br/>
able and experienced a nar:<br/>
:rator. I knew not at the<br/>
time we were conversing<br/>
whether my inquisitiveness<br/>
might not have been un:<br/>
:pleasant to him, as, however<br/>
willingly he gave answers to<br/>
all I asked yet he was so<br/>
<br/>
[45] <i>Leave Shalimar</i><br/>
backward in leading the sub:<br/>
:ject, that fearing to offend<br/>
I for some time suffer'd it<br/>
to decline into almost un:<br/>
:broken silence. At length<br/>
however, asking how long I<br/>
purposed staying at Delhi,<br/>
he hastily left the room, and<br/>
returning rather late, told me,<br/>
that having heard of some<br/>
game, if I would undertake<br/>
a trip to the jungles, and<br/>
accompany him home that<br/>
night, he would set:off for<br/>
Rhotuk the following mor:<br/>
:ning and endeavour to shew<br/>
me Sport.&#8212;<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>I took leave of Mr. Metcalfe<br/>
the following morning, and<br/>
proceeded to Fraser's house,<br/>
where every order was given<br/>
for the intended excursion.<br/>
<br/>
[46] <i>Preparations</i><br/>
Elephants, Horses, Tents and<br/>
indeed every thing on the<br/>
grandest scale, were dispat:<br/>
:ched &lt;&#8212;&gt; at day break<br/>
towards Rhotuk, and to me<br/>
who had not been accusto:<br/>
:med to such expedition, the<br/>
sight of so large a cavalcade<br/>
in motion, appeared the effect<br/>
of magic.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>However to allow time<br/>
for the camp equipage to<br/>
reach the appointed spot<br/>
it was necessary to remain<br/>
the whole of the next day at<br/>
Delhi, which was employed<br/>
by me (a perfect <u>griffin</u>) in<br/>
casting balls, and cleaning<br/>
guns, and during these ope:<br/>
:rations fighting in imagination<br/>
with every tiger in the upper<br/>

[47] <i>Fraser's Garden</i><br/>
provinces. In the evening<br/>
with a mind still harping on<br/>
this subject, and while wal:<br/>
:king with Fraser through<br/>
his extensive garden, my<br/>
astonishment, indeed, I can:<br/>
:didly confess my alarm, is<br/>
not so easily described as felt,<br/>
in having these scenes con:<br/>
:verted to strange reality; for<br/>
in walking thro' a wild and<br/>
beautiful shrubbery, and at<br/>
some distance from the house,<br/>
from behind a thick bush,<br/>
out sprung&#8212;&#8212; an uncommon<br/>
fine Tigress, and galloped<br/>
playfully by me to a small<br/>
patch of high Indian corn&#8212;<br/>
where she again couched down<br/>
and was again put up as<br/>
<br/>
[48] <i>Tame Tigers</i><br/>
we approached&#8212; I stopped<br/>
short, and looking earnestly<br/>
in Fraser's face, to discover<br/>
the meaning of all this, but<br/>
he sauntered on, eating some<br/>
fruit with the greatest un:<br/>
:concern&#8212; I certainly follow'd<br/>
but not without most cau:<br/>
:tious apprehension, which<br/>
he enjoyed for some time, but<br/>
soon laid aside by <s>his</s> in:<br/>
:forming me that she was <u>quite<br/>
harmless!</u>&#8212; He had two<br/>
others confined, that were<br/>
once allowed to roam at<br/>
large, but now grown ex:<br/>
:tremely savage. They had all<br/>
been deprived of their teeth<br/>
when very young, and their<br/>
claws so cut as to prevent<br/>
any serious mischief from<br/>
<br/>
[49] <i>Tame Tigers</i><br/>
an <u>accidental</u> scratch<br/>
when their playfulness might<br/>
become too serious. The<br/>
disposition of the Tiger is so<br/>
very treacherous, that I did<br/>
not <u>entirely</u> overcome, those<br/>
<u>queer</u> sensations of surprise<br/>
produced by her sudden ap:<br/>
:pearance, until I saw her<br/>
take a diff'rent direction, not:<br/>
:withstanding the assurances<br/>
of Fraser, and the manner<br/>
in which she had been disarmed.<br/>
It is the excessive violence<br/>
of the blow from the fore paw<br/>
of a Tiger, that is to be dreaded,<br/>
the teeth and claws only<br/>
perform a second part, and<br/>
death might be the consequence<br/>
from the former, without the<br/>
assistance of the Latter.<br/>

dream of nothing but Tigers,<br/>
so powerfully had yesterdays<br/>
adventures, and the accounts<br/>
of Fraser's feats among them,<br/>
operated on my mind. At<br/>
day break we were join'd by<br/>
Lieutenants Eliott and<br/>
Hewett of the 8h Dragoons,<br/>
and Lieut Young of the 27th<br/>
Native Infantry, when moun:<br/>

off for Rhotuk, at a brisk<br/>

and at Sunset arrived at<br/>
Rhotuk, sometimes on the<br/>
way, passing through the<br/>
most intricate Jungles, the<br/>
track of the Elephants and<br/>
camels over the moist places,<br/>
serving to guide us. We<br/>
found the Tents pitched on<br/>
a small plain, near the ruin<br/>
of a Temple to the left of the<br/>
Town, which was once emi:<br/>

<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>Rhotuk is situated upon<br/>
a rising ground, about 80<br/>
miles north:west of Delhi,<br/>
the surrounding country is<br/>
<s>extremely</s> wild, and gloomy<br/>
jungles on every side. Near<br/>
the town is a large mound<br/>
of earth, thrown up, it is said<br/>
<br/>
[52] <i>Rhotuk</i><br/>
over a heap of bodies of the<br/>
slain, in some considerable<br/>
battle which was here fought.<br/>
but how many years since<br/>
tradition does not say.<br/>
Upon which account I am<br/>
induced to believe it must<br/>
have taken place many<br/>
ages&#8212;perhaps centuries<br/>
since, as the natives are, in<br/>
general<s>ly</s> tolerably exact<br/>
in their chronology. It is<br/>
now impossible to trace over<br/>
whom this mound is erected,<br/>
but that it was raised to<br/>
commemorate some savage<br/>
chieftains slain in battle<br/>
I have no doubt, and with this<br/>
consideration, I walked, or<br/>
rather climbed to the top<br/>
<br/>
[53] <i>Rhotuk</i><br/>
and indulged in a pleasing<br/>
train of reflections, which<br/>
are naturally suggested to<br/>
the mind, in contemplating<br/>
these remains.<br/>

might be on the move, while<br/>
our time was employed in<br/>
receiving visits of ceremony<br/>
from the neighbouring<br/>

It was a <s>most charming</s> lovely<br/>
morning, and followed by<br/>
the hawkers we proceeded<br/>
to the plain. We were soon<br/>
directed by the screaming of<br/>
a curlew to the little spot of<br/>

feeding, and Fraser taking<br/>
a hawk on the fore:finger<br/>
of his right:hand cautious:<br/>

flight, the hawk's hood:wink<br/>
was slipped off, but dazzled<br/>
by the sudden light she<br/>
flutter'd for a short time<br/>
over his hand, but soon<br/>
recovering she flew rapidly<br/>
after the curlew, whose long<br/>

continues to ascend, and the<br/>
hawk persevere's in her<br/>
spiral motion, until she<br/>
has gain'd the upper flight,<br/>

her wings both fall together,<br/>

for nearly two days, and<br/>
returned to the camp while<br/>
the others were feeding.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The hawk generally in<br/>
use, is, I believe, known<br/>
among Falconer's, as the<br/>
long:wing'd hawk, of which<br/>
there are <s>ten</s> 10 kinds&#8212;of the<br/>
smaller or short:winged<br/>
only eight. I did not see<br/>
enough of them to give a<br/>
particular description, but<br/>
<br/>
[59] <i>Hawks &#8212;- Curlews</i><br/>
the females I think are only<br/>
used by Sportsmen.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The Curlew, here mentioned,<br/>
differs wildly from the one<br/>
found in England, is about<br/>
the size of a large fowl, its<br/>
figure more resembling the<br/>
snipe, with a bill much<br/>
longer and more arched<br/>
than that birds,&#8212;its color<br/>
a shining black, with a<br/>
few white spots at the ex:<br/>
:tremities of the wings, and<br/>
on the top of its head a<br/>
beautiful ornament of a<br/>
bright scarlet, in substance<br/>
not unlike the wattle of a<br/>
cock, long legs, and par:<br/>
:ticularly fine eyes.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The curlews at Rhotuk<br/>
are very numerous, and<br/>
<br/>
[60] <i>Hawking</i><br/>
heard screaming over the<br/>
ruins at all hours of the<br/>
day, but more so morning<br/>
and evening. Our first<br/>
flight this morning affor:<br/>
:ded us a gallop, at speed,<br/>
for nearly four miles on<br/>
end. This sport is not<br/>
altogether without danger,<br/>
for it being necessary to keep<br/>
the eye stedfastly fixed on<br/>
the birds, every other con:<br/>
:sideration for self, or horse<br/>
are laid aside. But one<br/>
of our party proved self<br/>
alone to be his consideration<br/>
in a little occurence<br/>
which happen'd during the<br/>
run. Hewett was a good<br/>
rider and uncommonly well<br/>
mounted, and proved the<br/>
<br/>
[61]<i>Anecdote</i><br/>
mettle of his horse, by taking<br/>
the lead for a long time,&#8212;<br/>
'till at length a high and<br/>
prickly fence presented<br/>
itself, which it was rather<br/>
awkward to clear, as the<br/>
ground was broken and<br/>
sloped on each side, and<br/>
in attempting it, <u>I know<br/>
not how it was</u> he fell, and<br/>
laid much at his ease on<br/>
the opposite side&#8212; "I hope<br/>
you are not hurt Hewett."<br/>
Said I still looking at the<br/>
birds&#8212;and galloping on&#8212;<br/>
"Curse that brute" he ansd<br/>
"there will be no catching<br/>
<u>him</u> to day; but do you<br/>
think if <u>I walk to the tents<br/>
I shall be in time for<br/>
Breakfast</u>" ?&#8212;<br/>
<br/>
[62] <i>Rhotuk</i><br/>
We had only time to fly<br/>
another hawk when the<br/>
sun became too warm and<br/>
drove us home to a <u>sum:<br/>
:tuous</u> breakfast. This<br/>
may astonish the reader who<br/>
has never quitted England,<br/>
but in India unlike any<br/>
other country, a man al:<br/>
:ways travels with every poss:<br/>
:ible comfort, and we seemed<br/>
to be as much at home in<br/>
the Tents in these inhospitable<br/>
looking wilds, as we should<br/>
have been in the centre of<br/>
the city of Delhi&#8212;the only<br/>
difference, a canopy of<br/>
canvas, than a roof of brick<br/>
or timber, with a preference<br/>
to the former.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>This breakfast of<br/>
<br/>
[63] <i>Rhotuk</i><br/>
which Hewett was so anxious<br/>
to share, was one adapted to<br/>
our Sporting apetites, and<br/>
composed of some substantial<br/>
dishes&#8212;such as beefstakes&#8212;<br/>
Mutton chops&#8212;fish &amp;ce<br/>
which dishes generally com:<br/>
:pose an Indian breakfast.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>During this meal an<br/>
enquiring glance was cast<br/>
at every one who entered the<br/>
tent. When a horseman arrived<br/>
with the news of a Tiger that<br/>
had just killed a bullock<br/>
about three miles from<br/>
our camp.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The order was instantly<br/>
given to "t&#239;ar kurroh," (to<br/>
prepare,) and in about half<br/>
an hour the cavalcade was<br/>
<br/>
[64]<i>Preparations</i><br/>
set in motion.<a href="#36">[36]</a> The man<br/>
who had brought the intelli:<br/>
:gence, went first as a guide<br/>
followed by a detachment<br/>
of horsemen; then came the<br/>
five sporting Elephants with<br/>
Howdahs into which we<br/>
ascended; these were follow'd<br/>
by seven others, mounted<br/>
by Spearmen to beat the<br/>
Jungle, while another Elephant<br/>
was dispatched to cut<br/>
forage; and last a crowd<br/>
of fellows closed the march<br/>
each declaring what feats<br/>
his countrymen should<br/>
witness! but "unlike their<br/>
sires of old" long before we<br/>
had reached the spot not<br/>
a hero was to be seen&#8212;<br/>

[65] <i>Going Out</i><br/>
we were all repeatedly cautio:<br/>

<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>When we arrived, the horse:<br/>

encircle the supposed den, &amp;<br/>
some of the followers were<br/>
sent up the higher <s>tr</s> trees, to<br/>
see which road the animal<br/>
might take if he broke cover.<br/>
<br/>
[66] <i>Tiger Hunt</i><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The Elephants were ranged<br/>
in a firm line, equi dis:<br/>
:tant, with a Sportsman on<br/>
each flank, and an Empty<br/>
Elephant between each of<br/>
the others. The order of<br/>
battle being thus arranged<br/>
we proceeded carefully pre:<br/>
:serving the line, until one<br/>
of the Elephants on the left<br/>
near me, shewed evident<br/>
signs of uneasiness, and a<br/>
little onward the stench of<br/>
the lair was almost intol:<br/>
:lerable.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>It is impossible to convey<br/>
an idea of my sensations<br/>
as we slowly entered the<br/>
den&#8212;the wildness of the<br/>
scene&#8212;the solitary expanse<br/>
of jungle, which hems you<br/>
<br/>
[67] <i>Tiger Hunt</i><br/>
in on all sides,&#8212;no human<br/>
habitation, or trace of man<br/>
for miles around&#8212;the<br/>
awful silence, and steady<br/>
look of your companions,<br/>
at times interrupted by the<br/>
low murmuring of the Elep:<br/>
:hants&#8212;the antelopes and<br/>
spotted deer breaking thro'<br/>
the underwood, together with<br/>
expected attack render the<br/>
scene quite awful&#8212;<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>Nothing possibly can be<br/>
more grand than when the<br/>
Elephant comes on the track<br/>
of the Tiger, which he discovers<br/>
by curling his trunk in the<br/>
air, or striking it forcibly on<br/>
the ground; making a kind<br/>
of sqweaking, trumpeting<br/>
<br/>
[68]<i>Tiger Hunt</i><br/>
noise; kicking the bushes<br/>
or shuffling with his hind<br/>
feet, always giving warning<br/>
by one of these signs of his<br/>
approach. The attention<br/>
of the Sportsman must be<br/>
wholly wrapt up in the ob:<br/>
:jects close before him, for<br/>
if the Tiger has lately gorged<br/>
himself, he will not be<br/>
roused until the Elephants<br/>
are close upon him.<br/>
The signal was at<br/>
length given by Young (who<br/>
was next to me on the left<br/>
flank) to close, which we<br/>
doing when the Tiger broke<br/>
with a terrific roar, and<br/>
galloped down the line,<br/>
where he got some severe<br/>
knocks, for I think Every<br/>

[69] <i>Tiger Hunt</i><br/>
one had two or three shots<br/>
at him en passant. Fraser,<br/>
Young, and myself pushed on<br/>
to the place where he again<br/>
couched; he seemed extremely<br/>
savage&#8212;his eyes rolling, &amp;<br/>
his tail lashing, with one<br/>
of his fore paws on a ladder<br/>
which had drop'd from my<br/>
Howdah, and which he had<br/>
nearly gnaw'd in two.<a href="#38">[38]</a> On our<br/>
approach he sneaked into<br/>
a thick bush, where we<br/>
<u>mobb'd</u> him, through which<br/>
he <s>charged</s> repeatedly charged<br/>
in most desperate style<br/>
"Thirsting for blood and eager to destroy"<a href="#39">[39]</a><br/>
Foil'd in every attempt, he<br/>
at length fell, by a ball from<br/>
Hewett, thro' the eye,&#8212;while<br/>

not unemployed, for while we<br/>

off at an amazing rate, &amp;<br/>
could only be persuaded to<br/>

me that day, and not so<br/>

greatly from the blow of a<br/>

these small pools quikly<br/>

[83] <i>The Lion</i><br/>
calmness over the face (if<br/>

structure of the head of the<br/>
Tiger, says "the pointed form<br/>
"of the hind:head, and the<br/>
"breadth of the forehead, are<br/>
"indications of a singular<br/>
"promptitude. How diff'rent<br/>
"its structure from beasts of<br/>

"a quick perception and a<br/>

In comparing it with that<br/>

between the Cat and Dog.<br/>

[86]<i>Rhotuk</i><br/>
March 10th<br/>
We were visited this<br/>
morning by a Chieftain,<br/>
or petty rajah, whose power in<br/>
upper provinces was once<br/>
considerable, but now dwindled<br/>
into into a "faithful few"<br/>
<s>of</s> followers, who endeavour<br/>
to support a certain appea:<br/>
:rance; but I could easily<br/>
discover the unequal<br/>
struggle between vanity &amp;<br/>
poverty&#8212;for though misfor:<br/>
:tune had attacked this poor<br/>
fellow with her most ma:<br/>
:licious deeds, she could<br/>
not humble the pride which<br/>
had been fostered in the<br/>
presence of his Emperor.<a href="#45">[45]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>His name I now forget,<br/>
but he was without excep:<br/>
<br/>
[87] <i>Rhotuk</i><br/>
:tion the handsomest native<br/>
I remember to have seen. He<br/>
told Fraser, that unable any<br/>
longer to suffer the indigni:<br/>
:ties which were daily offer'd<br/>
by his upstart countrymen, to<br/>
his family while they remain'd<br/>
in Delhi, he had removed to<br/>
this remote place, where the<br/>
inhabitants received, and<br/>
honored him as their Chief.<br/>
He spoke highly of the English,<br/>
and related their conquests<br/>
with a most expressive look<br/>
of admiration. He brought<br/>
a number of presents, the<br/>
manufacture of his jaghire,<br/>
which were accepted by<br/>
Fraser, and among them, was<br/>
a matchlock of curious</p>
<p>[88] <i>Rhotuk</i><br/>
workmanship, which <s>when</s><br/>
Fraser begged me to accept<br/>
in remembrance of <u>my<br/>
Prince</u> as he called him.<br/>
It often recals many pleasing<br/>
sensations in the recollection<br/>
of my unfortunate prince, but<br/>
they are now damped with<br/>
the painful one, that he<br/>
is no more.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>When the Chief had taken<br/>
his leave, and Fraser was<br/>
indulging us with his <u>bed<br/>
stay</u> melancholy history, we<br/>
were interrupted by the arrival<br/>
of a horseman, whose ap:<br/>

those feelings which are<br/>
naturally communicated by<br/>
the recital of such a tale,<br/>
<br/>
[89] <i>Attack a lioness &amp; Young</i><br/>
and informed us of having<br/>
heard of a lion, whom the<br/>
natives, he said, dignified<br/>
by the appellation of a<br/>
"burrah haramzader"&#8212;<a href="#46">[46]</a> and<br/>
so indeed she proved, <s>but</s> for<br/>
they had mistaken the sex.<br/>

den, (which was near the<br/>
place the two last were<br/>
killed) we entered it in the<br/>
same manner <s>we had done</s> as<br/>
before, but were not long<br/>
troubled in looking for her,<br/>
for she met us in <s>most</s> gal:<br/>

this ferocity was excited in<br/>
defence of her young, who<br/>
charged in their turn, and caused<br/>
<br/>
[90] <i>Lion hunt</i><br/>
great confusion&#8212;driving<br/>
us repeatedly from the jungle<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>&#8212;A <u>council of war</u> was,<br/>
at length called, and it<br/>
was proposed to renew the<br/>

to keep the Elephants in<br/>

Hewett, and Young all de:<br/>

last it was agreed that<br/>

attempt to describe the con:<br/>

<br/>
[91] <i>Lion hunt</i><br/>
the screaming of the Elephants<br/>
&#8212;the roaring of the lions,<br/>
which was augmented by a<br/>
fourth, that had come to<br/>
the aid of the others&#8212;the<br/>
repeated cries of "There She<br/>
goes"&#8212; <s>pr</s> and the tremendous<br/>
fire kept up, presented a<br/>
scene, which I leave to the<br/>
imagination.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The lioness "with many<br/>
a wound gor'd thro' and thro'"<br/>
was the first to attack us;<br/>
we had scarcely gone ten<br/>
paces when she sprung upon<br/>
Young's Elephant, but was<br/>
soon dislodged&#8212;she retired<br/>
a few paces to her young,<br/>
where<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>"with hot boiling rage<br/>
stung to the quick and mad with<br/>

<br/>
[92]<i>Lion hunt</i><br/>
we soon killed her&#8212;<a href="#47">[47]</a> The 2<br/>
cubs, about eighteen months<br/>
old, fell next; in killing<br/>
the last we were join'd by the<br/>
other party, who had dispat:<br/>
:ched the second lioness, and<br/>
were beating for the larger<br/>
one, but he continued to<br/>
make his escape in the<br/>
general confusion.&#8212;<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>A great part of the after:<br/>
:noon was employed in beating<br/>
for the Lion, but without<br/>
success. But in going thro'<br/>
a slight copse on our<br/>
return homewards started<br/>
four Nyl Ghy's (or wild cows)<br/>
These animals are in appear:<br/>
:ance, exactly what we might<br/>
suppose would be produced<br/>
by the <s>intercou</s> intercourse<br/>
<br/>
[93] <i>Nyl Ghy</i><br/>
of the stag with the Cow. &#8212;Its<br/>
body and legs more resemble the<br/>
Deer:Kind, while the head,<br/>
horns and tail are nearest<br/>
to the cow. Is of a mouse<br/>
color on the back, and on<br/>
the belly inclining to white.<br/>
Is vicious when irritated,<br/>
and in habits not unlike<br/>
the deer&#8212;whose swiftness, it<br/>
equals, if it does not surpass.<br/>
&#8212;The natives have given<br/>
it the name of Nyl Ghy, which<br/>
literally signifies Blue Cow.<a href="#48">[48]</a><br/>
Young made an excellent<br/>
long shot at the last, while in<br/>
the act of bounding a hedge.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>I am almost tempted to<br/>
observe, that the delight I<br/>
feel in going over these fields<br/>
<br/>
[94] <i>Rhotuk</i><br/>
in imagination, falls but<br/>
little short of the reality.<br/>
March 11th<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>At day:break took out<br/>
the hawks and killed threee<br/>
curlews, after some long<br/>
flights&#8212;Lost a hawk in<br/>
the last flight, in consequence<br/>
of the curlew making for a<br/>
tank (or pond) into which<br/>
it darted, and the hawk<br/>
taking a contrary direction&#8212;<a href="#49">[49]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>It seems that Providence<br/>
has instinctively supplied<br/>
them with this means of<br/>
escape, which it invariable<br/>
resorts to, when within its<br/>
reach; for if the curlew<br/>
makes for a piece of water,<br/>
the hawk increases her<br/>
<br/>
[95] <i>Rhotuk</i><br/>
speed in hopes of seizing its<br/>
prey before it can reach <a href="#50">[50]</a><br/>
its <s>safety</s> place of safety,<br/>
but if she finds her speed un:<br/>
:availing she generaly hovers<br/>
over the spot for a short<br/>
time, and flies after the first<br/>
bird that goes by.&#8212;<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>After breakfast went in<br/>
search of a Tiger, against<br/>
which the natives had made<br/>
sad complaints&#8212;but he had<br/>
left the jungle before our ar:<br/>
:rival&#8212;on our way home<br/>
shot a spotted deer.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>The ground to the Westward,<br/>
undulating&#8212;sandy soil&#8212;low<br/>
Koutah jungle, interspersed with a<br/>
beautiful shrub bearing a white<br/>
flower of great fragrance. In<br/>
<br/>
[96] <i>Rhotuk</i><br/>
this direction a great quantity of<br/>
Game of an inferior kind may<br/>
be found. It is said the<br/>
Bustard is sometimes seen<br/>
here, but they are very shy, &amp;<br/>
baffle all attempts to get<br/>
near them.<br/>
March 12th<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>About a mile from Rhotuk <a href="#52">[52]</a><br/>
a little to the right of the Hansi<br/>
road, is a large patch of high<br/>
and almost impenetrable<br/>
thicket, of a most gloomy, &amp;<br/>
uninviting appearance. A<br/>
place of this kind, and so<br/>
situated can not fail to<br/>
attract universal attention.<br/>
I know not how it happened<br/>
that none of our party ever<br/>
thought of entering and ex:<br/>
:ploring this dismal spot<br/>
<br/>
[97] <i>Ruins</i><br/>
as it was often the theme of<br/>
our conversation, and excited<br/>
much curiousity from what the<br/>
natives said concerning it, for<br/>
they all declared, and I am con:<br/>
:vinced confidently believed<br/>
the place to be haunted&#8212;and<br/>
they were well confirmed in<br/>
this superstitious belief, from<br/>
the reports of the inhabitants<br/>
of the City, from whom I have<br/>
often heard a long story of<br/>
the frightful noises that pro:<br/>
:ceed from the caverns, with<br/>
which it is undermined.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>Round the skirts of this<br/>
dreaded place, I have often<br/>
walked of an Evening, with my<br/>
gun, and generally contrived to<br/>
pick up two or three brace<br/>
<br/>
[98] <i>Haunted ruins</i><br/>
of partridge&#8212;peacocks, or<br/>
hares, with which it swarms;<br/>
but was always cautioned<br/>
by the servants not to think<br/>
of venturing inside as I<br/>
valued my life. This ad:<br/>
:vice was generally commu:<br/>
:nicated with a sidelong look of<br/>
horror at the jungle, for<br/>
which indeed I had but<br/>
little inclination, even if<br/>
it had been practicable, for<br/>
it is of all others the most<br/>
likely place for the haunt<br/>
of Tigers. It is said this<br/>
place is the site of the old<br/>
city of Rhotuk, which as I<br/>
before mentioned, was, many<br/>
ages since, rich, populous,<br/>
and flourishing, but now<br/>
according to the scriptural<br/>
<br/>
[99] <i>Haunted ruins</i><br/>
phrase is "become heaps, a<br/>
dwelling place for lions, a<br/>
desolation and a wilderness,<br/>
a place wherein no man<br/>
dwelleth."&#8212;<a href="#53">[53]</a><br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>At day break this morning<br/>
we had been out with the<br/>
hawks and greyhounds, and<br/>
having had excellent sport,<br/>
had dismounted from our<br/>
horses, and were walking<br/>
homewards through a field<br/>
on the skirts of this dread place,<br/>
when our attention was sud:<br/>
:denly arrested by the footmarks<br/>
of a lion of uncommon size;<br/>
and as they lead from the<br/>
covert, we tracked them to a<br/>
considerable distance, when<br/>
we discovered, the print of 3<br/>
<br/>
[100] <i>Four lions chace</i><br/>
more, two of which, were a<br/>
little smaller, these were<br/>
crossed and recrossed, some<br/>
leading to, and others from<br/>
the jungle; at length we traced<br/>
them to the head and entrails<br/>
of a Nyl Ghy which from the<br/>
freshness of the blood, could<br/>
only have been killed a very<br/>
short time before our arrival.<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/sketches/images/indent_spacer.gif" width="30" height="8" alt="spacer"/>This they had evidently<br/>
run down in chace, (I had<br/>
almost said by scent) which<br/>
fully convinces me, that<br/>
lions do not always seize<br/>
their prey, as Tigers, by sur:<br/>
:prise from ambush, but<br/>
when driven by hunger some:<br/>
:times trust to their speed,<a href="#54">[54]</a><br/>
which is wonderfully great,<br/>
the whole of the party con:<br/>
:curring in this opinion, so<br/>
<br/>
[101] <i>Nyl Ghy</i><br/>
evidently established by this<br/>
strange incident. They had<br/>
apparently exerted much<br/>
force, in the last spring, which<br/>
seemed by the few short bounds,<br/>
imprinted in the wet ground,<br/>
before making it, to have<br/>
been collected into one grand<br/>
effort. The earth for about<br/>
six paces around the remains<br/>
of the NylGhy, was, in their<br/>
eagerness to devour it, scrat:<br/>
:ched into a perfect hole, so<br/>
that it was with some dif:<br/>
:ficulty we retraced the <a href="#55">[55]</a><br/>
print of the feet to the thicket,<a href="#56">[56]</a><br/>
and convinced of their having<br/>
entered it we returned home,<br/>
where every preparation was<br/>
made for war, though not<br/>
without much apprehension<br/>
<br/>
[102] <i>Preparations</i><br/>
for the consequences of <s>attak</s><br/>
attacking them in this ter:<br/>
:rific retreat, and the danger<br/>
to which we should be exposed<br/>
if any of the Elephants took<br/>
fright. Many plans of<br/>
operation were suggested, often<br/>
agreed on, and often laid aside,<br/>
&#8212;many opinions offered and<br/>
rejected&#8212;for as it was an<br/>
important undertaking and<br/>
much, of course, was to<br/>
be said on all sides&#8212;but<br/>
kill them <u>we must</u>, all<br/>
cried; but <u>how</u> shall we<br/>
get at them, it was asked;<br/>
in that place they will defy<br/>
the <u>devil</u>&#8212; This caused the<br/>
difference, and like all other<br/>
disputes were every one<br/>
speaks and no one heard,<br/>
we had mounted the<br/>
Elephants without any<br/>
<br/>
[103] <i>for the attack</i><br/>
settled arrangement&#8212;and had<br/>
already arrived within the<br/>
precincts of enchantment<br/>
when it was proposed that<br/>
we should enter as usual, in<br/>
a line, well supported, by<br/>
beating Elephants&#8212;and the<br/>
command to devolve on Fraser.<br/>
<s>and</s> In this way we slowly entered,<br/>
without a word spoken, by any<br/>
one, indeed we were all too<br/>
much occupied in breaking<br/>
through the first wall of jungle,<br/>
which was not effected without<br/>
great labor;&#8212; The interior was<br/>
not quite so thick, though<br/>
it required great caution to<br/>
avoid the broken masses of<br/>

it extremely dangerous. It<br/>
was quite astonishing to<br/>
observe the manner in which<br/>
the Elephants proceeded,<br/>
selecting their way with the<br/>
utmost nicety. Fraser &amp;<br/>
myself were employed in<br/>
breaking down, an immense<br/>
koutah:bush, <s>which had</s><br/>
grown within the walls of<br/>

nearly buried, when a rustling<br/>
was heard at the extreme end, like<br/>
an animal endeavouring<br/>
to escape; (for we had blocked<br/>
the entrance)&#8212; We both fir'd<br/>
and were instantly charged<br/>
by a lioness, with a roar<br/>
that made "the forest tremble" <a href="#57">[57]</a><br/>
&#8212;She seized an Elephant by<br/>
the hind leg, and tore it most<br/>
<br/>
[105] <i>Attack the Lions</i><br/>
unmercifully, but was at<br/>
length kicked off; and nearly<br/>
stunned by the blow,&#8212;she retired<br/>
again to the extreme end, where<br/>
with much difficulty we<br/>
beat up to her&#8212; Here she<br/>
laid apparently very weak,<br/>
but made a desperate effort<br/>
to escape; with her Eyes<br/>

with furious rage" at not<br/>
being able to effect a passage,<br/>
or rather at being baffled<br/>
in the attempt, by two balls<br/>
which I put through her<br/>
shoulder, the whole of her<br/>
fury seem'd directed at me,<br/>
which she was prevented from<br/>
venting, by a shot from<br/>
Fraser, who now became, in<br/>
his turn the suff'rer, for she<br/>
<br/>
[106] <i>Attack the Lions</i><br/>
succeeded in getting upon the<br/>
Elephants head, and so high<br/>
up that I was fearful she<br/>
would get into the Howdah.<a href="#58">[58]</a><br/>
As for the poor Mohout, I gave him<br/>
up as a dead man, and so<br/>
indeed at the time I believe<br/>
he was, through fear. how<br/>
he escaped I know not&#8212;but<br/>
true it is, that altho' the<br/>
lioness appeared to be com:<br/>

recieved a slight scratch<br/>
on the thigh.&#8212; I had now<br/>
run up along side him, but<br/>
Fraser with all the coolness<br/>
that marks his character,<br/>
begged me not to fire, as I<br/>
might injure the Elephant;<br/>
at the same time he placed<br/>
a double:barrell'd rifle to<br/>

us of their having started the<br/>

place where the lioness was<br/>
lying dead. but neither<br/>

spot I ever saw&#8212;composed of<br/>
<br/>
[110] <i>The centre</i><br/>
of a thin underwood of the<br/>
Samaill&#228;h, a shrub in appea:<br/>

of a delicious medicinal<br/>
fragrance, (and I believe used<br/>
by the natives in fermentation)<br/>
These were interspersed by<br/>
small patches of the wild<br/>
jasmine, and rose, whose<br/>
white flowers bloomed in<br/>
modest contrast with the<br/>
beautiful gaudy blossom<br/>
of the jungle d&#228;k of a brilliant<br/>
scarlet. Near a rose bush,<br/>
upon a small hillock which<br/>
was covered with a long &amp;<br/>
silken kind of grass laid Youngs<br/>
lion, which added much to<br/>
the <s>widn</s> wildness of the scene,<br/>
and inspired me with <s>an</s><br/>
indescribable sensations of<br/>

which vibrates most pleasingly,<br/>
though not without a tender<br/>

of martial music, that can<br/>

He was recalled to London in 1805 on account of his vast expenditures, many connected with his personal taste for luxury.<br/>

        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="12"> </a>12</sup> Compare with Franklin's account: "After entering the palace, we were carried to the Dewaun Khana, or hall or audience for the nobility, in the middle of which was a throne, raised about a foot and a half from the ground. In the center of this elevation was placed a chair of crimson velvet, bound with gold clasps, and over the whole was thrown an embroidered covering of gold and silver thread. A handsome samianah [canopy], supported by four pillars, incrusted with silver, was placed over the chair of state" (211). And later: "The Dewaun Khass, in former times, was adorned with excessive magnificence . . . the roof is flat, supported by numerous columns of fine white marble, which have been richly ornamented with inlaid flower work of different coloured stones; the cornices and borders have been decorated with frieze and sculpted work" (213).<br/>

Rennell also identifies "Mahmood," the son of "Subactagi" (xliv)&#8212;the rulers to whom Williams apparently refers in this passage.<br/>

        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="29"> </a>29</sup> Several parts of this passage are taken verbatim from Dow's history. Dow writes, for example: "The provinces to the north-west of the Indus had been ceded to Nadir Shah," who "found means with the assistance of his own tribe in the confusion which succeeded the Shaw's death, to carry off three hundred camels loaded with wealth." See Dow, II, 310-11.<br/>

        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="30"> </a>30</sup> Compare with Dow's description: Nadir Shah "took the field with eighty thousand horses and marched to oppose the invader" (II, 311).<br/>

        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="34"> </a>34</sup> Compare with Franklin's account of Shalimar: "these gardens, made by the emperor Shah Jehan, were begun in the fourth year of his reign, and finished in the thirteenth....These gardens were laid out with admirable taste, and cost the enormous sum of a million sterling; their present appearance does not give cause to suppose such an immense sum has been laid out upon them . . . . The extent of Shalimar does not appear to have been very large. I suppose the gardens altogether are not above one mile in circumference" (209-10).<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="35"> </a>35</sup> These locations refer to present-day Rohtak and Bahadurgarh. These companions were, presumably, Lieutenant Henry Young and Coronets John Elliott and R.S. Hewett, listed in 1815, along with Williams and John Fraser, as officers in the VIII Hussars, all stationed in India under Colonel Westenra. Although Williams dates the journal's events to 1814, the absence of his companions from the list of officers in that year suggests that 1815 is more likely. See Murray, II, 707.<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="36"> </a>36</sup> Allowing for differences in transliteration, Williams is correct here. See John Ferguson's <i>Dictionary of the Hindostan Language</i>.<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="37"> </a>37</sup> Throughout this section of the notebook, Williams refers repeatedly to William Somervile's early eighteenth-century work, <i>The Chace, A Poem</i>. Somervile's narrative includes an extended verse account of Aurungzebe and of traditional Moghul hunting practices, and the poem was itself taken in large part from contemporary travel accounts. The lines Williams quotes here are from the third canto; see III.86 ("in the Madness of Delight") and III.240-5 ("And Hunger Keen, and pungent Thirst of Blood, / Rouse up the slothful Beast, he shakes his Sides, / Slow-rising from his Lair, and stretches wide / His rav'nous Paws, with recent Gore distain'd. / The Forests tremble, as he roars aloud, / Impatient to destroy"). All references are to the 1735 third edition.<br/>

        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="41"> </a>41</sup> Williams's account of this tiger hunt, from manuscript pages 64-76, appears to have been based on the "Account of the Hunting Excursions of Asoph ul Doulah, Visier of the Mogul Empire, and Nabob of Oude," given by William Blane in his <i>Cynegetica or Essays on Sporting Consisting of Observations of Hare Hunting</i>. See Blane, 193.<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="42"> </a>42</sup> As Williams's account suggests, Hansi is located several miles northwest of Delhi, en route to Rohtak. Hurrianah seems to refer to the present-day Haryana territory, located at the southern border of the Punjab district.<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="43"> </a>43</sup> Williams quotes, with only very minor alterations, from Lavater's text, cited above; see Lavater, 97.<br/>

        </p>
        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="46"> </a>46</sup> Apparently Williams intends here the term "burra haramzehada," signifying in Hindi "big rogue." See Ferguson.<br/>

        <p class="indent"><sup><a name="63"> </a>63</sup> The "bulbul" is a "species of the sub-family <i>pycnonoti</i> of the Thrush family, admired in the East for their song as the nightingale is in Europe." See Crooke, 175. The line quoted here has not been positively identified, but it may, in part, allude to Richard Polwhele's poem <i>Sir Allan; or, the Knight of Expiring Chivalry</i>. The third canto to Polwhele's poem describes a Eastern-style hunt with a Nabob, alluding specifically to Somervile's treatment of the subject in "sonorous lines" (III.672). The phrase "seem'd to mourn" appears in the description of the Twelfth Day feast, immediately following the hunting account (III.761).<br/>
