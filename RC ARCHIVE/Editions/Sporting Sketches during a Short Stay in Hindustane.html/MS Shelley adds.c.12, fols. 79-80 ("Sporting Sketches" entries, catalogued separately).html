<p>The following transcription comprises several loose leaves from the Williams-Trelawny notebook, listed by the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford, as MS Shelley adds.c.12, fols. 79-80. These pages have been catalogued separately from the rest of Williams's notebook, but they clearly belong with the larger text, and thus are included in this edition.</p>
<p><i>Editorial Procedures:</i></p>
<p><i>Numbers in brackets [ ] at the beginning of each page break indicate the manuscript pagination; in all other cases, brackets indicate an editorial addition or deletion, typically notes. One point of confusion for modern readers may be Williams's use of the colon [:], which he uses as a modern author would employ a hyphen [-], both to indicate divisions in words interrupted by line breaks and to hyphenate compound nouns and adjectives. Throughout, I have retained the punctuation of the original MS, leaving spelling and punctuation irregularities unaltered; underscoring has also been reproduced as in the original. Cancellations in the manuscript have been indicated, when legible, by a line through the letters; when the cancellation cannot be read, I place arrow brackets [&lt; &gt;] with a cancellation line of the approximate length between them. Williams titled each page of his notebook in a header, and these have been represented, in italics, at the beginning of each page break.</i></p>

[79] The following facts relating to the natural history of<br/>
the Hyena are but little known to even <s>to</s> Sportsmen<br/>
in India and border so much on the marvellous<br/>
as almost to surpass credibility, and had they not<br/>
been confirmed by numerous eye witnesses I should<br/>
be almost afraid of relating them.&#8212;&#160; Much has<br/>
been said respecting the power <s>of</s> Indian Jugglers possess<br/>
of charming Serpents, a similar incantation might<br/>
almost be supposed to have been resorted to on<br/>
this occasion&#8212;&#160; <s>In the Year 1813</s> during some<br/>
Shooting excursions I became acquainted with a<br/>
singular race of people of the lowest class of Hindus<br/>
called (I believe) Kunjooras who live solely by<br/>
the chace, and subsist upon the precarious produce of their<br/>
toils, the flesh of wolves. Hyenas snakes and any<br/>
kind of offal supplying the <s>animal</s> wants<br/>
of nature&#8212;&#160; One of their people had brought<br/>
a Hyena bound in a singular manner alive for sale some days before and<br/>
having heard several remarkable anecdotes<br/>
of their skill and intrepidity, and being<br/>
besides curious to know the method by<br/>
which he had succeeded in securing<br/>
so large and ferocious an animal I was<br/>
induced with several offers of the circles to which<br/>
I belong to rendezvous in the ruins of a city a few<br/>
miles distant called Jughanow once celebrated in<br/>
the history of Hindoostan and now inhabited<br/>
only by wild beasts&#8212;&#160; We were not long in<br/>
discovering the resort of the Brutes of which we<br/>
were in search and in one of the numerous<br/>
ravines that intersect the ruined walls found<br/>
the mouth or entrance to an <u>Earth</u> or <u>Burrow</u> that<br/>
from the skulls and bones of different animals<br/>
strewn around had evidently been lately<br/>
frequented by them&#8212;&#160; On sending in a Terrier<br/>
his barking <s>clearly proved that it contained<br/>
some</s> confirmed our suspicions and he shortly<br/>
afterward came out yelping and dreadfully<br/>
<s>bit</s> wounded&#8212;&#160;&#160; The Chasseurs now commenced their<br/>
operations&#8212;&#160; Their implements were simply a<br/>
Bamboo several feet in length pointed with<br/>
iron for the purpose of defense&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br/>
a coil of rope to fasten the hyena and an instrument<br/>
not unlike a marling spike to enlarge the<br/>
passage where within sufficiently to admit the body of a<br/>
man&#8212;&#160; One of them now descended and groped his<br/>
way along the subterranean cavity till he<br/>
reached the den or retreat of the savage which<br/>
when he had ascertained he made a signal by rapping against the roof to<br/>
his companion, who immediately set about digging</p>
<p>[80] a well or pit downwards to the spot whence the<br/>
sound appeared to issue&#8212;&#160; The man had now remained<br/>
so long in the bowels of the earth that some of us began<br/>
to entertain fears lest he might be suffocated<br/>
or devoured by the monster whilst others fancied<br/>
him an impostor practising on our credulity<br/>
&#8212;In about another half hour however he reascended<br/>
to breathe&#8212;on issuing from the cave he was<br/>
unlike any thing human&#8212;the dust and sweat<br/>
had planted a perfect coat of mud over his whole<br/>
frame for he was naked&#8212;not a feature was visible<br/>
<s>but</s> not even his eyes and well later he forced them open.<br/>
&#8212;The Pit being now completed the native again<br/>
disappeared by the new opening rolling before<br/>
him a piece of hard broken ground or cemented gravel called<br/>
Konker for protection agt the Beast as well<br/>
as to prevent his escape&#8212;whose furious<br/>
growlings were now plainly distinguishable&#8212;&#160; An<br/>
old man this Companion now also descended to<br/>
his assistance&#8212;and by their united efforts the<br/>
Hyena was at length muzzled, and his hind legs<br/>
bound to his fore whilst a stronger rope was<br/>
attached to his body in order to drag "the<br/>
struggling savage into day"&#8212;&#160; A signal for<br/>
this work was now given&#8212;and just as we had<br/>
succeeded in getting him to the top of the Pit the<br/>
rope gave way, and the task devolved upon the<br/>
chasseurs of again securing him.&#160; This they went<br/>
about aimlessly and with many precautions<br/>
but after a struggle of some minutes the<br/>
terrific <s>anim</s> monster was again hawled<br/>
up foaming and mad with rage&#8212;his<br/>
exertions snapped the muzzle when he seized<br/>
this crow bar between his legs and strange to<br/>
say bit it so savagely as to indent the iron<br/>
and tear out one of his thighs by the roots.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This adventure in the annals of sporting will<br/>
appear less extraordinary <s>when</s> if we reflect that the<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; it would seem &lt;&#160;&#160;&#160; &gt; from &lt;&#160;&#160;&#160; &gt;<br/>
whole of brute creation have has an instinctive<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; evinces no sense of<br/>
dread of man when <s>he faces them with</s><br/>
terror for himself<br/>
<s>intrepidity</s> &#8212;<s>and</s> even the Tiger when pressed<br/>
by hunger has been known to fly from him&#8212;<br/>
but the the felon character of the Hyena has<br/>
been long known it <s>will</s> excites our wonder<br/>
that an animal so amply provided by nature with<br/>
the means of offence should betray so cowardly<br/>
an insensibility of injury as tamely to submit<br/>
to be bound in this manner above attempted<br/>
to be described.<br/>
