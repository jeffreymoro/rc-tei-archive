    <h2 align="center">About This Edition</h2>
    <p align="left">Thomas Lovell Beddoes's <i>The Brides' Tragedy</i> (1822) immediately established its author as a promising if immature playwright and a powerfully imaginative poet, but it was the last play Beddoes was to publish during his lifetime. Intended to facilitate the study of text, <i>The Brides' Tragedy</i> by Thomas Lovell Beddoes, edited by David Baulch, presents both the full text and relevant contexts of the play. The editor's introduction and notes focus on Beddoes's fascinating radical political and intellectual context. The introduction includes a discussion of the sources for <i>The Brides' Tragedy</i>, the four reviews of the play, and the contemporary critical conversation surrounding the play. Additionally, this edition includes the play's sources, an item in <i>The Oxford University and City Herald</i> from 24 March 1822, and Thomas Gillet's poem "Lucy" (1822). Also included are the period reviews of the play by Barry Cornwall (Bryan Waller Procter), Christopher North (John Wilson), John Lacy (George Darley), and one by an anonymous reviewer.</p>
