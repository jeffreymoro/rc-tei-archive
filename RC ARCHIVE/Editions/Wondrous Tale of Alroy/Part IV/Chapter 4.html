    <p>&#8216;A thousand thanks, good Scherirah; but with our people the flesh of the gazelle is forbidden. It is unclean. Its foot is cloven.&#8217;<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote45">*</a></p>

    <p>&#8216;I have heard of these things,&#8217; replied Scherirah, with a thoughtful air. &#8216;My mother was a Jewess, and my father was a Kourd. Whichever be right, I hope to be saved.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;I will join you,&#8217; said the third robber. &#8216;My father was a Guebre,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote46">*</a> and sacrificed his property to his faith; and the consequence is, his son has got neither.&#8217;</p>
