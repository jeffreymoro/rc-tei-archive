    <p>THE moonbeam fell upon the fountain; the pavement of the court was a flood of light; the rocks rose dark around. Jabaster, seated by the spring, and holding his talisman in his left hand, shaded his sight with the other as he gazed upon the luminous heavens.</p>

    <p>&#8216;Know, then, that sleeping on the couch within, my sleep was troubled. Many dreams I had, indefinite and broken. I recall none of their images, except I feel a dim sensation &#8217;twas my lot to live in brighter days than now rise on our race. Suddenly I stood upon a mountain tall and grey, and gazed, upon the stars. And, as I gazed, a trumpet sounded. Its note thrilled through my soul. Never have I heard a sound so awful. The thunder, when it broke over the cavern here, and shivered the peak, whose ruins lie around us, was but a feeble worldly sound to this almighty music. My cheek grew pale, I panted even for breath. A flaming light spread over the sky, the stars melted away, and I beheld, advancing from the bursting radiancy, the foremost body of a mighty host.</p>

    <p>&#8216;I started in my dream, and I awoke. I found myself upsitting on my couch. The pageantry had vanished. Nought was seen but the bright moonlight and the gloomy cave. And, as I sighed to think I e'er had wakened, and mused upon the strangeness of my vision, a still small voice descended from above and called, &#8220;Alroy!&#8221; I started, but I answered not. Methought it was my fancy. Again my name was called, and now I murmured, &#8220;Lord, I am here, what wouldst thou?&#8221; Nought responded, and soon great dread came over me, and I rushed out and called to thee, my master.&#8217;</p>

Since the Captivity &#8217;tis the only mode by which the saints are summoned. Oft have I heard of it, but never in these sad degenerate days has its soft aspiration fallen upon us.
