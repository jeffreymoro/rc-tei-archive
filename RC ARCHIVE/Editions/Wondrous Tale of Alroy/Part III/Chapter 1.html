    <p>IT was midnight. Alroy slept upon the couch: his sleep was troubled. Jabaster stood by his side motionless, and gazing intently upon his slumbering guest.</p>

    <p>&#8216;The only hope of Israel,&#8217; murmured the Cabalist, &#8216;my pupil and my prince! I have long perceived in his young mind the seed of mighty deeds, and o&#8217;er his future life have often mused with a prophetic hope. The blood of David, the sacred offspring of a solemn race. There is a magic in his flowing veins my science cannot reach.</p>

    <p>&#8216;When, in my youth, I raised our standard by my native Tigris, and called our nation to restore their ark, why, we were numerous, wealthy, potent; we were a people then, and they flocked to it boldly. Did we lack counsel? Did we need a leader? Who can aver that Jabaster's brain or arm was ever wanting? And yet the dream dissolved, the glorious vision! Oh! when I struck down Marvan,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote38">*</a> and the Caliph&#8217;s camp flung its blazing shadow over the bloody river, ah! then indeed I lived.

I remembered that I had evoked spirits, that I had communed with the great departed, and that the glowing heavens were to me a natural language. I recalled, as consolation to my gloomy soul, that never had my science been exercised but for a sacred or a noble purpose. And I remembered Israel, my brave, my chosen, and my antique race, slaves, wretched slaves. I was strongly tempted to fling me down this perilous abyss, and end my learning and my life together.</p>
