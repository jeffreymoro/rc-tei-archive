                            1968. 51-7; 90-3.</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The significance of <i>Alroy</i> to the later Young England
                                novels is threefold. First, in this novel Disraeli most
                                clearly articulates his debt to the past. Second,
                                    <i>Alroy</i> removes whatever doubt might have remained
                                in any reader&#8217;s mind about Disraeli&#8217;s Hebraic
                                consciousness. Third, and most important, is what will be
                                discussed as the allegory of the novel&#8212;an allegory
                                which develops the efficacy of great, traditional principles
                                and of the destruction inherent in compromising them.<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li>Much confusion has been engendered by Disraeli&#8217;s
                                comment that his ideal ambition can be seen in <i>Alroy</i>.
                                Monypenny has suggested that Disraeli was simply too astute
                                a politician ever to have undertaken a Hebrew crusade.
                                Philip Guedalla has commented that &#8220;. . . it is not
                                easy to believe that he [Disraeli] ever played, even in
                                fancy, with the notion of a Jewish career. Can we forget
                                that <i>Contarini</i>&#8217;s Jerusalem was largely notable
                                for its Christian and Moslem antiquities? And even in
                                    <i>Alroy</i>, for all its highly scented eloquence, the
                                Jewish quality was distinctly tepid.&#8221;<sup><a
                                        href="#note1"
                                        >1</a></sup> Both Monypenny and Guedalla are
                                essentially correct in their assumption that Disraeli never
                                seriously considered a &#8220;Jewish career,&#8221; but
                                Disraeli&#8217;s &#8220;ideal ambition&#8221; can be
                                discussed in terms meaningful beyond the obviously limiting
                                qualification of such a career. I have previously commented
                                that Disraeli was emotionally and intellectually involved
                                with the Hebrew &#8220;race&#8221; rather than with the
                                Jewish religion, and in <i>Alroy</i> we have the clearest
                                example of that involvement. Disraeli frequently goes to the
                                past to discover (or uncover) traditional principles by
                                which contemporary problems might be better understood and
                                controlled. Is it not possible to read the author&#8217;s
                                ideal ambition in these terms as a commitment to traditional
                                principles and to the Hebraic past? And, by Disraeli&#8217;s
                                own qualification, the Hebraic past must also include
                                Christian tradition.<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li>Furthermore, the diary entry in which he mentioned the ideal
                                ambition reflected in <i>Alroy</i> was written in the same
                                year that saw the publication of his <i>Vindication of the
                                    English Constitution</i> (1835). This is a Disraeli in
                                his early thirties who is studiously engaged in a
                                consideration of the past and who is also seriously intent
                                on a political career. Yet he later looks back across the
                                few years to <i>Alroy</i> and perceives his ideal ambition
                                mirrored there. The commitment to tradition which permeates
                                the <i>Vindication</i> might very well be part and parcel of
                                Disraeli&#8217;s reading of his ideal ambition in 1835.
                                Furthermore, if we read <i>Alroy</i> in terms of the
                                over-all pattern of thought in the Young England trilogy,
                                the earlier novel must take on considerable ideational significance.<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li>David Alroy and his career have symbolic value in terms of
                                both the <i>Vindication</i> and the Young England novels. In
                                its simplest terms, Alroy&#8217;s mission is to deliver his
                                people to their rightful position as tradition has defined
                                that position. Alroy&#8217;s quest is, in one sense,
                                predicated upon his ability to invoke principles both by
                                which his people&#8217;s condition can be ameliorated and by
                                which they can once more be brought into harmony with
                                tradition. Essentially, of course, this is the mission of
                                Young England and, in part, the intellectual proposition of
                                the <i>Vindication</i>. Early in the novel, the clash
                                between the proponent of the <i>status quo</i> (old
                                Bostenay) and the advocate of a return to traditional
                                greatness (paradoxically, therefore, of progress) sets the
                                scene for Alroy&#8217;s drama. Bostenay is able to admit
                                that &#8220;we have fallen on evil days, and yet we
                                prosper&#8221; (Pt1Ch1), and, later, that &#8220;If life
                                were a mere question between freedom and slavery, glory and
                                dishonour, all could decide&#8221; (Pt1Ch1). He urges
                                acceptance of the present situation and denies Alroy&#8217;s
                                comments as the dreams of youth.<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li>David, however, is seized by the realization that
                                acquiescing to the present is not what he can or must do,
                                although he remains uncertain about any precise course of
                                action: &#8220;I know not what I feel, yet what I feel is
                                madness. Thus to be is not to live, if life be what I
                                sometimes dream, and dare to think it might be. To breathe,
                                to feed, to sleep, to wake and breathe again, again to feel
                                existence without hope; if this be life, why then these
                                brooding thoughts that whisper death were better?&#8221;
                                (Pt1Ch1). This sounds very much like the young Coningsby or
                                Egremont who realizes that he must engage change and embrace
                                principles but is without a clear direction to follow.
                                Indeed, the conversation between Bostenay and David bears
                                resemblances to a dialogue between the old and new
                                        Toryism.<sup><a
                                        href="#note2"
                                        >2</a></sup> Even the songs sung by the chorus of
                                Hebrew maidens are applicable to the new Toryism; for
                                example: &#8220;THE BRICKS ARE FALLEN, BUT WE WILL REBUILD
                                WITH MARBLE: THE SYCAMORES ARE CUT DOWN, BUT WE WILL REPLACE
                                THEM WITH CEDARS&#8221; (Pt1Ch2).<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li>When David Alroy emerges as the deliverer of his people, he
                                is aided by the mystical, Cabalistic Jabaster, who is the
                                Sidonia-like teacher. He is able to bring David into contact
                                with the great principles of the past and to channel his
                                zeal into programs which offer some possibilities for
                                success. Jabaster refers to David as his pupil, and states
                                that he has mused &#8220;o&#8217;er his [Alroy&#8217;s]
                                future life . . . with a prophetic hope&#8221; (Pt3Ch1).
                                Throughout the novel, the influence of Jabaster on Alroy is
                                paramount, even during those months when Alroy violates his
                                master&#8217;s counsel. Immediately after leaving
                                Jabaster&#8217;s cave, the young deliverer&#8217;s
                                adventures begin. He is seeking the sword of King Solomon
                                through which he shall receive divine aid and which in
                                itself is symbolic of the principles of tradition. Over and
                                over again, David is rescued during his journey; and in
                                every case he is saved by means of his religion. Furthermore
                                he is guided and aided by a wide variety of mysterious as
                                well as mystical occurrences.<sup><a
                                        href="#note3"
                                        >3</a></sup> In my reading of the novel as allegory,
                                David is protected by his belief in great principles. And as
                                long as his belief in those principles remains firm and
                                unaltered, Alroy is successful. Only after he decides to
                                compromise his original dedication does he fall from favor
                                and meet with failure.<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li>If Jabaster and David (during his quest) are representative
                                of the dedication to traditional, efficacious principles,
                                Schirene must be emblematic of the bed-and-board compromise
                                which produces only boredom and isolation in the midst of a
                                life of material luxury. She is neither happy nor even
                                satisfied in the sumptuous, easy life she leads. Honain, on
                                the other hand, the rationalist brother of Jabaster, is
                                concerned only with the problem of surviving well. Perhaps a
                                distant ancestor of Dickens&#8217; Gradgrind, Honain is
                                interested only in demonstrable facts as he sells himself
                                for comfort and power. His only allegiance is to those
                                mortal powers which can make him prosperous and secure
                                (whether those powers be Hebrew, Moslem, or Karasmian).
                                Committed to the principle of self, he thinks his brother deluded.<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li>To Alroy, both Schirene and Honain offer power and success
                                without the &#8220;nonsense&#8221; of ideological
                                commitment: &#8220;The world is before you. You may fight,
                                you may love, you may revel. War, and women, and luxury are
                                all at your command. With your person and talents you may be
                                grand vizir. Clear your head of nonsense&#8221; (Pt5Ch4).
                                Alroy, a young man, is taken with these possibilities,
                                especially with the beauty of Schirene; but he is also a
                                pilgrim and realizes that he must continue his quest. His
                                note to Honain makes clear the extent of the temptation he
                                experienced: &#8220;Honain, I have been the whole night like
                                David in the wilderness of Ziph; but, by the aid of the
                                Lord, I have conquered. I fly from this dangerous city upon
                                his business, which I have too much neglected&#8221;
                                (Pt5Ch6). Yet this is precisely the city to which Alroy will
                                eventually return once he decides to alter and adapt the
                                principles of tradition. Once again, the Schirene-Honain
                                view of an uncommitted but prosperous life affords
                                interesting parallels to the Young England conception of the
                                old Toryism.<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li>The change which Alroy undergoes is carefully wrought by
                                Disraeli. Through the early portions of the novel, the
                                protagonist is able to operate successfully while balancing
                                practical action on the one hand and commitment to principle
                                on the other. From his early dialogue with Bostenay, we
                                perceive Alroy as a man of action; from his first meeting
                                with Jabaster, we perceive Alroy as a man of commitment.
                                Jabaster, too, realizes the need for such a balance although
                                he himself has lived in hermit-like, mystical isolation,
                                apparently only awaiting the arrival of the deliverer. In
                                this balance between action and commitment there are
                                intimations of the later outlook of Sidonia and the men of
                                Young England. We might suggest also that this is the
                                relationship between action and thought which was operative
                                in Disraeli&#8217;s own career&#8212;or, at least, in his
                                own ideal rendering of that career. Clearly, then, there are
                                two possible dangers inherent in such a state of
                                equilibrium: the balance can be upset by either of the two
                                elements gaining greater weight. Disraeli treats both
                                possibilities in this novel and rejects both.<br/>

                            <li>After Alroy has left Jabaster&#8217;s cave and has begun his
                                search for the sword, he listens to a debate between two
                                learned rabbis regarding the whereabouts of the weapon. The
                                contrast between the scholarly, rabbinic argument and
                                Alroy&#8217;s need and desire for action is clear.
                                Ultimately, the reader comes to recognize the rabbis&#8217;
                                dialogue to be sterile, meaningless prattle. Indeed,
                                extolling the virtues of a learned treatise, one rabbi
                                declares &#8220;the first chapter makes equal sense, read
                                backward or forward&#8221; (Pt6Ch3). Clearly, Disraeli
                                intimates, no progress can ever arise from such rarefied
                                nonsense. Even Jabaster suggests that &#8220;the past is for
                                wisdom, the present for action, but for joy the
                                future&#8221; (Pt7Ch13). However, although Alroy properly
                                recoils from the rabbis, he gradually moves to a position in
                                which he finally states: &#8220;I&#8217;ll have no dreamers
                                in authority. I must have practical men about me, practical
                                men&#8221; (Pt8Ch1). From this rejection of tradition, it is
                                only a short movement to &#8220;The world is mine: and shall
                                I yield the prize . . . to realize the dull tradition of
                                some dreaming priest, and consecrate a legend?&#8221; (Pt8Ch1).<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li>From this point of departure from tradition and principle,
                                Alroy begins his downward turn to final ruin and capture by
                                the Karasmians. Symbolically, as we shall see in the Young
                                England trilogy, a marriage joins two opposing forces; but
                                in this case destruction instead of strength is the result.
                                Alroy is joined with Schirene; commitment is wedded to
                                compromise. The offspring must be ruin for the committed,
                                suggests the novel, as Alroy embraces compromise and
                                conciliation in order to become the secular conqueror of the
                                world in direct violation of the religious basis of his
                                crusade. Jabaster&#8217;s plea to Alroy to reject Schirene
                                and all she represents is essentially what Alroy was able to
                                convince himself of after first having met Schirene and
                                Honain: <blockquote>Arise, Alroy, arise and rouse thyself.
                                    The lure that snared thy fathers may trap thee, this
                                    Delilah may shear thy mystic locks. Spirits like thee
                                    act not by halves. Once fall out from the straight
                                    course before thee, and, though thou deemest &#8217;tis
                                    but to saunter mid the summer trees, soon thou wilt find
                                    thyself in the dark depths of some infernal forest,
                                    where none may rescue thee! (Pt8Ch6)</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>But Alroy&#8217;s dedication and commitment have been
                                altered and sullied by success and power.<sup><a

                            <li>While preparing to counter-attack the numerous, massive
                                military invasions against him, Alroy realizes that changes
                                have taken place: neither he nor his soldiers are fired by
                                zeal and commitment as they had been previously, the army is
                                now but &#8220;splendid mercenaries,&#8221; and the symbolic
                                sceptre of Solomon disappears. The last line of the chapter
                                is a paraphrase of King Saul&#8217;s lament: &#8220;he
                                [Alroy] flew to the couch, and throwing himself upon his
                                knees, and, covering his face with his hands, burst into
                                passionate tears, and exclaimed, &#8216;O! my God, I have
                                deserted thee, and now thou hast deserted me!&#8217;&#8221;
                                (Pt10Ch6). Disraeli meaningfully employs the Saul analogue
                                again as Alroy speaks to the spirit of Jabaster who
                                foretells his pupil&#8217;s defeat. Even after Alroy learns
                                that Schirene and Honain had plotted Jabaster&#8217;s death,
                                &#8220;he dismissed from his intelligence all cognizance of
                                good and evil; he determined, under all circumstances to
                                cling, ever to her; he tore from his mind all memory of the
                                late disclosure&#8221; (Pt10Ch8). The balance has now been
                                shifted to the side opposite the rabbis&#8217; total
                                immersion in speculation.<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li>After Alroy&#8217;s capture by the Karasmians, Honain (now
                                working for the new conquerors) delivers the terms by which
                                David can save himself and his sister: a public renunciation
                                of the principles which had guided him to his former
                                victories. But Alroy refuses, and thus Disraeli has his
                                protagonist finally accept his commitment once again; in a
                                grand moment, Alroy suffers death rather than complete and
                                public renunciation of the validity of his tradition.<sup><a

                                itself not one of its author&#8217;s more effective works,
                                in its ideational complexities Alroy emerges as significant
                                in terms of Disraeli&#8217;s later development in the Young
                                England novels, especially in <i>Tancred</i>.<br/>

                            <li>We recall that Disraeli had said, &#8220;In <i>Vivian
                                    Grey</i> I have portrayed my active and real ambition;
                                in Alroy my ideal ambition.&#8221;<sup><a

                                        >6</a></sup> That Disrael&#8217;s &#8220;active and
                                real ambition&#8221; was realized is obvious. Not so clear,
                                however, is his &#8220;ideal ambition.&#8221; Let us return
                                for a brief further look at <i>Alroy</i> which has much in
                                common with <i>Tancred</i>. Both novels deal with the past
                                and with Judaism, but Disraeli&#8217;s thinking on these
                                subjects had not yet been crystallized in 1833 in
                                    <i>Alroy</i>. But in <i>Tancred</i> (1847) we see that
                                Disraeli had come to firmly conceived conclusions about both
                                the past and Judaism. But one value of <i>Alroy</i> lies in
                                its presentation&#8212;however groping and
                                tentative&#8212;of a facet of Disraeli&#8217;s view of history.<br/>

                            <li>The events of the novel take place in the twelfth century.
                                As we have seen, <i>Alroy</i> deals with the desire of David
                                Alroy, a descendant of the House of David, to lift Israel to
                                her former position of glory and grandeur. Beginning as a
                                captive of the Mohammedans, Alroy escapes, goes to
                                Jerusalem, leads an army devoted to his cause, and is
                                successful in his holy war. He wins Western Asia for Israel,
                                but Alroy is not content. He now feels that both he and
                                Israel are invincible, and he desires the world for his God;
                                &#8220;The Lord of Hosts&#8221; must have universal
                                dominion. But the world is too much for Alroy, and he is
                                defeated and taken prisoner once more. He is magnificent in
                                death as he refuses freedom and faces execution rather than
                                abandon his faith. In a grand speech, Alroy answers the
                                charges brought against him by the king of his captors, the
                                Karasmians: <blockquote>King of Karasm&#233;! I stand here
                                    accused of many crimes. Now hear my answers. &#8217;Tis
                                    said I am a rebel. My answer is, I am a Prince as thou
                                    art, of a sacred race, and far more ancient. I owe
                                    fealty to no one but to my God. . . . &#8217;Tis well
                                    understood in every polity, my people stand apart from
                                    other nations, and ever will, in spite of suffering. . .

                                    the sacred writings of thy race still reverence. For the
                                    arts magical I practised, and the communion with
                                    infernal powers &#8217;tis said I held, know, King, I
                                    raised the standard of my faith by the direct
                                    commandment of my God, the great Creator of the
                                    universe. What need of magic, then? What need of
                                    paltering with petty fiends, when backed by His
                                    omnipotence? My magic was His inspiration. Need I prove
                                    why, with such aid, my people crowded round me? The time
                                    will come when from out our ancient seed, a worthier
                                    chief will rise, not to be quelled even by thee, Sire.

                            <li>Since Disraeli said that Alroy represented his &#8220;ideal
                                ambition,&#8221; he must have felt a kinship with David
                                Alroy; but, as Monypenny points out, Disraeli was far too
                                practical to devote his life to a religious crusade which
                                had little chance of success.<sup><a

                                        >7</a></sup> The quest of Alroy, however, never left
                                Disraeli, although it was often reinterpreted and even
                                sublimated in his works. In Alroy we see the first overt
                                statement of Disraeli&#8217;s &#8220;racism&#8221; and the
                                first implied statement of his medievalism. For Disraeli,
                                there is an inevitability in his ancient race; from the
                                depths of Judaism will come the salvation of man: &#8220;the
                                time will come when from out our ancient seed, a worthier
                                chief will rise. . . .&#8221; The spirit of history, for
                                Disraeli, is the working out of that salvation. Furthermore,
                                the placement of Alroy in the Middle Ages is not mere
                                accident. As I point out at some length in the next chapter,
                                the medieval religious view is significant for Disraeli
                                because there had then taken place a synthesis between
                                Judaism and Christianity, the Hebr&#230;o-Christian Church.
                                The union between the God of the Old Testament and of the
                                New Testament, between Disraeli&#8217;s ancestors and the
                                early church fathers, which produced the God of Sinai and of
                                Calvary, also produced the religious, political, and
                                societal patterns whose working out in future ages was the
                                ultimate stuff of history. Just as Coleridge desired to show
                                that history was a process &#8220;governed by the
                                consciousness of laws,&#8221; so Disraeli believed that the
                                process of history was the working out of the spirit of the
                                Hebr&#230;o-Christian Church. Like the Germano-Coleridgeans,
                                Disraeli and his fictional heroes &#8220;were looking for a
                                knowledge of the past which might suggest lines of action in
                                the present.&#8221;<sup><a

                            <li>Disraeli, who saw the state as an organic structure and
                                history as a living continuum, conceived of history as
                                moving in a spiraling motion toward the fulfillment of the
                                law of the God of Sinai and of Calvary, which law embraced
                                all areas of man&#8217;s life. I have said that in each of
                                the novels of the Young England trilogy, the organic,
                                spiraling nature of history is illustrated as the past
                                significantly influences the present and the future and that
                                Disraeli deals with the three principal areas of societal,
                                political, and religious organization. We see that, over and
                                over again, the spirit of the principles and often the
                                principles themselves which Disraeli&#8217;s protagonists
                                come to accept are medieval in nature. Just as there is an
                                apostolic succession in religion, so we see such a tradition
                                in operation in secular areas of life, a tradition which for
                                Young England must be re-asserted and followed.<br/>
                                <br/></li>
                            <li><i>Coningsby</i> and <i>Sybil</i> interpret this tradition
                                in the areas of social organization and statecraft. In both
                                novels, the disciples of the Young England movement come to
                                see that there are no principles guiding English life, and
                                they sincerely lament this fact. Through an educative
                                process carefully constructed by the author, they come to
                                realize the validity of the medieval ethos; and they attempt
                                to implement the best of it in their own age. In
                                    <i>Tancred</i>, Disraeli shifts the focus from politics
                                to religion. The possibility of a political solution to
                                England&#8217;s great ills has reached an impasse, for the
                                proponents of Young England are unfortunately in the
                                distinct minority. Thus the author has Tancred move to an
                                area greater than politics but one which must include
                                politics. Tancred goes to Palestine to seek the answer to
                                the great Asian mystery, an answer which solidifies the
                                basis of Disraeli&#8217;s views of the Hebraeo-Christian
                                Progress and the organic nature of society. Just as in the
                                Middle Ages, government must follow the lead of the Church
                                if the law-giver is to interpret the Law, so in
                                    <i>Tancred</i> the solution to the &#8220;condition of
                                England&#8221; question is given its ultimate statement
                                which involves a union between West and East. In each of the
                                three novels, we see illustrated in imaginative form
                                Disraeli&#8217;s general position that is outlined in this
                                chapter.</li>

                            Certainly one can imagine Disraeli, an alien, lamenting the
                            state of his frustrated ambitions in Alroy&#8217;s terms:
                            &#8220;And even now a vivid flash darts through the darkness of
                            my mind. Methinks, methinks: ah! worst of woes to dream of glory

                            and love, and fame and mighty deeds, the smile of women and the

                            that pants for empire, I stand here extending my vain arm for my
                            lost sceptre, a most dishonoured slave!&#8221; (pp. 52-53).</p>

                            Jabaster and Honain are here made clear in terms of plot. Honain

                            between Alroy and Jabaster in perfectly rational terms&#8212;and
                            at this moment Alroy wants nothing but such an explanation.
                            However, given the events of the past, the novel clearly
                            suggests that Alroy is foolish to discard Jabaster&#8217;s
                            reading of events and of the entire mystical environment in
