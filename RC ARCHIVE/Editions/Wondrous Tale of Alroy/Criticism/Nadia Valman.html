                                            <i>The Wondrous Tale of Alroy</i> (1833), an epic tale
                                        of tragic heroism. The legend of Jewish liberation fighters
                                        on which <i>Alroy</i> is based offers an unconventionally
                                        tough image of mediaeval Jews, but the novel is nevertheless
                                        ambivalent about the possibility of Jewish national autonomy
                                        it raises. <i>Alroy</i> is set in twelfth-century Hamadan,
                                        where the Jews, dispossessed of national sovereignty, live
                                        as a tributary people under Seljuk rule. Alroy, descendant
                                        of the house of David, the messianic line, and heir to the
                                        title of &#8216;Prince of the Captivity&#8217;, is a Hebrew
                                        Hamlet, galled at the weakness of the Jews and his own
                                        inability to take action against the humiliation of diaspora
                                        existence. Inspired by the kabbalist Jabaster, he embarks on
                                        a journey to Jerusalem, whose ruins are &#8216;like the last
                                        gladiator in an amphitheatre of desolation.&#8217;<sup><a

                                        transfigured Jerusalem and a godlike figure, which he
                                        believes to be a confirmation of his own mystical election
                                        as messiah. He unites the &#8216;singular and scattered

                                        first major debates about Jewish emancipation and the limits

                                        Parliament, Disraeli's novel uses the story of Jewish
                                        national liberation to consider universalist and
                                        particularist definitions of the nation. Disraeli satirises
                                        the old rabbis in Jerusalem, &#8216;the forlorn remnant of
                                        Israel, captives in their own city&#8217; but bound by
                                        religious pedantry to perpetuate their own

                                        valorises the romantic nationalism which inspires Alroy as
                                        he looks upon a ruined city of the East: <blockquote>All was
                                            silent: alone the Hebrew Prince stood amid the regal
                                            creation of the Macedonian captains. Empires and
                                            dynasties flourish and pass away; the proud metropolis
                                            becomes a solitude, the conquering kingdom even a
                                            desert; but Israel still remains, still a descendant of
                                            the most ancient kings breathed amid these royal ruins,
                                            and still the eternal sun could never rise without
                                            gilding the towers of living Jerusalem. A word, a deed,
                                            a single day, a single man, and we might be a

                                        project of national liberation and suggests the dynamic
                                        power of the nation embodied in a charismatic hero.<br/>

                                    <li>However, in the course of the novel Alroy comes to temper
                                        this mystical nostalgia with a modernising politics and to
                                        shift his rootedness in place and past towards a concept of
                                        the nation expanding indefinitely in time and territory.
                                        Eventually Jabaster's vision of a particularist national
                                        existence based on a fixed history and religious affiliation
                                        is rejected by Alroy: &#8216;Jerusalem, Jerusalem&#8212;ever
                                        harping on Jerusalem. With all his lore, he is a
                                        narrow-minded zealot, whose dreaming memory would fondly
                                        make a future like the past.&#8217;<sup><a

                                                >7</a></sup> Instead he favours an imperial,
                                        inclusive and expansionist notion of the nation, embracing
                                        both Jews and non-Jews. Alroy&#8217;s inclusive conception
                                        of Judaism appropriates Christianity&#8217;s traditional
                                        claim to universalism (as Disraeli himself was to do in a
                                        later parliamentary debate). Moreover, this universalism is
                                        the source of Alroy's military success. In his view the only
                                        way of attaining permanent political empowerment is to
                                        renounce the narrow religious definition of Judaism for a
                                        national and tolerant one: <blockquote>Universal empire must
                                            not be founded on sectarian prejudices and exclusive
                                            rights. Jabaster would massacre the Moslemin like Amalek
                                            [the archetypal enemy of the Jews]; the Moslemin, the

                                        to redefine the Jews as a nation in precisely the terms that
                                        Disraeli employs to discuss the future of England in the
                                        political trilogy of the 1840s, where he suggests that
                                        racial, social and religious divisions can be transcended in
                                        the name of a perceived common political ideal. Indeed the
                                        novel shows this to be a successful strategy: in the Jewish
                                        army &#8216;the greater part were Hebrews, but many Arabs,
                                        wearied of the Turkish yoke, and many gallant adventurers
                                        from the Caspian, easily converted from a vague idolatry to
                                        a religion of conquest, swelled the ranks of the army of the
                                        &#8220;Lord of Hosts&#8221;&#8217;.<sup><a

                                        universalist nationalism, or imperialism, is unsustainable.
                                        As Alroy&#8217;s tolerance increasingly earns him the
                                        resentment of his generals, the novel&#8217;s movement
                                        towards tragedy is underscored by pessimism about the
                                        possibility of a permanent Jewish national existence.
                                        Jabaster warns: &#8216;We must exist alone. To preserve that
                                        loneliness, is the great end and essence of our law . . .

                                        has universalised Judaism and destroyed the particularist
                                        motivation of many of his fighters. Loss of military unity
                                        is a reflection of Alroy&#8217;s own loss of masculine

                                        proud, the invincible. And where is he? In a soft Paradise
                                        of girls and eunuchs, crowned with flowers, listening to
                                        melting lays, and the wild trilling of the amorous

                                    <li>Schirene&#8217;s eventual betrayal of Alroy is a final
                                        confirmation of the novel's mistrust of miscegenation.
                                        Indeed, it is only by reasserting his Jewish identity in
                                        martyrdom at the end of the novel that Alroy regains his
                                        heroic stature, reaffirming that &#8216;. . . my people
                                        stand apart from other nations, and ever will despite of
                                                suffering.&#8217;<sup><a

                                                >12</a></sup> In this final rejection of luxury for
                                        physical pain, Alroy reverses the identification with
                                        Schirene and re-establishes his masculine and Jewish
                                        &#8216;loneliness.&#8217; Yet it is only within
                                        christological terms that Disraeli is able to figure
                                        Alroy&#8217;s fall as triumphant. As the novel moves into
                                        its final phase, in which Alroy is captured and humiliated,
                                        the style shifts, using shorter, simpler sentences and
                                        explicit references to the life of Jesus:
                                            <blockquote>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A tear stole
                                            down his cheek; the bitter drop stole to his parched
                                            lips, he asked the nearest horseman for water. The guard
                                            gave him a wetted sponge, with which, with difficulty,
                                            he contrived to wipe his lips, and then he let it fall
                                            to the ground. The Karasmian struck him.<br/>
                                            &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They arrived at the river.
                                            The prisoner was taken from the camel and placed in a
                                            covered boat. After some hours, they stopped and
                                            disembarked at a small village. Alroy was placed upon a
                                            donkey with his back to its head. His clothes were
                                            soiled and tattered. The children pelted him with mud.
                                            An old woman, with a fanatic curse, placed a crown of
                                            paper on his brow. With difficulty his brutal guards
                                            prevented their victim from being torn to pieces. And in
                                            such fashion, towards noon of the fourteenth day, David
                                            Alroy again entered Bagdad.<sup><a

                                        intertext suggests that Disraeli, in searching for a
                                        narrative within whose terms Jewish suffering can be
                                        refigured as heroic, finds only the Christian Passion.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>If the novel is unable to conceive of Jewish toughness
                                        except in christological terms, it is also unable to
                                        maintain a notion of Jewish authenticity except in domestic
                                        terms. Only Alroy&#8217;s sister Miriam, a figure of
                                        domestic but not erotic love, succeeds in sustaining a
                                        Jewish identity uncompromised by ambition or bigotry. Unlike
                                        other definitions of Jewishness in the text, hers requires
                                        no political expression. National liberation means nothing
                                        to her: &#8216;For Miriam, exalted station had brought
                                        neither cares nor crimes. It had, as it were, only rendered
                                        her charity universal, and her benevolence
                                                omnipotent.&#8217;<sup><a
                                                href="#note14"
                                                >14</a></sup> In this text Disraeli represents
                                        feminine virtue as transcendent, independent of political
                                        status, unaffected by either oppression or autonomy.
                                        Disraeli&#8217;s eulogistic language (the novel was
                                        dedicated to his own sister) suggests that it is Miriam who
                                        alone maintains an authentic Jewish identity. The contrast
                                        with the corruption of Alroy is striking. The feminised,
                                        domesticated definition of Jewishness, which the
                                        Anglo-Jewish writer Grace Aguilar was to exploit so
                                        successfully during the 1840s, is here presented as a
                                        pragmatic and more enduring alternative to the romantic,
                                        militant and ultimately tragic political nationalism of
                                                Alroy.<sup><a

                                        concerns with the relationships between Jewishness,
                                        masculinity and national identity.</li>
