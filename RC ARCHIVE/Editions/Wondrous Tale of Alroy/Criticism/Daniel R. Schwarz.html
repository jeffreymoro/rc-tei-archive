                                    <li><i>Alroy</i> is Disraeli&#8217;s ultimate heroic fantasy. He
                                        uses the figure of the twelfth-century Jewish Prince, Alroy,
                                        as the basis for a tale of Jewish conquest and empire.
                                        Disraeli found the medieval world in which Alroy lived an
                                        apt model for some of his own values. He saw in that world
                                        an emphasis on imagination, emotion and tradition; respect
                                        for political and social hierarchies; and a vital spiritual
                                        life. Alroy anticipates Disraeli&#8217;s attraction for the
                                        Middle Ages in Young England. Writing of the flowering of
                                        medieval Jewry under Alroy enabled him to express his
                                        opposition to rationalism and utilitarianism.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>In fact, the historic Alroy was a self-appointed messiah in
                                        Kurdistan during a period of severe tribulation and unusual
                                        suffering for the Jews.<sup><a
                                                href="#note1"
                                                >1</a></sup> Alroy&#8217;s father claimed he was
                                        Elijah and that his son was the Messiah. Although his actual
                                        name was Menahem, young Alroy took the name David, the
                                        appropriate name for a king of the Jews, and promised to
                                        lead his followers to Jerusalem where he would be their
                                        king. Apparently learned in Jewish mysticism, Alroy managed
                                        to convince his followers that he could perform supernatural
                                        acts. While he scored some victories before he was murdered,
                                        probably by his father-in-law, his successes were hardly of
                                        the magnitude of his victories in Disraeli&#8217;s romance.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Since completing <i>Vivian Grey</i>, Disraeli had been
                                        fascinated by Alroy, the Jew who had achieved power and
                                        prominence during Jewish captivity. But perhaps he needed
                                        the inspiration of his 1831 trip to Jerusalem to finish
                                            <i>Alroy</i>. Disraeli wrote in the Preface to <i>The
                                            Revolutionary Epick</i> (1834) that the purpose of
                                            <i>Alroy</i> was &#8216;the celebration of a gorgeous
                                        incident in the annals of that sacred and romantic people
                                        from whom I derive my blood and name.&#8217;<sup><a
                                                href="#note2"
                                                >2</a></sup> Undoubtedly the tale of a Jew becoming
                                        the most powerful man in an alien land appealed to Disraeli,
                                        who at the age of twenty-nine had not yet made his political
                                        or artistic reputation. Indeed David Alroy&#8217;s first
                                        name evokes visions of the David and Goliath legend which
                                        embodies another victory for a Jewish underdog. Disraeli
                                        uses the factual Alroy as a basis for his romance, but he
                                        extends Alroy&#8217;s power and prowess and introduces
                                        supernatural machinery and ersatz Cabalistic lore and ritual.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Alroy represents Disraeli&#8217;s own dreams of personal
                                        heroism and political power in the alien British culture.
                                            <i>Alroy</i> embodies not only his concept of himself as
                                        a potential leader, but his notion that the nation requires
                                        strong, visionary leaders who are true to its traditional
                                        manners and customs. Criticising Peel, he wrote, &#8216;My
                                        conception of a great statesman is one who represents a
                                        great idea&#8212;an idea which may lead him to power; an
                                        idea with which he may identify himself; an idea which he
                                        may develop; an idea which he may and can impress on the
                                        mind and conscience of a nation.&#8217;<sup><a
                                                href="#note3"
                                                >3</a></sup> He felt that some men were born to
                                        lead, and believed that, like Alroy, he was one of these.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Doubtless Disraeli&#8217;s journey to Jerusalem stimulated
                                        his fantasies of revived Jewish hegemony. Moreover, he
                                        believed that the Jews are not only an especially gifted
                                        race but the most aristocratic of races.<sup><a
                                                href="#note4"
                                                >4</a></sup> He also believed that the Jewish race
                                        is the source of all that is spiritual in European
                                        civilisation, most notably Christianity. Disraeli&#8217;s
                                        only historical romance, except for &#8216;The Rise of
                                        Iskander&#8217; (1833), resulted from his desire to depict
                                        Jews on a heroic scale. But it also derives from the
                                        discrepancy between his aspirations and his position in the
                                        early 1830s. In Alroy&#8217;s hyperbolic self-dramatisation
                                        is the thinly disguised voice of the young frustrated
                                        Disraeli who has not yet begun to fulfil the &#8216;ideal
                                        ambition&#8217; of which he wrote in his diary. Yet with
                                        typical Disraelian emotional resilience, Alroy&#8217;s early
                                        self-pity and <i>ennui</i> give way to the vision of a
                                        transformation of his condition: &#8216;I linger in this
                                        shadowy life, and feed on silent images which no eye but
                                        mine can gaze upon, till at length they are invested with
                                        all the terrible circumstance of life, and breathe, and act,
                                        and form a stirring world of fate and beauty, time, and
                                        death, and glory&#8217; (Pt1Ch1).<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>As the romance opens, Alroy is lost in despair and self-pity
                                        because both he and his people pay tribute to the Moslem
                                        Caliph: &#8216;I know not what I feel, yet what I feel is
                                        madness. Thus to be is not to live, if life be what I
                                        sometimes dream, and dare to think it might be. To breathe,
                                        to feed, to sleep, to wake and breathe again, again to feel
                                        existence without hope; if this be life, why then these
                                        brooding thoughts that whisper death were better?&#8217;
                                        (Pt1Ch1). But the assault of the Moslem Lord Alschiroch upon
                                        Alroy&#8217;s sister Miriam arouses him to action and he
                                        kills the Lord. As he sleeps &#8216;dreaming of noble
                                        purposes and mighty hopes&#8217;, Miriam awakes him and
                                        warns him that he must flee his home and the wrath of the
                                        Moslems. He makes his way to Jabaster who recognises him as
                                        &#8216;the only hope of Israel&#8217; (Pt3Ch1). Alroy dreams
                                        that he has been anointed by the Lord to lead the Jews out
                                        of Captivity to their chosen land, Jerusalem. Jabaster tells
                                        him that the Cabala insists he must get the sceptre of
                                        Solomon before he can free the Jews: &#8216;None shall rise
                                        to free us, until, alone and unassisted, he have gained the
                                        sceptre which Solomon of old wielded within his cedar
                                        palaces&#8217; (Pt3Ch3). Alroy undertakes a traditional
                                        romance quest, including visions, mysterious appearances and
                                        disappearances, and encounters with spirits, before
                                        receiving the sceptre from Solomon&#8217;s own
                                        hand&#8212;only to see the King immediately disappear and to
                                        find himself transported once again to the company of
                                        Jabaster. Aided by Jabaster and the divinely inspired
                                        prophetess Esther, he begins to triumph. Beginning with a
                                        small band, he scores victory after victory and gradually
                                        conquers Bagdad. But at the height of his powers he falls in
                                        love with the Caliph&#8217;s daughter, Princess Schirene,
                                        and betrays his mission by marrying her and not continuing
                                        to Jerusalem. Jabaster opposes the marriage and his decision
                                        to remain as Caliph of Bagdad as a betrayal of his
                                        commitment to Jewish customs and traditions. Jabaster argues
                                        for &#8216;a national existence&#8217; and for
                                        re-establishing &#8216;our beauteous country, our holy
                                        creed, our simple manners, and our ancient customs&#8217;
                                        (Pt8Ch6), a position that looks forward to the
                                        traditionalism of Disraeli&#8217;s Young England movement
                                        and the concept of a nation that dominated his thinking when
                                        in office.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>When Alroy starts to enjoy his power and to savour his
                                        prominence, his visions and prophetic dreams cease and his
                                        decline begins. Eventually he loses a vital battle to the
                                        Karasmians and reenters Bagdad as a captive.
                                        Disraeli&#8217;s implication is that arrogance and
                                        self-conceit are incompatible with imaginative activity. The
                                        significance and frequency of his imaginative experience
                                        decline as he forgets God&#8217;s command and marries
                                        Schirene; the alliance with a Gentile ironically fulfils his
                                        identity as a second Solomon. When Alroy tells Jabaster,
                                        &#8216;We must leave off dreaming&#8217;, he renounces
                                        imagination, the very quality that has given him the
                                        capacity to achieve greatness. Alroy&#8217;s rationalism and
                                        worldliness betray the dream of rebuilding the temple which
                                        was the catalyst for his heroic activity. Alroy&#8217;s
                                        apostasy begins when he belittles Jerusalem and when he
                                        dismisses the Prophetess Esther as a &#8216;quaint
                                        fanatic&#8217; after she counsels him not to enter Bagdad,
                                        which she calls Babylon. He becomes concerned with secular
                                        matters, such as the need for a &#8216;marshal of the
                                        palace&#8217;, the position to which he appoints Honain
                                        (Pt8Ch2). He is captivated by the princess, whom he had
                                        previously rejected when he had first been tempted by her.
                                        At this point we recall not only the prophetess&#8217;
                                        denunciation of Bagdad, but Alroy&#8217;s own words to
                                        Honain: &#8216;I fly from this dangerous city upon
                                        [God&#8217;s] business, which I have too much
                                        neglected&#8217; (Pt5Ch6). Speaking the language of courtly
                                        love, he puts Schirene before his love for God, and
                                        renounces his heritage: &#8216;If the deep devotion of the
                                        soul of Alroy be deemed an offering meet for the shrine of
                                        thy surpassing loveliness, I worship thee, Schirene, I
                                        worship thee, I worship thee!&#8217; (Pt8Ch4).<br/>

                                    <li>In <i>Alroy</i> the evolving pattern of events and
                                        circumstances depends upon Alroy&#8217;s moral health,
                                        whereas we have seen in <i>Contarini Fleming</i> that the
                                        character&#8217;s visions and dreams, and on occasion actual
                                        events, depend on his psychological life. Alroy&#8217;s
                                        moral status <i>determines</i> the action. Such a pattern,
                                        in which a man&#8217;s behaviour shapes the world, enables
                                        Disraeli to reconcile the conflict between his own poetic
                                        and political ambition. For example, when Alroy has the
                                        confidence to restore Israel&#8217;s glory, he has the
                                        vision in which he fulfils his quest for the sceptre of
                                        Solomon. Or, when the trumpet sounds to signal the time for
                                        Alroy&#8217;s trial, Miriam in response to his disgrace
                                        dies. The Jewish participants in the alliance that overthrew
                                        Alroy are absent from the denouement, as if by their part in
                                        Alroy&#8217;s overthrow they deserve to be discarded from
                                        the romance.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>As with Contarini, Alroy&#8217;s visionary experience occurs
                                        in times of heightened awareness, but these states cease to
                                        occur during his complacent rule of Babylon. Alroy regains
                                        the capacity to experience the spectre of Jabaster when he
                                        recognises the vulnerability of his actual situation prior
                                        to the climactic battle: &#8216;I feel more like a doomed
                                        and desperate renegade than a young hero on the verge of
                                        battle, flushed with the memory of unbroken triumphs!'
                                        (Pt10Ch4). Alroy's imaginative powers recover as he begins
                                        to acknowledge his shortcomings and his unjust treatment of
                                        the prophetess and Jabaster. Before his battle with the
                                        rebels, he realises: &#8216;I am not what I was. I have
                                        little faith. All about me seems changed, and dull, and
                                        grown mechanical&#8217; (Pt10Ch5). Even though he knows
                                        Jabaster&#8217;s ghost is summoning him to his doom, he
                                        seems to welcome his presence; Alroy knowingly accepts as
                                        his retribution a pattern of events which will fulfil the
                                        prophecy of his own destruction: &#8216;A rushing destiny
                                        carries me onward. I cannot stem the course, nor guide the
                                        vessel&#8217; (Pt10Ch10). But at the height of his military
                                        successes, when he feels fulfilled as a public man, his
                                        imagination becomes less active because he has deviated from
                                        his purposes. At this point he condemns Abidan, one of his
                                        most loyal, if zealous, lieutenants as a
                                        &#8216;dreamer&#8217; and rejects the prophetess
                                        Esther&#8217;s visions (Pt8Ch1). When Alroy becomes a man of
                                        the world and forswears his imaginative experiences, he is
                                        already on the road to his undoing. His success derives from
                                        his faith, from his idealism, and from his powers of
                                        imagination that enable him to hear the Daughter of the
                                        Voice and to dream of Afrites. Condemning Abidan is
                                        tantamount to rejecting his former self. Gradually he ceases
                                        to be the Prince of Captivity, not because he fulfils his
                                        holy purpose of rebuilding the temple and restoring the Jews
                                        to Jerusalem, but because he becomes Caliph. Although
                                        Alroy&#8217;s religious faith had been his best political
                                        guide, he abandons that and begins to rely on reason:
                                            <blockquote>The world is mine: and shall I yield the
                                            prize, the universal and heroic prize, to realize the
                                            dull tradition of some dreaming priest, and consecrate a
                                            legend? He conquered Asia, and he built the temple. . .
                                            . Is the Lord of hosts so slight a God, that we must
                                            place a barrier to His sovereignty, and fix the
                                            boundaries of Onmipotence between the Jordan and the
                                            Lebanon? . . . Well, I am clearly summoned, I am the
                                            Lord&#8217;s servant, not Jabaster&#8217;s. Let me make
                                            His worship universal as His power; and where&#8217;s
                                            the priest shall dare impugn my faith, because His
                                            altars smoke on other hills than those of Judah?
                                            (Pt8Ch1)</blockquote> Alroy&#8217;s pride makes him
                                        believe that he is entitled to reinterpret the Lord&#8217;s
                                        calling. He relies on reason rather than inspiration;
                                        sophistry displaces imagination. At least through the Young
                                        England period, Disraeli believed in the imagination as a
                                        necessary guide to political wisdom. The limitations of
                                        reason are illustrated in <i>Popanilla</i> (1828),
                                        Disraeli&#8217;s satire of utilitarianism.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Jabaster and Abidan are dedicated to ideological purity
                                        whatever the consequences. In the name of theocracy, they
                                        reject Alroy&#8217;s power. Yet in their conspiracy against
                                        their leader, we may see Disraeli&#8217;s impatience with
                                        those who would limit the English King&#8217;s power. Later,
                                        this attitude became part of his coherent political
                                        philosophy in <i>A Vindication of the English
                                            Constitution</i> (1835). Abidan&#8217;s justification
                                        for regicide is a deliberate satire of Cromwell&#8217;s
                                        views: &#8216;King! Why what&#8217;s a king? Why should one
                                        man break the equal sanctity of our chosen race? Is their
                                        blood purer than our own? We are all the seed of
                                        Abraham&#8217; (Pt9Ch1). Just as Honain and Schirene tempt
                                        Alroy, Abidan tempts Jabaster by appealing to his vanity:
                                        &#8216;Thou ne&#8217;er didst err, but when thou placedst a
                                        crown upon this haughty stripling. . . . &#8217;Twas thy
                                        mind inspired the deed. And now he is king; and now
                                        Jabaster, the very soul of Israel, who should be our judge
                                        and leader, Jabaster trembles in disgrace . . .&#8217;
                                        (Pt9Ch1). Disraeli implies that the zealotry of Jabaster,
                                        who would massacre Moslems, is both inhumane and misguided,
                                        if for no other reason than that the wheel of fortune has a
                                        way of turning. Significantly, Alroy later recalls his own
                                        gentle rule as Caliph, when he is being subjected to cruel
                                        punishment; because he refuses to forswear his faith and
                                        insists that he is the Lord&#8217;s anointed, he dies a
                                        martyr&#8217;s death. Perhaps Disraeli wished to remind his
                                        primarily Christian audience that the Jews had a long
                                        tradition of being the victims of persecution.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Disraeli is ambivalent to Honain, Jabaster&#8217;s brother
                                        who has achieved prominence under the Caliph&#8217;s rule
                                        and who again is serving Alroy&#8217;s conquerors. On one
                                        hand, Honain&#8217;s equivocation represents a temptation
                                        that Alroy must reject. On the other hand, he is the
                                        ultimate pragmatist who counsels compromise in contrast to
                                        his brother&#8217;s ideological purity. His brother&#8217;s
                                        polar opposite, he lives by his own resources and eschews
                                        commitment to principles. As such, he is an heir to
                                        Beckendorff and Contarini&#8217;s father, whose creeds he
                                        suggests when he asserts, &#8216;We make our fortunes, and
                                        we call them Fate&#8217; (p. 106). Honain survives three
                                        Caliphs because his own welfare is at the centre of his
                                        value system. The very moment that Alroy rejects Jabaster he
                                        acknowledges the abilities of Honain, the man who lives by
                                        his wits: &#8216;I must see Honain. That man has a great

                                        Honain always counsels worldliness and, after Alroy&#8217;s
                                        capture, compromise. He is an example of the apostate Jew
                                        who has made his way in the world. Perhaps he is a
                                        projection of Disraeli&#8217;s view of his own
                                        father&#8217;s apostasy. Honain may also reflect
                                        Disraeli&#8217;s own troubled response to his Jewish roots.<br/>

                                    <li>If Contarini vacillates erratically between imagination and
                                        action, Disraeli shows in <i>Alroy</i> that the life of
                                        action is not incompatible with the imaginative life. For
                                        Alroy&#8217;s political success is dependent upon visions
                                        that show how a life of action need not exclude poetic and
                                        imaginative impulses. Alroy uses his imagination in the
                                        service of his political goals. For example, the catalyst
                                        for his original act of rebellion is his insight that, as
                                        &#8216;the descendant of sacred kings&#8217;, he is not
                                        suited for a life of activity (Pt1Ch1). His imagination
                                        creates the fiction of Jewish and personal glory. Killing
                                        the city governor Alschiroch who harassed his sister (his
                                        alter ego throughout the novel) is the necessary heroic
                                        action which takes him from the imaginative world into the
                                        public world.<br/>

                                    <li>That sexual motives play an important part in <i>Alroy</i>
                                        and often displace heroic and public motives is an
                                        indication of Disraeli&#8217;s worldliness and refusal to
                                        compromise his own complex vision of mankind&#8217;s motives
                                        and needs for the sake of the character who embodies his
                                        fantasy of Jewish eminence. Alroy&#8217;s conduct, including
                                        his tolerance of Moslem influence in his council, is shaped
                                        by his erotic interest in Schirene, the Gentile princess of
                                        Bagdad whom he eventually marries. The prophetess&#8217;s
                                        real motive for wishing to murder Alroy is not so much
                                        ideological purity as sexual jealousy. As she watches Alroy
                                        sleep, her monologue begins with the indictment that he is
                                        &#8216;a tyrant and a traitor&#8217; who has betrayed
                                        God&#8217;s trust. But like all those who think that they
                                        act under God&#8217;s auspices&#8212;Alroy, Abidan,
                                        Jabaster&#8212;she is not without pathetically human
                                        feelings and failings: &#8216;Hush my heart, and let thy
                                        secret lie hid in the charnel-house of crushed affections.
                                        Hard is the lot of woman: to love and to conceal is our
                                        sharp doom! O bitter life! O most unnatural lot! Man made
                                        society, and made us slaves. And so we droop and die, or
                                        else take refuge in idle fantasies, to which we bring the
                                        fervour that is meant for nobler ends' (Pt9Ch5).<br/>

                                    <li>Disraeli wants to create a context where the marvellous is
                                        possible. Moreover, he wishes to present himself as an
                                        original artist and to flout conventional expectations as to
                                        what a work of prose fiction should be. His use of rhythm
                                        and rhyme is part of his rebellion against artistic
                                        captivity, a captivity created by standards he did not
                                        recognise and by what he felt was failure to appreciate his
                                        genius. In the original preface to <i>Alroy</i>, Disraeli
                                        stressed the genius of his achievement, particularly the
                                        prose poetry. <i>Alroy</i> is written in a prophetic tone
                                        and biblical rhythms as if Disraeli were proposing this as
                                        his contribution to Jewish lore. The fastidious notes are in
                                        the tradition of talmudic learning that addresses texts as
                                        sacred and values scholarship as homage to God. That
                                            <i>Alroy</i> is written in metrical prose punctuated by
                                        what Disraeli called &#8216;occasional bursts of lyric
                                        melody&#8217;, is the primary reason for the remoteness of
                                        its prose from colloquial English.<sup><a
                                                href="#note5"
                                                >5</a></sup> Lyric interludes, sometimes in rhyme,
                                        certainly contribute to Disraeli&#8217;s efforts to create
                                        an ersatz orientalism based on artifice rather than mimesis:
                                        &#8216;The carol of a lonely bird singing in the wilderness!
                                        A lonely bird that sings with glee! Sunny and sweet, and
                                        light and clear, its airy notes float through the sky, and
                                        trill with innocent revelry&#8217; (Pt2Ch5). But the
                                        stylised dialogue, the vatic tone accompanying the spare
                                        plot, the supernatural machinery, the bizarre reversals of
                                        fortune, and the hyperbolic descriptions of setting all
                                        contribute to astonish the normal expectations that a reader
                                        brings to prose fiction. Thus the &#8216;wondrous&#8217;
                                        tale describes not only Alroy&#8217;s conquests, but the
                                        tale itself with its remarkable style and tone. While the
                                        style deprives us of Disraeli&#8217;s ironic wit and playful
                                        vivacity, the taut symmetrical plot, which accelerates as it
                                        reaches Alroy&#8217;s demise, shows progression in
                                        Disraeli&#8217;s mastery of narrative form. The subject is
                                        hardly conducive to his exuberant self-mockery or boisterous
                                        digressions. But, although the author takes himself as
                                        seriously as he ever does in any of his prose fiction,
                                        Disraeli&#8217;s propensity for elaborate description, which
                                        was so much of the fun of the first novels, finds an outlet
                                        in the wonders of life in Bagdad, as in the following
                                        passage: <blockquote>The line of domestics at the end of the
                                            apartment opened, and a body of slaves advanced,
                                            carrying trays of ivory and gold, and ebony and silver,
                                            covered with the choicest dainties, curiously prepared.
                                            These were in turn offered to the Caliph and the Sultana
                                            by their surrounding attendants. The Princess accepted a
                                            spoon made of a single pearl, the long, thin golden
                                            handle of which was studded with rubies, and
                                            condescended to partake of some saffron soup, of which
                                            she was fond. Afterwards she regaled herself with the
                                            breast of a cygnet stuffed with almonds, and stewed with
                                            violets and cream. . . . Her attention was then engaged
                                            with a dish of those delicate ortolans that feed upon
                                            the vine-leaves of Schiraz, and with which the Governor
                                            of Nishabur took especial care that she should be well
                                            provided. Tearing the delicate birds to pieces with the
                                            still more delicate fingers, she insisted upon feeding
                                            Alroy, who of course yielded to her solicitations.

                                    <li>Disraeli wanted to establish the authenticity of his
                                        wondrous tale. For that reason he created as his
                                        editor-speaker a Jewish historian and scholar. But he must
                                        have known that very few readers would discover that he had
                                        taken liberties with the Alroy legend and really knew only
                                        scattered bits and snips of the Cabala tradition. One
                                        wonders whether the notes are in part an elaborate joke at
                                        the expense of readers who would take the editor and
                                        themselves too seriously and accept what is often mumbo
                                        jumbo. Is there not a note of dead pan humour in the
                                        following from the 1845 preface: &#8216;With regard to the
                                        supernatural machinery of this romance, it is Cabalistical
                                        and correct&#8217;? Disraeli must have known that given the
                                        multiple and contradictory sources, it is impossible to be
                                        correct about either the legend of Alroy or the Cabala.
                                        According to the <i>Encyclopedia Judaica</i>, the Cabala is
                                        a general term for &#8216;esoterical teachings of Judaism
                                        and for Jewish mysticism&#8217;, but there is no accepted
                                        and correct &#8216;version&#8217;. And the factual record of
                                        Alroy and his movement is, according to the same source,
                                        &#8216;contradictory and tendentious&#8217;.<sup><a

                                        informed if rather abstruse knowledge of Jewish lore, the
                                        notes mediate between the text and the audience. The notes
                                        become part of the reading experience and give <i>Alroy</i>
                                        an authenticity as Jewish myth that it lacks as personal
                                        fantasy. Alroy fuses the myths of the Chosen People, of
                                        return to the homeland, and of the long awaited Messiah. As
                                        is appropriate in Judaic tradition, Alroy turns out to be a
                                        heroic man, but not without human limitations. His demise
                                        may be Disraeli&#8217;s unconscious affirmation of the
                                        Jewish tradition that the Messiah has not yet come to redeem

                                        Daniel interprets upon the wall to mean that God had weighed
                                        Belshazzar and his kingdom and found them wanting (Pt8Ch6).
                                        Significantly, Alroy regains the Jewish title, Prince of
                                        Captivity, after he is overthrown as Caliph. In his final
                                        suffering and humility, he has achieved the stature that the
                                        Jewish exiled Prince, Disraeli&#8217;s metaphor for himself, deserves.<br/>

                                    <li>The Jewish desire for a Messiah is not finally fulfilled,
                                        but Alroy has significance for others, and particularly
                                        other Jews, as a historical figure. Miriam&#8217;s epitaph
                                        suggests Carlyle&#8217;s notion of the value of an heroic
                                        figure: &#8216;Great deeds are great legacies, and work with
                                        wondrous usury. By what Man has done, we learn what Man can
                                        do; and gauge the power and prospects of our race. . . . The
                                        memory of great actions never dies&#8217; (P10Ch19).
                                        Disraeli the imaginative poet is the heir to Alroy the
                                        imaginative man. Perhaps, by telling his story of the Jew
                                        who rose to prominence in a foreign land, it became more
                                        plausible to imagine himself as a political leader. But if
                                        Alroy is an objectification of Disraeli&#8217;s ambition,
                                        does he not also reflect Disraeli&#8217;s anxieties and
                                        doubts, specifically his fear of his own sensual weakness
                                        and a certain paranoia about betrayal? Perhaps he wondered
                                        whether, like Daniel and Alroy, he would be found wanting
                                        when his opportunity came.<br/>

                                    <li>Yet <i>Alroy</i> indicates Disraeli&#8217;s commitment to
                                        his Jewish heritage. His surrogate, the narrator, glories in
                                        the Jewish victories and in the triumph of the Prince of
                                        Captivity over his oppressors. Disraeli&#8217;s notes, which
                                        are a fundamental part of reading <i>Alroy</i>, show not
                                        only his knowledge of Jewish customs, but his wide reading
                                        in Jewish studies. His notes not only demonstrate both to
                                            <i>himself</i> and his readers that he has the
                                        intellectual and racial credentials to narrate Jewish
                                        history and legend, but they give us the perspective of a
                                        Jewish scholar who is trying to provide an authoritative
                                        edition of the Alroy legend. Indeed, Miriam had anticipated
                                        the possibility of such a poet-editor: &#8216;Perchance some
                                        poet, in some distant age, within whose veins our sacred
                                        blood may flow, his fancy fired by the national theme, may
                                        strike his harp to Alroy&#8217;s wild career, and consecrate
                                        a name too long forgotten?' (P10Ch19).</li>
