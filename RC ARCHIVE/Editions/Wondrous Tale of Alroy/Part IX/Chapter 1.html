    <p>&#8216;They say Alroy gives a grand banquet in the serail tonight, and toasts his harlot &#8217;mid the thunderbolts. Is there no hand to write upon the wall? He is found wanting, he is weighed, and is indeed found wanting. The parting of his kingdom soon will come, and then, I could weep, oh! I could weep, and down these stern and seldom yielding cheeks pour the wild anguish of my desperate woe. So young, so great, so favoured! But one more step a God, and now a foul Belshazzar!</p>

    <p>&#8216;A year ago, this very night, it was the eve of battle, I stood within his tent to wait his final word. He mused a while, and then he said, &#8220;Good night, Jabaster!&#8221; I believed myself the nearest to his heart, as he has ever been nearest to mine, but that&#8217;s all over. He never says, &#8220;Good night, Jabaster,&#8221; now. Why, what&#8217;s all this? Methinks I am a child.</p>

    <p>&#8216;The Lord&#8217;s anointed is a prisoner now in the light grating of a bright kiosk, and never gazes on the world he conquered. Egypt and Syria, even farthest Ind, send forth their messengers to greet Alroy, the great, the proud, the invincible. And where is he? In a soft Paradise of girls and eunuchs, crowned with flowers, listening to melting lays, and the wild trilling of the amorous lute. He spares no hours to council; all is left to his prime favourites, of whom the leader is that juggling fiend I sometime called my brother.</p>

He goes not to the sacrifice; they say he keeps no fast, observes no ritual, and that their festive fantasies will not be balked, even by the Sabbath. I have not seen him thrice since the marriage. Honain has told her I did oppose it, and she bears to me a hatred that only women feel. Our strong passions break into a thousand purposes: women have one. Their love is dangerous, but their hate is fatal.</p>

Now all again was darkness; the wind suddenly subsided; in a few minutes the plash of the oars was audible, and the boat apparently stopped beneath the palace.
