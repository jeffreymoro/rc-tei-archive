    <p>&#8216;GO to the Caliph, good Honain, I pray thee, go. I can support myself, he needs thy counsel. Bid him not expose his precious life. The wicked men! Asriel must soon be here. What sayest thou?&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;&#8217;Tis at me they aim; it is I whom they hate. The High Priest, too! Ay, ay! Thy proud brother, good Honain, I have ever felt he would not rest until he drove me from this throne, my right; or washed my hated name from out our annals in my life&#8217;s blood. Wicked, wicked Jabaster! He frowned upon me from the first, Honain. Is he indeed thy brother?&#8217;</p>
