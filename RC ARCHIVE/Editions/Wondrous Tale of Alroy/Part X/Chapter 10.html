    <p>&#8216;Good news. Go fetch Abner. Haste! He&#8217;ll find me here anon. I&#8217;ll visit the camp awhile. Well, my brave fellows, you have hither come to conquer again with Alroy. You have fought before, I warrant, on the plain of Nehauend. &#8217;Tis a rich soil, and shall be richer with Karasmian gore.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;They are in good cue, and yet &#8217;twas a different spirit that inspired our early days. That I strongly feel. These are men true to a leader who has never failed them, and confident in a cause that leads to plunder. They are but splendid mercenaries. No more. Oh! where are now the fighting men of Judah! Where are the men who, when they drew their scimetars, joined in a conquering psalm of holy triumph! Last eve of battle you would have thought the field a mighty synagogue. Priests and altars, flaming sacrifices, and smoking censers, groups of fiery zealots hanging with frenzy on prophetic lips, and scaling with their blood and holiest vows a solemn covenant to conquer Canaan. All is changed, as I am. How now, Abner? You are well muffled!&#8217;</p>
