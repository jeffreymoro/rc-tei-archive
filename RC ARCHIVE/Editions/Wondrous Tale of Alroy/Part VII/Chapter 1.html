    <p>&#8216;Miriam, we have seen the best. Prepare yourself for sorrow, gentle girl. I care not for myself, for I am old, and age makes heroes of us all. I have endured, and can endure more. As we approach our limit, it would appear that our minds grow callous. I have seen my wealth, raised with the labours of a thoughtful life, vanish in a morn: my people, a fragile remnant, nevertheless a people, dispersed, or what is worse. I have wept for them, although no tear of selfish grief has tinged this withered cheek. And, were I but alone, ay! there's the pang. The solace of my days is now my sorrow.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;We know not when we are well. Our hours stole tranquilly along, and then we murmured. Prospering, we murmured, and now we are rightly stricken. The legend of the past is Israel&#8217;s bane. The past is a dream; and, in the waking present, we should discard the enervating shadow. Why should we be free? We murmured against captivity. This is captivity: this damp, dim cell, where we are brought to die.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;O! youth, rash youth, thy being is destruction. But yesterday a child, it seems but yesterday I nursed him in these arms, a thoughtless child, and now our house has fallen by his deeds. I will not think of it; &#8217;twill make me mad.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Never! I would have struck him myself. Brave boy, he did his duty; and I, I, Miriam, thy uncle, at whom they wink behind his back and call niggard, was I wanting in that hour of trial? Was my treasure spared to save my people? Did I shrink from all toil and trouble of that time? A trying time, my Miriam, but compared with this, the building of the Temple&#8212;&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Alroy has captured the harem of our governor, as they journeyed from Bagdad to this city, guarded by his choicest troops. And he has sent to offer that they shall be exchanged for you and for your household. And Hassan<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote93">*</a> has answered that his women shall owe their freedom to nothing but his sword. But, in the meantime, it is agreed between him and the messenger of your nephew, that both companies of prisoners shall be treated with all becoming courtesy. You, therefore, are remanded to your palace, and the trumpet is now sounding before the great mosque to summon all the host against Alroy, whom Hassan has vowed to bring to Hamadan dead or alive.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;The harem of the Governor, guarded too by his choicest troops! &#8217;Tis a great deed. He did remember us. Faithful boy! The harem of the Governor! his choicest troops! &#8217;Tis a very great deed. Methinks the Lord is with him. He has his great father&#8217;s heart. Only think of David, a child! I nursed him, often. Caleb! Can this be David, our David, a child, a girl? Yet he struck Alschiroch! Miriam! where is she? Worthy Caleb, look to your mistress; she has fallen. Quite gone! Fetch water. &#8217;Tis not very pure, but we shall be in our palace soon. The harem of the Governor! I can't believe it. Sprinkle, sprinkle. David take them prisoners! Why, when they pass, we are obliged to turn our heads, and dare not look. More water: I'll rub her hand. &#8217;Tis warmer! Her eyes open! Miriam, choice news, my child! The harem of the Governor! I'll not believe it!&#8217;<br/>
