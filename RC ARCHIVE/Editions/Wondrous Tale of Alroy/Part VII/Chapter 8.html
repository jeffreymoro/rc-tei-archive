    <p>&#8216;Wine, methinks, has a peculiarly pleasant flavour in a golden cup,&#8217; said the Guebre. &#8216;I got this little trifle today in the Bazaar,&#8217; he added, holding up a magnificent vase studded with gems.</p>

    <p>&#8216;Well, for my part, I am a moderate man,&#8217; exclaimed Calidas the Indian, &#8216;and would not injure even these accursed dogs of Turks. I have not cut my host&#8217;s throat, but only turned him into my porter, and content myself with his harem, his baths, his fine horses, and other little trifles.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Nothing,&#8217; said Calidas; &#8216;though to speak truth, I did not much believe in the efficacy of Solomon&#8217;s sceptre, till his Majesty clove the head of the valiant Seljuk with it.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;I had great fun with some Dervishes this morning,&#8217; said the Guebre. &#8216;I met one asking alms with a wire run through his cheek,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/autnotes.html#autnote58"><sup>58</sup></a> so I caught another, bored his nose, and tied them both together!&#8217;</p>
