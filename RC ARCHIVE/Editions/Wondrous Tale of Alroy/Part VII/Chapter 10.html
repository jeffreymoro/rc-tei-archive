    <p>THE extensive and important province of Aderbijan, of which Hamadan was the capital, was formed of the ancient Media. Its fate was decided by one battle. On the plain of Nehauend,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote115">*</a> Alroy met the hastily-raised levies of the Atabek of Kermanshah,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote116">*</a> and entirely routed them. In the course of a month, every city of the province had acknowledged the supremacy of the new Hebrew monarch, and, leaving Abner to complete the conquest of Louristan,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote117">*</a> Alroy entered Persia.</p>

    <p>The incredible and irresistible progress of Alroy roused Togrul, the Turkish Sultan of Persia,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote118">*</a> from the luxurious indolence of the palaces of Nishabur.<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote119">*</a> He summoned his emirs to meet him at the imperial city of Rhey,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote120">*</a> and crush, by one overwhelming effort, the insolent rebel.</p>

    <p>Religion, valour, and genius, alike inspired the arms of Alroy, but he was, doubtless, not a little assisted by the strong national sympathy of his singular and scattered people, which ever assured him prompt information of all the movements of his enemy. Without any preparation, he found agents in every court, and camp, and cabinet; and by their assistance, he anticipated the designs of his adversaries, and turned even their ingenuity to their confusion. The imperial city of Rhey was surprised in the night, sacked, and burnt to the ground. The scared and baffled emirs who escaped, flew to the Sultan Togrul, tearing their beards, and prophesying the approaching termination of the world. The palaces of Nishabur resounded with the imprecations of their master, who, cursing the Jewish dogs, and vowing a pilgrimage to Mecca, placed himself at the head of a motley multitude of warriors, and rushed upon the plains of Irak, to exterminate Alroy.</p>

    <p>The Persian force exceeded the Hebrew at least five times in number. Besides a large division of Seljuks, the Caucasus had poured forth its strange inhabitants to swell the ranks of the Faithful. The wild tribes of the Bactiari<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote121">*</a> were even enlisted, with their fatal bows, and the savage Turkmans, tempted by the sultan&#8217;s gold, for a moment yielded their liberty, and shook their tall lances in his ranks.</p>

    <p>But what is a wild Bactiari, and what is a savage Turkman, and what even a disciplined and imperious Seljuk, to the warriors of the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob? At the first onset, Alroy succeeded in dividing the extended centre of Togrul, and separating the greater part of the Turks from their less disciplined comrades. At the head of his Median cavalry, the Messiah charged and utterly routed the warriors of the Caucasus. The wild tribes of the Bactiari discharged their arrows and fled, and the savage Turkmans plundered the baggage of their own commander.</p>

    <p>The Turks themselves fought desperately; but, deserted by their allies, and surrounded by an inspired foe, their efforts were unavailing, and their slaughter terrible. Togrul was slain while heading a desperate and fruitless charge, and, after his fall, the battle resembled a massacre rather than a combat. The plain was glotted with Seljuk gore. No quarter was given or asked. Twenty thousand chosen troops fell on the side of the Turks; the rest dispersed and gained the mountains. Leaving Scherirah to restore order, Alroy the next morning pushed on to Nishabur at the head of three thousand horsemen, and summoned the city ere the inhabitants were apprised of the defeat and death of their sultan. The capital of Persia escaped the fate of Rhey by an inglorious treaty and a lavish tribute. The treasures of the Chosroes<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote122">*</a> and the Gasnevides were despatched to Hamadan, on which city day dawned, only to bring intelligence of a victory or a conquest.</p>

    <p>While Alroy dictated peace on his own terms in the palaces of Nishabur, Abner, having reduced Louristan, crossed the mountains, and entered Persia with the reinforcements he had received from Jabaster. Leaving the government and garrisoning of his new conquests to this valiant captain, Alroy, at the head of the conquerors of Persia, in consequence of intelligence received from Hamadan, returned by forced marches to that city.<br/>
