    <p>BEING at Jerusalem in the year 1831, and visiting the traditionary tombs of the Kings of Israel, my thoughts recurred to a personage whose marvellous career had, even in boyhood, attracted my attention, as one fraught with the richest materials of poetic fiction. And I then commenced these pages that should commemorate the name of ALROY.<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote1">*</a></p>

    <p>The Caliphate was in a state of rapid decay. The Seljukian Sultans,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote2">*</a> who had been called to the assistance of the Commanders of the Faithful,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote3">*</a> had become, like the Mayors of the palace in France, the real sovereigns of the Empire. Out of the dominions of the successors of the Prophet, they had carved four kingdoms, which conferred titles on four Seljukian Princes, to wit, the Sultan of Bagdad, the Sultan of Persia, the Sultan of Syria, and the Sultan of Roum, or Asia Minor.</p>

    <p>But these warlike princes, in the relaxed discipline and doubtful conduct of their armies, began themselves to evince the natural effects of luxury and indulgence. They were no longer the same invincible and irresistible warriors who had poured forth from the shores of the Caspian over the fairest regions of the East; and although they still contrived to preserve order in their dominions, they witnessed with ill-concealed apprehension the rising power of the Kings of Karasm&#233;,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote4">*</a> whose conquests daily made their territories more contiguous.</p>

    <p>With regard to the Hebrew people, it should be known that, after the destruction of Jerusalem, the Eastern Jews, while they acknowledged the supremacy of their conquerors,gathered themselves together for all purposes of jurisdiction, under the control of a native ruler, a reputed descendant of David, whom they dignified with the title of &#8216;The Prince of the Captivity.&#8217; If we are to credit the enthusiastic annalists of this imaginative people, there were periods of prosperity when the Princes of the Captivity assumed scarcely less state and enjoyed scarcely less power than the ancient Kings of Judah themselves. Certain it is that their power increased always in an exact proportion to the weakness of the Caliphate, and, without doubt, in some of the most distracted periods of the Arabian rule, the Hebrew Princes rose into some degree of local and temporary importance. Their chief residence was Bagdad, where they remained until the eleventh century, an age fatal in Oriental history, and from the disasters of which the Princes of the Captivity were not exempt. They are heard of even in the twelfth century. I have ventured to place one at Hamadan,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote5">*</a> which was a favourite residence of the Hebrews, from being the burial-place of Esther and Mordecai.<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote6">*</a></p>

    <p>With regard to the supernatural machinery of this romance, it is Cabalistical and correct. From the Spirits of the Tombs to the sceptre of Solomon, authority may be found in the traditions of the Hebrews for the introduction of all these spiritual agencies.</p>
