    <p>IT is the tender twilight hour, when maidens in their lonely bower, sigh softer than the eve! The languid rose her head upraises, and listens to the nightingale, while his wild and thrilling praises, from his trembling bosom gush: the languid rose her head upraises, and listens with a blush.</p>

    <p>In the clear and rosy air, sparkling with a single star, the sharp and spiry cypress-tree rises like a gloomy thought, amid the flow of revelry. A singing bird, a single star, a solemn tree, an odorous flower, are dangerous in the tender hour, when maidens in their twilight bower, sigh softer than the eve!</p>

    <p>The daughter of the caliph comes forth to breathe the air: her lute her only company. She sits her down by a fountain&#8217;s side, and gazes on the waterfall. Her cheek reclines upon her arm, like fruit upon a graceful bough. Very pensive is the face of that bright and beauteous lady. She starts; a warm voluptuous lip presses her soft and idle hand. It is her own gazelle. With his large and lustrous eyes, more eloquent than many a tongue, the fond attendant mutely asks the cause of all her thoughtfulness.</p>

I have avenged the insults of long centuries in the best blood of Asia; I have returned, in glory and in pride, to claim my ancient sceptre; but sweeter far than vengeance, sweeter far than the quick gathering of my sacred tribes, the rush of triumph and the blaze of empire, is this brief moment of adoring love, wherein I pour the passion of my life!</p>

Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter yielded her dusky beauty<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote144%E2%80%99)">*</a> to my great ancestor. Thy face is like the bright inspiring day!
