    With rose-red feathers moulted from her wing,<br/>
    Still scanty-sprinkled clouds, like lagging sheep,<br/>
    Some golden-fleeced, some streaked with delicate pink,<br/>
    Are creeping up the welkin, and behind<br/>
    The wind, their boisterous shepherd, whistling drives them,<br/>
    From the drear wilderness of night <b>to drink<br/>
    Antipodean noon</b>. . . .<br/></p><br/><hr/><br/>
    ACT IV, SCENE III.<br/><br/><p><i>Hesp.</i> . . . There is on earth<br/>
    one face alone, one heart, that Hesperus needs;<br/>

    I'll tell thee how we'll 'scape these prying eyes;<br/><a name="wall" id="wall"> </a><b>We'll build a wall between us and the world,</b><br/>

    ACT V, SCENE IV.<br/><p><i>The place of Execution.</i><br/></p><br/><p>HESPERUS, guarded, HUBERT, ORLANDO, Citizens, &amp;c.<br/></p><p><i>Hesp.</i> Now in the scornful silence of your features<br/>
    I see my hated self; my friends, I was<br/>
    The pestilence you think of--but to-night<br/>
    Angelic ministers have been with me,<br/>
    And by the holy communings of conscience<br/>
    Wrought a most blessed change; my soul has wept<br/>
    And lain among the thorns of penitence;<br/>
    I ask, (and you will not refuse the boon<br/>
    To one who cannot crave again) forgiveness<br/>
    For all that in the noontide of my crimes,<br/>
    Against you, even in thought, I have committed.<br/></p><p><i>Orl.</i> And we rejoice to grant it; and if prayers,<br/>
    In meek sincerity outpoured, avail,<br/>
    You have them from our hearts.<br/></p><p><i>Hesp.</i> Thy sister's soul spake in those words Orlando;<br/><a name="lone" id="lone"> </a>A wretch's blessing for them. I'm <b>as one<br/>
    In some lone watch-tower on the deep, awakened<br/>
    From soothing visions of the home he loves;<br/>
    Trembling he hears the wrathful billows whoop</b>,<br/>
    And feels the little chamber of his life<br/>
    Torn from its vale of clouds, and, as it falls,<br/>
    In his midway to fate, beholds the gleam<br/>
    Of blazing ships, some swallowed by the waves,<br/>
    Some, pregnant with mock thunder, tossed abroad,<br/>
    With mangled carcases, among the winds;<br/>
    And the black sepulchre of ocean, choaked<br/>
    With multitudinous dead; then shrinks from pangs<br/>
    Unknown but destined. All I know of death<br/>
    Is, that 'twill come. I have seen many die<br/>
    Upon the battle field, and watched their lips<br/>
    At the final breath, pausing in doubt to hear<br/>
    If they were gone. I have marked oftentimes<br/>
    Their pale eyes fading in the last blue twilight--<br/>
    But none could speak the burning agony,<br/>
    None told his feelings. I ne'er dreamed I died,<br/>
    Else might I guess the torture that attends it.<br/>
    But men unhurt have lost their several senses,<br/>
    Grown deaf, and blind, and dumb without a pang<br/>
    And surely these are members of the soul,<br/>
    And, when they fail, man tastes a partial death:<br/>
    Besides our minds share not corporeal sleep<br/>
    But go among the past and future, or perhaps<br/>
    Inspire another in some waking world,<br/>
    And there's another death.<br/>
    I will not fear; why do ye linger, guards?<br/>
    I've flung my doubts away, my blood grows wild.<br/></p><p><i>Hub.</i> The hour appointed is not yet arrived,<br/>
    Some moments we must wait: I pray you, patience.<br/></p><p><i>Enter</i> LORD ERNEST <i>in the dress of a peasant, followed by</i> CLAUDIO.<br/></p><p><i>Clau.</i> My lord, where dost thou hurry?<br/></p><p><i>L. Ern.</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To Despair;<br/>
    Away! I know thee not. Henceforth I'll live<br/>
    Those bitter days that Providence decrees me,<br/>
    In toil and poverty. Oh, son, loved son,<br/>
    I come to give thee my last tear and blessing;<br/>
    thou wilt not cures the old, sad wretch again?<br/></p><p><i>Hesp. (Falling upon the ground and covering himself with the loose earth.)</i><br/>
    Oh trample me to dust.<br/></p><p><i>L. Ern. (Lying down beside him.)</i><br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; My own dear child;<br/>
    Ay, we will lie thus sweetly in the grave,<br/>
    (The wind will not awake us, not the rain,)<br/>
    Thou and thy mother and myself; but I<br/>
    Alas! I have some tearful years to come,<br/>
    Without a son to weep along with me.<br/></p><p><i>Hesp.</i> Father! Dear father!<br/>
    And wilt thou pray for me? Oh, no! Thou canst not,<br/>
    Thou must forget or hate me.<br/></p><p><i>L. Ern.</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sirs, have pity;<br/>
    Let him not use me thus. Hesperus, Hesperus,<br/>
    Thou'rt going to thy mother; tell her, son,<br/>
    My heart will soon be broken; so prepare<br/>
    To have me with you. Bless thee, boy, good night. [<i>Exit.</i><br/></p><p><i>Hesp.</i> My father, heaven will curse thee if I bless;<br/>
    But I shall die the better for this meeting. [<i>Kneeling.</i><br/>
    Oh, Floribel! Fair martyr of my fury,<br/>
    Oh, thou blessed saint! Look down and see thy vengeance,<br/>
    And, if thy injured nature still can pity,<br/>
    Whisper some comfort to my soul. Tis done;<br/>
    I feel an airy kiss upon my cheek;<br/>
    It is her breath; she hears me; she descends;<br/>
    He spirit is around me. Now I'll die.<br/></p><p><i>Enter</i> LENORA.<br/></p><p><i>Len.</i> Where's Hesperus? Not gone? Speak to me loud,<br/>
    I hear not for the beating of my heart.<br/>
    We're not both dead? Say thou hast scaped the headsman,<br/>
    Nor felt the severing steel fall through thy neck.<br/></p><p><i>Hesp.</i> I stay one moment for the signal here,<br/>
    The next I am no more.<br/></p><p><i>Len.</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the we have conquered.<br/>
    Friend, leave us: I would speak a private word<br/>
    Unto thy prisoner. Look upon these flowers;<br/>
    They grew upon the grave of Floribel,<br/>
    And, when I pulled them, through their tendrils blew<br/>
    A sweet soft music, like and angel's voice.<br/>
    Ah! there's her eye's dear blue; the blushing down<br/>
    Of her ripe cheek in yonder rose; and there<br/>
    In that pale bud, the blossom of her brow,<br/>
    her pitiful round tear; here are all colours<br/>
    That bloomed the fairest in her heavenly face;<br/>
    Is't not her breath?<br/></p><p><i>Hesp. (smelling them.)</i> It falls upon my soul<br/>
    Like an unearthly sense.<br/></p><p><i>Len.</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And so it should,<br/>
    For it is Death thou'st quaffed:<br/>
    I steeped the plants in a magician's potion,<br/>
    More deadly than the scum of Pluto's pool,<br/>
    Or the infernal brewage that goes round<br/>
    From lip to lip at wizards' mysteries;<br/>
    One drop of it, poured in a city conduit,<br/>
    Would ravage wider than a year of plague;<br/>
    it brings death swifter than the lightning shaft.<br/></p><p><i>Hesp.</i> Tis true: I feel it gnawing at my heart,<br/>
    And my veins boil as though with molten lead.<br/>
    How shall I thank thee for this last, best gift?<br/></p><p><i>Len.</i> What is it rushes burning though my mouth?<br/>
    Oh! My heart's melted.--Let me sit awhile.<br/></p><p><i>Hub.</i> hear ye the chime? Prisoner, we must be gone;<br/>
    Already should the sentence be performed.<br/></p><p><i>Hesp.</i> On! I am past you power.<br/><i>(To Lenora.)</i> How farest thou now?<br/></p><p><i>Len.</i> Oh! Come with me, and view<br/>
    These banks of stars, the rainbow-girt pavilions,<br/>
    These rivulets of music--hark, hark, hark!<br/>
    And here are winged maidens floating round,<br/>
    With smiles and welcomes; this bright beaming seraph<br/>
    I should remember; is it not--my daughter? <i>[Dies.</i><br/></p><p><i>Hesp.</i> I see not those; but the whole earth's in motion;<br/>
    I cannot stem the billows; now they roll:<br/>
    And what's this deluge? Ah! Infernal flames! <i>[Falls.</i></p><p><i>Hub.</i> Guards, lift him up.<br/></p><p><i>Hesp.</i> The bloody hunters and their dogs! Avaunt!--<br/>
    Tread down these serpent's heads. Come hither, Murder;<br/>
    Why dost thou growl at me? Ungrateful hound!<br/>
    Not know thy master? Tear him off! Help! Mercy!<br/>
    Down with your fiery fangs!--I'm not dead yet. <i>[Dies.</i></p>
