<h3>John Wilson, from <a style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold" href="/editions/mws/lastman/bibliog.htm#wilson">City of the Plague</a></h3><br/><b>ACT I, SCENE II</b>.<br/><br/><i>A great square in the city.--A multitude of miserable men and women crowding round a person of a wild and savage appearance, dressed in a fantastical garb, with an hour-glass in his hand.</i><p><i>Astrologer.</i> The sun is going down, and when he sets,<br/>
    You know my accursed gift of prophecy<br/>
    Departeth from me, and I then become<br/>
    Blind as my wretched brethren. Then the Plague<br/>
    Riots in darkness 'mid his unknown victims,<br/>
    Nor can I read the names within his roll<br/>
    Now register'd in characters of blood.<br/>
    Come to me all ye wearied who would rest,<br/>
    Who would exchange the fever's burning pillow<br/>
    For the refreshing coolness of the grave!<br/>
    Come hither all ye orphans of a day,<br/>
    And I will tell you when your heads shall rest<br/>
    Upon your parents' bosoms. Yearn ye not<br/>
    To clasp their shroudless bodies, and to lie<br/>
    In the dark pit by love made beautiful!<br/>
    Where are ye veiled widows? in the tomb<br/>
    The marriage-lamp doth burn unquenchably.<br/>
    Dry up your tears, fair virgins! to the grave<br/>
    Betrothed in your pure simplicity!<br/>
    Still is one countenance beautiful in death,<br/>
    And it will lean to-night upon a breast<br/>
    White with the snows of perfect innocence.<br/>
    --I Call upon the wicked! let him shew<br/>
    His face among the crowd, and I will tell him<br/>
    His dreams of horror and his works of sin.<br/></p><p style="font-style: italic">[A man of a fierce and ferocious aspect advances from the crowd.]</p><p><i>Stranger.</i> I ask thee not, thou juggling driveller,<br/>
    Whether the Plague hath fix'd his eyes on me,<br/>
    Determin'd to destroy. Let them who fear<br/>
    Death and his pit, with pale beseeching hands<br/>
    Buy with their monies the awards of fate,<br/>
    And die in poverty. Thou speak'st of guilt,<br/>
    And know'st forsooth each secret deed of sin<br/>
    Done in the dark hour. Tell me, driveller!<br/>
    Where I, who lay no claim to honesty,<br/>
    Come by this gold. I'll give thee half of it<br/>
    If thou speak'st truly. Was there robbery?<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. Flee murderer I from my sight! I touch thy gold!<br/>
    'Twould stain my fingers! See the blood-gouts on it.<br/>
    Hither thou com'st in savage hardihood,<br/>
    Yet with a beating heart. I saw thee murder him;<br/>
    What were his silver hairs, his tremulous voice,<br/>
    His old blind eyes to thee!--Ha! shrinking off,<br/>
    Aw'd by a driveller! Seize the murderer!<br/>
    You will find the bloody knife---<br/></p><p style="font-style: italic">[The man rushes off, and all make way for him.]</p><p><i>Astrologer.</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Mine eyes at once<br/>
    Did read the murderer's soul.<br/></p><p><i>Voices from the crowd.</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Guilt nor disease<br/>
    Are hidden from his ken--he knows them all.<br/></p><p style="font-style: italic">[The women advance eagerly from the crowd.]</p><p><i>1st Woman.</i> Listen to me before that woman speaks.<br/>
    I went this morning to my lover's house,<br/>
    Mine own betrothed husband, who had come<br/>
    From sea two days ago. The house was empty;<br/>
    As the cold grave that longeth for its coffin<br/>
    'Twas damp and empty; and I shriek'd in vain<br/>
    On him who would not hear. Tell me his fate,<br/>
    Say that he lives, or say that he is dead--<br/>
    But tell me,--tell me, lest I curse my God,<br/>
    Some tidings of him; should'st thou see him lying<br/>
    Even in yon dreadful pit. Do you hear? speak, speak!<br/>
    O God!--no words can be so terrible<br/>
    As that mute face whose blackness murders hope,<br/>
    And freezes my sick soul. Heaven's curse light on thee,<br/>
    For that dumb mockery of a broken heart!<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer.</i> I see him not, some cloud envelopes him!<br/></p><p><i>Woman.</i> He hath left the city then, and gone on shipboard?<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer.</i> I see him not, some cloud envelopes him!<br/></p><p><i>Woman.</i>What! hast thou not a wond'rous glass that shews<br/>
    Things past, or yet to come? give me one look,<br/>
    That I may see his face so beautiful,<br/>
    Where'er it be; or in that ghastly pit,<br/>
    Or smiling 'mid his comrades on the deck,<br/>
    While favouring breezes waft his blessed ship<br/>
    Far from the plague, to regions of delight<br/>
    Where he may live for ever.<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer.</i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Is your lover<br/>
    A tall thin youth, with thickly-clustering locks,<br/>
    Sable and glossy as the raven's wing?<br/></p><p><i>Woman.</i> Yes! he is tall--I think that he is tall,<br/>
    His hair it is dark-brown--yes, almost black--<br/>
    Many call it black--you see him? Does he live?<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer.</i> That pit containeth many beautiful:<br/>
    But thy sailor in his warlike garb doth lie<br/>
    Distinguish'd o'er the multitude of dead!<br/>
    And all the crowd, when the sad cart was emptied,<br/>
    Did weep and sob for that young mariner;<br/>
    Such corpse, they thought, should have been buried<br/>
    Deep in the ocean's heart, and a proud peal<br/>
    Of thunder roll'd above his sinking coffin.<br/></p><p><i>Woman, (distractedly.)</i> Must l believe him? off, off to the pit!<br/>
    One look into that ghastliness,--one plunge:<br/>
    None ever lov'd me but my gentle sailor,<br/>
    And his sweet lips are cold--I will leap down.<br/></p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>[She rushes madly away.]</i></p><p><i>Voice from the crowd.</i> Aye, she intends to look before she leaps;<br/>
    Well--life is life--I would not part with it<br/>
    For all the girls in Christendom. Forsooth!<br/></p><p><i>2d Woman</i>. Say! will my child recover from the Plague?<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. Child! foolish woman! now thou hast no child.<br/>
    Hast thou not been from home these two long hours,<br/>
    Here listening unto that which touch'd thee not,<br/>
    And left'st thou not thy little dying child,<br/>
    Sitting by the fire, upon a madman's knee?<br/>
    Go home! and ask thy husband for thy child!<br/>
    The fire was burning fierce and wrathfully,<br/>
    Its father knew not that the thing he held<br/>
    Upon his knee had life--and when it shriek'd,<br/>
    Amid the flames, he sat and look'd at it,<br/>
    With fixed eyeballs, and a stony heart.<br/>
    Unnatural mother! worse than idiocy<br/>
    To leave a baby in a madman's lap,<br/>
    And yet no fetters from infanticide<br/>
    To save his murderous hands.<br/></p><p><i>Woman, (rushing away.)</i>&#160;&#160;&#160; O God! O God!<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. Come forward thou with that most ghostlike face,<br/>
    Fit for a winding-sheet! and if those lips<br/>
    So blue and quivering still can utter sounds,<br/>
    What would'st thou say? The motions of thine eyes<br/>
    Betoken some wild wish within thy heart.<br/></p><p style="font-style: italic">[A man comes forward, and lays down money before the Astrologer.]</p><p><i>Man</i>. I trust my hour is near. I am alone<br/>
    In this dark world, and I desire to die.<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. Thou shalt be kept alive by misery.<br/>
    A tree doth live, long after rottenness<br/>
    Hath eat away its heart: the sap of life<br/>
    Moves through its wither'd rind and it lives on;<br/>
    'Mid the green woods a rueful spectacle<br/>
    Of mockery and decay.<br/></p><p><i>Man</i>. &#160;&#160;&#160; I feel 'tis so.<br/>
    Thus have I been since first the Plague burst out,<br/>
    A term methinks of many hundred years!<br/>
    As if this world were hell, and I condemn'd<br/>
    To walk through woe to all eternity.<br/>
    I will do suicide.<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>.&#160;&#160; Thou can'st not fool!<br/>
    Thou lovest life with all its agonies:<br/>
    Buy poison, and 'twill lie for years untouch'd<br/>
    Beneath thy pillow, when thy midnight horrors<br/>
    Are at their worst. Coward! thou can'st not die<br/></p><p><i>Man</i>. He sees thy soul; a blast as if from hell<br/>
    Drives me back from the grave--I dare not die.<br/></p><p style="font-style: italic">[He disappears among the crowd, and a young and beautiful lady approaches the Astrologer.]</p><p>O man of fate! my lovely babes are dead!<br/>
    My sweet twin-babes! and at the very hour<br/>
    Thy voice predicted, did my infants lie.<br/>
    My husband saw them both die in my arms,<br/>
    And never shed a tear. Yet did he love them<br/>
    Even as the wretch who bore them in her womb.<br/>
    He will not speak to me, but ever sits<br/>
    In horrid silence, with his glazed eyes<br/>
    Full on my face, as if he lov'd me not--<br/>
    O God! as if he hated me! I lean<br/>
    My head upon his knees and say my prayers,<br/>
    But no kind word, or look, or touch is mine.<br/>
    Then will he rise and pace through all the rooms,<br/>
    Like to a troubled ghost, or pale-fac'd man<br/>
    Walking in his sleep. O tell me! hath the Plague<br/>
    E'er these wild symptoms? Must my husband perish<br/>
    Without the sense of his immortal soul?<br/>
    Or,--bless me for ever with the heavenly words,--I<br/>
    Say he will yet recover, and behold<br/>
    His loving wife with answering looks of love.<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. Where are the gold, the diamonds and the pearls,<br/>
    That erewhile, in thy days of vanity,<br/>
    Did sparkle, star-like, through the hanging clouds<br/>
    That shaded thy bright neck, that raven hair?<br/>
    Give them to me; for many are the poor,<br/>
    Nor shalt thou, Lady! ever need again<br/>
    This mortal being's frivolous ornaments.<br/>
    Give me the gold you promis'd; holiest alms<br/>
    Add not a moment to our number'd days,<br/>
    But the death of open-handed charity<br/>
    Is on a bed of down. Hast thou the gold?<br/></p><p><i>Lady</i>. All that I have is here. My husband gave me<br/>
    This simple necklace on my marriage-day.<br/>
    Take it! Here is a picture set in gold.<br/>
    The picture I may keep. O! that his face<br/>
    Were smiling so serenely beautiful,<br/>
    So like an angel's now!--O sacred ring!<br/>
    Which I did hope to wear within the tomb,<br/>
    I give thee to the poor. So may their prayers<br/>
    Save him from death for whose delightful sake<br/>
    With bliss I wore it, and with hope resign.<br/>
    Here, take them all, thou steward of the poor;<br/>
    Stern as thou art, thou art a holy man!<br/>
    I do believe thou art a holy man.<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. Lady, thou need'st this wedding-ring no more!<br/>
    Death with his lean and bony hand hath loosen'd<br/>
    The bauble from thy finger, and even now<br/>
    Thy husband is a corpse. O! might I say<br/>
    Thy beauty were immortal! But a ghost,<br/>
    In all the loveliness on earth it wore,<br/>
    Walks through the moonlight of the cemetery,<br/>
    And I know the shadow of the mortal creature<br/>
    Now weeping at my side.<br/></p><p style="font-style: italic">Enter FRANKFORT and WILMOT close to the Astrologer.</p><p><i>Frank</i>. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Amelia!<br/></p><p><i>Lady</i>. Ah me! whose soft kind voice is that I hear?<br/></p><p><i>Frank</i>. Frankfort! the playmate of thy infancy,<br/>
    The brother of thy womanhood, the friend<br/>
    Of thy dear husband, and the godfather<br/>
    Of thy sweet twins, heaven shield their innocence!<br/></p><p><i>Lady</i>. My babes are with their Saviour, and my husband<br/>
    Has gone with them to heaven. Lead, lead me hence!<br/>
    For the seer's stern and scowling countenance<br/>
    Is more than I can bear.<br/></p><p><i>Frank</i>.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; O grief! to think<br/>
    That one so dear to heaven, by Christ belov'd<br/>
    For a still life of perfect sinlessness,<br/>
    Should, in such sad delusion, court the ban<br/>
    Of this most savage liar, sporting thus<br/>
    With the broken spirit of humanity.<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. Welcome to London, storm-beat mariners!<br/>
    The city is in masquerade to-day,<br/>
    And, in good truth, the Plague doth celebrate<br/>
    A daily festival, with many a dance<br/>
    Fantastic, and unusual melody,<br/>
    That may not suit your ears accustom'd long<br/>
    To the glad sea-breeze, and the rousing airs<br/>
    Of martial music on your armed decks.<br/></p><p><i>Frank. to Wil</i>. Is this some wild enthusiast whom the times<br/>
    Have sent unto the light, deluding others<br/>
    By his own strong delusions, or some fiend<br/>
    Thirsting for gold even in the very grave?<br/></p><p><i>Wil</i>. With what a cruel face he looks at us!<br/></p><p><i>Frank</i>. If an impostor in the shadow of death<br/>
    Endangering thus thy soul, vile wretch! come down<br/>
    From thy tribunal built upon the fears<br/>
    Of agony, lest in thy seat of guile<br/>
    The Pest may smite thee! Lean on me, Amelia!<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. Scoff not at God's own delegate, Harry Frankfort!<br/>
    What though the burning fever of the west<br/>
    Hath spar'd thy bronzed face and stately form,<br/>
    A mightier Power is here; and he may smile,<br/>
    Ere the sun go down, upon thy bloated corpse.<br/>
    Not thus the maiden whom her sailor loves<br/>
    Despis'd me and my prophecies. Magdalene<br/>
    In snow-white raiment, like a maid that walk'd<br/>
    At the funeral of a maiden, she stood there,<br/>
    Even on the very stones beneath your feet,<br/>
    And ask'd of me her doom; but on this earth<br/>
    Thy Magdalene's beauty must be seen no more.<br/></p><p><i>Frank. to Wil</i>. The maid of whom he speaks lives far remote.<br/>
    In her father's cottage, near a silent lake<br/>
    Among the hills of Westmoreland, she breathes<br/>
    Happy and well her own sweet mountain air.<br/>
    Methinks I know his face. That harden'd eye<br/>
    Gleams through the dimness of my memory,<br/>
    I know not when nor where. Amelia, come<br/>
    And I will lead thee home. I hear the crowd<br/>
    Saying that thy husband is alive: may heaven<br/>
    For many a year preserve you to each other.<br/>
    Say, is my mother living?<br/></p><p><i>Lady</i>. God forgive me<br/>
    As I hope for my friend's forgiveness!<br/>
    I know not if she lives; for, oh! this Plague<br/>
    Hath spread an universal selfishness,<br/>
    And each house in its own calamity<br/>
    Stands single, shut from human fellowship<br/>
    By sullen misery and heart-withering fear.<br/></p><p><i>Voice from the crowd</i>. Look at the sorcerer! how his countenance<br/>
    Is fallen!--'tis distorted horribly!<br/>
    A shadow comes across it, like a squall<br/>
    Dark'ning the sea.<br/></p><p><i>Another voice</i>. Even thus I saw a man<br/>
    This very morning, stricken by the Plague,<br/>
    And in three hours he was a ghost. Disperse<br/>
    All ye who prize your lives! soon will the air<br/>
    Be foul with his dead body. Let us away!<br/></p><p style="font-style: italic">[The crowd disperse.]</p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. God's hand is on me. In my cruel guilt<br/>
    I perish. Frankfort, I have never seen<br/>
    Magdalene, the maid thou lovest. Look at me;<br/>
    Dost not remember Francis Bannerman<br/>
    On board the Thunderer?<br/></p><p><i>Frank</i>.&#160;&#160; &#160; Pardon to thy soul!<br/>
    Thou mad abuser of the gifts of heaven.<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. Oh! I am sick to death: my soul hath sunk<br/>
    At once into despair.<br/></p><p><i>Wil</i>. &#160;&#160; &#160; What dreadful groans!--<br/>
    O fatal is the blast of misery,<br/>
    When it hath forc'd its way into the soul<br/>
    Of harden'd cruelty! As when a storm<br/>
    Hath burst the gates of a thick-ribbed hold,<br/>
    And all its gloomy dungeons, in one moment,<br/>
    Are roaring like a hundred cataracts.<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. I have shed blood. Roll, roll ye mountain waves,<br/>
    Above that merciless ghost that walks the sea<br/>
    After our ship for ever! Shut thine eyes,<br/>
    Those glaring, bloodshot, those avenging eyes,<br/>
    And I will bear to feel thy skeleton-arms<br/>
    Twin'd round my heart, so that those eyes be shut!<br/>
    A ghost's wild eyes, that nothing can behold<br/>
    But the frighten'd aspect of its murderer!<br/>
    Unconscious they of ocean, air, and Heaven,<br/>
    But fix'd eternally, like hideous stars,<br/>
    On a shrieking soul whom guilt hath doom'd to Hell!<br/></p><p><i>Frank. to Wil</i>. The mutineer is raving of his crime.<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. Ha! ha! 'tis set within the ebb of flood<br/>
    Fifty feet high; and the iron'd criminal<br/>
    With a frantic face stands dumb upon the scaffold.<br/>
    The priest is singing psalms!--Curst be the eyes<br/>
    That see such idle shew--'tis all gone by!<br/>
    I fear not Hell, if that eternal Shape<br/>
    Meet me not there! Pray, pray not for me Frankfort,<br/>
    For I am deliver'd over to despair,<br/>
    And holy words are nought but mockery<br/>
    To him who knows that he must dwell for ever<br/>
    In regions darken'd by the wrath of God.<br/></p><p><i>Lady</i>. Let us leave this horrid scene!<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>. &#160;&#160; &#160; O might I hear<br/>
    That sweet voice breathing of forgiveness!<br/>
    Hush! hush! a voice once breath'd upon this earth<br/>
    That would have pleaded not in vain to Heaven,<br/>
    Even for a fiend like me. Thou art in Heaven,<br/>
    And knowest all thy husband's wickedness;<br/>
    So hide thy pitying eyes, and let me sink<br/>
    Without thy intercession to the depths<br/>
    Of unimagin'd woe!---O Christ! I die.<br/></p><p><i>Frank</i>. Most miserable end! an evil man<br/>
    Prostrating by a savage eloquence<br/>
    The spirits of the wretched--so that he<br/>
    Might riot on the bare necessities<br/>
    Of man's expiring nature--on the spoil<br/>
    Of the unburied dead! Most atheist-like!<br/>
    I know not how I can implore the grace<br/>
    Of God unto my soul!<br/></p><p><i>Astrologer</i>.&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; Eternal doom!<br/>
    The realms of Hell are gleaming fiery bright.<br/>
    What ghastly faces!--Christ, have mercy on me!<br/></p><p><i>Lady</i>. Wilt thou not lead me away, for I am blind!<br/>
    O Frankfort come With me--the Plague hath struck<br/>
    My husband into madness--and I fear him!<br/>
    O God! I fear the man whom I do love!<br/></p><p><i>Frank</i>. All--all are wretched--guilty--dead or dying;<br/>
    And all the wild and direful images<br/>
    That crowd, and wail, and blacken round my soul<br/>
    Have reconcil'd me to the misery<br/>
    Sent from my mother's grave. An hour of respite<br/>
    Is granted me while I conduct thee home:<br/>
    Then will I seek that grave, and 'mid the tumult<br/>
    Of this perturbed city sit and listen<br/>
    To a voice that in my noiseless memory<br/>
    Sings like an angel.<br/></p><p><i>Lady</i>. She is yet alive!<br/></p><p><i>Frank</i>. Thy voice is like the voice of Hope--Sweet friend,<br/>
    Be cheer'd, nor tremble so--for God is with us.<br/></p>
