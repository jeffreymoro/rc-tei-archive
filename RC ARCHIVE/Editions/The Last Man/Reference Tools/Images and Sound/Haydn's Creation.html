<h3>Haydn's "New Created World" (<i>The Creation</i>)</h3><br/><p>Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) composed his oratorio, <i>The Creation</i>, late in his career, between 1796 and 1798. The libretto, originally in English, is based on the biblical story and on Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>; it was translated into German by Baron Gottfried van Swieten. Haydn's <i>Creation</i> was first performed in 1798, but it had its London premi&#232;re in 1800, in Covent Garden Theatre. The archangels, a chorus, and Adam and Eve make up the singing parts, and these were in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries usually accompanied by a very large orchestra.</p><p>Mary Shelley's friend Vincent Novello, who was serving as chapel organist at the Portuguese Embassy at the time, arranged a vocal score with separate accompaniment for organ or piano in the 1820s--two excerpts of which, from a twentieth-century reprint, are included here: <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/hscore1.htm">[1]</a> the portion played in the sound clips below; and <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/hscore9.htm">[2]</a> the portion probably alluded to in the novel (III.7).</p><p>This is among the many works he played for Mary Shelley in 1823. <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/bibliog.htm#palacio">Jean de Palacio</a> and others have suggested, based on <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/mwsl.htm#novello">Shelley's letters</a> from this period, that Novello's music--particularly his playing of the <i>Creation</i>--inspired her composition of <i>The Last Man</i> as a whole. <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/i-10.htm#music">Music</a> is closely connected to imaginative creation in this novel of apocalyptic <i>un</i>creation, and Shelley explicitly refers to the Haydn (which, significantly, is played on the organ) in one crucial scene <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/iii-7.htm#organ">(III.7)</a>.</p><p>Here are two versions of a digital sample produced from Novello's score (number <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/hscore1.htm">[1]</a> above):</p><ul><li><a href="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/mws/lastman/schaos.wav"><img class="allimages" src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/mws/lastman/images/speaker.gif" alt=""/> brief sample</a> (296k)</li><li><a href="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/mws/lastman/chaos3.wav"><img class="allimages" src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/mws/lastman/images/speaker.gif" alt=""/> longer (and higher resolution) sample 2</a> (507k)</li></ul>
