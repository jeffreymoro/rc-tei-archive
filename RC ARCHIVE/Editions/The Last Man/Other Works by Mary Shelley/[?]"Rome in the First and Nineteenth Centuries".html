        Centuries</h2><br/><p><b>OPENING</b> that volume of Pinelli's etchings which
    contains his illustrations of the Roman history, I was somewhat struck with the
    frontispiece, or introductory picture, representing the worthy artist himself, as like
    as needs be, with his sailor-like neck-handkerchief and little cork-screw curls over his
    temples. By his side sat those eternal companions of his,--and no useless escort,
    believe me, to one who goes sketching in the Campagna di Roma,--two surly mastiffs, with
    their heads stuck together classically, like Cerberus of old. The artist seems in the
    act of listening, not very submissively, to a lady with a wolf at her feet; from which
    sign, joined with a helm and long rectilinear nose, I guessed her to represent no less a
    being than the Genius of Rome itself. Now, thinks I, if Mistress Rome be so
    condescending as to dictate a series of etchings to Signor Pinelli; why not,
    &amp;c?--the inference is plain. But the deuce of it is, that when one of these artists
    gets an outlandish idea in his head, he puts it upon canvass at once, without proem or
    prologue, referring the ignorant spectator to his noddle or his catalogue. With us
    penmen the law says otherwise. We can take no such leap into the marvellous; we are
    first of all to explain the why and the wherefore, and have no right to depict visions
    without first relating how we came to see them. And really so many authors have begun
    now-a-days by setting themselves asleep, that to commence dreaming in any original way
    has become a matter of much difficulty. To walk and fall asleep, to get drunk and fall
    asleep, to ride, to meditate, &amp;c. &amp;c. are all preoccupied; to dream without
    plagiarism is impossible. Your modern visionary is as perplexed rotatory as a dog
    looking for his pillow.</p><p>So, to make a long story short, I fell asleep.
    When?--Evening. Where?--The Coliseum; around the galleries and corridors of which I had
    been wandering and stumbling for a couple of hours, popping my head out of its arches,
    like the fox in Ossian, and marvelling how it came to pass that the columns which from
    below seemed about three or four feet high, had nearly that measure in thickness when I
    came to stand by their side. I had been also strangely pestered by two English dandies,
    the sound of whose creaking boots and clanking spurs broke every now and then the thread
    of my cogitations. Nor was the sight of them more agreeable: they were handsome, good
    figures, no doubt; with fine English oval faces, nowise inferior to the proudest Roman
    bust, and habited in the fashionable taste of Europe; yet for all this I wished them at
    the Land's-end; and turning from them and the internal ruins of the amphitheatre, which
    they were surveying, 1 sat me down in one of the arches. The carriages from the Lateran
    and the gate of St. John rolled beneath, small as mice, numerous, but unregarded by me.
    My gaze was on the Esquiline, the distant Aqueducts, and the more distant Alban hills,
    their blue mass interspersed with a thousand gay spots, that marked the villages and
    villas on their sides. The vesper bell of the Franciscan convent in the Palatine began
    to chime, and I to nod--till, as I said before, gentle reader, I was fairly
    asleep.</p><p>What a speedy architect is the imagination! I had not been five minutes in
    slumber ere the whole amphitheatre was restored to its original perfection, its ruins
    half rebuilt, its arches, steps, its galleries and vomitories, all complete. An hundred
    thousand Romans, in their "eternal shirts," occupied their seats of marble. Great was
    the acclamation, the rising and rustling of togas, as the Emperor entered, and an
    hundred thousand of the masters of the world turned with looks of awe and submission
    towards the seat of the Caesar. All was hushed as the gladiators entered. They began the
    combat bold and determined; but the too earnest countenance, and the quiver of the naked
    muscle, spoke, through all their fortitude, a nervousness that communicated itself to me
    in such a degree as to become absolute pain. I turned from the scene, methought, and
    abruptly retiring to the deserted corridor, in my vision seated myself on the very seat
    which I actually occupied, closing my ears against the shouts that welcomed the victor
    and smothered the groan of the dying.</p><p>The Emperor of the day, methought, was
    Domitian, the "<i>calvus Nero</i>" of Juvenal; and in my dreamy identification with his
    age, my thoughts were occupied with the scandalous and witty pictures of the satirist;
    above all, the enormous turbot, and his summoning of the council thereon; and by one of
    those digressions, which dreams make nothing of, I was for a moment brought to think of
    Billingsgate and the Common Council. But this merely <i>par parenth&#233;se</i>; for
    behold, methought two Romans, in tunic and toga, paced round the corridor of the
    amphitheatre, and stopped even at the window where I was sitting. As they looked to the
    left with mournful aspects down upon the Esquiline, I turned towards the spot that
    seemed the object of their regards, and observed the palace of Titus erect in all its
    splendour, of which modern antiquaries have but the foundation and the baths, and in so
    many centuries of research have not yet more than half cleared them out.</p><p>"Alas!"
    said one of the toga'd figures, "to what purpose have served the fates, the conquests,
    and glories of Rome, except to leave the happiness of the world dependent on the temper,
    the good or evil whim of one being: yesterday a Titus, to-day a Domitian."</p><p>The
    other Roman had not time to reply, ere, methought, the two aforesaid English dandies
    came and took their station at the self-same window; and for the coincidence I cannot
    account, save that from it extends the most delightful of all prospects over the
    Esquiline and the Campagna, to Praeneste, the Alban hills, and Mount Algidus far in the
    distance.</p><p>My toga'd and my breeched companions seemed either not to see or not to
    acknowledge each other, as eighteen centuries difference in people's ages generally
    breeds a coldness between them, not to be overcome upon a first meeting. They talked,
    however, apart, Roman to Roman, Briton to Briton; and strange confusion certainly they
    made to me, who heard, as well as two ears could take in, all four.</p><br/><table

                the Capitoline Jupiter is to be rebuilt. Blessed be the fire of Vitellius
                that consumed the temple of the god, profaned by the foot of slaves! Its
                floor thick with ashes, its blackened and unroofed columns, form now the
                most appropriate temple for our
                deities."</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>"Speak not so loud, Publius,
                beware--some lurking spy may betray us to the Emperor."</p><p>"True, 'tis
                now a crime to be a Roman. Better far be a Syrian or Sarmatian, as our poet
                says or come a painted savage from the inhospitable Britain."</p><p>When
                were you in the forum?"</p><p>"But now I passed it. There was a whisper of
                the last batch of senators strangled. Their bodies lay under the Gemonian. I
                turned from them to the Temple of Concord, and exclaimed--O shade of Cicero,
                do the labours of the virtuous end in this!"</p><p>"Yet I have hopes of the
                Emperor--the arch he is finishing in honour of his brother, the virtuous
                Titus--"</p><p>"Long vowed, it could not be delayed. Besides, how unworthy a
                trophy of the conqueror of Jerusalem; --its pettiness disgraces the
                triumphal way."</p><p>"A strange religion, that of these banished Jews and
                Christians. 'Tis said, they worship an invisible spirit, to whom they
                sacrifice with prayers alone and inward meditations. They have no
                temples."</p><p>"Nor ever will in Rome, I trust. Gods multiply with
                bondsmen. When all our emperors are deities, methinks I would not take the
                road towards heaven."</p><p>"Caesar Domitian will doubtless take his seat in
                Olympus."</p><p>Would he were there!"</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>But how
                prospereth the state? Heard you nothing as you passed the Forum? The
                legions---"</p><p>"All's quiet in the East; the memory of Titus lives to awe
                the Orientals into obedience. Gaul and Britain bow submissively beneath our
                yoke. And, save some troubles on the Dacian frontier, there seems nought to
                dread."</p><br/><p>"Say, hope. I wish, by Jove, that the British savages
                would rise: perhaps the Emperor, like another Claudius, might set off and
                gather cockle-shells against them."</p><br/><p>"They may be even with us
                some of these days and the Britons of future ages may come to gather
                cockles, or as worthless trifle, in the ruins of
                Rome."</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>"Nay, when that shall be the case,
                their wicker London shall be more magnificent than our imperial city, their
                galleys bolder and more numerous, their armies braver, and the riches of the
                East shall flow to Thule, not to Rome. Impossible! look out upon the
                Esquiline, not a spot uncovered by a palace:--mark but this amphitheatre on
                which we stand! Are these memorials of a fleeting race? Or shall the
                barbarous nations of the North e'er raise their standards over imperial
                Rome? Thou mightest as well prophesy that humane letters shall be cultivated
                in Caledonia, or the muse of Catullus spring up in the chill and unknown
                Ierne."</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>"But the games are over;
                let us descend, and walk towards the Circus."</p><br/><br/><p>"What a
                mountain of palaces in this well-entitled Palatine. Here in this
                magnificence your arguments are answered: think you a nation could ever
                become obscure in the midst of such memorials? And the Circus with its
                throng of women, sooth-sayers, chapmen, and <i>quidnuncs</i>--has not life a
                strong-hold in this swarm?"</p><p>"It may he desert, as the palace of our
                first tyrant."</p><p>"Wisely did Octavian turn yon palace of his building
                towards this seat of shows and pleasure, afar and distant from the Forum,
                the sight of which might have excited disloyal sentiments in the breasts of
                his new-born courtiers."</p><p>"Boding begets boding--an augur's vision
                breaks upon me, and methinks I see, even on yon Palatine, the plaster hovel
                of the barbarian surmount the crumbled palace of the
                Caesar!"</p><br/><br/><br/><p>"Go to--and yet I blame thee not; Domitian
                reigns. Let us on toward the river, and along beneath the Aventine. A midst
                the bustle of the crowded quay we shall forget these melancholy thoughts.
                But what new building is this?"</p><p>"An arch of Janus that Domitian
                builds!"</p><br/><br/><br/><p>"I should not have thought the glutton a lover
                of the arts, or ornamenter of the city."</p><p>"Nay, who built like
                Nero?--besides, this is the market, a place peculiarly under the divine
                protection of his Imperial
                Serenity."</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>"Here is Vesta; let
                us pay our adoration to the oldest and purest deity of the Republic--but
                you're a sceptic."</p><br/><br/><br/><p>"I but just thought Mars' altar
                might be the most appropriate deity of our orisons at present. If you be a
                lover of the old gods, here is Juno's famous temple above us on the
                Aventine. For me, there's quite divinity enough in the scene before us.
                Behold the Tiber and Sublician bridge. Spirit of Cocles, which of our
                divinities can boast of virtues equal to thy patriotism and
                courage?"</p><p>"Well, I press you not; and here is food enough for
                enthusiasm in your kind of political religion. Yonder lie the gardens of
                Caesar and the grove of the Furies, sacred with the blood of
                Gracchus."</p><p>"What mean you by political
                religion?"</p><p>"Patriotism."</p><p>"And you love it not?"</p><p>"Not as
                religion. When our commonwealth was in its glory, then love of it was indeed
                religion; it was the love of something truly divine. But now we need a
                substitute, and some less earthly one than the selfish and moral religion of
                our living poet, who preaches,<br/> 'Nullum numen abest, sisit
                prudentia.'"</p><br/></td>
        <td width="250" align="center" valign="top"><br/><b>BRITONS.</b><p>"Will you come to
                vespers in Ara Coeli?--the church is on the site of the temple of the
                Capitoline Jupiter. It is the monks' feast-day, and their <i>bambino</i>, or
                waxen image of Jesus, which fell to them all the way from Heaven, is to be
                exposed: why, do you not know it?--That barn-looking place, crowning a huge
                Jacob's ladder of steps, to the left as you ascend the Campidoglio, brick
                without and gold within, the begging friars own it."</p><p>"Speak reverently
                of the <i>bambino</i>, my honest fellow, if you do not want to be stoned by
                the friars."</p><p>"Friars, indeed! Egad, I'd like to see pope or cardinal,
                that dare wag his little finger against an Englishman!"</p><p>"Did you see
                the hole that the Duchess of Devonshire is making in the Forum?"</p><p>Yes,
                l hear the butchers and graziers swear vengeance against her for cutting up
                their market-place. Fea is as busy with his galley-slaves rooting in the
                Temple of Concord. But what arch is that, the blocks of which strew the road
                from this to the Forum?"</p><p>The Arch of Titus: it was crumbling to decay;
                'tis now taken down and about to be re-erected by the Pope."</p><p>"Pius,
                The Roman pontiff, restoring the arch erected to the conqueror of the Jews,
                after an interval of eighteen centuries, is striking. How little its
                builders could have foreseen!"</p><p>"Little indeed--that a priest of that
                same religion or its consequence should sit on the throne of the Caesars,
                and, assuming the self-same title with the Emperors of Pontifex Maximus,
                should re-establish more ridiculous mummeries than ever were invented by the
                caprices of Paganism. How many churches, think you, are in
                Rome?"</p><p>"From three to four hundred, I suppose; yet not half enough for
                the Iegion of saints, which each demand one."</p><p>"Pope Pius is to be
                sainted."</p><p>"Doubtless: his miracles at Fontainebleau, 'tis said, are
                numerous. A curious one Fra Raffaelli assured me of, that he had made the
                Empress Maria Louisa pregnant--by his payers."</p><p>"Were you at the
                saddler's in the Piazza, to-day, to see the English
                papers?"</p><p>"Yes,--full of hubble, bubble, toil and trouble. Laments over
                enslaved Rome and self-liberating Greece. Spain, too, all the rage--what we
                might, and what we won't do. We seem upon the bullying
                system."</p><p>"Pretty bullying. Like the two legged lion in Pyramus and
                Thisbe, we roar you, an' it were as soft as a sucking dove. Does his
                Holiness intend, I wonder, raising troops against the
                Spaniards?"</p><p>"Doubtless, if the weather be fine, and their umbrellas
                not out of order. The Swiss Guards of his Holiness, in their harlequin hose
                and doublet, would make good fight. I am thinking, if any of the old Romans
                were to pop up their heads, and see their military successors, how amazed
                they must be."</p><p>"Equally amazed, methinks, to see us here, lords of the
                ascendant,<br/> The glass of fashion, and the mould of
                form--'<br/></p><p>scattering our pearls among the crouching Romans, and
                rich enough to afford being doubly cheated by them, (the greatest comfort of
                being rich, by the by). The second coming of the Gauls in 1797 must also
                astonish them not a little, especially as those same Gauls came not to
                destroy, but to unbury and rebuild. And that Britain should have prevented
                Rome from becoming a province of this same Gaul, giving it up to a Christian
                Pontifex Maximus--verily, this might make Tully rub his eyes."</p><p>"Let us
                be off:--the monk below has ceased his preaching and the crowd has ceased to
                kneel and bray in the old arena. Let's saunter over the
                Palantine."</p><p>"Why, we should have our shins broke passing through the
                rubbish, or our throats cut, which is worse. Not a soul dwells upon it,
                except a few Franciscans, and our countryman Mills."</p><p>"No matter, we'll
                soon get over it. into the Circus."</p><p>"Worse and worse. and more lonely.
                How gloomily the Palantine overhangs us, now we are in the Circus; and this
                villa, is it not Mill's?"</p><p>"Ay! it belongs to Mr. Mills, or Sir William
                Gell, who have the honour of residing over the palace of Augustus. The
                saloons of the Roman Emperor, even yet fresh with their gilding, serve as
                cool subterranean wine-cellars to the English baronet, who with the King of
                Naples and the Irish Franciscans, shares the lorddom of the
                Palatine."</p><p>"Let us come on, I'm in an exploring humour; and
                moonlight,<br/></p><p>'Hallowing tree and tower,'<br/></p><p>will shed more
                interest on the scene. Let us visit the Cloaca."</p><p>"Truly an interesting
                visit to the great sewer. But even a sink becomes venerable by age. What's
                this?"</p><p>"The Arco di Giano, a queer kind of a little old market-house,
                built by Domitian, says Venuti."</p><p>"Domitian! 'tis strange, that
                although all the Romans, both bad and good, were extravagantly given to
                building, yet it is with few exceptions the fabrics of the virtuous that
                have survived. Who built so much as Nero? yet of his works there remains
                scarce a relic. Architecture seems to have had more discernment than History
                in bestowing immortality. Whilst the stupendous undertaking of a Nero and a
                Collegially have disappeared and left no trace, the names of Agrippa, of
                Titus, Trajan, Antoninus, and Constantine still live to fame in unperishing
                records of marble. And this pretty little columned affair--is it a
                watch-box?"</p><p>"A watch-box!--seest thou not its Corinthian columns? 'Tis
                a temple of Vesta. Yonder is the Ripa, a prison for all prostitutes
                unlicensed by the priesthood; and beneath it, the ruins of the Sublician
                bridge. Do you remember the prayer of Cocles, <i>pater
                Titurinus</i>?"</p><p>"Ay, and esteem the prayer more worthy than that of
                the modern Roman to his waxed and wigged saint. Wordsworth has uttered the
                sentiment sublimely, &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'd rather be<br/> A Pagan

    external, documentary proof exists for her authorship, but the 1824 work is obviously
    relevant to <i>The Last Man</i> in any case.</p>
<p><a name="n2">[2]</a> Henry Colburn (d. 1855) was introduced to Mary Shelley by her
    father, William Godwin. He was publisher of <i>The Last Man</i> in 1826. But before that
    he may have published Mary Shelley's short fiction; in 1824 she may have published (see note above) "Rome in the
        First and Nineteenth Centuries" in Colburn's <i>New Monthly Magazine and
        Political Register</i>, a periodical he had started in 1814.</p><p>Colburn is famous
    as the publisher--and brazen promoter--of fashionable society novels, including those
    known as the "Silver Fork School." From 1835-41 he brought out a series of "Colburn's
    Modern Standard Novelists" in nineteen volumes. This contained works by Bulwer Lytton,
    Lady Morgan (Sydney Owenson), Horace Smith, <a
        href="/editions/mws/lastman/lister.htm">T. H. Lister</a>, Theodore Hook, and
    others. Benjamin Disraeli was also one of Colburn's authors.</p>
<p><a name="n3">[3]</a> There is no evidence that this translation, signed "S," is the work
    of Mary Shelley (who, at any rate, is not known to have used this signature).</p>
