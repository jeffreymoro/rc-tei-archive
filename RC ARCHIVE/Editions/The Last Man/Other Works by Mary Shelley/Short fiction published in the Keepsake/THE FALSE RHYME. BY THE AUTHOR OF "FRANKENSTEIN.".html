        &#160;&#160; --THOMAS MOORE.</p><br/><br/><p>ON a fine July day, the fair Margaret, Queen of
            Navarre, then on a visit to her royal brother, had arranged a rural feast for the
            morning following, which Francis declined attending. He was melancholy; and the cause
            was said to be some lover's quarrel with a favourite dame. The morrow came, and dark
            rain and murky clouds destroyed at once the schemes of the courtly throng. Margaret was
            angry, and she grew weary: her only hope for amusement was in Francis, and he had shut
            himself up--an excellent reason why she should the more desire to see him. She entered
            his apartment: he was standing at the casement, against which the noisy shower beat,
            writing with a diamond on the glass. Two beautiful dogs were his sole companions. As
            Queen Margaret entered, he hastily let down the silken curtain before the window, and
            looked a little confused.</p><p>"What treason is this, my liege," said the queen, "which
            crimsons your cheek? I must see the same."</p><p>"It is treason," replied the king, "and
            therefore, sweet sister, thou mayest not see it."</p><p>This the more excited Margaret's
            curiosity, and a playful contest ensued: Francis at last yielded: he threw himself on a
            huge high-backed settee; and as the lady drew back the curtain with an arch smile, he
            grew grave and sentimental, as he reflected on the cause which had inspired his libel
            against all womankind.</p><p class="center"><img height="313" width="242"

            Heath<br/> FRANCIS THE FIRST &amp; HIS SISTER<br/></p><br/><p>"What have we here?" cried
            Margaret: "nay, this is <a href="#n1">l&#234;se</a>
            majest&#233;--<blockquote>'Souvent femme varie,<br/> Bien fou qui s'y fie!'</blockquote>Very
            little change would greatly amend your couplet:-- would it not run better
            thus--<blockquote>'Souvent homme varie,<br/> Bien folle qui s'y fie?'</blockquote>I could tell
            you twenty stories of man's inconstancy."</p><p>"I will be content with one true tale of
            woman's fidelity," said Francis, drily; "but do not provoke me. I would fain be at peace
            with the soft Mutabilities, for thy dear sake."</p><p>"I defy your grace," replied
            Margaret, rashly, "to instance the falsehood of one noble and well reputed
            dame."</p><p>"Not even Emilie de Lagny?" asked the king.</p><p>This was a sore subject
            for the queen. Emilie had been brought up in her own household, the most beautiful and
            the most virtuous of her maids of honour. She had long loved the Sire de Lagny, and
            their nuptials were celebrated with rejoicings but little ominous of the result. De
            Lagny was accused but a year after of traitorously yielding to the emperor a fortress
            under his command, and he was condemned to perpetual imprisonment. For some time Emilie
            seemed inconsolable, often visiting the miserable dungeon of her husband, and suffering
            on her return, from witnessing his wretchedness, such paroxysms of grief as threatened
            her life. Suddenly, in the midst of her sorrow, she disappeared; and inquiry only
            divulged the disgraceful fact, that she had escaped from France, bearing her jewels with
            her, and accompanied by her page, Robinet Leroux. It was whispered that, during their
            journey, the lady and the stripling often occupied one chamber; and Margaret, enraged at
            these discoveries, commanded that no further quest should be made for her lost
            favourite.</p><p>Taunted now by her brother, she defended Emilie, declaring that she
            believed her to be guiltless, even going so far as to boast that within a month she
            would bring proof of her innocence.</p><p>"Robinet was a pretty boy," said Francis,
            laughing.</p><p>"Let us make a bet," cried Margaret: "if I lose, I will bear this vile
            rhyme of thine as a motto to my shame to my grave; if I win---"</p><p>"I will break my
            window, and grant thee whatever boon thou askest."</p><p>The result of this bet was long
            sung by troubadour and minstrel. The <a href="#n2"
                >Queen</a> employed a hundred emissaries--published rewards for any intelligence of
            Emilie--all in vain. The month was expiring, and Margaret would have given many bright
            jewels to redeem her word. On the eve of the fatal day, the jailor of the prison in
            which the Sire de Lagny was confined sought an audience of the Queen; he brought her a
            message from the knight to say, that if the Lady Margaret would ask his pardon as her
            boon, and obtain from her royal brother that he might be brought before him, her bet was
            won. Fair Margaret was very joyful, and readily made the desired promise. Francis was
            unwilling to see his false servant, but he was in high good humour, for a cavalier had
            that morning brought intelligence of a victory over the Imperialists. The messenger
            himself was lauded in the despatches as the most fearless and bravest knight in France.
            The king loaded him with presents, only regretting that a vow prevented the soldier from
            raising his visor or declaring his name.</p><p>That same evening as the setting sun
            shone on the lattice on which the ungallant rhyme was traced, Francis reposed on the
            same settee, and the beautiful Queen of Navarre, with triumph in her bright eyes, sat
            beside him. Attended by guards, the prisoner was brought in: his frame was attenuated by
            privation, and he walked with tottering steps. He knelt at the feet of Francis, and
            uncovered his head; a quantity of rich golden hair then escaping, fell over the sunken
            cheeks and pallid brow of the suppliant. "We have treason here!" cried the king: "sir
            jailor, where is your prisoner?"</p><p>"Sire, blame him not," said the soft faltering
            voice of Emilie; "wiser men than he have been deceived by woman. My dear lord was
            guiltless of the crime for which he suffered. There was but one mode to save him:--I
            assumed his chains--he escaped with poor Robinet Leroux in my attire--he joined your
            army: the young and gallant cavalier who delivered the despatches to your grace, whom
            you overwhelmed with honours and reward, is my own Enguerrard de Lagny. I waited but for
            his arrival with testimonials of his innocence, to declare myself to my lady, the Queen.
            Has she not won her bet? And the boon she asks----"</p><p>"Is de Lagny's pardon," said
            Margaret, as she also knelt to the king: "spare your faithful vassal, sire, and reward
            this lady's truth."</p><p>Francis first broke the false <a
                href="#n3">speaking-window</a>, then he raised the
            ladies from their supplicatory posture.</p><p>In the tournament given to celebrate this
            "Triumph of Ladies," the Sire de Lagny bore off every prize; and surely there was more
            loveliness in Emilie's faded cheek--more grace in her emaciated form, type as they were
            of truest affection--than in the prouder bearing and fresher complexion of the most
            brilliant beauty in attendance on the courtly festival.</p>
