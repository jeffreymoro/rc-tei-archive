<h3>Thomas Campbell, <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/bibliog.htm#campbell">"The Last Man"</a></h3><br/><p>ALL worldly shapes shall melt in gloom,<br/>
    &#160;&#160;The Sun himself must die,<br/>
    Before this mortal shall assume<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Its Immortality!<br/>
    I saw a vision in my sleep<br/>
    That gave my spirit strength to sweep<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Adown the gulf of Time!<br/>
    I saw the last of human mould,<br/>
    That shall Creation's death behold,<br/>
    &#160;&#160; As Adam saw her prime!<br/></p><p>The Sun's eye had a sickly glare,<br/>
    &#160;&#160; The Earth with age was wan,<br/>
    The skeletons of nations were<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Around that lonely man!<br/>
    Some had expired in fight,--the brands<br/>
    Still rested in their bony hands;<br/>
    &#160;&#160; In plague and famine some!<br/>
    Earth's cities had no sound nor tread;<br/>
    And ships were drifting with the dead<br/>
    &#160;&#160; To shores where all was dumb!<br/></p><p>Yet, prophet-like, that lone one stood<br/>
    &#160;&#160; With dauntless words and high,<br/>
    That shook the sere leaves from the wood<br/>
    &#160;&#160; As if a storm passed by,<br/>
    Saying, "We are twins in death, proud Sun,<br/>
    Thy face is cold, thy race is run,<br/>
    &#160;&#160; 'Tis Mercy bids thee go.<br/>
    For thou ten thousand thousand years<br/>
    Hast seen the tide of human tears,<br/>
    &#160;&#160; That shall no longer flow.<br/></p><p>"What though beneath thee man put forth<br/>
    &#160;&#160; His pomp, his pride, his skill;<br/>
    And arts that made fire, floods, and earth,<br/>
    &#160;&#160; The vassals of his will;--<br/>
    Yet mourn not I thy parted sway,<br/>
    Thou dim discrowned king of day:<br/>
    &#160;&#160; For all those trophied arts<br/>
    And triumphs that beneath thee sprang,<br/>
    Healed not a passion or a pang<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Entailed on human hearts.<br/></p><p>"Go, let oblivion's curtain fall<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Upon the stage of men,<br/>
    Nor with thy rising beams recall<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Life's tragedy again.<br/>
    Its piteous pageants bring not back,<br/>
    Nor waken flesh, upon the rack<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Of pain anew to writhe;<br/>
    Stretched in disease's shapes abhorred,<br/>
    Or mown in battle by the sword,<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Like grass beneath the scythe.<br/></p><p>"Ee'n I am weary in yon skies<br/>
    &#160;&#160; To watch thy fading fire;<br/>
    Test of all sumless agonies<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Behold not me expire.<br/>
    My lips that speak thy dirge of death--<br/>
    Their rounded gasp and gurgling breath<br/>
    &#160;&#160; To see thou shalt not boast.<br/>
    The eclipse of Nature spreads my pall,--<br/>
    The majesty of Darkness shall<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Receive my parting ghost!<br/></p><p>"This spirit shall return to Him<br/>
    &#160;&#160; That gave its heavenly spark;<br/>
    Yet think not, Sun, it shall be dim<br/>
    &#160;&#160; When thou thyself art dark!<br/>
    No! it shall live again, and shine<br/>
    In bliss unknown to beams of thine,<br/>
    &#160;&#160; By Him recalled to breath,<br/>
    Who captive led captivity.<br/>
    Who robbed the grave of Victory,--<br/>
    &#160;&#160; And took the sting from Death!<br/></p><p>"Go, Sun, while Mercy holds me up<br/>
    &#160;&#160; On Nature's awful waste<br/>
    To drink this last and bitter cup<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Of grief that man shall taste--<br/>
    Go, tell the night that hides thy face,<br/>
    Thou saw'st the last of Adam's race,<br/>
    &#160;&#160; On Earth's sepulchral clod,<br/>
    The darkening universe defy<br/>
    To quench his Immortality,<br/>
    &#160;&#160; Or shake his trust in God!"<br/></p>
