<h3>Thomas Lovell Beddoes, <a style="font-style: italic" href="/editions/mws/lastman/bibliog.htm#beddoes">The Last Man</a></h3><a href="/editions/mws/lastman/beddnote.htm">[Ed. 1890 from holograph MSS. fragments]</a><br/><br/><b>DIANEME <i>and female attendants</i>.</b><br/><p><i>Dianeme</i>.<br/></p><p>SING on, sing ever, and let sobs arise<br/>
    Beneath the current of your harmony,<br/>
    Breaking its silvery stillness into gushes<br/>
    Of stealing sadness: let tears fall upon it,<br/>
    And burst with such a sound, as when a lute-string,<br/>
    Torn by the passion of its melody,<br/>
    Gasps its whole soul of music in one sound,<br/>
    And dies beneath the waves of its own voice!<br/>
    Be pale thou mooned midnight, and ye stars<br/>
    Shed fluttering tremours of inconstant light<br/>
    Upon the moaning billows; timid leaves<br/>
    O'erwhelm yourselves with shadow, and give out<br/>
    Your dewy titterings to the air no more!<br/>
    Clouds, clouds, dark, deadly clouds, let not the moon<br/>
    Look on his grave!--It is too light: the day<br/>
    Will rise before I die: how old is evening?<br/></p><p><i>Attend</i>. The tide of darkness now is at its height.<br/>
    Yon lily-woven cradle of the hours<br/>
    Hath floated half her shming voyage, nor yet<br/>
    Is by the current of the mom opposed.<br/></p><p><i>Dianeme</i>. The hour is coming: I must give my soul<br/>
    To the same moment on whose precious air<br/>
    My Casimir soared heavenward, for I know<br/>
    There are a million chambers of the dead,<br/>
    And every other minute but the same<br/>
    Would bear me to the one where he is not,<br/>
    And that were madness. Bring me yon sick lily,--<br/>
    Yon fevered one.<br/></p><p><i>Attend</i>. Choose any other, lady,<br/>
    For this is broken, odourless, and scorched,--<br/>
    Where Death has graved his curse.<br/></p><p><i>Dianeme</i>. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Give it to me;<br/>
    I'll weep it full. I have a love for flowers:<br/>
    Guess you not why ? Their roots are in the earth,<br/>
    And, when the dead awake, or talk in sleep,<br/>
    These hear their thoughts and write them on their leaves<br/>
    For heaven to look on: and their dews come down<br/>
    From the deep bosom of the blue, whereon<br/>
    The spirits linger, sent by them perchance<br/>
    With blessings to their friends. Besides all night<br/>
    They are wide-waking, and the ghosts will pause,<br/>
    And breathe their thoughts upon them. There,<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160; poor blossom,<br/>
    My soul bedews thee, and my breast shall be<br/>
    Thy death-bed, and our deaths shall intertwine.<br/>
    Now, maids, farewell; this is the very echo<br/>
    Of his expiring time; one snowy cloud<br/>
    Hangs, like an avalanche of frozen light,<br/>
    Upon the peak of night's cerulean Alp,<br/>
    And yon still pine, a bleak anatomy,<br/>
    Flows, like a river, on the planet's disk.<br/>
    With its black, wandering arms. Farewell to all:<br/>
    There is my hand to weep on.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Now my soul<br/>
    Developes its great beams, and, like a cloud<br/>
    Racked by the mighty winds, at once expands<br/>
    Into a measureless, immortal growth.<br/>
    Crescented night, and amethystine stars,<br/>
    And day, thou god and glory of the heavens,<br/>
    Flow on for ever! Play, ye living spheres,<br/>
    Through the infinity of azure wafted<br/>
    On billowy music! Airs immortal, strew<br/>
    Your tressed beauty on the clouds and seas!<br/>
    And thou the sum of these, nature of all,<br/>
    Thou providence pervading the whole space<br/>
    Of measureless creation; thou vast mind,<br/>
    Whose thoughts these pageantries and seasons are,<br/>
    Who claspest all in one imagination,<br/>
    All hail! I too am an eternity;<br/>
    I am an universe. My soul is bent<br/>
    Into a girdling circle full of days;<br/>
    And my fears rise through the deep sky of it,<br/>
    Blossoming into palpitating stars;<br/>
    And suns are launched, and planets wake within me;<br/>
    The words upon my breath are showery clouds,<br/>
    Sailing along a summer; Casimir<br/>
    Is the clear truth of ocean, to look back<br/>
    The beams of my soft love, the world to turn<br/>
    Within my blue embrace. I am an heaven,<br/>
    And he my hreezes, rays, and harmony;<br/>
    'Round and around the curvous atmosphere<br/>
    Of my own real existence I revolve<br/>
    Serene and starry with undying love.<br/>
    I am, I have been, I shall be, O glory!<br/>
    An universe, a god, a living Ever.<br/></p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; [<i>She dies</i>.</p><hr/><b>RECOGNITION.</b><br/><p>SOFT! Stand away! those features--Do not stir!<br/>
    Be breathless if thou canst! . . The trembling ray<br/>
    Of some approaching thought, I know not what,<br/>
    Gleams on my darkened mind. It will be here<br/>
    Directly: now I feel it growing, growing,<br/>
    Like a man's shadow, when the sun floats slowly<br/>
    Through the white border of a baffled cloud:<br/>
    And now the pale conception furls and thickens.<br/>
    'Tis settled,--Yes--Beroe!--How dare thy cheek<br/>
    Be wan and withered as a wrinkling moon<br/>
    Upon the tumbled waves? Why cam'st thou here?<br/>
    I dreamt of thee last night, as thou wert once,<br/>
    But I shall never dream of thee again.<br/></p><hr/><b>RECEPTION OF EVIL TIDINGS.</b><br/><p>WHAT'S this? Did you not see a white convulsion<br/>
    Run through his cheek and fling his eye-lids up?<br/>
    There's mischief in the paper.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Mark again<br/>
    How, with that open palm, he shades his brain<br/>
    From its broad, sudden meaning. Once I saw<br/>
    One who had dug for treasure in a corner<br/>
    Where he, by torchlight, saw a trembling man<br/>
    Burying a chest at night. Just so he stood<br/>
    With open striving lips and shaking hair;<br/>
    Alive but in his eyes, and they were fixed<br/>
    On a smeared, earthly, bleeding corpse--his sister,<br/>
    There by her murderer crushed into the earth.<br/></p><hr/><b>A RUFFIAN.</b><br/><p>THERE'S a fellow<br/>
    With twisting root-like hair up to his eyes,<br/>
    And they are streaked with red and starting out<br/>
    Under their bristling brows; his crooked tusks<br/>
    Part, like a hungry wolf's, his cursing mouth;<br/>
    His head is frontless, and a swinish mane<br/>
    Grows o'er his shoulders:--brown and warty hands,<br/>
    Like roots, with pointed nails.--He is the man.<br/></p><hr/><b>RECOLLECTION OF EARLY LIFE.</b><br/><p>LEAF after leaf, like a magician's book<br/>
    Turned in a dragon-guarded hermitage<br/>
    By tress-disheveling spirits of the air,<br/>
    My life unfolds.<br/></p><hr/><b>A CROCODILE.</b><br/><p>HARD by the lilied Nile I saw<br/>
    A duskish river-dragon stretched along,<br/>
    The brown habergeon of his limbs enamelled<br/>
    With sanguine almandines and rainy pearl:<br/>
    And on his back there lay a young one sleeping,<br/>
    No bigger than a mouse; with eyes like beads,<br/>
    And a small fragment of its speckled egg<br/>
    Remaining on its harmless, pulpy snout;<br/>
    A thing to laugh at, as it gaped to catch<br/>
    The baulking, merry flies. In the iron jaws--<br/>
    Of the great devil-beast, like a pale soul<br/>
    Fluttering in rocky hell, lightsomely flew<br/>
    A snowy troculus, with roseate beak<br/>
    Tearing the hairy leeches from his throat.<br/></p><hr/><b>"BONA DE MORTUIS."</b><br/><p>AY, ay: <i>good man, kind father, best of friends--</i><br/>
    These are the words that grow, like grass and nettles,<br/>
    Out of dead men, and speckled hatreds hide,<br/>
    Like toads, among them.<br/></p><hr/><b>ROSILY DYING.</b><br/><p>I'LL take that fainting rose<br/>
    Out of his breast; perhaps some sigh of his<br/>
    Lives in the gyre of its kiss-coloured leaves.<br/>
    O pretty rose, hast thou thy flowery passions?<br/>
    Then put thyself into a scented rage,<br/>
    And breathe on me some poisonous revenge.<br/>
    For it was I, thou languid, silken blush,<br/>
    Who orphaned thy green family of thee,<br/>
    In their closed infancy: therefore receive<br/>
    My life, and spread it on thy shrunken petals,<br/>
    And give to me thy pink, reclining death.<br/></p><hr/><b>SPEAKER'S MEANING DIMLY DESCRIED.</b><br/><p>I KNOW not whether<br/>
    I see your meaning: if I do, it lies<br/>
    Upon the wordy wavelets of your voice,<br/>
    Dim as an evening shadow in a brook,<br/>
    When the least moon has silver on't no larger,<br/>
    Than the pure white of Hebe's pinkish nail.<br/></p><hr/><b>ANTICIPATION OF EVIL TIDINGS.</b><br/><p>I FEAR there is some maddening secret<br/>
    Hid in your words, (and at each turn of thought<br/>
    Comes up a skull,) like an anatomy<br/>
    Found in a weedy hole, 'mongst stones and roots<br/>
    And straggling reptiles, with his tongueless mouth<br/>
    Telling of murder.<br/></p><hr/><b>MIDNIGHT HYMN.</b><br/><p>AND many voices marshalled in one hymn<br/>
    Wound through the night, whose still translucent moments<br/>
    Lay on each side their breath; and the hymn passed<br/>
    Its long, harmonious populace of words<br/>
    Between the silvery silences, as when<br/>
    The slaves of Egypt, like a wind between<br/>
    The head and trunk of a dismembered king<br/>
    On a strewn plank, with blood and footsteps sealed,<br/>
    Vallied the unaccustomed sea.<br/></p><hr/><b>CONCEALED JOY.</b><br/><p>JUST now a beam of joy hung on his eye-lash;<br/>
    But, as I looked, it sunk into his eye,<br/>
    Like a bruised worm writhing its form of rings<br/>
    Into a darkening hole.<br/></p><hr/><b>LIFE A GLASS WINDOW.</b><br/><p>LET him lean<br/>
    Against his life, that glassy interval<br/>
    'Twixt us and nothing; and, upon the ground<br/>
    Of his own slippery breath, draw hueless dreams,<br/>
    And gaze on frost-work hopes. Uncourteous Death<br/>
    Knuckles the pane, and * * *<br/></p><hr/><b>A DREAM.</b><br/><p>LAST night I looked into a dream; 'twas drawn<br/>
    On the black midnight of a velvet sleep,<br/>
    And set in woeful thoughts; and there I saw<br/>
    A thin, pale Cupid, with bare, ragged wings<br/>
    Like skeletons of leaves, in autumn left,<br/>
    That sift the frosty air. One hand was shut,<br/>
    And in its little hold of ivory<br/>
    Fastened a May-morn zephyr, frozen straight,<br/>
    Made deadly with a hornet's rugged sting,<br/>
    Gilt with the influence of an adverse star.<br/>
    Such was his weapon, and he traced with it,<br/>
    Upon the waters of my thoughts, these words:<br/>
    "I am the death of flowers, and nightingales,<br/>
    And small-lipped babes, that give their souls to summer<br/>
    To make a perfumed day with: I shall come,<br/>
    A death no larger than a sigh to thee,<br/>
    Upon a sunset hour." --And so he passed<br/>
    Into the place where faded rainbows are,<br/>
    Dying along the distance of my mind;<br/>
    As down the sea Europa's hair-pearls fell<br/>
    When, through the Cretan waves, the curly bull<br/>
    Dashed, tugging at a stormy plough, whose share<br/>
    Was of the northern hurricane--<br/></p><hr/><b>METAPHOR OF RAIN.</b><br/><p>A N amorous cloud<br/>
    Lets down her rustling hair over the sun.<br/></p><hr/><b>MEDITATION.</b><br/><p>THE bitter past<br/>
    And the untasted future I mix up,<br/>
    Making the present a dream-figured bowl<br/>
    For the black poison, which is caked and moulded,<br/>
    By the inside of the enchasing thoughts,<br/>
    Even as I taste it.<br/></p><hr/><b>SWEET TO DIE.</b><br/><p>IS it not sweet to die? for, what is death,<br/>
    But sighing that we ne'er may sigh again,<br/>
    Getting at length beyond our tedious selves;<br/>
    But trampling the last tear from poisonous sorrow,<br/>
    Spilling our woes, crushing our frozen hopes,<br/>
    And passing like an incense out of man?<br/>
    Then, if the body felt, what were its sense,<br/>
    Turning to daisies gently in the grave,<br/>
    If not the soul's most delicate delight<br/>
    When it does filtrate, through the pores of thought<br/>
    In love and the enamelled flowers of song?<br/></p><hr/><b>EXTREME ACCLIVITY.</b><br/><p>ITS impossible ascent was steep,<br/>
    As are the million pillars of a shower<br/>
    Torn, shivered, and dashed hard against the earth,<br/>
    When Day no longer breathes, but through the hours<br/>
    The ghost of chaos haunts the ruined sky.<br/></p><hr/><b>RAIN.</b><br/><p>THE blue, between yon star-nailed cloud<br/>
    The double-mountain and this narrow valley<br/>
    Is strung with rain, like a fantastic lyre.<br/></p><hr/><b>LIFE'S UNCERTAINTY.</b><br/><p><i>A</i>. THE king looks well, red in its proper place<br/>
    The middle of the cheek, and his eye's round<br/>
    Black as a bit of night.<br/></p><p><i>B</i>.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet men die suddenly:<br/>
    One sits upon a strong and rocky life,<br/>
    Watching a street of many opulent years,<br/>
    And Hope's his mason. Well I to-day do this<br/>
    And so to-morrow; twenty hollow years<br/>
    Are stuffed with action:--lo! upon his head<br/>
    Drops a pin's point of time; tick! quoth the clock,<br/>
    And the grave snaps him.<br/></p><p><i>A</i>.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such things may have been;<br/>
    The crevice 'twixt two after-dinner minutes,<br/>
    The crack between a pair of syllables,<br/>
    May sometimes be a grave as deep as 'tis<br/>
    From noon to midnight in the hoop of time.<br/>
    But for this man, his life wears ever steel<br/>
    From which disease drops blunted. If indeed<br/>
    Death lay in the market-place, or were--but hush!<br/>
    See you the tremble of that myrtle bough?<br/>
    Does no one listen?<br/></p><p><i>B</i>.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nothing with a tongue:<br/>
    The grass is dumb since Midas, and no AEsop<br/>
    Translates the crow or hog. Within the myrtle<br/>
    Sits a hen-robin, trembling like a star,<br/>
    over her brittle eggs.<br/></p><p><i>A</i>. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Is it no more?<br/></p><p><i>B</i>. Nought: let her hatch.<br/></p><hr/><b>KISSES.</b><br/><p>HER kisses are<br/>
    Soft as a snow-tuft in the dewless cup<br/>
    Of a redoubled rose, noiselessly falling<br/>
    When heaven is brimful of starry night.<br/></p><hr/><b>SUBTERRANEAN CITY.</b><br/><p>CAN it then be, that the earth loved some city,<br/>
    Another planet's child, so long, so truly,<br/>
    That here we find its image next her heart,<br/>
    Like an abandoned, melancholy thought<br/>
    Yet legible?<br/></p><hr/><b>DREAM OF DYING.</b><br/><p>SHIVERING in fever, weak, and parched to sand,<br/>
    My ears, those entrances of word-dressed thoughts,<br/>
    My pictured eyes, and my assuring touch,<br/>
    Fell from me, and my body turned me forth<br/>
    From its beloved abode: then I was dead;<br/>
    And in my grave beside my corpse I sat,<br/>
    In vain attempting to return: meantime<br/>
    There came the untimely spectres of two babes,<br/>
    And played in my abandoned body's ruins;<br/>
    They went away; and, one by one, by snakes<br/>
    My limbs were swallowed; and, at last. I sat<br/>
    With only one, blue-eyed, curled round my ribs,<br/>
    Eating the last remainder of my heart,<br/>
    And hissing to himself O sleep, thou fiend!<br/>
    Thou blackness of the night! how sad and frightful<br/>
    Are these thy dreams!<br/></p><hr/><b>INSIGNIFICANCE OF THE WORLD.</b><br/><p>WHY what's the world and time? a fleeting thought<br/>
    In the great meditating universe<br/>
    A brief parenthesis in chaos.<br/></p>
