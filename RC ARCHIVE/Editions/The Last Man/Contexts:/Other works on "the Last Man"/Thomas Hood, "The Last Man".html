<h3>Thomas Hood, <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/bibliog.htm#hood">"The Last Man"</a></h3><br/><p>'Twas in the year two thousand and one,<br/>
    A pleasant morning of May<br/>
    I sat on the gallows-tree, all alone,<br/>
    A chaunting a merry lay,--<br/>
    To think how the pest had spared my life,<br/>
    To sing, with the larks that day!<br/></p><p>When up the heath came a jolly knave,<br/>
    Like a scarecrow, all in rags:<br/>
    lt made me crow to see his old duds<br/>
    All abroad in the wind, like flags;--<br/>
    So up he came to the timbers' foot<br/>
    And pitch'd down his greasy bags.--<br/></p><p>Good Lord! how blythe the old beggar was!<br/>
    At pulling out his scraps,--<br/>
    The very sight of his broken orts<br/>
    Made a work in his wrinkled chaps:<br/>
    "Come down," says he, "you Newgate-bird,<br/>
    And have a taste of my snaps!"--<br/></p><p>Then down the rope, like a tar from the mast,<br/>
    I slided, and by him stood:<br/>
    But I wish'd myself on the gallows again<br/>
    When I smelt that beggar's food,--<br/>
    A foul beef-bone and a mouldy crust;--<br/>
    "Oh!" quoth he, "the heavens are good!"<br/></p><p>Then after this grace he cast him down:<br/>
    Says I, "You'll get sweeter air<br/>
    A pace or two off, on the windward side"--<br/>
    For the felons' bones lay there--<br/>
    But he only laugh'd at the empty skulls,<br/>
    And offer'd them part of his fare.<br/></p><p>"I never harm'd <i>them</i>, and they won't harm me:<br/>
    Let the proud and the rich be cravens!"<br/>
    I did not like that strange beggar man,<br/>
    He look'd so up at the heavens--<br/>
    Anon he shook out his empty old poke;--<br/>
    "There's the crums," saith he, "for the ravens!"<br/></p><p>It made me angry to see his face,<br/>
    It had such a jesting look;<br/>
    But while I made up my mind to speak,<br/>
    A small case-bottle he took:<br/>
    Quoth he, "though I gather the green water-cress,<br/>
    My drink is not of the brook!"<br/></p><p>Full manners-like he tender'd the dram;<br/>
    Oh it came of a dainty cask!<br/>
    But, whenever it came to his turn to pull,<br/>
    "Your leave, good sir, I must ask;<br/>
    But I always wipe the brim with my sleeve,<br/>
    When a hangman sups at my flask!"<br/></p><p>And then he laugh'd so loudly and long,<br/>
    The churl was quite out of breath;<br/>
    I thought the very Old One was come<br/>
    To mock me before my death,<br/>
    And wish'd I had buried the dead men's bones<br/>
    That were lying about the heath!<br/></p><p>But the beggar gave me a jolly clap--<br/>
    "Come, let us pledge each other,<br/>
    For all the wide world is dead beside,<br/>
    And we are brother and brother--<br/>
    I've a yearning for thee in my heart,<br/>
    As if we had come of one mother.<br/></p><p>"I've a yearning for thee in my heart<br/>
    That almost makes me weep,<br/>
    For as I pass'd from town to town<br/>
    The folks were all stone-asleep,--<br/>
    But when I saw thee sitting aloft,<br/>
    It made me both laugh and leap!"<br/></p><p>Now a curse (I thought) be on his love,<br/>
    And a curse upon his mirth,--<br/>
    An' it were not for that beggar man<br/>
    I'd be the King of the earth,--<br/>
    But I promis'd myself, an hour should come<br/>
    To make him rue his birth!--<br/></p><p>So down we sat and bous'd again<br/>
    Till the sun was in mid-sky,<br/>
    When, just as the gentle west-wind came,<br/>
    We hearken'd a dismal cry:<br/>
    "Up, up, on the tree," quoth the beggar man,<br/>
    "Till those horrible dogs go by!"<br/></p><p>And, lo! from the forest's far-off skirts,<br/>
    They came all yelling for gore,<br/>
    A hundred hounds pursuing at once,<br/>
    And a panting hart before,<br/>
    Till he sunk adown at the gallows' foot,<br/>
    And there his haunches they tore!<br/></p><p>His haunches they tore, without a horn<br/>
    To tell when the chase was done;<br/>
    And there was not a single scarlet coat<br/>
    To flaunt it in the sun!--<br/>
    I turn'd, and look'd at the beggar man,<br/>
    And his tears dropt one by one!<br/></p><p>And with curses sore he chid at the hounds,<br/>
    Till the last dropt out of sight,<br/>
    Anon saith he, "let's down again,<br/>
    And ramble for our delight,<br/>
    For the world's all free, and we may choose<br/>
    A right cozie barn for to-night!"<br/></p><p>With that, he set up his staff on end,<br/>
    And it fell with the point due West;<br/>
    So we far'd that way to a city great,<br/>
    Where the folks had died of the pest--<br/>
    It was fine to enter in house and hall,<br/>
    Wherever it liked me best!--<br/></p><p>For the porters all were stiff and cold,<br/>
    And could not lift their heads;<br/>
    And when we came where their masters lay,<br/>
    The rats leapt out of the beds:--<br/>
    The grandest palaces in the land<br/>
    Were as free as workhouse sheds.<br/></p><p>But the beggar man made a mumping face,<br/>
    And knocked at every gate:<br/>
    It made me curse to hear how he whined,<br/>
    So our fellowship turn'd to hate,<br/>
    And I bade him walk the world by himself,<br/>
    For I scorn'd so humble a mate!<br/></p><p>So <i>he</i> turn'd right and <i>I</i> turn'd left,<br/>
    As if we had never met;<br/>
    And I chose a fair stone house for myself,<br/>
    For the city was all to let;<br/>
    And for three brave holydays drank my fill<br/>
    Of the choicest that I could get.<br/></p><p>And because my jerkin was coarse and worn,<br/>
    I got me a properer vest;<br/>
    It was purple velvet, stitch'd o'er with gold,<br/>
    And a shining star at the breast,--<br/>
    'Twas enough to fetch old Joan from her grave<br/>
    To see me so purely drest!--<br/></p><p>But Joan was dead and under the mould,<br/>
    And every buxom lass;<br/>
    In vain I watch'd, at the window pane,<br/>
    For a Christian soul to pass;--<br/>
    But sheep and kine wander'd up the street,<br/>
    And browz'd on the new-come grass.--<br/></p><p><a name="crown" id="crown">When</a> lo! I spied the old beggar man,<br/>
    And lustily he did sing!--<br/>
    His rags were lapp'd in a scarlet cloak,<br/>
    And a crown he had like a King;<br/>
    So he stept right up before my gate<br/>
    And danc'd me a saucy fling!<br/></p><p>Heaven mend us all!--but, within my mind,<br/>
    I had kill'd him then and there;<br/>
    To see him lording so braggart-like<br/>
    That was born to his beggar's fare,<br/>
    And how he had stolen the royal crown<br/>
    His betters were meant to wear.<br/></p><p>But God forbid that a thief should die<br/>
    Without his share of the laws!<br/>
    So I nimbly whipt my tackle out,<br/>
    And soon tied up his claws,--<br/>
    I was judge, myself, and jury, and all,<br/>
    And solemnly tried the cause.<br/></p><p>But the beggar man would not plead, but cried<br/>
    Like a babe without its corals,<br/>
    For he knew how hard it is apt to go<br/>
    When the law and a thief have quarrels,--<br/>
    There was not a Christian soul alive<br/>
    To speak a word for his morals.<br/></p><p>Oh, how gaily I doff'd my costly gear,<br/>
    And put on my work-day clothes;--<br/>
    I was tired of such a long Sunday life,<br/>
    And never was one of the sloths;<br/>
    But the beggar man grumbled a weary deal,<br/>
    And made many crooked mouths.<br/></p><p>So I haul'd him off to the gallows' foot,<br/>
    And blinded him in his bags;<br/>
    'Twas a weary job to heave him up,<br/>
    For a doom'd man always lags;<br/>
    But by ten of the clock he was off his legs<br/>
    In the wind and airing his rags!<br/></p><p>So there he hung, and there I stood<br/>
    The LAST MAN left alive,<br/>
    To have my own will of all the earth:<br/>
    Quoth I, now I shall thrive!<br/>
    But when was ever honey made<br/>
    With one bee in a hive!<br/></p><p>My conscience began to gnaw my heart<br/>
    Before the day was done,<br/>
    For other men's lives had all gone out,<br/>
    Like candles in the sun!--<br/>
    But it seem'd as if I had broke, at last,<br/>
    A thousand necks in one!<br/></p><p>So I went and cut his body down<br/>
    To bury it decentlie;--<br/>
    God send there were any good soul alive<br/>
    To do the like by me!<br/>
    But the wild dogs came with terrible speed,<br/>
    And bay'd me up the tree!<br/></p><p>My sight was like a drunkard's sight,<br/>
    And my head began to swim,<br/>
    To see their jaws all white with foam,<br/>
    Like the ravenous ocean brim;--<br/>
    But when the wild dogs trotted away<br/>
    Their jaws were bloody and grim!<br/></p><p>Their jaws were bloody and grim, good Lord!<br/>
    But the beggar man, where was he?--<br/>
    There was nought of him but some ribbons of rags<br/>
    Below the gallows' tree!--<br/>
    I know the Devil, when I am dead,<br/>
    Will send his hounds for me!--<br/></p><p>I've buried my babies one by one,<br/>
    And dug the deep hole for Joan,<br/>
    And cover'd the faces of kith and kin,<br/>
    And felt the old churchyard stone<br/>
    Go cold to my heart, full many a time,<br/>
    But I never felt so lone!<br/></p><p>For the lion and Adam were company,<br/>
    And the tiger him beguil'd;<br/>
    But the simple kine are foes to my life,<br/>
    And the household brutes are wild.<br/>
    If the veriest cur would lick my hand,<br/>
    I could love it like a child!<br/></p><p>And the beggar man's ghost besets my dreams,<br/>
    At night, to make me madder,--<br/>
    And my wretched conscience, within my breast,<br/>
    Is like a stinging adder;--<br/>
    I sigh when I pass the gallows' foot,<br/>
    And look at the rope and ladder!--<br/></p><p>For hanging looks sweet,--but, alas! in vain,<br/>
    My desperate fancy begs,--<br/>
    I must turn my cup of sorrows quite up,<br/>
    And drink it to the dregs,--<br/>
    For there is not another man alive,<br/>
    In the world, to pull my legs!</p>
