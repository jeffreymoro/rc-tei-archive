    <p>My dear Friend</p>
    <p>I never wish to have any <i>introductions</i> to my own Poetry in the M P and therefore I thought of course that yours did not require it: the merit of <i>your</i> lines speaking for themselves. I have already taken care, I believe <i>twice</i>, to announce the Gleanings &amp;c&amp;c and on their publication I will do every thing that is right, and just, and handsome about them, for I feel warmly interested in every thing that is pleasant and honorable to you. I continue my daily labours in the Post; all the Oberons. Tabithas. M R's and indeed most of the Poetry, you see there is mine.</p>
    <p>I know not when your letter was written but <i>I</i> only received it this</p>
    <p>morning here. I remain secluded till November-- will you come a pass a few days with us, this autumn? You must tell me what you think of my Lyrical Tales now printing by Longman &amp; Reese-- I am still tormented with ill health, but I have had my Cottage perpetually full of visitors ever since I came to it: and some charming literary characters,-- <i>authoresses</i> -- &amp;cccc. I wish you would come and see us;-- I expect the Miss Porters, the beautiful Sisters of the painter of - --- the Seringapatam Picture with their mother. I have had Mrs Fenwick, the Elegant authoress of "Secresy" &amp; her daughter, here, this month past-- Tomorrow I expect Godwin-- and his Philanthropic friend, Mr Marshall-- they will only stay a day or two. I shall see Mrs Parsons here soon; and I regret that I was not in town when Mrs Bennet called upon me: If you <i>know her</i>, tell her that I lament not seeing her before she set out for Scotland.</p>
    <p>God bless you and farewell remember I have always a spare bed for my best friends, consequently <i>we</i> shall be deleghted to see you. We have some thoughts of making an hasty journey to visit Coleridge, the Poet, and his amiable little wife, in Cumberland but <i>health</i> must decide this matter.</p>
    <p>Farewell ever truly yrs</p>

    <p>Editorial Note: Quoted by permission of the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation, Inc.; this letter is part of the Shelley Circle Pforzheimer Collection (SC 29; see below for full documentation). Samuel Jackson Pratt (1749-1814) was a poet and novelist who contributed to the <i>Morning Post</i> (where Robinson was poetry editor); he also wrote Robinson's epitaph. Robinson mentions a number of writers in this letter with whom she was acquainted: William Godwin (whom she knew through Robert Merry- see her <a href="/editions/robinson/mrgodwinfrst.htm">letter to Godwin</a>), Jane Porter (poet and historical novelist, author of <i>Thaddeus of Warsaw</i> (1803) and Anna Maria Porter (novelist), "Mrs. Parsons," probably Elizabeth Parsons (author of <i>The Castle of Wolfenbach</i>), Eliza Fenwick (close friend of Mary Hays, educator, and author of <i>Secresy</i>), "Mrs. Bennet," probably Agnes Maria Bennet (novelist, author of <i>Agnes de Courci</i>). The "Seringapatam Picture" refers to the panorama painted by Sir Robert Ker Porter (1777-1842), titled the "Storming of Seringapatam."</p>
