    <p>1794.5<br/><b>Effects of War</b><br/>
    "Philanthropos"<br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (February 22, 1794)</p>
    <p>Hic matres uniferaeque nurus, hic chara Sororum.<br/>
    Pectora maerentum, puerique parentibus orbi<br/>
    Dirum execrantur bellum!</p>

    <p>Come proud unfeeling pomp—Come luxury,<br/>
    And ye, who thoughtless frolic in the round<br/>
    Of mirth and joy, or revel out the night<br/>
    Where dissipation mads her festive sons!<br/>
    A scene I will disclose—a piteous scene—<br/>
    At sight of which proud pomp shall shrink aghast,<br/>
    The tear shall start from the chang'd eye of mirth,<br/>
    And from the unnerv'd bacchanalian hand,<br/>
    The cup shall fall untasted to the ground.<br/>
    Behold yon wretched hovel! once the seat<br/>
    Of industry and health, content and love.<br/>
    There the poor labourer, from his daily toil<br/>
    Releas'd at eve, enjoy'd his little home.<br/>
    With every sweet endearment his fond wife<br/>
    Welcom'd his glad return; rejoic'd to share<br/>
    A father's smile, the little prattlers strove<br/>
    To climb his knee, and play'd their gambols rough.<br/>
    Thoughtless of future ills each parent smil'd,<br/>
    Gaz'd on the pledges of their mutual love<br/>
    With heartfelt joy, and thought them wealth enough;<br/>
    Blest was the cot with innocence and peace.<br/>
    Alas! how chang'd! each smiling joy is fled,<br/>
    Fled to return no more,—while sickness, want,<br/>
    Famine, and all the complicated woes,<br/>
    That haunt the desolating steps of war,<br/>
    With dismal gloom o'erspread the sadden'd scene.<br/>
    See on yon wretched bed! which ill excludes<br/>
    Rude winter's piercing blast, with sickness wan.<br/>
    A wife, a mother lies; oft had she spar'd<br/>
    The hard earn'd morsel from her famish'd lips,<br/>
    To save her children from untimely death;<br/>
    Long had she struggled with the cruel force<br/>
    Of sickness, preying on her tender frame,<br/>
    Too carefully conceal'd lest she should add<br/>
    Another pang t'encrease her partner's woes;<br/>
    She sinks at last, and feels the icy grasp<br/>
    Of desolation waste her feeble frame:<br/>
    Resign'd she welcomes death, nor heaves a sigh,<br/>
    Save for her husband's and her children's fate.<br/>
    In vain to shield her sinking in his arms,<br/>
    And ward the dart a wretched husband strives;<br/>
    She clasps his hand, and looks a last adieu!<br/>
    In speechless agony he stands, while death<br/>
    Remorseless mocks his prayer, and strikes the blow.<br/>
    See o'er the clay-cold corpse he hands,—despair<br/>
    Rolls in his eye, and anguish fills his soul!<br/>
    Have we no HOWARD<a href="#2">[2]</a> left,—Heaven's messenger<br/>
    To poverty distrest, to pour the balm<br/>
    Of comfort on affliction's wounded heart?<br/>
    But here the stores of charity would fail,<br/>
    Lo commerce sickens, and the toiling hand<br/>
    Of industry droops lifeless, unemploy'd;<br/>
    Dire is the curse, and wide the ruin spreads,<br/>
    War sounds an echoing blast, and havoc stalks around!<br/>
    Britannia weeping mourns her hapless sons,<br/>
    But frowns indignant at a nation's wrongs.<br/>
    Despots delight in war, to them 'tis sport,<br/>
    A Royal Game—their subjects lives the stake.<br/>
    But why will brother against brother lift<br/>
    The murderous steel, to gratify the pride<br/>
    Of one ambitious man, yclep'd a King.<br/>
    If we must fight, let freemen fight with slaves;<br/>
    Hurl'd from their thrones let despots feel the force<br/>
    Of Britain's vengeful thunder, nor insult<br/>
    The RIGHTS of NATIONS, and the RIGHTS of MAN.<br/>
    Tremble, ye tyrants, for your doom is seal'd!<br/>
    Tremble, ye slaves, for ye shall bite the dust!<br/>
    Triumphant freedom, in her blood-stain'd vest,<br/>
    Despots combin'd, drags at her chariot-wheels,<br/>
    And nobly manumits a world enslav'd!</p>
