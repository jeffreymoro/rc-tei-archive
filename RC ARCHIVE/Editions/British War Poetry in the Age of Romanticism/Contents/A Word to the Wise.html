    <p>1793.8<br/><b>A Word to the Wise. A new Ballad on the Times</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXIII (July 1793), frontispiece</p>
    <p><br/>
    The Mounseers, they say, have the world in a string,<br/>
    They don't like our nobles, they don't like our King;<br/>
    But they smuggle our wool, and they'd fain have our wheat,<br/>
    And leave us poor Englishmen nothing to eat.<br/>
        Derry down, down, down derry down.<br/><br/>
    They call us already a province of France,<br/>
    And come here by hundreds to teach us to dance;<br/>
    They say we are heavy, they say we are dull,<br/>
    And that beef and plumb-pudding's not good for John Bull.</p>
    <p>They jaw in their clubs, murder women and priests,<br/>
    And then for their fishwives they make civic feasts—<br/>
    Civic feasts! what are they? why, a new-fashion'd thing,<br/>
    For which they renounce both their God and their King!</p>
    <p>And yet there's no eating, 'tis all foolish play,<br/>
    For when pies are cut open, the birds fly away;<br/>
    But Frenchmen admire it, and fancy they see<br/>
    That Liberty's fix'd at the top of a tree.</p>
    <p>They say man and wife should no longer be one,<br/>
    Do you take a daughter, and I'll take a son;<br/>
    And as all things are equal, and all should be free,<br/>
    If your wife don't suit you, Sir, perhaps she'll suit me.</p>
    <p>But our ladies are virtuous, our ladies are fair,<br/>
    Which is more than they tell us your French-women are;<br/>
    They know they are happy, they know they are free,<br/>
    And that Liberty's not at the top of a tree.</p>
    <p>They take from the rich, but don't give to the poor,<br/>
    And to all sorts of mischief they'd open the door;<br/>
    Then let's be united, and know when we're well,<br/>
    Nor believe all the lies these Republicans tell.</p>
    <p>Our soldiers and sailors will answer these sparks,<br/>
    Though they threaten'd Dumourier<a href="#1">[1]</a> should spit us like larks;<br/>
    But, Britons, don't fear them, for Britons are free,<br/>
    And know Liberty's not to be found on a tree.</p>
    <p>They try to deceive us, our loss is their gain,<br/>
    Which is all we can learn from the works of Tom Paine;<br/>
    But let Britons be wise, as they're brave and they're free,<br/>
    And still Britain shall rule in the midst of her sea.</p>
    <p>Then stand by the Church, and the King, and the Laws,<br/>
    The Old Lion still has his teeth and his claws;<br/>
    We know of no Despots, we've nothing to fear,<br/>
    For their new-fangled nonsense will never do here.<br/>
        Derry down, down, down derry down.</p>
