    <p>1793.26<br/><b>Lines by John Gabriel Stedman</b><br/>
    John Gabriel Stedman<br/><i>The Journal of John Gabriel Stedman, 1744-1797, Soldier and Author</i><br/>
    Ed. Stanbury Thompson (London: 1962), p. 347 <a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
    <p>. . . . . . . . . . . the combined crew<br/>
    they joyn, they thicken, and that land renew<br/>
    Unnerved, th' embodied French, their fury dare<br/>
    And fix'd support the weight of all the war.<br/>
    Nor could the French repel the Allied powers,<br/>
    Nor the bold Allied forces, the Gaelic<a href="#2">[2]</a> towers,<br/>
    As on the confines of adjoyning grounds,<br/>
    Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds.<br/></p>
    <p>They tugg, they sweat, but neither gain nor yield<br/>
    One foot, one inch, of the contended field.<br/>
    Thus obstinate, to death they fight, they fall,<br/>
    Nor there can keep, now<a href="#3">[3]</a> there can win the wall.<br/>
    Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,<br/>
    Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound.<br/>
    The copious slaughter covers all the shore,<br/>
    And the high ramparts drop with human gore.</p>
