    <p>1803.13<br/><b>For Christmas Day, 1803</b><br/>
    “W. R.”<br/><i>The Hull Packet</i>, (December 27, 1803)<br/></p>
    <p>(A Contrast.)<br/></p>
    <p>Britons, tune the joyful lay,<br/>
    Hail the sacred natal day;<br/>
    Join the angelic songs above,<br/>
    Songs to praise redeeming love.<br/></p>
    <p>British Christians still are found<br/>
    Glorying in the gospel's sound;<br/>
    Celebrating still on earth,<br/>
    The year of Christ! THE SAVIOUR'S BIRTH.<br/></p>
    <p>FRANCE hath God and man defied,<br/>
    To dethrone them both hath tried:<br/>
    "Who is God?" their acts have said,<br/>
    "We establish the Decade."<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Consecrates the impious feast,<br/>
    Makes the law of God a jest;<br/>
    Casts the Christian year away,<br/>
    Abrogates the Sabbath-day.<br/></p>
    <p>HAPPY BRITAIN! favoured ground!<br/>
    Pure religion still is found;<br/>
    Cherish'd by a Sovereign's hand,<br/>
    Britain still is Freedom's land!<br/></p>
    <p>BRITISH CHRISTIANS! join your lays,<br/>
    Sing the great REDEEMER'S praise:<br/>
    Praising, pray,—and praying, sing,<br/>
    God preserve our Church and King.<br/></p>
    <p>God hath saved us heretofore,<br/>
    Let us now his name adore;<br/>
    Seek for mercy at his hand,<br/>
    GOD WILL THEN PROTECT OUR LAND.<br/></p>
