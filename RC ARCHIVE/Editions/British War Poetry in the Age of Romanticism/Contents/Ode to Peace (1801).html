    <p>1801.13<br/><b>Ode to Peace</b><br/>
    Helen Maria Williams<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (November 17, 1801)<br/><i>The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Poetry</i>, V (1807), pp. 463-465<br/></p>
    <p>Written in Paris</p>
    <p>By Helen Maria Williams</p>
    <p>She comes, benign Enchantress, heav'n-born PEACE,<br/>
        With Mercy beaming in her radiant eye!—<br/>
    She bids the horrid Din of Battle cease,<br/>
        And at her glance the savage Passions die!<br/>
    'Tis nature's Festival: let Earth rejoice,<br/>
        Vanquish'd and Conqu'ror pour exulting Songs;<br/>
    In distant regions, with according voice,<br/>
        Let Man the vict'ry bless—its prize to Man belongs!<br/></p>
    <p>Resistless FREEDOM—when she nerves the arm<br/>
        No vulgar triumph crowns the Hero's might:<br/>
    She, she alone can spread a moral charm<br/>
        O'er WAR's fell deeds, and SANCTIFY the fight!<br/>
    Oh, GALLIA, in this bright immortal hour<br/>
        How proud a trophy binds thy laurell'd brow!<br/>
    REPUBLIC, hail, whose independent pow'r<br/>
        All Earth CONTESTED ONCE, All Earth CONFESSES NOW!<br/></p>
    <p>Protecting Spirits of the glorious Dead,<br/>
        Ah, not in vain the Hero's Noble toil,<br/>
    Ah, not in vain the Patriot's blood is shed—<br/>
        That Blood shall CONSECRATE his Native Soil!<br/>
    Illustrious Names to hist'ry's record dear,<br/>
        And breath'd when some high impulse fires the Bard,<br/>
    For you shall VIRTUE pour the glowing tear—<br/>
        And your remember'd deeds shall still your Country guard!<br/></p>
    <p>And thou, lov'd BRITAIN, my parental Isle,<br/>
        Secure encircled by thy subject Waves,<br/>
    Thou Land august, where FREEDOM rear'd her pile,<br/>
        While Gothic Night obscur'd a world of Slaves;<br/>
    Thy Genius, that indignant heard the shock<br/>
        Of frantic combat (strife unmeet for thee!)<br/>
    Now views, triumphant, from his sea-girt rock<br/>
        Thee unsubdued alone; for thou alone wert free!<br/></p>
    <p>Oh, happy thy misguided efforts fail'd,<br/>
        My Country, when with tyrant hosts combin'd!<br/>
    Oh, hideous CONQUEST, had thy sword prevail'd,<br/>
        And crown'd the impious League against Mankind;<br/>
    Thou nurse of great design, of lofty thought,<br/>
        What Homicide, had thy insensate rage<br/>
    Effac'd the sacred lesson thou hast taught,<br/>
        And with thy purest Blood inscrib'd on GLORY's page!<br/></p>
    <p>Ah, rather haste to CONCORD'S holy shrine,<br/>
        Ye rival Nations—haste with joy elate;<br/>
    Your blending Garlands round her Altar twine,<br/>
        And bind the wounds of no immortal hate;<br/>
    Go, breathe responsive rituals o'er the sod<br/>
        Where FREEDOM's Martyrs press an early grave;<br/>
    Go, vow that never shall their turf be trod<br/>
        By the polluting step of Tyrant or of Slave!<br/></p>
    <p>And from your shores the abject Vices chase—<br/>
        That low AMBITION gen'rous Souls disdain,<br/>
    CORRUPTION, blasting ev'ry moral grace;<br/>
        SERVILITY, that kneels to bless his Chain!<br/>
    Oh, LIBERTY, those Demons fare remove:<br/>
        Come, Nymph, severely good, sublimely great;<br/>
    Nor to the 'raptur'd hope of mortals prove<br/>
        Like those illusive dreams that pass the Iv'ry Gate!<br/></p>
    <p>New Age, that rolls o'er man thy dawning year,<br/>
        Ah, sure all happy omens hail thy birth;<br/>
    Sure whiter annals in thy train appear,<br/>
        And purer glory cheers the gladden'd Earth.<br/>
    Like the young Eagle, when his stedfast glance<br/>
        Meets the full Sun-beam in his upward flight,<br/>
    So thou shalt with majestic step advance,<br/>
        And fix thy dauntless eye on Liberty and Light!</p>
