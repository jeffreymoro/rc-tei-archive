    <p>1793.21<br/><b>A Favourite Song,<br/></b> Anon<br/><i>The Star</i> (November 15, 1793)</p>
    <p>Founded on Facts,<br/></p>
    <p>Sung By Mr. Wallack,<br/></p>
    <p>In the Character of a Poor Harmless French Cobler, in a new<br/>
    Ballet, called The Carmagnols Routed, and which will be<br/>
    presented This Evening Tomorrow the 16th, and Monday next,<br/>
    the 18th Instant,<br/></p>
    <p>At the Royal Saloon, Astley's, Westminster-Bridge.</p>
    <p>                                I.<br/></p>
    <p>Piere Savetier, behold, is from France just arriv'd,<br/>
    Where twenty-five years I at cobling had triv'd,<br/>
    Till one fatal day I was tore from my stall,<br/>
    Le deable tear par pieces the democrats all.<br/>
                               Derry down, down, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>                                II.</p>
    <p>My lapstone and last being chang'd to a gun,<br/>
    With thousands of others o'er Frontiers I run;<br/>
    But Messieurs les Anglois cause me so much fright,<br/>
    That I did sham dead, and escap'd the same night<a href="#1">[1]</a>.<br/>
                               Derry down, &amp;c.<br/><br/>
                                    III.<br/></p>
    <p>If fair words the back and the belly suffice,<br/>
    We'd have victuals and clothes, mafois, in a trice;<br/>
    But when these we ask of our fam'd democrats,<br/>
    They stop our mouths with their demm'd assignats<a href="#2">[2]</a>.<br/>
                               Derry down, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>                               IV.<br/></p>
    <p>I'd rather be Cobler, and work in my stall,<br/>
    Than of the Convention von grand General;<br/>
    One day he be great man, he head all the mob,<br/>
    One two three days after they cut off his nob<a href="#3">[3]</a>.<br/>
                               Derry down, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>                               V.<br/></p>
    <p>The Convention's like to an old rotton shoe,<br/>
    That wants both a soal and a top leather too;<br/>
    What lets water behind, and the mud in before,<br/>
    Runs away from the foot, and returns never more.<br/>
                               Derry down, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>                              VI.<br/></p>
    <p>If safe I arrive, I will stick to my trade<a href="#4">[4]</a>,<br/>
    In London where always I'm sure to be paid,<br/>
    Where law is respected, and that is the ting,<br/>
    What makes the poor happy, the rich, and the king.<br/>
                               Derry down, &amp;c.</p>
