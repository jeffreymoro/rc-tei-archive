    <p>1801.15<br/><b>Impromptu,<br/>
    On Being Told that the Present War is for the<br/>
    Preservation of Property</b><br/>
    “Quiz”<br/><i>The Spirit of the Public Journals</i>, IV (1801), p. 393<br/></p>
    <p>Will dreamt that thieves his house would rob:—<br/>
    "Sell all my goods," quoth he; "and, Bob,<br/>
    Go, hire of watchmen many a score,<br/>
    Stop ev'ry cranny, bar each door;<br/>
    Ere safety's means a jot shall lack,<br/>
    I'll pawn the last shirt off my back!"<br/>
    He stem'd the <i>fancied</i> evil-doing,<br/>
    But at the price of <i>certain</i> ruin;<br/>
    For, so much cost this careful dealing,<br/>
    It did not leave a stick <i>worth stealing</i>!</p>
