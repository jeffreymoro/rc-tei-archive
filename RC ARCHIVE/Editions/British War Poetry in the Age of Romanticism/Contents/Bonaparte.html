    <p>1811.2<br/><b>Bonaparte</b><br/>
    “Mr. Scott”<br/>
    [Walter Scott]<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, IXXIII (August, 1811), pp. 615-16<br/></p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">[From the Vision of Don Roderick]<br/></p>
    <p>From a rude isle, his ruder lineage came.<br/>
        The spark, that, from a suburb hovel's hearth<br/>
    Ascending, wraps some capital in flame,<br/>
        Hath not a meaner or more sordid birth.<br/>
    And for the soul that bade him waste the earth—<br/>
        The sable land-flood from some swamp obscure,<br/>
    That poisons the glad husband-field with dearth,<br/>
        And by destruction bids its fame endure,<br/>
    Hath not a source more sullen, stagnant, and impure.<br/></p>
    <p>Before that Leader strode a shadowy form,<br/>
        Her limbs like mist, her torch like meteor shew'd;<br/>
    With which she beckon'd him through fight and storm,<br/>
        And all he crush'd that cross'd his desp'rate road,<br/>
    Nor thought, nor fear'd, nor look'd on what he trode;<br/>
        Realms could not glut his pride, blood not slake,<br/>
    So oft as e'er she shook her torch abroad—<br/>
        It was Ambition bade his terrors wake;<br/>
    Nor deign'd she, as of yore, a milder form to take.<br/><br/>
    No longer now she spurn'd at mean revenge,<br/>
        Or stay'd her hand for conquer'd freeman's moan,<br/>
    As when, the fates of aged Rome to change,<br/>
        By Caesar's side she cross'd the Rubicon;<br/>
    Nor joy'd she to bestow the spoils she won,<br/>
        As when the banded Powers of Greece were task'd<br/>
    To war beneath the Youth of Macedon:<br/>
        No seemly veil her modern minion ask'd,<br/>
    He saw her hideous face, and lov'd the fiend unmask'd.<br/></p>
    <p>That Prelate mark'd his march—On banners blaz'd<br/>
        With battles won in many a distant land.<br/>
    On eagle standards and on arms he gaz'd;<br/>
        "And hop'st thou, then," he said, "thy power shall stand?<br/>
    O! thou hast builded on the shifting sand,<br/>
        And thou hast temper'd it with slaughter's flood;<br/>
    And know, fell scourge in the Almighty's hand,<br/>
        Gore-moisten'd trees shall perish in the bud,<br/>
    And, by a bloody death, shall die the Man of Blood."<br/></p>
    <p>The ruthless Leader beckon'd from his train<br/>
        A wan, paternal shade, and bade him kneel,<br/>
    And pale his temples with the Crown of Spain,<br/>
        While trumpets rang, and Heralds cried, "Castile!"<br/>
    Not that he lov'd him—No!—in no man's weal,<br/>
        Scarce in his own, e'er joy'd that sullen heart;<br/>
    Yet round that throne he bade his warriors wheel,<br/>
        That the poor puppet might perform his part,<br/>
    And be a scepter'd slave, at his stern beck to start.</p>
