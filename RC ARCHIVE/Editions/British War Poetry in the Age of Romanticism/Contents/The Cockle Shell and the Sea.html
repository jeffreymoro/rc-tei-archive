    <p>1813.8<br/><b>The Cockle Shell <i>and the</i> Sea</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, XXXIII (July, 1813), p. 63<br/></p>
    <p>A Cockle Shell, whose slender cup<br/>
    Had by a wave been lifted up,<br/>
    And gently lodg'd, secure and sound,<br/>
    A little way upon the ground,<br/>
    Yet not so far, but ev'ry day,<br/>
    She drank the falling of the spray,<br/>
    Grew vain at length to think that she<br/>
    Contained a portion of the sea.<br/>
    "And why not more? (at length she cried)<br/>
    And why not waves, and why not tide?<br/>
    Perhaps, though men account me small,<br/>
    I might on proof contain it all;<br/>
    'Tis worth the trial; how should I<br/>
    Be sure I can't, unless I try?"<br/>
    Fir'd by the grandeur of the thought,<br/>
    To quit her safe retreat she sought;<br/>
    And, victim of her idiot pride,<br/>
    Plung'd downward in the swelling tide:<br/>
    But now no fav'ring wave was there;<br/>
    Ambition fled, arose Despair;<br/>
    When a rude billow, that receiv'd<br/>
    The wanton fool, now undeceiv'd,<br/>
    Recoiling, for a moment bore<br/>
    The buoyant trifle from the shore,<br/>
    And murmur'd: "Idiot! learn too late<br/>
    The misery of presumptuous fate.<br/>
    Of holding seas no longer think:<br/>
    The waste spray thou no more shall drink.<br/>
    Know, vain pretender, to thy cost,<br/>
    Thy small capacity is lost."<br/>
    Then, flowing with impetuous shock<br/>
    Against the angle of a rock<br/>
    The Shell, at one tremendous stroke,<br/>
    Into an hundred atoms broke.</p>
