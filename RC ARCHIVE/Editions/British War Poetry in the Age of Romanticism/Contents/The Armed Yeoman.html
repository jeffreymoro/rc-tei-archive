    <p>I.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Yeomen, attend, who sword in hand<br/>
        Stand forth, your country's glory,<br/>
    Who quit the plough to guard the land,<br/>
        Come listen to my story:<br/>
    Listen how France is still the foe<br/>
        Of Britain's Constitution!<br/>
    King, or Republicans, we know<br/>
        In this, no Revolution.</p>
            <div class="indent10">
    <p>       Chorus.</p>
    </div>
    <p>These Frenchmen boast they'll hither come,<br/>
        And mighty are in word, Sirs;<br/>
    But who invades a Briton's home,<br/>
        Shall feel a Briton's sword, Sirs!</p>
            <div class="indent15">
    <p>II.</p>
    </div>
    <p>They say they will, so kind and good,<br/>
        Give freedom to all people;<br/>
    Free, they shall be, to bathe in blood,<br/>
        Free, to burn church and steeple;<br/>
    Free, to lose all that's dear, and then<br/>
        Free, to keep what they have, Sirs;<br/>
    Free, nor to think nor act as men,<br/>
        Free, to be France's slaves, Sirs.</p>
            <div class="indent10">
    <p>       Chorus.</p>
    </div>
    <p>These Frenchmen boast, &amp;c.</p>
            <div class="indent15">
    <p>III.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Britons well know, and e'er have known,<br/>
        That freedom ne'er was given,<br/>
    But to those deserve the boon,<br/>
        And then's the gift of Heaven.<br/>
    The virtuous, brave, and kind, are free,<br/>
        In this alone confin'd, Sirs,<br/>
    They cannot false, or cruel be,<br/>
        They cannot change their mind, Sirs.</p>
            <div class="indent10">
    <p>       Chorus.</p>
    </div>
    <p>We will not change, so let them come,<br/>
        And mighty be in, &amp;c.</p>
            <div class="indent15">
    <p>IV.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Yeomen attend, your liberty<br/>
        Has no fine-spun solution,<br/>
    But has a noble invent'ry<br/>
        Within the Constitution:<br/>
    Has never master, but the laws,<br/>
        Which house, as castle, guard, Sirs;<br/>
    And in the rich and poor man's cause,<br/>
        Give equally award, Sirs.</p>
            <div class="indent10">
    <p>Chorus.</p>
    </div>
    <p>These laws we'll keep; no let them come,<br/>
        And mighty be in word, Sirs, &amp;c.</p>
            <div class="indent15">
    <p>V.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This invent'ry, as you'll perceive,<br/>
        Names freedom's dispensations,<br/>
    Names all herself can ever give,<br/>
        And all her best relations:<br/>
    Free industry to work and gain,<br/>
        Free what is gain'd t'enjoy, Sirs;<br/>
    Free words, free thoughts, to entertain,<br/>
        Free talents best t'employ, Sirs.</p>
            <div class="indent10">
    <p>        Chorus.</p>
    </div>
    <p>These rights we'll keep; so let them come,<br/>
        And mighty be in, &amp;c.<br/></p>
        <div class="indent15">
    <p>VI.</p>
    </div>
    <p>A Royal Keystone knits the arch,<br/>
        Where freedom's bulwark standing,<br/>
    With lion flag directs our march,<br/>
        To meet the foe when landing:<br/>
    Then whilst we note our laws and rights,<br/>
        Their Guardian let us sing, Sirs,<br/>
    For whom each true-born Britain fights,<br/>
        And toast, God save the King, Sirs.</p>
            <div class="indent10">
    <p>        Chorus.</p>
    </div>
    <p>For Him we'll fight; so let them come,<br/>
        And mighty be in word, Sirs;<br/>
    But who invades a Briton's home,<br/>
        Shall feel a Briton's sword, Sirs.</p>
