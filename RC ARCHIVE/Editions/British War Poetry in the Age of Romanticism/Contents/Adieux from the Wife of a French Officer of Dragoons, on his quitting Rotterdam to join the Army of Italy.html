    <p>1804.2<br/><b>ADIEUX <i>from the wife of a French officer of dragoons,<br/>
    on his quitting Rotterdam to join the army of Italy</i></b><br/>
    "A. B."<br/><i>The Hull Packet</i> (January 31, 1804)<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Adieu, dear spouse; you quit your native walls,<br/>
    For foreign climes, as pressing duty calls;<br/>
    The sun now shines on MAES'S willow'd shore,<br/>
    Those banks which you perchance may see no more;<br/>
    Yet here you leave a tender faithful friend,<br/>
    Whose thoughts shall still on your remembrance bend,<br/>
    Whose vows shall ever be to heaven addrest,<br/>
    For your return, with health and fortune blest;<br/>
    O may th' ETERNAL grant my fond desire,<br/>
    While I his justice awfully admire,<br/>
    Yes—I dare hope he'll hear my earnest prayer,<br/>
    And you the favours due to merit share;<br/>
    But while just heaven its bounties does impart,<br/>
    Remember still the partner of your heart.</p>
