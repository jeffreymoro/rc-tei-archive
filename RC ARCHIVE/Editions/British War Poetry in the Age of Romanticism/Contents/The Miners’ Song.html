    <p>1793.12<br/><b>The Miners' Song</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Star</i> (September 11, 1793)<br/></p>
    <p>Sung by Mr. Fox, in the Celebrated Siege of Valenciennes <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Now Performing at Astley's.<br/></p>
    <p style="text-align: left">                                 I.</p>
    <p>                In the bowels of the earth,<br/>
                    We miners take our birth;<br/>
    Secure from prying eyes, our fatal work prepare:<br/>
                    And soon we'll make the foe,<br/>
                    Our mighty calling know,<br/>
    And blow them and blow them, to atoms in the air!<br/>
        And blow them, and blow them, to atoms in the air!<br/><br/>
                                    II.</p>
    <p>                The faithful compass see,<br/>
                    Directs us where to be,<br/>
    To countermine the art of Britain's daring foe:<br/>
                    Now, haughty Gauls, beware,<br/>
                    For not a man we'll spare,<br/>
    But to atoms, to atoms, the garrison we'll blow!<br/>
        But to atoms, to atoms, the garrison we'll blow!</p>
    <p>                               III.</p>
    <p>                The business goes on well,<br/>
                    We see the waters swell;<br/>
    The foe can't counteract, we've made it plain appear:<br/>
                    Now, now, prepare to spring,<br/>
                    For mischief's on the wing;<br/>
    And death, and certain death, and certain death is near!<br/>
        And death, and certain death, and certain death is near!</p>
    <p>                               IV.</p>
    <p>                Now, now, we'll soon enshroud,<br/>
                    With sulphur, every cloud;<br/>
    And soon their cover'd way in ruins we'll display!<br/>
                    With sword in hand proceed,<br/>
                    And storm the breach with speed;<br/>
    Brave LEIGH and ABERCROMBIE, with DOYLE <a href="#2">[2]</a> leads us the way.<br/>
        Brave LEIGH and ABERCROMBIE, with DOYLE, leads us the way.</p>
