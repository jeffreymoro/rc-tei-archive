    John Whitehouse<br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (September 13, 1794)<br/></p>

    <p>I.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Dread Offspring of Tartarian birth,<br/>
    Whose nodding crest is stain'd with gore,<br/>
    Whom to some giant-son of Earth,<br/>
    Strife in strong pangs of childbed bore;<br/>
    0 War! fierce monster, homicide,<br/>
    Who marchest on with hideous stride,<br/>
    Shaking thy spear distilling blood;<br/>
    Bellona thee, in angry mood,<br/>
    Taught proud Ambition's spoils to win,<br/>
    Amidst the loud, conflicting din<br/>
    Of arms, where Discord's gorgon-featured form<br/>
    High shakes her flaming torch amidst the martial storm.</p>
    <div class="indent15">
    <p>II.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Stern God! wolf-hearted, and accursed,<br/>
    Foster'd by Power, by Rapine nursed,<br/>
    Oppression ever in thy train,<br/>
    For hapless man prepares her chain:<br/>
    A thousand vulture-forms beside<br/>
    Stalk on before thee; bloated Pride,<br/>
    Thick-eyed Revenge, his soul on fire,<br/>
    And Slaughter breathing threatenings dire,<br/>
    Tumult, and Rage, and Fury fell,<br/>
    And Cruelty, the imp of hell,<br/>
    Her heart of adamant! and arm'd her hand<br/>
    With iron hooks, and cords, and Desolation's brand.</p>
    <div class="indent15">
    <p>III.</p>
    </div>
    <p>There, where the Battle loudest roars,<br/>
    Where wide the impurpled deluge pours,<br/>
    And ghastly Death, his thousands slain,<br/>
    Whirls his swift chariot o'er the plain,<br/>
    Rapt in wild Horror's frantic fit,<br/>
    'Midst the dire scene thou lov'st to sit,<br/>
    To catch some wretch's parting sigh,<br/>
    To mark the dimly-glazing eye,<br/>
    The face into contortions thrown,<br/>
    Convuls'd: the deep, deep-lengthening groan,<br/>
    The frequent sob, the agonizing smart,<br/>
    And nature's dread release, the pang that rends the heart.</p>
    <div class="indent15">
    <p>IV.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Avaunt, from Albion's isle! not there<br/>
    Thy arms, and maddening car prepare,<br/>
    Nor bid thy crimson banners fly<br/>
    Terrific, through the troubled sky;<br/>
    But stay thee in thy wild career;<br/>
    Lay by thy glittering shield and spear,<br/>
    Thy polished casque, and nodding crest,<br/>
    And let thy sable steeds have rest:<br/>
    At length, the work of slaughter close,<br/>
    And give to Europe's sons repose,<br/>
    Bid the hoarse clangors of the trumpet cease,<br/>
    And smooth thy wrinkled front to meet the smiles of Peace.</p>
