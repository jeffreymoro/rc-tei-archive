    <p>1794.22<br/><b>For the European Magazine.<br/>
    On A Late Victory At Sea.</b><br/>
    "T. O."<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXVI (December 1794), pp. 438-439</p>
    <p>Behold the foe with spreading sails advance,<br/>
        With speed we steer to form th' embattled line,<br/>
    In contest dread to join the sons of France,<br/>
        From o'er the seas their daring pow'r confine.</p>
    <p>And as we near those tow'rs of wondrous force,<br/>
        The flash denotes th' impatient warrior's ire;<br/>
    But impotent the blast, its lengthen'd course<br/>
        Disarms the ball thus wing'd with misspent fire.</p>
    <p>And now we're close as valour's self can come;<br/>
        The din begins, the thunder shakes the deep,<br/>
    From thousand mouths now hear the fatal doom<br/>
        That summons mortals to eternal sleep.</p>
    <p>Now o'er the main the scatter'd fragments glide<br/>
        Of masts, and yards, and sails confus'd in heaps;<br/>
    Now timbers crash, and batter'd ports gape wide,<br/>
        And Horror reigns, secure his vigil keeps.</p>
    <p>Behold, what spectre's that! with visage pale,<br/>
        With crimson'd hands, and meagre ghastly form,<br/>
    Who greets fell Horror with a friendly hail,<br/>
        Grins at each woe, and ruthless points the storm.</p>
    <p>'Tis Death—o'er fleets with giant stride he goes,<br/>
        Insatiate, marks each victim doom'd to bleed,<br/>
    With scowl malignant counts contending foes,<br/>
        The destin'd prey his hungry maw to feed.<br/><br/>
    Brave Montague<a href="#1">[1]</a> the fatal lot is thine,<br/>
        And Death receives thee as his lawful prize;<br/>
    Britannia round thy urn the bays shall twine,<br/>
        The grateful tear adorn each Briton's eyes.</p>
    <p>Now hark! the shouts of victory resound,<br/>
        The foe gives way, the Gallic ships retreat,<br/>
    Save those secur'd by hard-earn'd conquest bound,<br/>
        Attending trophies to the British fleet.</p>
    <p>And one whose crew the muse must sure lament,<br/>
        Whilst valour's honour'd, or the brave held dear,<br/>
    To ocean's bosom for their country sent,<br/>
        To yielding strangers, unallied to fear.</p>
    <p>When Death upon their prow had plac'd his throne,<br/>
        They own his pow'r, and, pleas'd, their homage plight,<br/>
    Scorn to accept the victor's proffer'd boon,<br/>
        Thunder reply, then sink to endless night.</p>
    <p>The blood-ting'd waves inclose their sad remains;<br/>
        But not their fame, that must for ever live,<br/>
    Whilst on the trident France bestows her pains,<br/>
        Or valour's due to foes just Britons give.</p>
    <p>What yell is that which breaks on Fancy's ear!<br/>
        Hark! 'tis the shriek of parents, brothers, wives,<br/>
    Bereft of all their hearts us'd hold most dear,<br/>
        Of every comfort with their kindred lives.</p>
    <p>With fond impatience did the virgin moan<br/>
        Her hero's absence; now despair succeeds;<br/>
    Her tender wishes blasted with a groan,<br/>
        Mad'ning, in death she screams, 'her lover<br/>
                                    bleeds.'<br/></p>
    <p>The helpless orphan, ignorant of woes,<br/>
        Oft lisping, doth require his sire's return,<br/>
    The gushing tear betrays the mother's throes,<br/>
        And soon for both her sorrowing heart must<br/>
                                    mourn.<br/><br/>
    Ye Powers who guide the rulers of this ball,<br/>
        Who with ambition long their course have<br/>
                                    rang'd,<br/>
    With anarchy their country who enthral,<br/>
        Defeat their mischiefs, be their maxims<br/>
                                    chang'd!<br/></p>
    <p>Oh send fair Peace, the greatest good possess'd!<br/>
        Of ills enough each hostile land has shar'd;<br/>
    Her smiling train by free-born minds caress'd,<br/>
        Still be enjoy'd, and guilt and blood be<br/>
                                    spar'd.<br/></p>
    <p>Ah, what avails the victor's splendid car,<br/>
        Of noisy triumph! joy for heedless throngs!<br/>
    What the advantage that can spring from war,<br/>
        To balance make 'gainst mis'ry's countless<br/>
                                    wrongs?<br/></p>
    <p>And when reflection with resistless power<br/>
        Emblazon'd crimes with forceful pencil<br/>
                                    draws,<br/>
    What fame or glory <i>then</i> can cheer the hour,<br/>
        Or plea afford to Heaven's insulted laws?</p>
