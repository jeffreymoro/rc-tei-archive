    <p>1815.9<br/><b>To the People of Spain</b><br/>
    “Vox Populi"<br/><i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, XL (October 1, 1815), p. 237<br/></p>
    <p>Ye sons of Spain, what Gorgon spirit roves<br/>
    Amid your vine-clad hills, your orange groves?<br/>
    What death-like torpor chills each manly form?<br/>
    That once defied the flash and dar'd the storm;<br/>
    What pois'nous breath chill'd freedom at its root,<br/>
    Nips the fair flow'r, and blasts the promis'd fruit?<br/>
    How long shall Tagus pour his golden flood,<br/>
    Red with the sacred stain of patriot blood,<br/>
    And mingle with a nation's timid tears,<br/>
    Nor rouse its vengeance, nor disperse its fears?<br/>
    The soil that now with trembling steps you tread,<br/>
    Heroes have trod, when foes, when tyrants, fled.<br/>
    On you they call, from their dishonor'd graves:<br/>
    Awake! Arise! or be for ever slaves;<br/>
    Awake, ye sons of Spain! your fathers call,<br/>
    Arise to conquer, or, like them, to fall!</p>
    <br/>
