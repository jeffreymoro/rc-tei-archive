    <p>1810.10<br/><b>The True Story</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    “S. A.”<br/>
    [Samuel Ashby]<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXX (December, 1810), p. 568<br/></p>
    <p>Sons of the Arts, of Genius, and the Nine,<br/>
    'Tis not to you that Fortune opes her mine;<br/>
        Hard is the fate ye meet for praise and glory!<br/>
    Plagued by the clown, the idiot, and the sot,<br/>
    Such is the Wit's, the Poet's, Artist's lot!<br/><i>    
    Exempli gratia</i>, take authentic story.<br/></p>
    <p>From London came an Artist of the Brush,<br/>
    And through the country made pedestrian push<br/>
        For subjects new—as landscapes, ruins, charts,<br/>
    Majestic oaks, and castles; and, perchance,<br/>
    Poor, hungry biped! just as if from France!<br/>
    He hop'd to find, along his dirty dance,<br/>
        Food for himself as well as for the Arts!<br/></p>
    <p>And as little curious prying wight,<br/>
    Sketch'd from the mould'ring cloister's broken site,<br/>
    Soon by the spot some farmer hobbinowls<br/>
    Came jogging—nothing vicious in their jowls—<br/>
        And, seeing poor Apelles, one cried, "I<br/>
    Dars for to say, that waggabone we sees<br/>
    There, with his rule and plummet on his knees,<br/>
        Is nothing more, nor less, than a French Spy!"<br/></p>
    <p>Next, to the public-house the clowns repair'd,<br/>
    And told the case, while brother Joskins star'd;<br/>
        "As how, a strange, outlandish man, they see'd,<br/>
    A Mounsheer Spy! and if so be—as how"—<br/>
    When, lo! appears the Painter, makes his bow,<br/>
        And shews his sketch and name, to who could read.<br/>
    Strait, midst the rustic herd, a Chief arose,<br/>
    And thrice he snuff'd up wisdom through the nose,<br/>
        As erst Thersites<a href="#2">[2]</a> did amongst the Greeks—<br/>
    A merchant this, in brandy, rum, and gin,<br/>
    And to Thersites near, in parts, akin;<br/>
    Could read, and, literati say, could write,<br/>
    Hem, snuffle, spit, and grin, most erudite!<br/>
        "Silence!" they cry, "our parish spokesman speaks."<br/></p>
    <p>He thus: "Sir Painter, to be plain, we doubts<br/>
    That you design, by lurking hereabouts,<br/>
        To map our forts and harbours, sound our moats;<br/>
    While thus, to blind us harmless country-folks,<br/>
    You sham to draw old antient walls and oaks,<br/>
        Anon to show the French to cut our throats.<br/>
    We're loyal friend! your looks betray the spy!<br/>
    These gem'men all think so—and so thinks I!<br/>
        You 'fore our Justus must disprove the fact;<br/>
    Swear you are he his-self, the painter Rooker;<br/>
    If not—God bless the King! we must, odzooker!<br/>
        Straitway commit you on the vagrant act."<br/>
    The Painter then, "Most worthy sirs! I prize<br/>
    You much, you are so loyal and so wise;<br/>
        I joy our gracious King such subjects rules.<br/>
    Now to his Worship; pray debate no further;<br/>
    I'll swear I am myself, and not another:<br/>
        That asses still are asses, fools are fools."</p>
