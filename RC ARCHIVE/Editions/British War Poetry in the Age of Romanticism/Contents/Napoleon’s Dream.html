    <p>1814.1<br/><b>Napoleon's Dream</b><br/>
    “Miss Mitford”<br/>
    [Mary Russell Mitford] <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Poetry</i>, VIII (1814), pp. 215-220<br/></p>
    <p>                           I.<br/></p>
    <p>Sweet is the English peasant's joy<br/>
        To watch her husband sleeping,<br/>
    And smile upon the blooming boy<br/>
        To his lov'd bosom creeping;<br/>
    Her finger on her lip the while<br/>
    Mingling fond caution with her smile—<br/>
    For the dear father wearied came<br/>
    From copse-wood to his gentle dame;<br/>
    'Twas cold and wet the dreary day,<br/>
    And long and cheerless was the way—<br/>
        O transitory sorrow!<br/>
    Slumbering beside the faggot's blaze,<br/>
    On his calm mind no vision preys,<br/>
        Care leaves him till the morrow.<br/>
    Yet sometimes o'er his sun-burnt face,<br/>
    A pleasant dream will shed its grace,<br/>
        Sometimes a swelling tear;<br/>
    Full well can she, his happy mate,<br/>
    Link'd to his soul as to his fate,<br/>
    The transient images translate,<br/>
        Nor feel one doubting fear;<br/>
    The heart, the heart oft prompts the themes,<br/>
    Which sleep and memory mould to dreams;<br/>
    As radiance that from diamonds gleams,<br/>
        Is darted from above;<br/>
    That smile the husband's fondness beams,<br/>
        That tear the father's love.<br/></p>
    <p>                          II.<br/></p>
    <p>But 'tis no English cottage there,<br/>
        That rears its Lofty head;<br/>
    No English wife with tender care<br/>
        Watches her husband's bed:<br/>
    No English peasant can he be,<br/>
    That slumbers there so heavily.<br/>
    Though scarce the lamp can pierce the gloom,<br/>
    That shrouds a high and stately room,<br/>
    Its light a bending fair one shows;<br/>
    A man, who snatches short repose;<br/>
    And while St. Cloud's proud walls scarce catch the beam,<br/>
    Louisa wondering, marks Napoleon's dream.<br/></p>
    <p>                          III.<br/></p>
    <p>Strong were the features, sallow, wan,<br/>
    And thoughtful, of the sleeping man:<br/>
    In the fine mould of beauty cast,<br/>
    Till passions wild and moody pass'd,<br/>
    And nature's lovely work o'ercast.<br/>
    Yet smiles, the lightning of the storm,<br/>
    Would sometimes gild their darken'd form;<br/>
    And never had a smile so bright<br/>
    Dwelt on his lips with sunny light<br/>
    Not when the Austrian maid be woo'd,<br/>
    As now beguiles his dreaming mood.<br/>
    His very hand, high rais'd in air,<br/>
    Its gladsome influence seems to share.<br/>
    Thinks he of victory's laurell'd bough?<br/>
    Or of his mighty empire now?<br/>
    In idolizing Paris crown'd?<br/>
    On Austerlitz' red field renown'd?<br/>
    Or, victor at the council board,<br/>
    Deems he his rescued Spain restor'd?<br/>
    Oh, no! not this th' usurper's smile;<br/>
    Not this the statesman's crafty wile;<br/>
    Not this the conqueror's blood-earn'd bliss;<br/>
    No! 'tis a blameless transport this;<br/>
    A joy unfelt of many years,<br/>
    Unstain'd by guilt, unspoilt by fears.<br/></p>
    <p>                         IV.<br/></p>
    <p>Treading a lone and sea-beat shore<br/>
    He seems a thoughtful boy once more:<br/>
    A thoughtful boy, in musings rapt,<br/>
    In hope's delightful visions lapt;<br/>
    He feels the very breezes blow<br/>
    That fann'd his cheek's enraptur'd glow;<br/>
    He hears the very surges beat<br/>
    That wont to lave his careless feet;<br/>
    And every wish and joy again<br/>
    Of happy youth inspires his brain.<br/>
    The rushing tide of love, of hope,<br/>
        Ambition undefin'd,<br/>
    Thoughts that the wealth of worlds would ope<br/>
        To spread it to mankind;<br/>
    Wishes that would possess to give;<br/>
    Power that might say, Be blest and live!<br/>
    That would to all he loved impart<br/>
    The boundless treasures of his heart;<br/>
    Win but to save some land bedeck'd with flowers,<br/>
    And Eden's bliss renew in Eden's blooming bowers.<br/>
    Such are the thoughts that wake his smiles,<br/>
    Such dream his sleeping sense beguiles,<br/>
    And such are young Ambition's wiles.<br/>
    The sun that in the burning street<br/>
        Pours death in every ray,<br/>
    Darting through palms and plaintains sweet,<br/>
    Gives but a soft and balmy heat<br/>
        Where leaf-born breezes play,<br/>
    'Tis as the war-flag closely furl'd<br/>
        When reason reigns within;<br/>
    O 'tis the world, the bitter world,<br/>
        That makes ambition sin.<br/></p>
    <p>                           V.<br/></p>
    <p>Ah, see the brilliant smile is dead!<br/>
    The hand is dropt, the joy is fled!<br/>
    Some thought has indistinctly shown,<br/>
        As in a misty glass,<br/>
    Where all the cares that wait a throne,<br/>
    And youthful hopes and virtues flown,<br/>
        In dim confusion pass;<br/>
    With comrades slain, a fearful band,<br/>
    Brothers who roam a foreign strand,<br/>
        A fond forsaken wife,<br/>
    A bleeding world, a suffering land,<br/>
        His sorrows and his life.<br/>
    Well may he sigh! but that convulsion<br/>
        A deeper anguish caus'd;<br/>
    Almost it seem'd in dread revulsion<br/>
        That Nature's functions paus'd.<br/>
    His brow was wet, his hair uprais'd,<br/>
    His hands were clench'd, his look was mazed,—<br/>
    The empress trembled as she gazed.<br/>
    At Palm's<a href="#2">[2]</a> dread spectre doth he quake?<br/>
    Comes D'Enghien<a href="#3">[3]</a> thus his soul to shake?<br/>
    No; to the consciences of kings<br/>
    Flattery her deadly opiate brings;<br/>
    Though doom'd untried, by impious men,<br/>
    Yet murder shall be justice then.<br/></p>
    <p>                          VI.<br/></p>
    <p>In all his pomp of power array'd<br/>
    The monarch deems himself betray'd;<br/>
    Hemm'd in by guards and armed bands<br/>
    Chain'd in the senate hall he stands;<br/>
    All whom he hated, all he loved<br/>
    Were there, and all his fall approved.<a href="#4">[4]</a><br/>
    E'en the betrayer's self stood nigh,<br/>
    With jeering tongue and scornful eye,<br/>
    And thrice he strove to strike him dead,<br/>
    And thrice the grinning traitor fled,<br/>
    And Frenchmen thrice, with fickle breath,<br/>
    Shouted "Napoleon to the death!"<br/>
    That horror's past: Memory again<br/>
    Binds Fancy in her spell-fraught chain.<br/>
    The vision chang'd, and chang'd his look,<br/>
    Though still his form with chillness shook,<br/>
    Though still uprose his coal-black hair,<br/>
    'Twas anguish still—but not despair.<br/></p>
    <p>                          VII.<br/></p>
    <p>He seem'd through realms of frost to stray<br/>
    Where endless forests barred his way;<br/>
    Forests of pines, whose snow mass made<br/>
    In noontide clear a midnight shade.<br/>
    A sense of solitary care,<br/>
    Silence and deathlike cold were there.<br/>
    And still he thought at every step<br/>
    His jaded steed was forced to leap,<br/>
    Something he could not move, nor kill,<br/>
    Some fell obstruction met him still.<br/>
    At length full in the monarch's way<br/>
    A Gallic soldier dying lay;<br/>
    Napoleon stopp'd and strove to cheer;<br/>
    The warrior's death-groan met his ear,<br/>
    The warrior's death-glance met his eye,<br/>
    That groan that glance he could not fly!<br/>
    A bitter curse they seem'd to shroud.<br/>
    He gallopp'd on, he shouted loud,—<br/>
    But still the groan he cannot fly,<br/>
    But still the glance is in his eye.<br/>
    "Awake! Awake!" and at her touch<br/>
    The hero started from his couch,<br/>
    Awhile he stood and shook with dread,<br/>
    "'Tis but a dream!" at length he said;<br/>
    "'Tis but a bubble of the brain!"<br/>
    He said—yet fear'd to sleep again.<br/></p>
