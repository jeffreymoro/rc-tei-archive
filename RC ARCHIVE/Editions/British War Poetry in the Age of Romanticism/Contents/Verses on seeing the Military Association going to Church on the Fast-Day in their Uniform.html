    <p>1799.6<br/><b>Verses<br/>
    On seeing the Military Association going to Church on<br/>
    the Fast-Day in their Uniform</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Courier</i> (March 14, 1799)<br/></p>
    <p>"Sackcloth and ashes were in ancient times<br/>
    The dress in which the Jews bewail'd their crimes,<br/>
    Marks of contrition for their former guilt,<br/>
    And signs of sorrow for the blood they spilt.<br/>
    But modern times a different scene display,<br/>
    And Britain keeps her Fasts another way.<br/>
    Dress'd in the pomp of military glare,<br/>
    OUR CHRISTIANS go to say their Form of Pray'r;<br/>
    Not to lament the evils they have done,<br/>
    And humbly pray in future such to shun;<br/>
    Not to lament the numbers who have died<br/>
    Victims to Pow'r, Injustice and to Pride;<br/>
    Not to lament the Nation's great distress,<br/>
    And sorrow for its num'rous crimes confess;<br/>
    They only pray that Heav'n would interpose,<br/>
    And pour its vengeance on their guilty Foes:—<br/>
    On Atheists, Rebels, and on Regicides,<br/>
    And ev'ry one who Ministers derides;<br/>
    Like Pharisees of old they dare to plead<br/>
    Their own good works, and think they most succeed."</p>
