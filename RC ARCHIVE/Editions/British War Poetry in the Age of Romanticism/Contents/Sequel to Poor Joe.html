    <p>1811.4<br/><b>Sequel to Poor Joe</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (November 7, 1811)<br/></p>
    <p>The topsails had caught the first beams of the morning,<br/>
        The ocean was smiling, the sky was serene,<br/>
    When Harwich we made, with our cargo returning<br/>
        Of sick and of dying from swampy Walcheren.<br/></p>
    <p>(Where death of my father had lately bereft me,<br/>
        And the son of my sad widow'd bosom laid low;<br/>
    Where my comrade and brother for ever had left me—<br/>
        The wedded of ANNA—my sister's POOR JOE!)<br/></p>
    <p>Alas; the still sky, and the wave softly glowing<br/>
        With light's lovely dawn, and dear Harwich in view,<br/>
    Sooth'd not my lorn heart, and check'd not the flowing<br/>
        Of tears, my dear ANNA, that streamed for you.<br/></p>
    <p>For, there, in the hope of a husband embracing,<br/>
        When fondly you thought the foul pest had gone by,<br/>
    I saw you the brink of the main wildly pacing,—<br/>
        Saw your stretch'd arms, and I mark'd your strain'd eye.<br/><br/>
    Say, how, my forlorn heart—Oh! how can I tell her—<br/>
        Whose breast fond affection has chose for its throne?<br/>
    How can my tongue utter what loss has befel her?<br/>
        A loss that brings back all my griefs for my own.<br/></p>
    <p>I leap'd on the strand, with my eyes overflowing;<br/>
        For mankind recoil'd from its burthen of woe,<br/>
    When ANNA—her fond arms around my neck throwing—<br/>
        Cry'd "Welcome!—Oh! welcome!—Where lingers POOR JOE?<br/></p>
    <p>"Behold yonder cottage, where, waiting to greet him,<br/>
        "Sweet slumbers my WILLIAM, the pledge of his joy;<br/>
    "From whose tender arms I have hurried to meet him,<br/>
        "To catch one embrace ere he blesses his boy.<br/></p>
    <p>"And where is my father, that vet'ran in glory?<br/>
        "And where your own HENRY, the gallant and brave?"<br/>
    "Oh! ANNA! most mournful and dark is their story—<br/>
        "By <i>folly destroy'd</i>, they lie low in the grave.<br/></p>
    <p>"And JOE—Oh! no never thine eyes shall behold him!<br/>
        "My spirit with horror revolts from the scene!<br/>
    "No more shall the arms of his ANNA enfold him,<br/>
        "Who languish'd and dy'd on the shores of Walcheren.<br/></p>
    <p>"It was not the Warrior, in battle contending,<br/>
        "By strength or by courage, that hasten'd their doom;<br/>
    "But neglect, want, and pestilence, horribly blending,<br/>
        "That dragg'd them inglorious to rest in the tomb."<br/></p>
    <p>I look'd—and the eye of poor ANNA was closing—<br/>
        I felt—and the cheek of poor ANNA was cold.<br/>
    "Yet, take me"—she said "where my child is reposing,<br/>
        "That his face, 'ere I die, I may once more behold."<br/></p>
    <p>I obey'd. From the strand with her lifeless form bending,<br/>
        By hardships enfeebled—by misery brought low—<br/>
    I went—my brave comrades in silence attending,<br/>
        And shedding a tear for the wrongs of "POOR JOE."<br/></p>
    <p>By the side of her dear one, unconscious I laid her,<br/>
        The loving—the innocent victim of woe;<br/>
    She, joining my hand and her orphan's together,<br/>
        Said, "Oh! be a friend to the child of POOR JOE."<br/></p>
    <p>And struggling with death—"Oh! I feel my heart breaking,<br/>
        "Far, far from this scene of my anguish I go;<br/>
    "Great Power! to THY BEST, which my spirit is seeking,<br/>
        "Receive me!"—then dying, she join'd her "POOR JOE."<br/><br/>
    Oh! deep was the sorrow from sympathy flowing,<br/>
        That stream'd o'er the orphan we all vowed to save;<br/>
    Yet—<i>Blest is the heart where compassion is glowing,</i><br/>
        And, dear to his God are the tears of the brave.</p>
