    1810.1<br/><b>Walcheren Expedition;<br/>
    Or, the Englishman's Lamentation for the Loss of<br/>
    His Countrymen.</b><br/>
    [James Henry Leigh Hunt]<br/><i>The Examiner</i> (January 7, 1810)<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (January 8, 1810)<br/><i>The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Poetry</i>, VII (1812), pp. 249-251 <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Ye brave, enduring Englishmen,<br/>
        Who dash through fire and flood,<br/>
    And spend with equal thoughtlessness<br/>
        Your money and your blood,<br/>
    I sing of that black season,<br/>
        Which all true hearts deplore,<br/>
            When ye lay,<br/>
            Night and day,<br/>
    Upon Walcheren's swampy shore.<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/></p>
    <p>'Twas in the summer's sunshine<br/>
        Your mighty host set sail,<br/>
    With valour in each longing heart<br/>
        And vigour in the gale;<br/>
    The Frenchman dropp'd his laughter,<br/>
        The Fleming's thoughts grew sore,<br/>
            As ye came<br/>
            In your fame<br/>
    To the dark and swampy shore.<br/></p>
    <p>But foul delays encompass'd ye<br/>
        More dang'rous than the foe,<br/>
    As Antwerp's town and its guarded fleet<br/>
        Too well for Britons know;<br/>
    One spot alone ye conquer'd<br/>
        With hosts unknown of yore;<br/>
            And your might<br/>
            Day and night,<br/>
    Lay still on the swampy shore.<br/></p>
    <p>In vain your dauntless mariners<br/>
        Mourn'd ev'ry moment lost,<br/>
    In vain your soldiers threw their eyes<br/>
        In flame to the hostile coast;<br/>
    The fire of gallant aspects<br/>
        Was doom'd to be no more,<br/>
            And your fame<br/>
            Sunk with shame<br/>
    In the dark and the swampy shore.<br/><br/>
    Ye died not in the triumphing<br/>
        Of the battle-shaken flood,<br/>
    Ye died not on the charging field<br/>
        In the mingle of brave blood;<br/>
    But 'twas in wasting fevers<br/>
        Full three months and more,<br/>
            Britons born,<br/>
            Pierc'd with scorn,<br/>
    Lay at rot on the swampy shore.<br/></p>
    <p>No ship came o'er to bring relief,<br/>
        No orders came to save;<br/>
    But DEATH stood there and never stirr'd,<br/>
        Still counting for the grave.<br/>
    They lay down, and they linger'd,<br/>
        And died with feelings sore,<br/>
            And the waves<br/>
            Pierc'd their graves<br/>
    Thro' the dark and the swampy shore.<br/></p>
    <p>Oh England! Oh my Countrymen!<br/>
        Ye ne'er shall thrive again,<br/>
    Till freed from Councils obstinate<br/>
        Of mercenary men.<br/>
    So toll for the six thousand<br/>
        Whose miseries are o'er,<br/>
            Where the deep,<br/>
            To their sleep,<br/>
    Bemoans on the swampy shore.</p>

On July 28, 1809, 39,000 British fighting men were sent to the Low Countries under the Command of John Pitt, 2nd earl of Chatham. Instead of marching on Antwerp, Chatham ordered his men to take Walcheren Island off Flushing. By September when half his troops were recalled, 11,000 of Chatham's men had contracted fever, unused as they were to the swampy region. By December when the remaining troops were called back, the casualties numbered 4,044, only 106 of whom had been killed in battle.</span>
