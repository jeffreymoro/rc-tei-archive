In order to engage the Archduke's troops, Napoleon ordered his army to cross the river below Vienna where the Danube was split by islands into smaller channels. His forces were successfully repulsed by the Austrians between the villages of Aspern and Essling, and this defeat marked a turning point in the Austrian campaign.</span>
