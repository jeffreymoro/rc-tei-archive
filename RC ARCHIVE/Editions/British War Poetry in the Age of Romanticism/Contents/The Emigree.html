    <p>1799.9<br/><b>The Emigree</b><br/>
    “F. A.”<br/><i>The Monthly Mirror</i>, VIII (August 1799), p. 109<br/></p>
    <p><i>The</i> words of the song of Rosalie, sung last season by Miss Waters,<br/>
        at Covent Garden theatre, on her benefit night, are altered<br/>
        from the Emigree, a sonnet written by Mr. Frederick Atkinson;<br/>
        and in that altered state are published without his knowledge.<br/>
        The original words, in the character of Sabina, are as fol-<br/>
        lows, and have never before been published.<br/></p>
    <p>      My lov'd parents are gone!—alas, ne'er to return,<br/>
          And have left poor Sabina their suff'rings to mourn;<br/>
          All my friends are dispers'd, and I comfortless roam,<br/>
          Here a stranger to all—without money or home.<br/>
              Escap'd from a nation who wish'd to enslave her,<br/>
              A poor little <i>Emigree</i> sues for your favour!<br/><br/>
          Once encompass'd by pleasures, and cheer'd by content,<br/>
          O'er the smooth paths of innocence joyful I went;<br/>
          In our mansion of peace, my fond parents too blest,<br/>
          Entwin'd wreaths of delight to encircle my breast.<br/>
              Escap'd from a nation who wish'd to enslave her,<br/>
              A poor little <i>Emigree</i> sues for your favour.<br/></p>
    <p>      Now no parent, no friend, no country, no home!<br/>
          All lost to Sabina—full cheerless I roam:<br/>
          In this land of fair freedom I look for the smile<br/>
          Which can soften distress, and my sorrows beguile.<br/>
              Escap'd from a nation who wish'd to enslave her,<br/>
              A poor little <i>Emigree</i> sues for your favour.</p>
