    <p>1806.7<br/><b>Song</b><br/>
    “Leo”<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXVI (August, 1806), p. 750<br/></p>
    <p>    Wandring from town to town, I go,<br/>
    A beggar boy oppress'd with woe;<br/>
    My Father was a gallant tar,<br/>
    He fought and fell at Trafalgar;<br/>
    O, faint am I for want of bread,<br/>
    And weary is my naked head;<br/>
    Yet still my bosom swells with pride,<br/>
    My sire with <i>Nelson conquering</i> died.<br/></p>
    <p>    O, when the news of victory came<br/>
    My Mother shudder'd at the name,<br/>
    And soon she heard that in the strife<br/>
    My noble father lost his life;<br/>
    She clasp'd my neck, and kiss'd my cheek,<br/>
    And sigh'd and wept, but could not speak;<br/>
    Yet still her bosom swell'd with pride,<br/>
    My sire with <i>Nelson conquering</i> died.<br/></p>
    <p>    But, ah! misfortune had not pass'd,<br/>
    And heavier than the first the last:<br/>
    My Mother from my arms must part,<br/><i>Continual sorrow broke her heart!</i><br/>
    An orphan now bereft of joy<br/>
    I wander on a beggar boy;<br/>
    Yet still my bosom swells with pride,<br/>
    My sire with <i>Nelson conquering</i> died.<br/></p>
    <p><i>Stokesley</i>.<br/></p>
