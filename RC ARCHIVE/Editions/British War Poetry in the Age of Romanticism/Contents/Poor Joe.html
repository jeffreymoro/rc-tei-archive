    <p>1811.3<br/><b>Poor Joe</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (October 26, 1811)<br/></p>
    <p>While youth's early roses his cheek yet invested,<br/>
        The rough paths of glory ambitious to tread,<br/>
    Poor JOE in the cause of his Country enlisted,<br/>
        With RAWDON THE VIRTUOUS<a href="#1">[1]</a> fought, conquer'd, and bled.<br/><br/>
    And when through all hazards their duty pursuing,<br/>
        The warriors of Britain plough'd Africa's wave,<br/>
    Egyptia to free from invasion and ruin,<br/>
        He join'd ABERCROMBIE THE HAPLESS!—THE BRAVE!<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/></p>
    <p>But when by the horrors of battle surrounded,<br/>
        While <i>general'd by heroes</i>, his soul was serene;<br/>
    For Death he not fear'd—<i>till by folly confounded</i>,<br/>
        <i>He trod with a Chatham the shores of Walcheren</i>!<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Where from the low marshes, on dew-muffled pinion,<br/>
        The dark scowling daemons of pestilence rise,<br/>
    O'er the frame of the warrior usurping dominion,<br/>
        Unstring his firm heart, and dejected he dies.<br/></p>
    <p>'Twas under the boughs of a tear-dropping willow,<br/>
        By the life-blasting mildew despoil'd of its green,<br/>
    Lone, helpless, and dying, POOR JOE made his pillow,<br/>
        Lamenting his lot on the shores of Walcheren!<br/></p>
    <p>"Oh! sad was the hour when from England we ventur'd,<br/>
        "And cruel the mandate that bade us to sail;<br/>
    "For with sickness and death was the contest we enter'd,<br/>
        "And who against sickness and death can prevail?<br/></p>
    <p>"When among my dear comrades as once I contended,<br/>
        "Had the chance of the battle on earth laid me low,<br/>
    "With the anguish of dying some cheer had been blended,<br/>
        "Some comfort had sooth'd the last pangs of poor JOE.<br/></p>
    <p>"For then had I fallen, though helpless and bleeding,<br/>
        "While yet my Creator perception allow'd,<br/>
    "As the last drop of life from my heart was receding,<br/>
        "I should have rejoic'd that for England it flow'd.<br/></p>
    <p>"But here all forlorn, doom'd to suffer and languish,<br/>
        "No enemy conquer'd, no purpose secur'd,<br/>
    "Complaining I die, while the foe mocks my anguish,<br/>
        "Which trebles the misery I long have endur'd.<br/><br/>
    "Farewell, my dear ANNA! from you I must sever,<br/>
        "And thou, little orphan, I ne'er shall see more,<br/>
    "Farewell: may kind Providence bless you for ever!<br/>
        "And soon may you cease your deep loss to deplore."<br/></p>
    <p>Thus thro' the long night near his station remaining,<br/>
        To the tear-dropping willow he utter'd his woe,<br/>
    Till death put a period to all his complaining,<br/>
        And Heaven received the soul of POOR JOE.<br/></p>
    <p>Oh! England, throughout thy rich towns and sweet vallies,<br/>
        May the stern voice of Freedom and Virtue resound—<br/>
    May they guard and reform both the Cottage and Palace,<br/>
        While the strong arms of Union enclasp them around.<br/></p>
    <p>So, the vile and the venal, far, far from thee driven,<br/>
        The sun of thy glory once more shall arise,<br/>
    To cheer and illumine the path of the living,<br/>
        And heighten the bliss of POOR JOE in the skies.<br/></p>
