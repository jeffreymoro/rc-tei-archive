    <p>1793.4<br/><b>Sonnet to Rational Liberty</b><br/>
    "Dr. Mavor"<br/>
    [William Fordyce Mavor]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXIII (March 1793), p. 263<br/></p>
    <p style="text-align: left">On reading the horrid acts of the Paris Mob.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left">By Dr. Mavor.<br/></p>
    <p>Dearer than life, than love more sweet,<br/>
        Of every joy the source, the zest!<br/>
    Thee, LIBERTY! I fondly greet,<br/>
        Thy genuine spirit fires my breast.<br/></p>
    <p>No tyrant's frown, no traitor's harlot smile,<br/>
        My free born soul shall awe, my sense<br/>
            shall ne'er beguile.<br/>
    Rais'd on the throne of LAW and RIGHT,<br/>
    O ever shield thy favourite land!<br/>
        While Anarchy, with wild affright,<br/>
    Flies to GALLIA's frantic strand.<br/>
    O check these scenes of dire uproar—<br/>
        Revenge thy prostituted name!<br/>
    And far, O far, from BRITAIN'S shore<br/>
    Drive the foul deeds that clothe thy charms<br/>
        with shame.</p>
