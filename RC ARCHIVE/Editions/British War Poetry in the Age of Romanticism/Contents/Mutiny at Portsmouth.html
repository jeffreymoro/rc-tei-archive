<p>1797.3<br/><b>Mutiny at Portsmouth</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Post</i> (April 25, 1797)<br/><i>The Courier</i> (April 25, 1797)<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: left">
    <i>The following is a popular Song among the Fleet;</i>
    <br/>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">(Composed on Board His Majesty's Ship London)<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: left">                           By the<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: left">                 Widow of a Seaman,<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Who lost his Life in the Defence of his Country,<br/>
    on Board the Intrepid, in the present War.<br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Genius of Britain went hovering round,<br/>
        For she fear'd that fair Freedom was fled,<br/>
    But she found, to her joy, that she was not quite gone,<br/>
        But remain'd with the Fleet at Spithead.<br/></p>
<p>Rejoic'd at the news, to the <i>Charlotte</i> she flew,<br/>
        Where fair Freedom, she heard, sat enthron'd,<br/>
    They all mann'd the yards as the Goddess came in,<br/>
        For Britain and Freedom they own'd.<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The Fleet hail'd the Goddess with three hearty<br/>
                                cheers,<br/>
        As she stood on the <i>Charlotte's</i> gangway,<br/>
    She dropped a sad tear as she look'd on her Sons,<br/>
        Who so long neglected had lay.<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: left">She was led to the Cabin, fair Freedom was there,<br/>
        True Loyalty sat by her side,<br/>
    Britannia sat down in a transport of joy,<br/>
        All hail to my Heroes, she cry'd.<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Every ship of the line sent two Seamen so brave,<br/>
        Whom the Goddess receiv'd with a smile;<br/>
    They assur'd her that, if they were treated like men,<br/>
        They would still guard her favourite Isle.<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Go on my brave Sons in the steps you now tread,<br/>
        Be Virtue your guide and your guard;<br/>
    And God, who rules over the Land and the Sea,<br/>
        Will honest endeavours reward.<br/><br/>
    The Genius of <i>Ireland</i> came in with her harp,<br/>
        She saluted fair Freedom with tears:<br/>
    They all mann'd the yards to welcome her o'er,<br/>
        And ev'ry Ship gave her three cheers.<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Success to the Seventeen united bright Stars,<br/>
        Let their praise echo round ev'ry shore.<br/>
    And the 15th of April will ne'er be forgot,<a href="#1">[1]<br/></a>     Till Britain and Freedom're no more.<br/></p>
