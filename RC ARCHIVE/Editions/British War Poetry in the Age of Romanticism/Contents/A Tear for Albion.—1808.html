    <p>1810.11<br/><b>A Tear for Albion.—1808</b><br/>
    “S. M. W****G.”<br/><i>The Poetical Magazine</i>, II (1810), pp. 169-170<br/></p>
    <p>Say, can the Bard, who owns his native land,<br/>
        Love 'mid the tempest of her skies to sing;<br/>
    Or call her sentence, with prophetic hand,<br/>
        In deep-ton'd numbers from the Pythian string?<br/></p>
    <p>No! ev'ry feeling chides th' ungrateful thought,<br/>
        Nature's loud mandate bids him bend and weep<br/>
    O'er the wide wreck that marks his country's lot,<br/>
        Till Fate's last billows hide it in the deep.<br/></p>
    <p>Yet why, since streams that Pity's eye has pour'd,<br/>
        Are softly mingling in the hallow'd fount,<br/>
    Should they, in vain, awake her plaintive chord,<br/>
        Or flow unheeded down the sacred mount?<br/></p>
    <p>Dear Albion! loveliest daughter of the sea,<br/>
        When with thy gladd'ning dawn th' horizon glow'd,<br/>
    Pale Envy dropp'd her dart and gaz'd on thee,<br/>
        And strangers wond'ring sought thy blest abode.<br/></p>
    <p>There was a day (Reflection yet recalls<br/>
        Bright from the annals of thy favour'd land,<br/>
    On Fame's high temple's adamantine walls<br/>
        It stands engrav'd by Mem'ry's mighty hand)<br/></p>
    <p>When, deeply rooted in its native rock,<br/>
        Thy tree of commerce rais'd its stately head;<br/>
    Whilst, guarded safely from each foreign shock,<br/>
        The blossom flourish'd as the branches spread.<br/><br/>
    Its fruit matur'd was scatter'd on thy breast,<br/>
        Where Peace beneath her olive-bow'r had made;<br/>
    And sky-born Freedom built her eagle nest<br/>
        High 'mid the verdure of the fragrant shade.<br/></p>
    <p>But howling since along the frowning sky,<br/>
        And wing 'd with tempest, has demoniac War<br/>
    Flash'd his fierce lightnings, shook his sword on high,<br/>
        Hewn the broad trunk, and strew'd its limbs afar.<br/></p>
    <p>So grew that tree<a href="#1">[1]</a> which Babel's haughty King<br/>
        Saw in the nightly visions of his soul,<br/>
    As late, upborne on Pride's misguided wing,<br/>
        He view'd the glories of his wide control.<br/></p>
    <p>But whilst he cried, in that ill-fated hour,<br/>
        "How great is Babylon! secure I reign!"<br/>
    The branch of empire, and the bloom of pow'r<br/>
        Fell crush'd, and wither'd on the blasted plain.<br/></p>
    <p>His boasted name, to infamy consign'd,<br/>
        Lost in the ruins of his fallen throne;<br/>
    And soon (O Albion!) to his humbled mind,<br/>
        Instruction taught a lesson like thy own:—<br/></p>
    <p>That He who hurls, by his unerring word,<br/>
        The bolts of Justice flaming on the land,<br/>
    Has ne'er unsheath'd in vain th' avenging sword,<br/>
        Nor pois'd the balance with a palsied hand.<br/></p>
    <p>Yet, if mild Mercy shield thy hapless head,<br/>
        If her eternal band<a href="#2">[2]</a> preserve the whole,<br/>
    May thy fair foliage yet reviving spread<br/>
        A goodly shadow wide, from pole to pole!<br/></p>
    <p>May He, whose thunders shake thy sea-beat shore,<br/>
        Bid each rude storm that wastes thy honours cease;<br/>
    And with the sceptre of thy sway restore<br/>
        The robe of Joy—the diadem of Peace!<br/></p>
    <p><i>Alton</i>.</p>
