    <p>1800.5<br/><b>The Generous Soldier</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Universal Magazine</i>, CVII (November 1800), pp. 374-375<br/></p>
    <p>An Anecdote by Mr. Booker.<br/></p>
    <p>Beside a path, worn bare by frequent feet,<br/>
    Sat—shiv'ring in the blast—an hoary wretch,<br/>
    On whose quench'd eye-balls the meridian sun<br/>
    Wasted its beams. A weather-beaten cap<br/>
    He, silent, held; and left his piteous case<br/>
    To tongue his woes. But few more falt'ring<br/>
                            steps,<br/>
    Thro' the dark world, he lonely had to tread,<br/>
    And then find shelter in the peaceful grave.<br/>
    —Speechless he sat; but sat not long, in vain.<br/>
    A brave defender of old England's isle<br/>
    Cane where he was; and, with observant eye,<br/>
    Beheld and pitied him. On furlough bent,<br/>
    A knapsack o'er his belted shoulders lay,<br/>
    Containing his attire—soon told; small wealth<br/>
    He boasted else; yet, of that little, cast<br/>
    A lib'ral portion to the suppliant old.—<br/>
    Unseen, he ween'd, by ev'ry mortal eye,<br/>
    Sat <i>one</i>, not less with admiration touch'd<br/>
    Than he with pity, saw the gen'rous deed,<br/>
    And thus him instant hail'd: 'Well pleas'd,<br/>
                            brave youth,<br/>
    Witness'd have I thy bounty; which but ill<br/>
    A soldier's purse can spare—Allay me thus<br/>
    Such goodness to requite: be this thy mead.'<br/>
    He said—presenting, with his courteous speech,<br/>
    A piece of silver. Grateful, this, receiv'd<br/>
    The youthful warrior, and, receding straight,<br/>
    The splendid coin bestow'd where late he threw<br/>
    His former off'ring: then the doner kind<br/>
    Accosted thus—'Forgive, too gen'rous sir!<br/>
    My rude appropriation of thy gift,<br/>
    Which that poor suff'rer's wants more urgent<br/>
                            need,<br/>
    Than do my own.'—This said, he hied away-<br/>
    Swift, as if marching to the battle's call,<br/>
    Debarring further converse; or afraid<br/>
    To hear the voice of praise. Unknown, he fled,<br/>
    Defeating ev'ry purpose to promote<br/>
    Him in the martial ranks which Freedom's isle<br/>
    Guard from each hostile arm.—But where pale<br/>
                            want<br/>
    Compassion's willing mite no more shall claim,<br/>
    The King of kings near his eternal throne<br/>
    Will place the Christian-hero: for the deed<br/>
    Approving spirits, on aerial wing,<br/>
    To heav'n's high chancery, delighted, bore;<br/>
    And the recording angel it inscrib'd<br/>
    On monumental adamant and gold,<br/>
    In glorious characters of living light,<br/>
    Bright as the sun, and purer than his fires.</p>
