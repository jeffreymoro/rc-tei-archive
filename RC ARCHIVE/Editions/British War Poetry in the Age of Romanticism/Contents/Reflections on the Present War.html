    <p>1795.9<br/><b>Reflections on the Present War</b><br/>
    W. W. Deacon<br/><i>The Morning Post</i> (February 6, 1795)</p>
    <p>In vain may Britons sue for Peace,<br/>
    Fresh obstacles will never cease,<br/>
        Their wishes to oppose.<br/>
    While men direct the Public Weal,<br/>
    Too high to stoop, too proud to feel,<br/>
        For England's bleeding woes.</p>
    <p>'Tis Place and Pension bear the sway,<br/>
    While Power unlicens'd cloggs the way<br/>
        To Merit's humble cot;<br/>
    'Tis Wealth the busy Statesman sires,<br/>
    He barters, bargains, then retires,<br/>
        On what Oppression got.</p>
    <p>No comforts for the poor remain,<br/>
    They hear of friends, of kindred slain,<br/>
        In vain their loss deplore;<br/>
    While Commerce droops her languid head,<br/>
    And wretched groups, for want of bread,<br/>
        Desert their native shore.</p>
    <p>While Placemen deck'd in rich array.<br/>
    Their gaudy luxuries display,<br/>
        And dash from door to door;<br/>
    Unmov'd they view the wretched fates<br/>
    Of thousands begging at their gates,<br/>
        Or welt'ring in their gore.<br/><br/>
    How little for this State avails,<br/>
    Whether a Cha--m<a href="#1">[1]</a> now prevails,<br/>
        Or now a Port---d's<a href="#2">[2]</a> nam'd;<br/>
    If for a scarf, or garter blue,<br/>
    The same injustice they pursue,<br/>
        Which just before they blam'd?</p>
    <p>While men the Corpus Act suspend,<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/>
    On which our Liberties depend,<br/>
        Who can from prison get?<br/>
    Since Freedom's brightest gem is gone,<br/>
    The rays which once with lustre shone,<br/>
        Is now for ever set?</p>
    <p>If Crimps and Spies, both night and day,<br/>
    Are suffer'd on mankind to prey,<br/>
        And families divide;<br/>
    Ah! where is now that sacred claim!<br/>
    That made with joy each Briton name<br/>
        His cot, his castle's pride?</p>
    <p>Where Evils are so thick ally'd,<br/>
    What remedies can be apply'd,<br/>
        Lost Comforts to restore;<br/>
    Since then our Pilot is a P--t,<a href="#4">[4]</a><br/>
    On rocks and quicksands we shall split,<br/>
        And fall to rise no more!</p>
    <p>'Tis men and measures must be chang'd,<br/>
    Or Evils partially arrang'd,<br/>
        Are Evils to inflame;<br/>
    The only sure, efficient plan,<br/>
    Is to dismiss that haughty man,<br/>
        From whom those Evils came.<br/><br/>
    To call in those of worth approv'd,<br/>
    Who by their Country are belov'd,<br/>
        Respected by her foes;<br/>
    In short, to sue for speedy Peace,<br/>
    The wants of thousands to decrease,<br/>
        And Plenty's smiles disclose.</p>
