    <p>1794.15<br/><b>Ode</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Scots Magazine</i>, LVI (August 1794), p. 474<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXV (May 1794), pp. 389-390</p>
    <p>To the Memory of the British Officers, Seamen,<br/>
    and Soldiers, <i>who have fallen in the present War</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>While Mars prevails o'er earth and main,<br/>
    Record, O Muse, the valiant Slain,<br/>
        Who fought for Britain's right;<br/>
    Here smiling youth, there manly grace,<br/>
    Abandon'd to Death's cold embrace,<br/>
        Are lost in shades of night.</p>
    <p>No tender friend, no parent near,<br/>
    Drops o'er their wounds the balmy tear<br/>
        Of pity or of love:<br/>
    But fame eternal is their meed,<br/>
    And ev'ry bold heroic deed<br/>
        Is register'd above.</p>
    <p>If conquest crown our martial bands,<br/>
    To Heav'n they raise their grateful hands,<br/>
        And meet resign'd their fate;<br/>
    And if misfortune cloud the day,<br/>
    Nor fugitives nor captives they<br/>
        Disgrace and scorn await.</p>
    <p>No earthly foe o'er them has pow'r,<br/>
    Victorious in that awful hour<br/>
        Which claims their latest breath;<br/>
    Their soul with purest rapture flies<br/>
    Triumphant to her native skies,<br/>
        Nor feels the sting of death.</p>
    <p>Approach their tomb, ye chosen few,<br/>
    Who Virtue's active path pursue,<br/>
        And shun ignoble rest.<br/>
    But hence retire, ye slaves of Vice,<br/>
    Whom Luxury's vain charms entice.<br/>
        Corrupters of the breast.</p>
    <p>Ye cold philosophers, who zeal<br/>
    For friends or country ne'er could feel,<br/>
        To seek this glorious lot;<br/>
    And you, by sordid int'rest charm'd,<br/>
    Whom never spark of honour warm'd,<br/>
        Forbear this hallow'd spot!<br/><br/>
    Your sumptuous mansions, letter'd case,<br/>
    And hoarded gold, no long please,<br/>
        When barb'rous foes are near:<br/>
    But shall this costly blood be spilt,<br/>
    To snatch the sons of sloth and guilt,<br/>
        From danger and from fear?</p>
    <p>No! Heroes bleed in Glory's cause,<br/>
    Defenders of their country's laws,<br/>
        And just monarchal sway.<br/>
    They bleed to save the guiltless maid,<br/>
    To guard the tender orphan's head<br/>
        From insult and dismay;</p>
    <p>To shield the rev'rend locks of age,<br/>
    And ev'ry mild benignant sage,<br/>
        Who teaches heavenly lore:<br/>
    To keep from wrong the silent grave,<br/>
    Where rest the good, the just, the brave,<br/>
        And peace on earth restore.</p>
    <p>Then sacred be each honour'd name!<br/>
    Let Albion still their worth proclaim,<br/>
        And palms unfading bring.<br/>
    For them parental chiefs shall mourn,<br/>
    And fainted warriors o'er their urn<br/>
        Celestial dirges sing.</p>
    <p>But when the martial trumpets cease,<br/>
    And Victory conducting Peace,<br/>
        Diffuses joy around:<br/>
    When notes of triumph rend the sky,<br/>
    How many widow'd hearts shall sigh!<br/>
        What tears bedew the ground!</p>
    <p>Their conq'ring friends shall then relate<br/>
    How brave their deeds, how blest their fate,<br/>
        Who vanquish even in death:<br/>
    And, musing o'er their glorious doom,<br/>
    Unbind and place upon their tomb<br/>
        The well-earn'd laurel wreath.</p>
