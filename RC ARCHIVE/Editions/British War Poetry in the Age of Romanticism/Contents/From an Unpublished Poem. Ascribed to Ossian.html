    <p>1805.6<br/><b>From an Unpublished Poem.<br/>
    Ascribed to Ossian</b><br/>
    “T.”<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (September 19, 1805)<br/></p>
    <p>Oh! burn the tall heath which now waves in the gale;<br/>
    Let nought but the war songs of ODIN prevail;<br/>
    The prows of the Stranger now swell the green wave,<br/>
    Unsheath then, ye Heroes, the sword of the brave!<br/>
    Chace the Deer of black MORVERN far from the shore—<br/>
    'Till the Banquet of DEATH and ODIN is o'er.<br/>
    Ye Bards, sing the deeds of our fathers of old,<br/>
    And rouse to new glory the brave and the bold.<br/></p>
    <p>Strike the harp ye Daughters of MOINA'S green Isle,<br/>
    Let the Warriors rejoice in Beauty's soft smile,<br/>
    Swell the strings with the deeds of FINGAL'S brave line;<br/>
    Their names through the darkness of ages shall shine!<br/>
    Strike the spear on the ground, the signal of war,<br/>
    The shell of brave CAIRBAR resounds from afar;<br/>
    The heroes shall start from the heath-cover'd cell,<br/>
    Determin'd to fall as their forefathers fell.<br/></p>
    <p>Bend the bow, ye huntsmen of Colna's dark plain;<br/>
    Rejoice in the strength of your arrows again,—<br/>
    The spears of the Strangers now darken the sky—<br/>
    Thrice the Eagle hath shriek'd—dread Odin is nigh!<br/>
    Then burn the tall heath which now waves in the gale,<br/>
    Let nought but the war songs of Odin prevail,<br/>
    The prows of the Stranger now swell the green wave,<br/>
    Unsheath then, ye heroes, the Sword of the Brave!<br/></p>
