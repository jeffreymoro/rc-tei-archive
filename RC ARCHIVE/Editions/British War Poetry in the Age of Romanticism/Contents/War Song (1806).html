    <p>1806.10<br/><b>War Song</b><br/>
    “Frater”<br/><i>The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Verse</i>, V (1806), pp. 390-392<br/></p>
    <p>Warriors! see th' Invader near!<br/>
    Warriors! now the standard rear—<br/>
    Grasp the sabre—point the spear.<br/>
                                           Warriors! rise.<br/><br/>
    By the Hero's hallow'd fame;<br/>
    By the coward's deathless shame;<br/>
    By Ireland's injur'd honour'd name;<br/>
    By Borhoime's shade, whose dying hand,<br/>
    On the bloody Clontarf strand<br/>
    Swept the wild Dane from the land,<br/>
                                           Warriors! rise.<br/></p>
    <p>Onward! to the battle go,<br/>
    Bid the Atheist Plund'rer know,<br/>
    Our breasts with Irish valour glow!<br/>
    If, trusting to his faith, ye yield,<br/>
    The die is cast, your doom is seal'd—<br/>
    Remember Jaffa's murd'rous field!<br/>
                                           Warriors! rise.<br/></p>
    <p>By all the Hero's heart holds dear—<br/>
    The Spouse's smile, the Infant's tear,<br/>
    The voice of God and Nature near.<br/>
    'Tis in no Tyrant's tott'ring cause,<br/>
    'Tis for his King, his Home, his Laws,<br/>
    The Freeman's sword the Freeman draws.<br/>
                                          Warriors! rise.<br/></p>
    <p>When did the Frenchman learn to spare<br/>
    The kneeling Parent's hoary hair,<br/>
    Or soften to the Infant's pray'r?<br/>
    Tho' Fate or Fortune waft him o'er,<br/>
    Teach him, if once he treads our shore,<br/>
    He treads it—to return no more.<br/>
                                          Warriors! rise.<br/></p>
    <p>See! yonder see his banners wave!<br/>
    Fathers! Brothers! Sons! be brave—<br/>
    Give him no ground, but for his grave.<br/>
    What, tho' his countless hosts pour on—<br/>
    What tho' on earth we stand alone,<br/>
    To shield the Temple and the Throne—<br/>
                                          Warriors! rise.<br/></p>
    <p>By the Captive's galling chain,<br/>
    By the polluted, plunder'd fane—<br/>
    The ruin'd cot—the smoaking plain—<br/>
    On! Warriors!—to the Battle go,<br/>
    Squadrons, sweeping on the Foe,<br/>
    Strike the exterminating blow.<br/>
                                          Warriors! rise.<br/><br/>
    Rushing thro' the heaps of slain,<br/>
    Re-dye with many a gory stain<br/>
    The laurels of the Egyptian plain.<br/>
    Now! the hour of trail's nigh—<br/>
    Swell the battle-chorus high,<br/>
    "Death! glorious Death or Liberty!"<br/>
                                          Warriors! rise.<br/></p>
    <p>Brace the helm, the standard rear,<br/>
    Grasp the sabre, point the spear—<br/>
    United!—what have ye to fear?<br/>
    Warriors! be brave.<br/></p>
