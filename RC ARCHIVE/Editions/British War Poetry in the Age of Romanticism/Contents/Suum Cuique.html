    <p>1798.4<br/><b>Suum Cuique!</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Courier</i> (September 18, 1798)<br/></p>
    <p>On the late happy news from Hibernia sent over,<br/>
    How Lake has been able his luck to recover,<br/>
    And the French, without cannon, commanded by Humbert,<br/>
    Have surrendered their arms to <i>full six times</i> their number,<br/>
    It surely no wonder in Britain can raise,<br/>
    To observe what large numbers have merited praise,<br/>
    For 'tis just, who to <i>numbers</i> their victories owe,<br/>
    To <i>numbers</i> their thanks in return should bestow.<br/>
    Then let us all join in the warm commendation<br/>
    Exprest by our Chiefs with such discrimination;<br/>
    Thank the Officers' skill, and the Soldiers' great merit,<br/>
    For marching with zeal, and for walking with spirit.<br/>
    But oh! above all, thank the temperate Yeomen,<br/>
    That <i>they murder'd no children and ravish'd no women.</i></p>
