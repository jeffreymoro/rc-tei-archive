    <p>1813.13<br/><b>Bonaparte's Bridge,<br/>
    to The Tune of This is the House That Jack Built</b><br/>
    John Ashton<br/><i>English Caricature and Satire on Napoleon</i>, I, II (London 1884), pp. 162-163<br/></p>
    <p>This is the bridge that was blown into air,<br/>
    These are the Miners who had the care<br/>
    Of mining the Bridge that was blown into air.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>This is the Corporal stout and strong,<br/>
    Who fired the Mine with his match so long,<br/>
    Which was made by the Miners, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>This is the Colonel of Infantry,<br/>
    Who ordered the Corporal stout and strong<br/>
    To fire the Mine, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>This is the Marshall of high degree<br/>
    Who whispered the Colonel of Infantry<br/>
    To order the Corporal, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>This is the Emperor who scampered away,<br/>
    And left the Marshall of high degree<br/>
    To whisper the Colonel, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>These be the thousands who cursed the day,<br/>
    Which made him an emperor, who scampered away, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>These are the Monarchs so gen'rous and brave,<br/>
    Who conquer'd the Tyrant, and Liberty gave,<br/>
    To thousands &amp; thousands who cursed the day, &amp;c.</p>

                        <span class="footnote_text">1. The combined armies of Russia, Prussia, and Austria fought a decisive battle against Napoleon at Leipzig in October, 1813. As Napoleon was retreating it was said he gave a command to blow up a strategic bridge while the allied armies passed over it. The command, given to a colonel, was passed down the ranks until, finally, a corporal blew up the bridge too soon, destroying not the enemy, but wagonloads of French wounded.</span>
