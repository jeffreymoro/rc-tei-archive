<p>1796.11<br/><b>Political Integrity</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXVI (December 1796), p. 1038</p>
<p>Decipimur specie recti.<a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
<p>O Britain! first in Freedom's train,<br/>
        And fairest of her chosen few,<br/>
    How has Ambition burst the chain<br/>
        Of friendship you believ'd so true!<br/></p>
<p>Prussia, with false usurping pride,<br/>
        An Empire's rights would overturn;<br/>
    And, were his wishes gratify'd,<br/>
        Vienna would like Warsaw mourn.<br/></p>
<p>Batavia,<a href="#2">[2]</a> too, long fam'd for guile,<br/>
        And whom no bond of honour awes,<br/>
    First deep involv'd us in the broil,<br/>
        Then, coward like, forsook the cause.<br/></p>
<p>And now, priest-ridden, dastard Spain<br/>
        Flies from the solemn vows she made;<br/>
    And would, perfidious, from the Main<br/>
        Sweep all our naval power and trade.<br/></p>
<p>Such were our great and good Allies!<br/>
        Just Heav'n! their jealous arms defeat,<br/>
    The worst of evils ever rise<br/>
        From Friendship veil'd in base deceit.</p>
