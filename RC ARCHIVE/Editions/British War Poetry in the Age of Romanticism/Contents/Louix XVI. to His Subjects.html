    <p>1793.2<br/><b>Louis XVI. to His Subjects</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XIII (February 1793), pp. 153-154</p>
    <p>Alas! my people, what is then my fault,<br/>
        On truth and justice still my mind was bent:<br/>
    Your happiness was all the good I sought,<br/>
        But now you drag me forth to punishment.<br/><br/>
    Ah! sons of France, did not your native earth<br/>
        Behold your Louis first with life indu'd;<br/>
    One sky, with yours, has witnessed to my birth,<br/>
        Your prattling infants me an infant view'd.</p>
    <p>Alas, my people, am I doom'd to bear<br/>
        From you such sorrow, such afflicting pains?<br/>
    To give you freedom was your Monarch's care,<br/>
        And now my recompence is cruel chains.</p>
    <p>While yet a youth, in me the French confess'd<br/>
        Their rising hope, their tutelary guide:<br/>
    Ere yet my hand the regal sceptre press'd,<br/>
        To you my love a father's care supplied.</p>
    <p>When on this throne I took my envy'd place,<br/>
        A throne for Louis from his birth design'd;<br/>
    My first decree was deem'd an act of grace,<br/>
        A tribute to the wishes of mankind.</p>
    <p>Good Henry<a href="#1">[1]</a>, long so dear to every breast,<br/>
        Sometimes might Error's devious path pursue;<br/>
    But Louis still to Virtue friend profess'd,<br/>
        Nor loves illicit sought, nor favourites knew.</p>
    <p>Oh! name them—name the subjects whom to death<br/>
        My hand has sentenc'd in a cruel hour;<br/>
    One day beheld more Frenchmen yield their breath,<br/>
        Than all my twenty years of kingly power.</p>
    <p>But if my life to fix your peace avails,<br/>
        Receive the blood which freely I bestow;<br/>
    Your loving king, while he your fault bewails,<br/>
        Dies innocent, and pardons you the blow.</p>
    <p>Alas! my people, take this last adieu;<br/>
        Be happy, and with life I gladly part.<br/>
    O may the blood that shall your hands imbrue,<br/>
        Quench all the hatred in my people's heart!</p>
