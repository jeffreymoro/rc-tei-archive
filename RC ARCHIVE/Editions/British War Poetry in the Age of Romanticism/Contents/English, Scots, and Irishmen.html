    <p>1803.16<br/><b>English, Scots, and Irishmen<br/>
    A Patriotic Address to the Inhabitants of the<br/>
    United Kingdom, July, 1803</b>.<br/>
    John Mayne <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIII (September 1803), p. 858 <a href="#2">[2]</a><br/></p>
    <p><i>By</i> John Mayne,<br/><i>Author of</i> Glasgow, <i>a Poem</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>ENGLISH, SCOTS, and IRISHMEN,<br/>
    All that are in VALOUR'S ken!<br/>
    Shield your KING: and flock agen<br/>
        Where his sacred Banners fly!<br/>
    Now's the day, and now's the hour,<br/>
    Frenchmen would the Land devour—<br/>
    Will ye wait till they come o'er<br/>
        To give ye Chains and Slavery?<br/><br/>
    Who would be a Frenchman's slave?<br/>
    Who would truckle to the Knave?<br/>
    Who would shun a glorious grave<br/>
        For worse than death, for—infamy?<br/>
    To see your Liberties expire—<br/>
    Your Temples smoke, your Fleets on fire!<br/>
    That's a Frenchman's sole desire—<br/>
        That's your fate, or Liberty!<br/></p>
    <p>Robb'd of all that sweetens life,<br/>
    Tranquil home, and happy wife!<br/>
    Reeking from the villain's knife,<br/>
        Yonder harmless Peasant see—<br/>
    Prostrate near him on the heath<br/>
    A ruin'd Daughter gasps for breath!<br/>
    Frenchmen riot in their death—<br/>
        That's to them a luxury!<br/></p>
    <p>In fancy'd conquest over you,<br/>
    The Tyrant tells his tiger-crew—<br/>
    If chains will not your minds subdue,<br/>
        Nor exile, stripes, and poverty,<br/>
    Then, when the Land is all defil'd,<br/>
    He'll butcher woman, man and child—<br/>
    He'll turn your gardens to a wild—<br/>
        Your Courts to caves of misery!<br/></p>
    <p>Mothers, Sisters, Sweethearts dear,<br/>
    All that VIRTUE gives us here!<br/>
    Can your Sons or Lovers fear<br/>
        When Frenchmen threaten slavery?<br/>
    O! no!—In hosts of VOLUNTEERS,<br/>
    The GENIUS of the ISLE appears!<br/>
    With dauntless breast, BRITANNIA rears<br/>
        Her arm, and points to VICTORY!<br/></p>
    <p>IRISH, SCOTS and ENGLISHMEN<br/>
    All that WORTH and VALOUR ken!<br/>
    Shield your KING; and flock agen<br/>
        Where his sacred Banners fly!<br/>
    Now's the day, and now's the hour,<br/>
    Frenchmen would the Land devour—<br/>
    To arms! to arms! and make them cow'r,<br/>
        Or meet their certain destiny!</p>

He went to London in 1787 where he became proprietor and joint editor of <i>The</i><i>Star</i>. His long poem, <i>Siller Gun</i>, expanded over a period 1777-1836, was considered by Walter Scott to be superior to anything of Ferguson and close to Burns (<i>Lady of the Lake</i>, v. 20.).</span></p>
