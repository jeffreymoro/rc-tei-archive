<p>1797.12<br/><b>La Sainte Guillotine<br/></b> Anon<br/><i>The Anti-Jacobin</i> (December 4, 1797), pp. 136-138<br/></p>
<p>A New Song, Attempted from the French.</p>
<p>Tune, "O'er the vine-cover'd Hills and<br/>
    gay Regions of France."<br/></p>
<p>                                    I.<br/></p>
<p>From the blood bedew'd valleys and mountains of France,<br/>
    See the Genius of Gallic INVASION advance!<br/>
    Old Ocean, shall waft her, unruffled by storm,<br/>
    While our shores are all lin'd with the <i>Friends of Reform</i>.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
<p>Confiscation and Murder attend in her train,<br/>
    With meek-ey'd Sedition, the daughter of PAINE:<a href="#2">[2]<br/></a> While her sportive <i>Poissardes</i> with light footsteps are seen<br/>
    To dance in a ring round the gay <i>Guillotine</i>.<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/></p>
<p>                                   II.<br/></p>
<p>To London, "the rich, the defenceless,"<a href="#4">[4]</a> she comes—<br/>
    Hark! my boys, to the sound of the Jacobin drums!<br/>
    See Corruption, Prescription, and Privilege fly,<br/>
    Pierc'd thro' by the glance of her blood-darting eye.<br/></p>
<p>While Patriots, from Prison and Prejudice freed,<br/>
    In soft accents shall lisp the Republican Creed,<br/>
    And with Tri-colour'd Fillets, and Cravats of Green,<br/>
    Shall crowd round the Altar of <i>Saint Guillotine</i>.<br/></p>
<p>                                   III.<br/></p>
<p>See the Level of Freedom sweep over the land—<br/>
    The vile Aristocracy's doom is at hand!<br/>
    Not a seat shall be left in a House <i>that we know</i>,<br/>
    But for <i>Earl</i> BUONAPARTE AND <i>Baron</i> MOREAU.<br/></p>
<p>But the Rights of the Commons shall still be respected—<br/>
    BUONAPARTE himself shall approve the Elected;<br/>
    And the speaker shall march with majestical mien,<br/>
    And make his three bows to the grave <i>Guillotine</i>.<br/></p>
<p>                                   IV.<br/></p>
<p>Two Heads, says our Proverb, are better than One,<br/>
    But the Jacobin choice is for Five Heads, or none.<br/>
    By Directories only can Liberty thrive,<br/>
    Then down with the ONE, BOYS! and up with the FIVE!<br/></p>
<p>How our Bishops and Judges will stare with amazement,<br/>
    When their Heads are thrust out at the <i>National Casement</i>!<a href="#5">[5]</a><br/>
    When the <i>National Razor</i> has shav'd them quite clean,<br/>
    What a handsome oblation to <i>Saint Guillotine</i>!</p>
<br/>
