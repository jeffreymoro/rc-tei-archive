    <p>1794.23<br/><b>Half-Pay</b><br/>
    "A. Rambler"<br/>
    [Capt. Jos. Badworth]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXIV (December 1794), p. 1129</p>
    <p>        Written at Gibraltar, on a<br/>
            very stormy evening, with<br/>
            the melancholy prospect of<br/>
            going upon half-pay.</p>

    <p>What is't to toil amidst the din of war,<br/>
    To talk of honour, or a dreadful fear,<br/>
    To live on hope, the shadow'd best we have,<br/>
    With ling'ring wounds that torture to the grave!<br/>
    Yet even hope, delusive hope, is fled,<br/>
    Half-pay must cover a once-bleeding head!<br/>
    A fate too oft the worn-out soldier meets,<br/>
    Such too the friendless of our British fleets;<br/>
    Not like those idle baskers in the sun,<br/>
    Who reap the profits that the brave had won,<br/>
    Who never knew, nor ever wish'd to know,<br/>
    What 'tis to struggle 'gainst a hardy foe;<br/>
    But men, whose actions with the war forgot,<br/>
    Slip from the Minister's Protean thought.<br/>
    Alas! 'tis painful such a change to tell,<br/>
    To bid our friends in arms a longing, last, farewell!</p>

    <p>Soldiers, and <i>Brother Soldiers</i>, doubly dear,<br/>
    The time will come we meet no longer here;<br/>
    No more is heard the thund'ring cannon's roar;<br/>
    Calpe is silent; Echo says no more;<br/>
    No more terrific to Iberia now,<br/>
    Yet scournful frowns with dark unalter'd brow;<br/>
    Her harden'd front at rest from fruitless rage,<br/>
    Whilst Hist'ry plants her in the choicest page.<br/><i>But halt!</i>—Carnage is o'er, and we must go<br/>
    To other climes; ah! where we cannot know.<br/>
    Chance must direct, parent of hidden wiles,<br/>
    To guess—as useless as past Fortune's smiles;<br/>
    But, wheresoe'er it is, we part with pain,<br/>
    For separation breaks the soldier's chain.<br/>
    Alas! 'tis rueful such a change to tell,<br/>
    To bid our friends in arms a longing, last, farewell!</p>

    <p>Oft has been heard, when fight imbrues the plain<br/>
    (Where many a gallant Englishman is slain),<br/>
    The loudest plaudits through the country rise,<br/>
    And empty approbation is the prize;<br/>
    Such as a nation on her ROCK bestow'd,<br/>
    When no rich manna<a href="#2">[2]</a> from the fount o'er-flow'd;<br/>
    Promotion lost, and hard the soldier's fare,<br/>
    For thanks alone are nothing more than air.<br/>
    And now fair Peace her genial influence sends<br/>
    To stop the glut of war, when foes are friends,<br/>
    The time so wish'd-for by each hostile side,<br/>
    The downy time that life should be enjoy'd;<br/>
    Ah! then it is the soldier droops alone,<br/>
    Retires with penury, and lives unknown.<br/>
    Alas! 'tis painful such a change to tell,<br/>
    To bid our friends in arms a longing, last, farewell!<br/></p>

    <p>Should all the little stock be starv'd Half-pay,<br/>
    Hope gleans no comfort from the coming day;<br/>
    (Hope always was a shadow in my breast,<br/>
    Nor e'er dropp'd anchor near some place of rest;)<br/>
    Onward Time drags; relations now no more,<br/>
    Who would have added to the scanty store;<br/>
    Some (not a few) whom fortune so much chang'd,<br/>
    Their wealth as useless as their hearts estrang'd;<br/>
    Whilst the old soldier sickens at his fate,<br/>
    In the lone dulness of forlorn retreat.<br/>
    Yet, should he hear again of War's alarms,<br/>
    And Britain's voice call forth her sons "to arms!"<br/>
    His breast would glow with retrospective fire,<br/>
    For the true brave ne'er willingly retire.—<br/>
    Alas! 'tis painful such a change to tell,<br/>
    To bid our friends in arms a longing, last, farewell!</p>

    <p>Ah! should old Time the embers quench, and say,<br/>
    "Thou canst no more, thine ev'ry hair is gray;<br/>
    "Thy veins start high above the palsied hand,<br/>
    "That once with vig'rous nerve obey'd command;<br/>
    "Thy head hangs drooping o'er thy furrow'd breast,<br/>
    "Where once the tender passion was—a guest;<br/>
    "Trem'lous thy speech; scarce canst thou find  <br/>
                                        thy way;<br/>
    "And faithful tell'st thy story thrice a day;<br/>
    "Thy legs, the <i>crutches</i> to thy tott'ring frame,<br/>
    "The body's feeble partnership proclaim;<br/>
    "Therefore, my vet'ran, thou must now no more;<br/>
    "Thy zeal is only left, thy pow'rs are o'er;<br/>
    "Let the bold youth, whose bosoms pant for fame,<br/>
    "Come forth exulting in the British name;<br/>
    "Such should advance, with prudence for a guide,<br/>
    "Proud of their country, such their country's pride;<br/>
    "Give them the wishes of thy worn-out breast,<br/>
    "But let thy head in calm oblivion rest.<br/>
    "Go! to thyself re-think thy actions past,<br/>
    "Weigh ev'ry hour, prepare to meet the last;<br/>
    "By such great means make happiness thy own:<br/>
    "In youth thou serv'd'st thy King; in age serve<br/>
    God alone!"</p>
