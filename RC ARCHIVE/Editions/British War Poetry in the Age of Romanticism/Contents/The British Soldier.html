    <p>1813.4<br/><b>The British Soldier</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    “S. W. X. Z.”<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, LXIII (April, 1813), p. 319<br/></p>
    <p>"Chide not my chief, the gallant soldier cries,<br/>
    "Knit not your brows, oh cast that frown away;<br/>
    "Your wishes to my feelings sacrifice,<br/>
    "Nor harshly judge me if I disobey.<br/>
    "Oh, I have seen the day when thousands fell,<br/>
    "Have join'd in th' inspiring battle cry;<br/>
    "These scars, more eloquent than words, can tell<br/>
    "I did my part towards the victory.<br/>
    "Then pardon, chieftain, if this once I dare,<br/>
    "Refuse performing the too harsh decree;<br/>
    "Oh pardon then, and in my feelings share,<br/>
    "Unsoldier like I am, unchristian cannot be."<br/>
    He ceas'd, his leader felt as soldiers ought,<br/>
    Felt all his words, and all his feelings priz'd;<br/>
    He knew him brave, he knew how he had fought,<br/>
    And with his generous feelings sympathized.<br/>
    He saw beneath a rough war-beaten form,<br/>
    Nature's affections, and best virtue lie;<br/>
    Honour and pity, valour, truth, inborn,<br/>
    The soldier's courage, christian's charity.<br/>
    He saw, and anger from his bosom flew,<br/>
    He could not punish, where reward was due.<br/></p>
