    <p>1795.15<br/><b>Kate of Dover</b><br/>
    “Mr. Hook”<br/><i>The Morning Post</i> (October 1, 1795)<br/></p>
    <p>Sung By Mr. Dignum.<br/></p>
    <p>Composed by Mr. Hook.</p>
    <p>Ned Flint was lov'd by all the ship,<br/>
        Was tender-hearted, bold, and true,<br/>
    He'd work his way, or drink his flip,<br/>
        With e'er a seaman in the crew.<br/>
    Tho' Ned had fac'd his country's foe,<br/>
        And twice had sail'd the world all over,<br/>
    And seen his messmates oft laid low,<br/>
        Yet wou'd he sigh, he wou'd sigh, for<br/>
                   Kate of Dover.</p>
    <p>Fair was the morn when on the shore,<br/>
        Ned flew to take of Kate his leave.<br/>
    Says he my love, your grief give o'er,<br/>
        For Ned can ne'er his Kate deceive.<br/>
    Let Fortune smile, or let her frown,<br/>
        To you I ne'er will prove a rover;<br/>
    All cares in gen'rous flip I'll drown,<br/>
        And still be true to Kate of Dover.</p>
    <p>The tow'ring cliffs they bade adieu<br/>
        To brave all dangers on the main,<br/>
    When lo! a sail appear'd in view,<br/>
        And Ned with many a Tar was slain.<br/>
    Thus Death, who lays each Hero low,<br/>
        Robb'd Kitty of her faithful Lover;<br/>
    The Tars oft' tell the tale of woe,<br/>
        And heave a sigh for Kate of Dover.</p>
