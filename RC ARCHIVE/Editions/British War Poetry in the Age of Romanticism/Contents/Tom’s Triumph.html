    <p>1805.14<br/><b>Tom's Triumph</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XLVIII (December 1805), p. 465<br/></p>
    <p>The fight was o'er, the prize in tow,<br/>
    When Ben in friendship went below,<br/>
    To learn if Tom, his sister's swain,<br/>
    Was 'mongst the wounded or the slain.<br/>
    Between each deck his friend he sought,<br/>
    With hopes and fears his bosom fraught;<br/>
    He call'd his name, but call'd in vain;<br/>
    No answer came from Tom again.<br/></p>
    <p>                        II.<br/></p>
    <p>His steps now to the cockpit lead,<br/>
    Where some were wounded, some lay dead;<br/>
    Among the former—piercing sight!—<br/>
    Was Tom, poor lad! in piteous plight—<br/>
    Both legs were gone, e'en to the thighs!<br/>
    At Ben's known voice he op'd his eyes,<br/>
    A hand held out his friend to greet,<br/>
    Convinc'd that life would soon retreat.<br/></p>
    <p>                       III.<br/></p>
    <p>With looks benign Ben's hand he press'd,<br/>
    And thus his kneeling friend address'd:<br/>
    "My time is come—my end is near"—<br/>
    Ben wip'd away a manly tear—<br/>
    "To thee, my honour'd, worthy friend,<br/>
    A tender pledge I now commend:<br/>
    Your sister Sall, betroth'd my wife,<br/>
    Support, protect, defend through life.<br/></p>
    <p>                      IV.<br/></p>
    <p>"Tell her we conquer'd!—beat the foe!—<br/>
    My line is run—I go, I go."<br/>
    He could no more—his manly breast<br/>
    Exulted—heav'd—and sunk to rest.—<br/>
    And now in shrouded hammock laid,<br/>
    Each tar a tear in tribute paid;<br/>
    His body to the Deep consign'd,<br/>
    As men they griev'd—as men resign'd.<br/></p>
    <br/>
