    <p>1804.19<br/><b>Richard Llwyd, the Bard of Snowden,<br/>
    To His Countrymen</b><br/>
    “Rd. Llywd”<br/><i>The Anti-Gallican</i> (1804), pp. 139-141<br/></p>
    <p>Ye, <a href="#1">(1)</a> whom Britain's earliest day<br/>
    Saw among her meadows play;<br/>
    Unconscious yet that Ocean's waves<br/>
    Form'd the isle it loves and laves!<br/></p>
    <p>Lords of realms, as yet unknown,<br/>
    A blest creation all your own;<br/>
    A region yet by blood unstain'd<br/>
    Where Peace unbroke, unruffl'd reign'd.<br/></p>
    <p>Ere yet, the icy rocky North <a href="#2">(2)</a><br/>
    Had pour'd her hungry myriads forth,<br/>
    The hordes that ravag'd guiltless lands,<br/>
    And forc'd to arms your past'ral bands.<br/></p>
    <p>Decreed to share a restless doom,<br/>
    A world, in vain, resisted Rome:<br/>
    Yet Claudius <a href="#3">(3)</a> heard, on Empire's throne,<br/>
    A voice <i>then</i> greater than his own.<br/></p>
    <p>Led by rapine, fraud and spoil,<br/>
    Saxons, Normans, trod your soil;<br/>
    And Bards in strains of sorrow tell,<br/>
    That Britain's offspring, fought, and fell.<br/></p>
    <p>Lost your own paternal plains,<br/>
    Florid fields, and wide domains;<br/>
    Fair Cambria saw with beckoning eyes,<br/>
    And bade ERYRI'S <a href="#4">(4)</a> ramparts rise.<br/></p>
    <p>Here amid her cliffs of snow,<br/>
    Ages saw you brave the foe;<br/>
    Till Concord came, with efforts blest,<br/>
    And sooth'd Contention's roar to rest!<br/></p>
    <p>United now to Britain's throne,<br/>
    Your Sires <a href="#5">(5)</a> return, resume their own;<br/>
    Chiefs of your country's antient days,<br/>
    Britannia's wider sceptre sways!<br/></p>
    <p>O'er Britain's fair extended face,<br/>
    One brave, one rich, and potent race;—<br/>
    High in honour—high in fame—<br/>
    The first of nations—BOASTS YOUR NAME!<br/><br/>
    Britons hear, that <i>name's</i> a host,<br/>
    And forms a bulwark round your coast:<br/>
    And Fame shall tell, in records fair,<br/>
    You're worthy of the <i>name</i> you bear!<br/></p>
    <p>The foe that racks a suffering world,<br/>
    At you the bolt of war has hurl'd;<br/>
    And dares in language loud and high<br/>
    Your warriors to the field defy:<br/></p>
    <p>Dares, and hopes, by threats and wiles,<br/>
    To ravage, rule—The Queen of Isles:<br/>
    Her sons shall check his thirst of blood,<br/>
    By all that's great, and all that's good!<br/></p>
    <p>By genuine Freedom's holy flame,<br/>
    By your own Arthur, Alfred's name;<br/>
    By Deva's <a href="#6">(6)</a> waves, when Ida fled,<br/>
    By Mona's sons, and Merfyn <a href="#7">(7)</a> led.<br/></p>
    <p>By Rodri's <a href="#8">(8)</a> bright and vengeful sword,<br/>
    That gleam'd in Conway's lucid ford;<br/>
    By Euloe's <a href="#9">(9)</a> forests, Berwyn's heath,<br/>
    Where Owen gain'd th' unfading wreath.<br/></p>
    <p>By Jorwerth <a href="#10">(10)</a>—Cynan—Howel's name,<br/>
    By all that fills the rolls of fame,<br/>
    Unfold your banners, rend the air,<br/>
    And proudly show the shields <a href="#11">(11)</a> you bear!<br/></p>
    <p>Sons <a href="#12">(12)</a> of Snowden, yours the need,<br/>
    Nobly live, or nobly bleed;<br/>
    Your Country, Parents, Children, save,<br/>
    Or <i>fill one great and glorious grave</i>!</p>

Of those of Gwyerd ap Rhys Goch, Ednyfed Vychan, Carwed of Twrcelyn, Meurig, from Hedd Moelwynog, Howel y Fwyall Dafydd Gam (see History, battle of Cressy and Poictiers) and that of the Lloyds of Bod Idris in lal, are particularly instructing and entertaining."</span>
