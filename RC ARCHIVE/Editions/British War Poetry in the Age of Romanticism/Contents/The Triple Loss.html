    <p>1806.2<br/><b>The Triple Loss</b><br/>
    “Hafiz”<br/>
    [Thomas Stott]<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXVI (February 1806), p. 160<br/></p>
    <p>In the short space of half a circling year,<br/>
    Britain has felt <i>three losses</i> most severe,<br/>
    NELSON, her hero on the boundless main,<br/>
    The constant scourge and dread of France and Spain;<br/>
    CORNWALLIS,<a href="#1">[1]</a> India's fav'rite—<i>Ireland's</i> friend,<br/>
    Wise to conciliate, valiant to defend;<br/>
    And PITT,<a href="#2">[2]</a> the dauntless pilot of the State,<br/>
    By birth, in talents, eminently great:<br/>
    These have, alas! now pass'd that awful bourn<br/>
    Whence Fate's decree for ever bars return!<br/>
    But let not Britain, though thus doom'd to bear<br/>
    Such ponderous misfortunes, yet despair.<br/>
    Warriors and statesmen still for her shall rise,<br/>
    Like those whose noble souls have sought the skies;<br/>
    With generous strife each loyal breast shall glow<br/>
    To recompense her losses—soothe her woe.<br/>
    Around the Constitution all shall cling,<br/>
    Warm in attachment to their virtuous King;<br/>
    Firm in their resolution to oppose,<br/>
    With heart and hands united, Britain's foes.<br/></p>
