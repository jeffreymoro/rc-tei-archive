    <p>1800.1<br/><b>The Battle of Blenheim</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Robert Southey<br/><i>The Annual Anthology</i>, II (1800), 34-37<br/></p>
    <p>                    I.<br/></p>
    <p>It was a summer evening,<br/>
        Old Kaspar's work was done;<br/>
    And he before his cottage door<br/>
        Was sitting in the sun,<br/>
    And by him sported on the green<br/>
    His little grandchild Wilhelmine.<br/></p>
    <p>                    II.<br/></p>
    <p>She saw her brother Peterkin<br/>
        Roll something large and round,<br/>
    That he beside the rivulet<br/>
        In playing there had found;<br/>
    He came to ask what he had found,<br/>
    That was so large, and smooth, and round.<br/></p>
    <p>                   III.<br/></p>
    <p>Old Kaspar took it from the boy<br/>
        Who stood expectant by;<br/>
    And then the old man shook his head,<br/>
        And with a natural sigh,<br/>
    'Tis some poor fellow's scull, said he,<br/>
    Who fell in the great victory.<br/><br/>
                        IV.<br/></p>
    <p>I find them in the garden, for<br/>
        There's many here about,<br/>
    And often when I go to plough,<br/>
        The ploughshare turns them out;<br/>
    For many thousand men, said he,<br/>
    Were slain in the great victory.</p>
    <p>                    V.<br/></p>
    <p>Now tell us what 'twas all about,<br/>
        Young Peterkin he cries,<br/>
    And little Wilhelmine looks up<br/>
        With wonder-waiting eyes;<br/>
    Now tell us all about the war,<br/>
    And what they kill'd each other for.<br/></p>
    <p>                    VI.<br/></p>
    <p>It was the English, Kaspar cried,<br/>
        That put the French to rout;<br/>
    But what they kill'd each other for,<br/>
        I could not well make out.<br/>
    But every body said, quoth he,<br/>
    That 'twas a famous victory.<br/></p>
    <p>                   VII.<br/></p>
    <p>My father lived at Blenheim then,<br/>
        Yon little stream hard by,<br/>
    They burnt his dwelling to the ground<br/>
        And he was forced to fly;<br/>
    So with his wife and child he fled,<br/>
    Nor had he where to rest his head.<br/></p>
    <p>                   VIII.<br/></p>
    <p>With fire and sword the country round<br/>
        Was wasted far and wide,<br/>
    And many a childing mother then,<br/>
        And new-born infant died.<br/>
    But things like that, you know, must be<br/>
    At every famous victory.<br/></p>
    <p>                    IX.<br/></p>
    <p>They say it was a shocking sight<br/>
        After the field was won,<br/>
    For many thousand bodies here<br/>
        Lay rotting in the sun;<br/>
    But things like that you know must be<br/>
    After a famous victory.<br/></p>
    <p>                    X.<br/></p>
    <p>Great praise the Duke of Marlbro' won,<br/>
        And our good Prince Eugene.—<br/>
    Why 'twas a very wicked thing!<br/>
        Said little Wilhelmine.<br/>
    Nay—nay—my little girl, quoth he,<br/>
    It was a famous victory.<br/></p>
    <p>                    XI.<br/></p>
    <p>And every body praised the Duke<br/>
        Who such a fight did win.<br/>
    But what good came of it at last?—<br/>
        Quoth little Peterkin.<br/>
    Why that I cannot tell, said he,<br/>
    But 'twas a famous victory. <a href="#2">[2]</a></p>
