    <p>1802.1<br/><b>The Camp</b><br/>
    “Oberon" <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    [Mary Robinson]<br/><i>The Spirit of the Public Journals</i>, V (1802), p. 234<br/></p>
    <p>(From the Morning Post)<br/></p>
    <p>Tents, <i>marquees</i>, and baggage waggons;<br/>
    Suttling-houses, beer in flagons;<br/>
    Drums and trumpets, singing, firing;<br/>
    Girls seducing, beaux admiring;<br/>
    Country lasses gay and smiling,<br/>
    City lads their hearts beguiling;<br/>
    Dusty roads, and horses frisky,<br/>
    Many an <i>Eton Boy</i> in whisky;<br/>
    Tax'd carts full of farmers' daughters;<br/>
    Brutes condemn'd, and man who slaughters!<br/>
    Public-houses, booths, and castles,<br/><i>Belles</i> of fashion, serving vassals;<br/>
    Lordly gen'rals fiercely staring,<br/>
    Weary soldiers, sighing, swearing!<br/><i>Petit-maitres</i> always dressing,<br/>
    In the glass themselves caressing;<br/>
    Perfum'd, painted, patch'd, and blooming<br/>
    Ladies—manly airs assuming!<br/>
    Dowagers of fifty, simp'ring,<br/>
    Misses for their lovers whimp'ring;<br/>
    Husbands drill'd to household tameness;<br/>
    Dames heart sick of wedded sameness.<br/>
    Princes setting girls a-madding,<br/>
    Wives for ever fond of gadding;<br/>
    Princesses with lovely faces,<br/>
    Beauteous children of the Graces!<br/>
    Britain's pride and virtue's treasure,<br/>
    Fair and gracious beyond measure!<br/><i>Aid-de-camps</i> and youthful pages,<br/>
    Prudes and vestals of all ages!<br/>
    Old coquets and matrons surly,<br/>
    Sounds of distant hurly-burly!<br/>
    Mingled voices, uncouth singing,<br/>
    Carts full laden, forage bringing;<br/>
    Sociables and horses weary,<br/>
    Houses warm, and dresses airy;<br/>
    Loads of fatten'd poultry; pleasure<br/>
    Serv'd (to nobles) without measure;<br/>
    Doxies, who the waggons follow;<br/>
    Beer, for thirsty hinds to swallow;<br/>
    Washerwomen, fruit-girls cheerful,<br/>
    Ancient ladies—<i>chaste</i> and <i>fearful</i>!!<br/>
    Tradesmen, leaving shops, and seeming<br/>
    More of <i>war</i> than profit dreaming;<br/>
    Martial sounds and braying asses,<br/>
    Noise, that ev'ry noise surpasses!<br/>
    All confusion, din, and riot,<br/>
    Nothing clean—and nothing quiet.</p>

                        <span class="footnote_text">1. Mary Robinson (1758-1800) used this signature for her poems published in the <em>Oracle</em> and the <em>Morning Post</em>. On Aug. 31, 1800 she wrote to S. J. Pratt, "I continue my daily labours in the Post; all the Oberons, Tabithas, MR's and indeed most of the Poetry, you see there is mine." See <em>Shelley and his Circle 1773-1822</em>, ed. Kenneth Neill Cameron, I (Cambridge, Mass. 1961), 232. Andrew Ashfield (in <i>Romantic Women Poets</i>) identifies an earlier printing of this poem in the <i>Morning Post</i>, 1 August 1800.</span>
