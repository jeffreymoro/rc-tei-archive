    <p>1795.4<br/><b>Lines<br/>
    Written on the Capture of<br/>
    Gen. Kosciusko</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    [Thomas Starling Norgate]<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/><i>The Cabinet</i>, I (1795), pp. 231-232</p>
    <p>What spectred form is that, with tearful eye,<br/>
    With heaving bosom, and with deep-drawn sigh,<br/>
    Sorrowing in silence o'er the darken'd cell<br/>
    Where, Kosciusko!<a href="#3">[3]</a> thou art doom'd to dwell?<br/>
    'Tis thee, lorn Liberty! whom once I knew<br/>
    Cloth'd with the rosy morning's healthful hue,<br/>
    Sweep the wide woodlands, and with carols gay<br/>
    Swell the soft gales that usher in the day;<br/>
    'Tis thee, lorn Liberty! with anguish wild<br/>
    Now weeping o'er thy fond, thy fav'rite child!</p>
    <p>No common sorrows hover round his head,<br/>
    All nature sickens, all her joys are fled:<br/>
    The moon extends a cold and dewy gleam,<br/>
    And the sun saddens with a languid beam;<br/>
    Pale livid lightnings thro' the welkin fly,<br/>
    And pealing thunders shake the shudd'ring sky:<br/>
    O'er the wide concave no kind star is found,<br/>
    Night spreads her darkest, deepest shades around;<br/>
    The war-worn vet'ran pours his pensive moan,<br/>
    And in his leader's fate, laments his own!</p>
    <p>Poor Kosciusko! long shall live thy fame,<br/>
    And future infants learn to lisp thy name;<br/>
    Ages unborn shall weep the hostile deed,<br/>
    And curse the ruffian hand that made thee bleed!<a href="#4">[4]</a><br/>
    Shall mourn that morning, when the vital tide<br/>
    Purpled thy limbs, and bubbled from thy side,<br/>
    When first on thee was pour'd the dungeon's gloom,<br/>
    Mocking the midnight darkness of the tomb;<br/>
    On thee—at once magnanimous and mild,<br/>
    In war a hero, and in peace a child.</p>
    <p>O may that band, who once by thee inspir'd,<br/>
    By virtue sanction'd, and by freedom fir'd,<br/>
    Who oft with thee, on Vist'la's winding banks,<br/>
    Vanquish'd the warriors of proud Prussia's ranks,<br/>
    Strike with a patriot arm, their wond'ring foes,<br/>
    Weep o'er their country, but avenge her woes;<br/>
    May triumph wave each banner in the field,<br/>
    And frightful horror frown from ev'ry shield;<br/>
    And like a storm that swells the troubled gale,<br/>
    Rolls down the hill, and sweeps along the vale,<br/>
    Cleaving in twain the forest's trembling king,<br/>
    While the day darkens, and the mountains ring,<br/>
    While the hoarse thunders with re-echoes roar,<br/>
    Crack the white cliffs, and roll around the shore;<br/>
    So may thy band, with firm collected force,<br/>
    Scour the wide plains, and conquer in their course;<br/>
    And, Kosciusko! ere thy soul have fled<br/>
    To the dark, dreary mansions of the dead,<br/>
    By thee led on, by thee their vengeance hurl'd,<br/>
    Give tyrants death, and freedom to the world!</p>
