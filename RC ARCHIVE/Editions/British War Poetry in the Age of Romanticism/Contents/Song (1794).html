    <p>1794.12<br/><b>Song</b><br/>
    "G. C."<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXVI (July 1794), p. 62</p>
    <p>Tune, "To Anacreon in Heaven."</p>
    <p>When Gallia's base sons, by some daemon inspir'd,<br/>
        Had burst all the ties which society bind,<br/>
    With presumption unequall'd they madly aspir'd<br/>
        To plunge in confusion the rest of mankind,<br/>
                    Our dear native plains,<br/>
                    Where true liberty reigns,<br/>
    They reconed an object was well worth their pains;<br/>
    So resolv'd with their fleets they'd invade us;<br/>
                            but now,<br/>
    Experience has shewn them they did not know HOW.<a href="#1">[1]<br/></a><br/>
    To beat us at sea was quite easy they thought,<br/>
        Who our loyalty hated, our freedom despis'd,<br/>
    Forgetting the lessons experience had taught,<br/>
        When Hawke<a href="#2">[2]</a> and Boscawen<a href="#3">[3]</a> their navies chastis'd.<br/>
                    Those insolent knaves<br/>
                    Swore they'd rule o'er the waves,<br/>
    And that Britons from henceforth should be but their<br/>
                            slaves,<br/>
    Till old Neptune, enraged, overheard them, and now<br/>
    Was resolv'd to convince them they did not know HOW.<br/></p>
    <p>Says Neptune, "Were I to encourage those bands,<br/>
        My Tritons and Sea-Gods would grow democratic,<br/>
    This trident, perhaps, be snatch'd out of my hands,<br/>
        And the reign of Old Neptune become problematic.<br/>
                    Such ills to avoid,<br/>
                    Be a hero employ'd<br/>
    By whom those proud boasters shall soon be destroy'd;<br/>
    Nor long need I think on't, I'll fix on him now,<br/>
    For his former achievements have made me know HOW.<br/></p>
    <p>A fleet such as England ne'er equall'd before,<br/>
        For skill, strength, and courage that nought could<br/>
                           restrain,<br/>
    Impatient for conquest depart from the shore,<br/>
    And the union flag wav'd, proudly wav'd at the main.<br/>
                    Old Neptune with glee<br/>
                    Saw his heroes at sea,<br/>
    And cried out with rapture, "Come, come, follow me;—<br/>
    I have oftentimes led you to glory ere now,<br/>
    And determin'd to shew you that still I know HOW."<br/></p>
    <p>They meet,—and the battle by England is won;—<br/>
        But story no conflict so dreadful can shew;—<br/>
    Two are sunk—six are taken; the rest of them run;<br/>
        Nor ever again will the contest renew.<br/>
                    The vict'ry complete,<br/>
                    What a glorious defeat;<br/>
    None ever to Britons was yet half so sweet—<br/>
    For whatever was dearest we fought for it now,<br/>
    And Gallia from henceforth will ne'er forget HOW.</p>
