    <p>1803.19<br/><b>The Ploughman's Ditty</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIII (Supp. 1803), pp. 1238-1239<br/><i>The Patriot's Vocal Miscellany</i>, (Dublin, 1804)<br/><i>The Anti-Gallican</i> (1804), p. 496<br/><i>The Shrewsbury Chronicle</i> (November 27, 1807)<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>The Ploughman's Ditty,</p>
    <p>Being an Answer to that foolish Question,<br/></p>
    <p>What Have the Poor to Lose?<br/></p>
    <p>    Because I'm but poor,<br/>
        And slender my store,<br/>
    That I've nothing to lose is the cry;<br/>
        Let who will declare it,<br/>
        I vow I can't bear it,<br/>
    I give all such praters the lie.<br/></p>
    <p>    Tho' my house is but small,<br/>
        Yet to have none at all,<br/>
    Would sure be a greater distress, Sir;<br/>
        Shall my garden so sweet,<br/>
        And my orchard so neat,<br/>
    Be the pride of a foreign oppressor?<br/><br/>
        On Saturday night,<br/>
        'Tis still my delight,<br/>
    With my wages to run home the faster;<br/>
        But, if Frenchmen rule here,<br/>
        I may look far and near,<br/>
    But I never shall find a <i>pay-master</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>    I've a dear little wife,<br/>
        Whom I love as my life;<br/>
    To lose her I should not much like;<br/>
        And 'twould make me run wild,<br/>
        To see my sweet child,<br/>
    With its head on the point of a pike.<br/></p>
    <p>    I've my Church too to save,<br/>
        And will go to my grave<br/>
    In defence of a Church that's the best;<br/>
        I've my King too, God bless him!<br/>
        Let no man oppress him,<br/>
    For none has he ever opprest.<br/></p>
    <p>    British Laws for my guard,<br/>
        My cottage is barr'd;<br/>
    'Tis safe in the light or the dark.<br/>
        If the Squire should oppress,<br/>
        I get instant redress,<br/>
    My orchard's as safe as his park.<br/></p>
    <p>    My cot is my throne,<br/>
        What I have is my own,<br/>
    And what is my own I will keep.<br/>
        Shou'd <i>Boni</i> come now,<br/>
        'Tis true I may plough,<br/>
    But I'm sure that I never shall reap.<br/></p>
    <p>    Now do but reflect,<br/>
        What I have to protect;<br/>
    Then doubt if to fight I shall choose—<br/>
        King, Church, Babes and Wife,<br/>
        Laws, Liberty, Life,—<br/>
    Now tell me I've nothing to lose.<br/></p>
    <p>    Then I'll beat my ploughshare<br/>
        To a sword or a spear,<br/>
    And rush on those desperate men:<br/>
        Like a lion I'll fight;<br/>
        That my spear, now so bright,<br/>
    May soon turn to a ploughshare again!</p>
