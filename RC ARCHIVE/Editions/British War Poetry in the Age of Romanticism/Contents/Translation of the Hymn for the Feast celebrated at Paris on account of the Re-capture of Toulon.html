    <p>1794.1<br/><b>Translation of the Hymn for the Feast celebrated at Paris on account of the Re-capture of Toulon.</b><br/>
    "G. K. W."<br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (January 18, 1794)</p>
    <p>Toulon<a href="#1">[1]</a>, restor'd to France again,<br/>
    No more regards the captive main,<br/>
        Whose waters lave her sands;<br/>
    Her rock, now freed, from barbarous foes,<br/>
    She deals around her vengeful blows,<br/>
        On Albion's flying bands.</p>
    <p>Her flames she darts upon their heads,<br/>
    To recompense their ruthless deeds,<br/>
        And answers fire for fire;<br/>
    Their tyrant squadrons fall beneath<br/>
    The fury of the tempest's breath,<br/>
        Drest in terrific ire.</p>
    <p>Victorious in each bloody field,<br/>
    Frenchmen shall make their rival yield<br/>
        The palm she bore so long;<br/>
    See Britons march with guilty dread!<br/>
    While Gallia's sons by Virtue led,<br/>
        Repeat th' inspiring song.<br/><br/>
    Th' eternal Power that sits on high,<br/>
    Guards from his radiant throne the sky,<br/>
        A sov'reign people's right:<br/>
    And furious elements combine,<br/>
    To baffle tyranny's design,<br/>
        Their all-resistless might.</p>
    <p>Slaves crouch around their monarch's thrones,<br/><i>Toulon</i> drives forth her guilty sons,<br/>
        A mean, degenerate band:<br/>
    That men, more true to Freedom's cause,<br/>
    May hail the reign of equal laws,<br/>
        Upon her famous strand.</p>
    <p>Leaving the Court, that base defence<br/>
    Of grandeur's votaries, void of sense,<br/>
        They'll cleave the liquid plain.<br/>
    Prompt in the search of happiness,<br/>
    Who stands fair Freedom's sons to bless<br/>
        On sacred <i>La Montagne</i>.</p>
    <p>Britons! whose ships, a servile train,<br/>
    Ting'd with our blood on Genoa's main,<br/>
        Beneath her ramparts high,<br/>
    Dar'd to pollute a Gallic shore,<br/>
    As treacherous to our ports they bore<br/>
        The chains of slavery.</p>
    <p>Our fleet shall bear to Plymouth's Sound,<br/>
    Equality by freedom crown'd<br/>
        To People far and wide:<br/>
    The sombrous Thames, in slavery's night,<br/>
    Shall feel the rays of freedom's light,<br/>
        And swift his waters glide.</p>
    <p>K___,<a href="#2">[2]</a> minister, and soldiers bold,<br/>
    Brave conquerors by dint of gold,<br/>
        Who boast of punic faith<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/>
    No more again assume to reign<br/>
    With trident—tyrants of the main,<br/>
        And rule the ocean's path.</p>
    <p>For see! the universe awake,<br/>
    Bids us the hostile faulchion take,<br/>
        Her rights again to claim:<br/>
    We, a new Roman nation, burn<br/>
    Another Carthage to o'erturn<br/>
        And tyrant princes tame.</p>
    <p>Ocean's lov'd daughter! fair <i>Toulon</i>.<br/>
    Arise and take the laurel crown,<br/>
        Around thy temples bind<br/>
    Olive leaves, and fadeless flowers,<br/>
    For ev'ry gift that nature pours,<br/>
        To deck thee is design'd.</p>
    <p>On thy generous bosom bring<br/>
    All the balmy sweets of spring,<br/>
        All bounteous Autumn's stores:<br/>
    Byzantine treasures, Adria's trade,<br/>
    From thee in plenteous streams convey'd,<br/>
        Shall crowd our happy shores.</p>
    <p>Triumphant French! by freedom blest,<br/>
    By fav'ring fortune still carest,<br/>
        The world shall share your fate:<br/>
    The new-born sun shall shine sublime,<br/>
    Rejoice and animate each clime,<br/>
        And nourish every state.</p>
    <p>His presence with each good, shall bless<br/>
    The poor, and soothe their deep distress,<br/>
        Who seek his fav'ring light:<br/>
    While tyrants burn beneath his rays,<br/>
    The world shall brighten at the blaze,<br/>
        And millions hail the fight.</p>
