    <p>1813.11<br/><b>The Crimp Serjeant</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (August 28, 1813)<br/></p>
    <p>The bed of honour is a pretty spot,<br/>
    For heroes to lie down and rot,<br/>
        And war's a very noble game,<br/>
    At which Kings play at arms and legs<br/>
    Of soldiers, who thenceforward walk on pegs,<br/>
        And Mister CROKER<a href="#1">[1]</a> doth such feats proclaim—<br/>
    So do Crimp Serjeants<a href="#2">[2]</a> —'tis their bounden duty<br/>
    To call grim-visaged carnage, Beauty;<br/>
    Murder and Rapine very pretty jobs,<br/>
    And knocking brains out of our neighbours' nobs<br/>
    A famous enterprize, sublime and glorious,<br/>
    And all is fair, if we but prove <i>victorious</i>.<br/>
    Serjeant MALONE, an Irishman, had drank<br/>
    More whiskey than would fill a tank,<br/>
    His soul to a consumption had been worn<br/>
    With all the oaths that he had sworn;<br/>
    He had a wife in every town,<br/>
    And bastards in profusion up and down;<br/>
    He bilk'd more landladies than he had breath to count,<br/>
    And poultry stole to an immense amount:—<br/>
    Thus qualified, he up to Dublin hied,<br/>
    And 'mongst the lanes and allies prowl'd and pried,<br/>
        Of raw apprentices to make a prey,<br/>
    Or country bumpkin at shop window stuck,<br/>
    Or displaced footman, or bum-hunted buck,<br/>
        And so cajole them in the usual way.<br/>
    On Poor PAT CLOD at last his claw he laid—<br/>
    PAT, of the Serjeant, was at first afraid;<br/>
    But PAT was full of mischief and of fun,<br/>
    And flattery finish'd what strong punch begun—<br/>
    "Why, PAT, you're taller than myself by half!—<br/>
    "And what a Roman's nose—and <i>what a calf</i>!—<br/>
    "May Belzebub blow out my brains—<br/>
    "You'll be a General in two campaigns!<br/>
    "Pray do you know that German riding by—<br/>
    "He in the regimentals?"—"No, not I."—<br/>
        "There's, b---t my eyes! a pretty job of work:<br/>
    "I listed him, not quite three years last May,<br/>
        "And now he's General the Duke of YORK!!—<br/>
    "And will not condescend to nod good day;—<br/>
    "I don't deceive you, PADDY—look and see,<br/>
    "He does not even seem to notice me.<br/>
    "And that's the way, you handsome dog, you'll treat me,<br/>
    "When you're a General, and chance to meet me!<br/>
        "And yet you're of a generous disposition—<br/>
    "Come, promise me, and that is all I ask,<br/>
    "(And on the Staff 'twill be an easy task)<br/>
    "You'll give my son CORNELIUS a commission."<br/></p>
    <p>PAT took the shilling, and e'er three months older,<br/>
    He died in Portugal—a common soldier.</p>
