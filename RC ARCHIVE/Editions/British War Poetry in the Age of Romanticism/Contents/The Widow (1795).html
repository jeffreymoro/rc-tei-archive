    <p>1795.13<br/><b>The Widow</b><br/>
    "Sandy"<br/><i>The Morning Post</i> (June 22, 1795)</p>
    <p>    The Moon was sinking in the West,<br/>
            And briskly blew the ev'ning gale.<br/>
        When WILLIAM, from his NANCY prest,<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
            Spread with a sigh the swelling sail;</p>
    <p>And soon was wafted from his native shore,<br/>
    To see his NANCY'S dear-lov'd form no more.</p>
    <p>    The tear oft sparkled in her eye,<br/>
            And oft bedew'd her pallid cheek;<br/>
        And speechless Grief, in many a sigh,<br/>
            Whisper'd her o'erfraught heart to break.<br/>
    In vain her constant bosom sought repose;<br/>
    The eye that view'd not WILLIAM could not close.</p>
    <p>    Fearless of ill, the gallant fleet<br/>
            O'er the loud-dashing billows go;<br/>
        Each Briton's breast tumultuous beat,<br/>
            To hurl destruction on their foe.<br/>
    Conquest no more could heal poor WILLIAM'S smart—<br/>
    He spill'd the ruddy drop that warm'd his heart.</p>
    <p>    Alternate Hope, alternate Fear,<br/>
            In NANCY'S constant bosom reign;<br/>
        In vain she dropp'd the pearly tear—<br/>
            Hope sooth'd her constant heart in vain:<br/>
    Her WILLIAM'S fate was told; she heard and sigh'd,<br/>
    Cast up to Heav'n her eyes—then bow'd and died.</p>
