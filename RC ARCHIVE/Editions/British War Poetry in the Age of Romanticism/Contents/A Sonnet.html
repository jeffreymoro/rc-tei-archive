    <p>1802.10<br/><b>A Sonnet</b><br/>
    William Cunningham<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXII (1802), p. 1141<br/></p>
    <p>Occasioned by seeing in the Newspapers, that in France the Gallies have only succeeded the Guillotine; that four or five hundred a week are condemned to them; and that an English Gentleman in Paris<a href="#1">[1]</a> counted eight Carts, containing from 20 to 30 Persons each, who were going to the Gallies. So far does the present Gallic Liberty exceed its old Monarchichal Disposition.<br/></p>
    <p>Is this the boasted Liberty of France!<br/>
        Or this the land where Freedom holds her reign!<br/>
    Was it for this she shook Rebellion's lance!<br/>
        Was it for this her thousand sons were slain!<br/></p>
    <p>Do gifts like these from Bonaparte flow,<br/>
        Whose name, whose actions soar to Fame's<br/>
                           high tower!<br/>
    Or does he plunge his wretched slaves in woe,<br/>
        And wade thro' slaughter to unbounded<br/>
                             power!<br/></p>
    <p>Britain, let Gallia's fall thy Sons inspire<br/>
        To prize that Liberty their fires bestow'd;<br/>
    Nations around thy happy state admire;<br/>
        Ne'er was it thine to brook Oppression's<br/>
                              load.<br/><br/>
    Hail, Britons, hail! at Freedom's call arise;<br/>
    Sacred preserve that Liberty ye prize.<br/></p>
