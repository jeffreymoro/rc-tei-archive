    <p>By Rev. R. Mant, A.M.<br/>
    Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford.</p>
    <p><i>Written in May, 1803, on the Publication of the<br/>
    Negotiation Papers</i><br/><br/>
    What! shall they seek the lion in his den,<br/>
    And fright him there? And make his tremble there?<br/>
    O, let it not be said!-------<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/>
    __________<br/></p>
    <p>    Britons, bow the haughty head!<a href="#4">[4]</a><br/>
            "Bend, Britons, bend the stubborn knee!<br/>
        "Own your ancient virtue fled,<br/>
            "And know not that ye once were free.<br/>
            "Think not as your fathers thought;<br/>
            "Speak no more, as Britons ought;<br/>
            "Act no more the Britons' part,<br/>
            "With valiant hand and honest heart;<br/>
            "What indignation bids you feel,<br/>
            "Dare not, dare not to reveal;<br/>
    "Though Justice sharpen, dare not grasp the lance,<br/>
    "Nor single-handed tempt the might of France!<br/></p>
    <p>    "Me, <i>Holland, Italy</i> obey:<br/>
            "Her breast with many a war wound gor'd,<br/>
        "And crush'd beneath my iron sway,<br/>
            "Me <i>Helvetia</i> owns her Lord.<br/>
            "Boast not then your fleets, that sweep<br/>
            "The eastern and the western deep!<br/>
            "Boast not then your sea-wash'd land,<br/>
            "Rampart-girt by Nature's hand!<br/>
            "Fleets and billows stay not me—<br/>
            "Then bow the head, and bend the knee.<br/>
    "Britons, no more your rival ranks advance,<br/>
    "Nor single-handed dare to cope with France!"<br/></p>
    <p>    Yes! as our Albion's root-bound oak<br/>
            Stoops to the tempest, we will bow!<br/>
        Yes! we will bend, as the tall rock<br/>
            Mocking the wave that chafes below!<br/>
            Now by the sable Prince inbrued<br/>
            Once and again in Gallic blood;<br/>
            By the laurels that intwine,<br/><i>        Harry</i>, thy helm; and <i>Marlborough</i>, thine;<br/>
            By our Chiefs on Nilus' tide,<br/>
            Him, who triumph'd; him, who died;<br/>
            By him, whom <i>Acon's</i> turrets raise<br/>
            To lion-hearted <i>Richard's</i> praise;<a href="#5">[5]</a><br/>
    Yes! we will still our rival ranks advance,<br/>
    And single-handed brave the might of France.<br/></p>
    <p>    Come then, come thou Consul-king!<br/>
            Launch thy navies, arm thine host,<br/>
        And beneath night's favouring wing<br/>
            Thy banners plant on England's coast!<a href="#6">[6]</a><br/>
            Come! but hope not to return—<br/>
            Here other thoughts thou soon shalt learn;<br/>
            Shalt feel that Britons still may claim<br/>
            The honours of the British name;<br/>
            Can fearless still maintain their stand<br/>
            On British, as on Syrian, land;<br/>
    Still rise superior to the sons of Chance,<br/>
    Still single-handed crush the pride of France.</p>
