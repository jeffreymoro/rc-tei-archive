        <p>Ye Friends give attention awhile to my lay,<br/>
            'Tis what you can't meet with (at least ev'ry day),<br/>
            'Tis all Supposition, of this and of that,<br/>
            For the Devil himself cannot tell what I am at.<br/>
            Some Wiseacres doubtless to puzzle their brains,<br/>
            May try to find out, Sir—"my Ways and my Means."<br/>
            Tho' my Budget is ope—till I give 'em the cue,<br/>
            They'll ne'er find me out—I'll be d--d if they do.</p>

        <p>Supposition's my motto—then let me <i>suppose</i><br/>
            A parcel of Asses, who're led by the nose;<br/>
            Suppose then again that their Masters are such,<br/>
            They'd load the poor Devils a little too much;<br/>
            Suppose from the top of the head to the toe.<br/>
            They're burthen'd so heavy they cannot well go.<br/>
            Yet forc'd to jog on, Sir, their <i>strength</i> to evince,<br/>
            Now supposing all this—don't you think they might<br/>
            wince?</p>
        <div class="indent20">

                        <p>III.</p>
                    </div>
        <p>Suppose then again, for the sake of the joke,<br/>
            (As Asses of old, we are told once have spoke:)<br/>
            These Asses complain'd of this heart-rending grief,<br/>
            And beg'd their Taskmasters' to give some relief.<br/>
            "Oh no!" says their Leaders, "find fault to our face?<br/>
            "But now, my dear Creatures, we'll alter the case.<br/>
            "Mum Chance you shall live—not a Word shall you<br/>
            "say,<br/>
            "For we'll MUZZLE you so, that you never shall bray."</p>
        <div class="indent20">

        <p>Some Asses I'm told—but <i>suppose</i> it a hum,<br/>
            Rejoic'd when they found that the "Order was Mum!"<br/>
            And said they would go if their Leaders thought fit,<br/>
            Blindfold dawn the gulph—of the bottomless Pitt.<br/>
            The muzzles were made, and it then came to pass,<br/>
            They stop'd up the mouth of John Bull's simple Ass,<br/>
            Who then sunk, alas! in a woeful condition;<br/>
            But remember, my friends—This is all <i>Supposition</i>!!<br/></p>
