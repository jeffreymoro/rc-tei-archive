    <p>1811.6<br/><b>Sonnet<br/>
    To France</b><br/>
    “R. A. D.”<br/>
    [Richard Arthur Davenport]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Poetry</i>, VI (1811), p. 170<br/></p>
    <p>Detested land! such deep and deadly hate<br/>
        As once to Rome the Punic hero swore<br/>
    I vow to thee! O! were but mine the fate<br/>
        Over thy pale and trembling plains to pour<br/>
    The tempest of the battle, and to crush<br/>
        In dust forever all thy vaunting pride,<br/>
    Impetuous to the glorious task I'd rush,<br/>
        Terror, Despair, Destruction, by my side!<br/>
    Nor do I hate thee, France, for this alone,<br/>
        That thou from age to age thyself has shown<br/>
    For to the realm that rules the subject waves;<br/>
        But that thy sons, detested land! are still<br/>
    A race accurst, prone to extremes of ill;<br/>
        Blood-drinking tyrants, or dust-licking-slaves!<br/></p>
