    <p>1815.2<br/><b>Petition for a New War!</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Champion</i> (January 29, 1815)<br/></p>
    <p>The following is a minute of proceedings,<br/>
    Speeches, replies, resolutions, and pleadings,<br/>
    Deliver'd at a meeting of various contractors,<br/>
    Underwriters, newsmen, corn dealers, factors,<br/>
    And others concern'd in the horrid ruination,<br/>
    Which a GENERAL PEACE must infallibly occasion.<br/></p>
    <p>    The chairman in a speech full of argument and strength,<br/>
    Which we're sorry that our limits will not let us give at length,<br/>
    Stated to the meeting the points for which they met, and<br/>
    The greatness of the danger with which they all were threaten'd,<br/>
    When an editor arose, and with infinite combustion<br/>
    Pronounced a malediction of elevated fustian:—<br/>
    Contended that peace-making was the very worst of crimes,<br/>
    Confess'd he didn't like the complexion of <i>The Times,</i><br/>
    For tho' England, he admitted, lost thousands by the war,<br/>
    His losses by the peace were more ruinous by far.—<br/>
    The Congress, he repeated, would eventually rise<br/>
    Without one act magnificent, magnanimous, or wise.<br/>
    For instance, might they not have employ'd their men and<br/>
                                            treasures<br/>
    In establishing a standard of common weights and measures?<br/>
    Might not all the kings and emperors have club'd their stock<br/>
                                            of knowledge,<br/>
    In founding and endowing a European college?<br/>
    If a continental peace gave us nothing of the kind,<br/>
    He who hoped it from the Yankees must be obviously blind;<br/>
    He therefore day by day a wordy war whoop threw in,<br/>
    But ministers (<i>Hear! Hear!</i>) seem'd determin'd on our ruin,<br/>
    And England was destroy'd by that truculent event<br/>
    That sanguinary sacrilege the signature at Ghent.—<br/></p>
    <p>    A gentleman from Liverpool had heard with great attention<br/>
    The arguments adduced, but requested leave to mention,<br/>
    That the columns of the editor were open to suspicion,<br/>
    In affecting to be friendly to the slave trade abolition,<br/>
    When 'twas known and ascertain'd that the traffic on the<br/>
                                            coast<br/>
    Was the greatest friend to wars that the universe could boast.<br/><br/>
        This charge of inconsistency called up the former speaker<br/>
    To answer to the argument, (he never heard a weaker;)<br/>
    What were Afric's wars to <i>him</i>?—Why, they didn't sell a paper,<br/>
    It was therefore just as cheap to philanthropise and vapour.<br/>
    Campaigns that were not vendible were clearly waste of blood,<br/>
    And did the present company no earthly sort of good.<br/></p>
    <p>    As the advocate for slavery was rising to reply,<br/>
    "Order! Order!" and "Chair! Chair!" was the universal cry.<br/></p>
    <p>    The horn-boys regretted the busy period when<br/>
    The consumption of their papers was greater than of men;<br/>
    But twelve were now in deep declines, in spite of the physicians,<br/>
    From blowing horns to puffing sales of fifth and sixth editions.<br/></p>
    <p>    An eminent contractor, whose name we couldn't hit on,<br/>
    Said that peace would put an end to the tranquillity of Britain,<br/>
    For such a state was quite at war with all our modes of acting,<br/>
    And fatal to those worthy men who fatten'd by contracting.<br/></p>
    <p>    A landholder with profits had for twenty years been cramm'd,<br/>
    Until this fatal peace, (for which ministers be ------;)<br/>
    However 'twas a hardship too enormous to endure,<br/>
    For 'twas only beneficial to the hungry and the poor.<br/></p>
    <p>    Several other speakers follow'd, and agreeing every one,<br/>
    The resolutions underneath were determined on <i>nem. con.</i><br/></p>
    <p>    RESOLVED, That we abhor this most diabolic Peace,<br/>
    And hope that (under God!) it may very shortly cease.<br/></p>
    <p>    RESOLVED,—That a state of interminable war,<br/>
    Is more christianlike, more noble, and more profitable far,<br/>
    And that therefore a Petition be immediately prepar'd,<br/>
    Requesting that the Regent, out of fatherly regard,<br/>
    Would declare another war on the very first occasion,<br/>
    And thereby heal the wounds of his peace-afflicted nation.<br/></p>
    <p>    Resolved,—that our thanks be given to the chairman,<br/>
    For having done his duty like a competent and fair man.<br/></p>
    <p>    Resolved,—that the Times our advertisements have earn'd,<br/>
    And that our patriot meeting for the present be adjourn'd.</p>
