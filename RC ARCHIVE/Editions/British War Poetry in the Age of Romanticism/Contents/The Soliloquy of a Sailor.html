    <p>1814.10<br/><b>The Soliloquy of a Sailor,<br/>
    With one eye, one arm, and one leg, as he limped<br/>
    through St. James's Park yesterday</b><br/>
    "All My Eye"<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (July 26, 1814)<br/><br/>
    Blind as I am, methinks a camp I view—<br/>
    Many the <i>Tents</i>, but faith, the <i>Contents</i> few.<br/>
    Who pays the piper?—Who d'ye think?—<i>John Bull</i>,<br/>
    While for his wife and babes he wants a belly full.<br/>
    For this, <i>I</i> lost an eye, an arm, a leg.<br/>
    For this poor NAN too is compelled to beg.<br/>
    Illumination!<a href="#1">[1]</a> —O the shame and scandal,<br/><i>Gods light they grudge, and tax my farthing candle</i>.</p>
