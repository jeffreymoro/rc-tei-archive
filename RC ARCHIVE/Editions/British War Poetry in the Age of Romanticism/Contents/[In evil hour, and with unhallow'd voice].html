    <p>1796.6<br/><b>[In evil hour, and with unhallow'd voice]</b><br/>
    [William Crowe]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Watchman</i>, V (April 2, 1796), pp. 144-145</p>
    <p>We are happy in being able to present our readers with the following admirable lines, written by MR. CROWE, the public orator of the University of Oxford: they were intended to have been spoken by an Under-Graduate at the Installation of the Duke of Portland; but were rejected by the Vice-Chancellor, on account of the <i>too free</i> sentiments which they conveyed. MR. CROWE is the Author of LEWESDON-HILL, a Poem.—Quod qui non legit, legat, qui legit, relegat.<br/></p>
    <p>In evil hour, and with unhallow'd voice<br/>
    Profaning the pure gift of poesy<br/>
    Did he begin to sing, he first who sung<br/>
    Of arms and combats, and the proud array<br/>
    Of warriors on the embattled plain and raised<br/>
    The aspiring spirit to hopes of fair renown<br/>
    By deeds of violence. For since that time<br/>
    The imperious victor, oft unsatisfied<br/>
    With bloody spoil and tyrannous conquest, dares<br/>
    To challenge fame and honour; and too oft<br/>
    The poet, bending low to lawless power,<br/>
    Hath paid unseemly reverence, yea, and brought<br/>
    Streams clearest of the Aonian fount, to wash<br/>
    Blood-stain'd ambition. If the stroke of war<br/>
    Fell certain on the guilty head none else;<br/>
    If they who make the cause might taste the effect,<br/>
    And drink themselves the bitter cut they mix,<br/>
    Then might the bard (though child of peace) delight<br/>
    To twine fresh wreaths around the conqueror's brow,<br/>
    Or haply strike his high toned harp to swell<br/>
    The trumpet's martial sound, and bid them on,<br/>
    Whom justice arms for vengeance: but alas!<br/>
    That undistinguishing and deathful storm<br/>
    Beats heaviest on the exposed Innocent;<br/>
    And they that stir its fury, while it raves<br/>
    Stand at safe distance; send their mandate forth<br/>
    Unto the mortal Ministers that wait<br/>
    To do their bidding—Ah! who then regards<br/>
    The Widow's tears, the friendless Orphan's cry,<br/>
    And Famine, and the ghastly train of woes<br/>
    That follow at the dogged heels of war?<br/>
    They in the pomp and pride of victory,<br/>
    Rejoicing o'er the desolated Earth,<br/>
    As at an altar wet with human blood,<br/>
    And flaming with the fire of cities burnt,<br/>
    Sing their mad hymns of triumph, hymns to God<br/>
    O'er the destruction of his gracious works!—<br/>
    Hymns to the Father o'er his slaughter'd Sons!<br/>
    Detested by their sword, abhorred their name,<br/>
    And scorn'd the tongues that praise them.</p>

                        <span class="footnote_text">1. The poet is identified as William Crowe by Lewis Patton in his edition of <i>The Watchman</i> (Princeton, 1970). Although the poem appeared earlier in <i>The European Magazine</i>, XXVII (June, 1795), pp. 418-419, the version from <i>The Watchman</i> is included here because of the introductory paragraph. Patton suggests that the Latin motto, "Those who have not read it, read it; those who have read it, read it again," may have been by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.</span>
