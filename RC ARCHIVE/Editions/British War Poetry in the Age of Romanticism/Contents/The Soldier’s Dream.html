    <p>1804.23<br/><b>The Soldier's Dream</b><br/>
    “<i>Mr</i>. Campbell”<br/><i>The Anti-Gallican</i> (1804), pp. 416-417.<br/></p>
    <p>Our bugles had sung, for the night-cloud had lower'd,<br/>
        And the centinal stars set them watch in the sky,<br/>
    And thousands had sunk on the ground overpower'd,<br/>
        The weary to sleep and the wounded to die!<br/></p>
    <p>When reposing that night on my pallet of straw,<br/>
        By the wolf-scaring faggot that guarded the slain,<br/>
    At the dead of the night, a sweet vision I saw,<br/>
        And twice ere the cock crew, I dreamt it again.<br/></p>
    <p>Methought, from the battle field's dreadful array,<br/>
        Far, far I had roam'd on a desolate track,<br/>
    Till nature and sunshine disclos'd the sweet way<br/>
        To the house of my Father that welcom'd me back.<br/></p>
    <p>I flew to the pleasant fields travell'd so oft,<br/>
        In life's morning's march when my bosom was young,<br/>
    I heard my own mountain-goats bleating aloft,<br/>
        And well knew the strain that the corn-reapers sung.<br/><br/>
    Then pledg'd we the cup, and fondly we swore,<br/>
        From my home, and my weeping friends never to part;<br/>
    My little ones miss'd me a thousand times o'er,<br/>
        And my wife sobb'd aloud in the fulness of heart!<br/></p>
    <p>Stay! stay with us! rest! thou art weary and worn;<br/>
        And fain was the war-broken soldier to stay;<br/>
    But sorrow return'd with the dawning of morn,<br/>
        And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away.<br/></p>
