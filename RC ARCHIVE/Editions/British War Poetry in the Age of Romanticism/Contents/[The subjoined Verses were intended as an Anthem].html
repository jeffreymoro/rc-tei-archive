    <p>1803.11<br/><b>The subjoined Verses were intended as an Anthem . . .</b><br/>
    “T. W.”<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIII (November 1803), p. 1058<br/></p>
    <p>Mr. URBAN,                                                                                  <i>B--n,</i> Oct. 25.<br/></p>
    <p>    The subjoined Verses were intended as an Anthem for Divine Service on the last Fast-day in the two parish-churches in which I officiate; but recollecting, after I had written them, their introduction <i>there</i> would be an infringement on the authority of the Ordinary, they were not used. If thought fit to be preserved in the Gentleman's Magazine, you loyalty or your kindness will induce you to print then.   T.W.<br/></p>
    <p>         First Verse.<br/></p>
    <p>"God save great George," &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>               II.<br/></p>
    <p>Holy Lord God arise,<br/>
    Venger of perfidies,<br/>
        Father of truth!<br/>
    Teach every secret foe,<br/>
    Lurking in treasons low,<br/>
    Teach all the earth, to know<br/>
        Thy favour's worth.<br/></p>
    <p>               III.<br/></p>
    <p>O our Defence and Shield,<br/>
    When in th' ensanguin'd field<br/>
    For thy great name;<br/>
        When, in thy righteous cause,<br/>
    Navies of warriors rose,<br/>
    Thine, Lord, and <i>His</i>, who shews<br/>
        Thine is the fame:<br/></p>
    <p>               IV.<br/></p>
    <p>Thou, whose Almighty Hand<br/>
    Guardest this envied land<br/>
        In each dread hour;<br/>
    Thou, who Invasion's host<br/>
    Scatter'st on many a coast,<br/>
    O be Thou still our boast;<br/>
        We own thy pow'r:<br/><br/>
                    V.</p>
    <p>We bend beneath thy rod;<br/>
    Raise us, O gracious God,<br/>
        Thy praise to sing:<br/>
    Still bid thy people know,<br/>
    Vain is the proudest foe,<br/>
    Vain the assassin's blow,<br/>
        God saves our King!</p>
    
    <br/>
