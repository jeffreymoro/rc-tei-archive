    <p>1813.5<br/><b>War the Source of Riches</b><br/>
    “H. R.”<br/><i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, XXXV (May 1, 1813), p. 333<br/></p>
    <p>What nonsense they talk who complain of a War<br/>
    Which makes us all greater and richer by far:<br/>
    And tho' no War known, ever lasted so long,<br/>
    Yet this may go on to the end of the song.<br/></p>
    <p>I remember the time when we all were at peace,<br/>
    When rich men and poor men all liv'd at their ease;<br/>
    When the great could drink claret, the midling sort port,<br/>
    And ale or grog flow'd for th' inferior sort,<br/>
    But War levels all, or makes us all rich,<br/>
    Whether buried in th' Abbey, or dead in a ditch.<br/><br/>
    I remember, that formerly Cits worth a plum<br/>
    Were call'd very rich—but now such a sum<br/>
    Is a younger child's portion—since some worth a million<br/>
    Have fail'd!—or jigg'd off in death's dance of cotillon.<br/>
    Then what nonsense to talk of the horrors of War,<br/>
    Which makes the small great, and the poor richer far.<br/></p>
    <p>Say, how can this happen; has England more acres?<br/>
    No, the land is the same, but your great fortune makers<br/>
    Without gold or silver can purchase the land,<br/>
    And this is the thing that some can't understand;<br/>
    Now the thing is as plain as your A, B, and C,<br/>
    For those that can't read can get money, we see:<br/></p>
    <p>As thus—an army must have cloaths and food,<br/>
    (With powder and ball for the enemies good,)<br/>
    Then who must supply them, and who are the factors?<br/>
    Why Agents, and Brokers, and army Contractors.<br/>
    Messrs. A. B. and C. and so quite down to Zed,<br/>
    Men who cypher and sum, tho' they little have read,<br/>
    And if twenty-four of such letters agree,<br/>
    They establish a bank—Messrs. A. B. and C.<br/></p>
    <p>Their notes go for guineas, next year something more,<br/>
    The next for more still, till at length a full score<br/>
    Will scarce buy so much as a guinea before;<br/>
    Yet he who possesses the most of such rags,<br/>
    Is rich without silver or gold in his bags.<br/></p>
    <p>Then what nonsense to talk of the ruin of War,<br/>
    When such riches are coin'd without bullion from far:<br/>
    Thus no one <i>can tell</i> what by War's won or lost,<br/>
    But the <i>Tellers</i>, who're paid for <i>not telling</i> its cost.</p>
