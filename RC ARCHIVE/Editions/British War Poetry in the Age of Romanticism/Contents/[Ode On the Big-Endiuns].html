    <p>1807.9<br/><b>[Ode On the Big-Endiuns]</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (November 26, 1807)<br/></p>
    <p>Yesterday arrived the <i>Cockle Shell</i> (MINIKIN, commander), from Lilyput, after an extraordinary quick passage. An Ode has appeared in one of the Papers, devoted to the interest of the <i>Big-Endiuns</i>, of which we have attempted the following translation—<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>When the Man-mountain<br/>
    Gave an account in<br/>
    Of his naval exploit,<br/>
    The fam'd <i>pull away</i> fight,<br/>
            'Tis notorious,<br/>
            What rapture,<br/>
            At a capture<br/>
            So glorious;<br/>
    All Lilyput felt,<br/>
            When we spied<br/>
            The foe's pride<br/>
            So fast tied<br/>
    To the end of his belt.<br/></p>
    <p>        Tho' a stranger<br/>
            Our danger<br/>
        Determin'd to share,<br/>
        He strips to his buff,<br/>
    And for Lilyput's rescue,<br/>
    Swims away to Blefusca,<br/>
        Tho' the seas were so rough,<br/>
        And the distance so far.<br/>
    Then his brave pair of spectacles!<br/>
    Became the receptacles<br/>
    Of the arrows so bright<br/>
    That were aim'd at his sight!<br/>
            Yet, ye Gods! Tho' such odds,<br/>
            How he tore,<br/>
            From their shore,<br/>
            Many more<br/>
            Than a score<br/>
    Of their stout men of war!<br/></p>
    <p>But Giant GAMBIER,<br/><i>Unparalleled</i> Peer;<br/>
    Tho' he with less pains<br/>
    Had his pull at the Danes,<br/>
    Mere was the merit,<br/>
    The skill, or the spirit,<br/>
    In sharing the sight,<br/>
    Not the toils, of a fight;<br/>
    His hands in his pockets,<br/>
            And nothing to do,<br/>
    But look at the rockets,<br/>
            And laugh at the shew.<br/></p>
