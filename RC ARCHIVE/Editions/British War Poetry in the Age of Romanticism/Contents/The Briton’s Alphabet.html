    <p>1804.3<br/><b>The Briton's Alphabet</b><br/>
    “C. Dibdin”<br/>
    [Charles Dibdin]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Hull Packet</i> (February 14, 1804)<br/></p>
    <p>
    <i>Tune—"A pox of your pother."—Midas.</i>
    <br/>
    </p>
    <p>A stands for <i>Albion</i>, the Queen of the Main;<br/>
    B for the <i>Britons</i> she boasts in her train<br/>
    C for the <i>Consul</i> invasion who drums;<br/>
    And D for the drubbing he'll get when he comes.<br/></p>
    <p>E stands for the Ensign of Britain unfurl'd,<br/>
    And F for her Fleets, which defy all the world;<br/>
    Next G both for Granville and Gun-boats will tell,<br/>
    And H for the Heroes who pepper'd 'em well.<br/><br/>
    I stands for Invasion, that won't stand at all,<br/>
    K stands for the King, who stands up for us all;<br/>
    L for Liberty stands, and our King will defend it<br/>
    From M that's the Murd'rer of Jaffa, who'd end it.<br/></p>
    <p>N is NELSON, of whom our foes sadly complain,<br/>
    O is Ocean, where often he'll beat 'em again;<br/>
    P our Press, at whose freedom friend BONY looks grim,<br/>
    But attacking it, Q's a Quietus for him.<br/></p>
    <p>R means our Roast-Beef, which no Frenchman shall touch,<br/>
    And S is Sir SIDNEY, who'll shew 'em as much;<br/>
    As our Tars and their Triumphs, T nobly appears,<br/>
    While V stands as glorious for brave Volunteers.<br/></p>
    <p>As our Wooden Walls, W may claim some renown,<br/>
    Which our foes, to invade us, must climb or knock down;<br/>
    Then X, Y, and Z, means my song's at an end,<br/>
    As all Frenchmen will soon be, to land who pretend.</p>

                        <span class="footnote_text">1. Charles Dibden (1745-1814): dramatist and prolix song-writer. He wrote novels and many naval songs. According to the DNB: "he brought more men into the navy in war time than all the press-gangs could" (V, 910-911).<br/></span>
