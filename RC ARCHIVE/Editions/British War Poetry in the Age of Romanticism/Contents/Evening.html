    <p>1793.20<br/><b>Evening. An Elegy.<br/>
    Written on reading the melancholy Separation of the Dauphin<br/>
    from the Queen of France</b><br/>
    “Eliza”<br/>
    [Eliza Daye?]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXIII (November 1793), pp. 1037-1038</p>
    <p>The Sun receding with his scorching beams<br/>
        Tinges the Western skies with streaks of gold,<br/>
    The hinds now whistle homeward with their teams,<br/>
        And shepherds penn with care the distant fold.</p>
    <p>Lo! from the verge of yon retiring cloud,<br/>
        Bright Cynthia pours her silver light along,<br/>
    See, to yon grove the feather'd songsters croud,<br/>
        And, for awhile, forget their tuneful song.</p>
    <p>Now flies the timid bat across the glade.<br/>
        The beetle slowly winds his drowsy horn,<br/>
    The night-bird hoots from yonder distant plat,<br/>
        The cricket chirps beneath the scatter'd corn.</p>
    <p>Now glows the pure expanse a beauteous veil,<br/>
        Glitt'ring with gems, to crown departing day,<br/>
    The Southern breeze just whispers through the dale,<br/>
        And Philomel bewails her mournful lay.</p>
    <p>Hail hour serene! thy calmness suits my mind,<br/>
        Attunes my soul ere while too deep imprest,<br/>
    Nature's still voice, by Providence design'd<br/>
        To sooth each sorrow, lull each eye to rest.</p>
    <p>Each eye, Eliza!—Ah! thou little know'st,<br/>
        How many sobs this moment rend the air,<br/>
    How many signs, by various passions lost,<br/>
        Rife from the gloomy gulph of black despair;—</p>
    <p>And, soft! what ghastly shade attracts my sight!<br/>
    Skims o'er the glade with looks of wild affright!<br/>
    What wailing phantom shrieks with fix'd despair,<br/>
    Glares wildly round, and frantic tears her hair!<br/>
        Oh! my full heart; 'tis Gallia's hopeless Queen!<br/>
    Distraction, grief, and horror, in her mien!<br/>
    Shrinking impatient from commission'd slaves,<br/>
    She spurns their wily plea, and loudly raves.—</p>
    <p>"Traitors, avaunt!—ye can no more deceive,<br/>
    "No more betray, or wretched I believe!<br/>
    "Will ye my murder'd lord, my child, restore?<br/>
    "Then may I perish ere I trust ye more;<br/>
    "The rack, <i>suspence</i>, no more with <i>hope</i> can twine,<br/>
    "For, <i>certainty</i> and <i>fix'd</i> despair are mine!<br/>
    "Peace from this tortur'd bosom's ever flown,<br/>
    "Hail, meagre mis'ry, I am all thine own!"</p>
    <p>    See on the earth, the last retreat of all,<br/>
    Pierc'd with her woes, a Queen, a mother, fail,<br/>
    No broider'd tap'stry o'er the floor is spread,<br/>
    No purple canopy enfolds her head,<br/>
    Those amber tresses twin'd with so much care,<br/>
    Neglected now, and <i>silver'd</i> by despair,<br/>
    Those eyes which open'd only to be bless'd,<br/>
    That form which only to be seen—caress'd.<br/>
    Ah! what avails her splendid house's pride,<br/>
    To whom affianc'd—or to whom allied!<br/>
    Bereft of every tie the heart holds dear,<br/>
    No friend that durst disclose one pitying tear.<br/>
    Hurl'd from her throne, from all the soul prefers,<br/>
    Did ever Misery spread so wide as hers!<br/>
    Her matchless woes each error will atone!<br/>
    He, he, that's faultless, cast the wond'rous stone.</p>
    <p>    See the poor mourner wildly stare around,<br/>
    Talk to the walls, and madly strike the ground!<br/>
    Ye flinty hearts, hear her; her anguish tell,<br/>
    "Here is my Court!—here I and Misery dwell:<br/>
    "Supreme in woe as glory heretofore,<br/>
    "This is my throne! let Kings bow down before."<br/>
    See, wildly wand'ring in the viewless air,<br/>
    The glaring eye with soul distressing stare,<br/>
    The quiv'ring lip, short breath, and stretch'd-out arm<br/>
    Starting convulsive at each dread alarm,<br/>
    View in terrific forms before her eyes<br/>
    A headless group of shrieking ghosts arise!<br/>
    And see the last sad scene reacted o'er;<br/>
    See the grim gaoler ope the ponderous door,<br/>
    See him with sturdy stride unmov'd advance,<br/>
    And of his Mother urge the Heir of France.<br/>
    View the poor frighted victim round her fling<br/>
    His little arms, and to her bosom cling.</p>
    <p>    "And dost thou think I'll ever freely give<br/>
    "My child!—my all!—no never whilst I live;<br/>
    "These arms shall shield him, we will never part,<br/>
    "Thus will I clasp him to my bursting heart.<br/>
    "Away! Away! ye need no more explain,<br/>
    "Touch him not, monsters, lest ye fire my brain!—<br/>
    "Hark!—the dread word! the dire command is given,<br/>
    "Oh! spare him!—spare him!—mercy, mercy, heaven!—</p>
    <p>    "Hast thou no bowels?—not one pretty child,<br/>
    "Dear as thy life that in thy face has smil'd?<br/>
    "And dost thou grudge me,—me that gave him birth,<br/>
    The veriest wretch that ever crawl'd on earth,<br/>
    "Of all but this—this little good beguil'd!<br/>
    "And canst thou part us!—Oh my child,—my child!—<br/>
    "See, see, they seize him!—bear him from my view!<br/>
    "Barbarians, stop!—O Gods!—one last adieu!<br/>
    "He shrieks!—he struggles!—O! restore! restore!<br/>
    "And by the Gods I'll never curse ye more.<br/>
    "Leave—leave my little bird within his cage<br/>
    "To sooth his mother's premature old age!<br/>
    "Let me but see him, while I yet have breath,<br/>
    "And I will bless you, though convuls'd with death.<br/>
        "Oh I am sick!—sick!—sick!—and worn with grief;<br/>
    "These trembling arms deny the wish'd relief,<br/>
    "Oh earth!—earth!—earth!—I come! I come!—I come;<br/>
    "And thus!—and thus, I dig my infant's tomb.<br/><br/>
        "But, soft!—'tis he!—my child escap'd the snare;<br/>
    "Oh! all ye powers! he mounts!—he skims in air!<br/>
    "Off! Off!—I'll meet him;—hark!—my cherub calls!<br/>
    "He smiles!—he points!—down, down, ye ruthless walls!<br/>
    "These hands shall do a deed to strike ye dumb!<br/>
    "Shade of my angel Boy,—I come!—I come!"</p>
