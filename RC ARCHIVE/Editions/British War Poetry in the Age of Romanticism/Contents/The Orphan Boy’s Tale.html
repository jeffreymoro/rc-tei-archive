    <p>1800.2<br/><b>The Orphan Boy's Tale</b><br/>
    “Mrs. Opie”<br/>
    [Amelia Opie]<br/><i>Poems by Mrs. Opie</i> (1800), pp. 149-151<br/><i>The Universal Magazine</i>, CX (March 1802), p. 207<br/></p>
    <p>Stay, lady, stay, for mercy's sake,<br/>
    And hear a helpless orphan's tale!<br/>
    Ah! sure my looks must pity wake, . . .<br/>
    'Tis want that makes my cheek so pale.<br/>
    Yet I was once a mother's pride,<br/>
    And my brave father's hope and joy;<br/>
    But in the Nile's proud fight he died,<br/>
    And I am now an ORPHAN BOY.<br/></p>
    <p>Poor foolish child! how pleased was I,<br/>
    When news of Nelson's victory came,<br/>
    Along the crowded streets to fly<br/>
    And see the lighted windows flame!<br/>
    To force me home my mother sought;<br/>
    She could not bear to see my joy;<br/>
    For with my father's life 'twas bought,<br/>
    And made me a poor ORPHAN BOY.<br/></p>
    <p>The people's shouts were long and loud;<br/>
    My mother, shuddering, closed her ears;<br/>
    'Rejoice! Rejoice!' still cried the crowd;<br/>
    My mother answered with her tears.<br/>
    'Why are you crying thus,' said I,<br/>
    'While others laugh and shout with joy?'<br/>
    She kissed me, . . . and, with such a sigh!<br/>
    She called me her poor ORPHAN BOY.<br/></p>
    <p>'What is an orphan boy?' I said, . . .<br/>
    When suddenly she gasped for breath,<br/>
    And her eyes closed; . . . I shrieked for aid, . . .<br/>
    But, ah! her eyes were closed in death.<br/>
    My hardships since I will not tell:<br/>
    But, now no more a parent's joy,<br/>
    Ah! lady, . . . I have learnt too well<br/>
    What 'tis to be an ORPHAN BOY.<br/></p>
    <p>Oh! were I by your bounty fed!<br/>
    Nay, gentle lady, do not chide, . . .<br/>
    Trust me, I mean to earn my bread;<br/>
    The sailor's orphan boy has pride.<br/>
    Lady, you weep! . . . Ha? . . . this to me?<br/>
    You'll give me clothing, food, employ? . . .<br/>
    Look down, dear parents! Look, and see<br/>
    Your happy happy ORPHAN BOY.</p>
