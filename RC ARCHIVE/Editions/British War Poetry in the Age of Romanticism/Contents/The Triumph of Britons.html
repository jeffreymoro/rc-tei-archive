    <p>1799.7<br/><b>The Triumph of Britons</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    “Peter Pindar” <a href="#2">[2]</a><br/>
    [John Wolcot]<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXXV (March 1799), p. 191<br/></p>
    <p>Again we begin to be Britons, my boys,<br/>
        While united success we command:<br/>
    Lo, each Tar on the Ocean a triumph enjoys,<br/>
        And laurels shall cover the land.<br/>
    Tho' surrounded by foes, that in legions arise,<br/>
        And cry for our ruin aloud,<br/>
    The Genius of England their fury defies,<br/>
        And bursts like the Sun from a cloud!<br/></p>
    <p>                      Chorus<br/></p>
    <p>May the King live for ever the friend of our Isle,<br/>
        Who revolts at the name of a Slave;<br/>
    Whose eye for fair merit possesses a smile,<br/>
        And a tear for the tomb of the brave.</p>
    <p>What man to his mistress or wife will return,<br/>
        And say, "I have fled from the foe,<br/>
    "My honour is gone, in the grave let me mourn<br/>
        "A disgrace that no Briton should know?"<br/>
    The Frenchman, who, fierce for dominion, has cried<br/>
        "To France shall the world be a slave!"<br/>
    Submitting, shall lower his top-sail of pride,<br/>
        And skulk to his ports from the wave.<br/></p>
    <p>            Cho.—May the King, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>The Spaniard too late shall his folly confess,<br/>
        When his Indies no longer remain;<br/>
    And the Dutchman, a frog in the days of Queen Bess,<br/>
        Shall croak in his ditches again.<br/>
    But how needless to talk of our prowess in war,<br/>
        And proclaim what an universe knows!<br/>
    Let Old Nile, who has witness'd our wonders, declare<br/>
        What it is to have Britons for foes!<br/></p>
    <p>           Cho.—May the King, &amp;c.</p>
