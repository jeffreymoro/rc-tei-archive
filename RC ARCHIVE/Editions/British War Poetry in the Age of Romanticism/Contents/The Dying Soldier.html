    <p>1798.15<br/><b><i>The</i> Dying Soldier; <i>a</i> Fragment</b><br/>
    "G."<br/><i>The Lady's Magazine</i>, XXIX (1798), p. 325<br/></p>
    <p>———Ah me!———<br/>
    Why did I wander from my native vale,<br/>
    And leave my cottage, where Contentment smil'd?<br/>
    Where all was happiness and peace.—Ah! why<br/>
    Did I e'er mingle in the strife of kings,<br/>
    And change the sickle for the gleaming sword,<br/>
    The low-fenc'd garden for th' embattled plain,<br/>
    Deep-ting'd with blood?—Ah, luckless was the day<br/>
    When I did hie me from Pisena's vale,<br/>
    And left all happiness behind!<br/>
                                         E'en now,<br/>
    Doth busy Memory delight to paint<br/>
    Past scenes of peace.<br/>
                             Where is the wand'ring rill,<br/>
    That, softly stealing through the dingle's shade,<br/>
    Lull'd my young soul to rest?—Where now the wood,<br/>
    In which I wander'd at the close of day,<br/>
    To pluck the lily from its secret haunt;<br/>
    Or the blue violet, that cast around<br/>
    Its balmy fragrance?—Ah! where now the hills<br/>
    O'er which I wanton'd, void of care, to catch<br/>
    The spicy gale; or mark'd the setting sun<br/>
    Tinge the blue surface of the distant main<br/>
    With purple radiance!—Where, my Mary, now?<br/>
    Sweet partner of my cot! thy simple lay<br/>
    Oft cheer'd the winter's night, when round the fire<br/>
    We sat, and hearken'd to the pelting storm;<br/>
    Then near and nearer drew.—But thou, no more<br/>
    Shalt see thy Henry; or at morn or eve<br/>
    Alas, for ever fled!—But now a film,<br/>
    Dim-spreading o'er mine eye, conceals the light<br/>
    Of pallid Cynthia.—Ah, how chill's the hand<br/>
    Of Death! and slow—still slower—flows my blood.<br/>
    Scenes of my youth farewell.—Oh, God! I come.<br/></p>
