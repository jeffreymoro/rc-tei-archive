    <p>1812.7<br/><b>Little Epigrams on the Great Emperor</b><br/>
    "Ralpho" <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Hull Packet (</i>December 15, 1812)<br/><br/><i>On his styling the Russians Bears.</i><br/></p>
    <p>Napoleon dubs the <i>Russ</i> a bear,<br/>
    He might have added something more;<br/>
    For now, 'tis ten to one he'll swear<br/>
    This bear has prov'd a mighty <i>bore</i>.<br/><br/><i>On his retreat from Moscow</i>.<br/><br/>
    Bonaparte at Moscow was <i>roasted</i>,<a href="#2">[2]</a> they say,<br/>
    And since has been <i>basted</i>, while running away;<br/>
    What wonder then now (as was long ago wish'd)<br/>
    If we find the great Emp'ror about to be <i>dish'd</i>.<br/></p>
    <p><i>Impromptu</i>,<br/></p>
    <p>On Reading the Last French Bulletin.<br/></p>
    <p>Bonaparte begins to complain of the cold;<br/>
        Why what would the fellow desire?<br/>
    Wherever the Renegade moves, we are told,<br/>
        He's surrounded with <i>hot Russian fire</i>.</p>
