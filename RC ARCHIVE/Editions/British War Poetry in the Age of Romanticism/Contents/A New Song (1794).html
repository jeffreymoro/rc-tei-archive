    <p>1794.19<br/><b>A New Song</b><br/>
    "Captain Morris"<br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (October 4, 1794)</p>
    <p>[It has been suggested that there is more <i>Truth</i> than <i>Wit</i> in the following Song. The <i>justice</i> of this suggestion, we leave to our Readers to determine.]</p>
    <p>Sure, Master JOHN BULL, I shan't know till I'm dead,<br/>
    Where the devil you're driving to, <i>a—e over head</i>!<br/>
    Troth, I've watch'd you, my dear, day and night, like a cat;<br/>
    And, bad luck to myself, if I know <i>what you're at</i>.</p>
    <p>But, the reason you waste all this blood, and this gold,<br/>
    Is a <i>secret</i>, they say—that can <i>never be told</i>:<br/>
    To be sure, for <i>such</i> secrets my tongue isn't fit;<br/>
    For I can't keep it still, without <i>speaking</i> a bit.</p>
