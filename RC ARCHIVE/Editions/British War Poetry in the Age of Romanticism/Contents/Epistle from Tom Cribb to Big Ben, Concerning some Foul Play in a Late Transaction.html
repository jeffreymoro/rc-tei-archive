    <p>1815.6<br/><b>Epistle from Tom Cribb to Big Ben,<br/>
    Concerning some Foul Play in a Late Transaction</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (August 31, 1815)<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXXV (October 1815), p. 352<br/><br/>
    What! BEN, my big hero, is <i>this</i> thy renown?<br/>
    Is <i>this</i> the new go?—kick a man when he's down!<br/>
    When the foe has knock'd under, to tread on him then—<br/>
    By the fist of my father, I blush for thee, BEN!<br/>
    "Foul! Foul!" all the Lads of the Fancy exclaim—<br/>
    CHARLEY SHOCK is electrified—BELCHER spits flame—<br/>
    And MOLYNEUX—aye, even BLACKY cries "shame!"<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Time was, when JOHN BULL little difference spied<br/>
    Twixt the foe at his feet and the friend at his side;<br/>
    When he found (such his humour in fighting and eating)<br/>
    His foe, like his beef-steak, the sweeter for beating!—<br/>
    But this comes, Master BEN, of your curst foreign notions,<br/>
    Your trinkets, wigs, thingumbobs, gold lace and lotions;<br/>
    Your Noyaus, Curacoas, and the Devil knows what—<br/>
    (One swig of <i>Blue Ruin</i><a href="#3">[3]</a> is worth the whole lot!)<br/>
    Your great and small <i>crosses</i>—(my eyes, what a brood!<br/>
    A cross-buttock from <i>me</i> would some of them good:)<br/>
    Which have spoilt you, till hardly a drop, my old porpoise,<br/>
    Of pure English claret is left in your <i>corpus</i>;<br/>
    And (as JIM says) the only one trick, good or bad,<br/>
    Of the Fancy you're up to, is <i>fibbing</i>, my lad!<br/>
    Hence it comes—BOXIANA, disgrace to thy page!—<br/>
    Having <i>floor'd</i> by good luck, the first <i>swell</i> of the age,<br/>
    Having conquer'd the <i>prime one</i>, that <i>mill'd</i> us all round,<br/>
    You kick'd him, old BEN, as he gasp'd on the ground!—<br/>
    Aye—just at the time to show spunk, if you'd got any—<br/>
    Kick'd him and jaw'd him and lag'd<a href="#4">[4]</a> him to Botany!<br/></p>
    <p>Oh shade of the Cheese-monger!<a href="#5">[5]</a> —you, who, alas!<br/><i>Doubled up</i>, by the dozen, those Mounseers in brass,<br/>
    On that great day of milling, when blood lay in lakes,<br/>
    When Kings held the bottle and Europe the stakes,—<br/>
    Look down upon BEN—see him, dunghill all o'er,<br/>
    Insult the fall'n foe that can harm him no more!—<br/>
    Out, cowardly <i>spooney</i>!—again and again,<br/>
    By the fist of my Father, I blush for thee, BEN.<br/>
    To <i>shew the white feather</i><a href="#6">[6]</a> is many men's doom,<br/>
    But, what of <i>one</i> feather? BEN shows a whole PLUME!</p>
