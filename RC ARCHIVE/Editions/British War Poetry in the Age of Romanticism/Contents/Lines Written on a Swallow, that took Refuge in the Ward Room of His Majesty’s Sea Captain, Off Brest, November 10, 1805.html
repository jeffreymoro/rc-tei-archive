    <p>1806.1<br/><b>Lines<br/>
    Written on a Swallow . . .</b><br/>
    “I. H. G.” <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (January 30, 1806)<br/></p>
    <p>Lines<br/>
    Written on a Swallow, that took Refuge in the Ward<br/>
    Room of His Majesty's Ship Captain, Off Brest,<br/>
    November 10, 1805.</p>
    <p>    Say, hapless Bird! what distant shore<br/>
    Thy wand'ring wings would fain explore?<br/>
    Or why fair Albion's peaceful Isle,<br/>
    Where every blessing deigns to smile,<br/>
    Can hold no lure to tempt your stay,<br/>
    And bask in Sol's resplendent ray?<br/></p>
    <p>    Thy walls of mud, on yonder dome,<br/>
    Where peaceful smiled the SWALLOW'S home,<br/>
    No notes of cheering joy rehearse—<br/>
    No Childrens' sweet responsive verse;<br/>
    Alas! they wail the Parent fled,<br/>
    And wait, forlorn, their daily bread.<br/></p>
    <p>    Perhaps some Bird, with rude essay,<br/>
    Has forced thee from thy home away,<br/>
    Some vile Intruder, who ne'er knew<br/>
    The joys that kindred love pursue<br/>
    Too indolent to build his nest,<br/>
    Usurps thy downy bed of rest.<br/></p>
    <p>    Like NOAH'S Dove, in ancient Ark,<br/>
    You live within a hallowed bark,<br/>
    For sacred are BRITANNIA'S walls,<br/>
    That guard her shores from daring Gauls,<br/>
    And here thy wandring feet may stay,<br/>
    And hop secure the live long day.<br/></p>
    <p>    Perhaps a Bird portending bliss,<br/>
    Omen of FAME! you enter this—<br/>
    Arrested by keen Hunger's rage,<br/>
    Here seek thy mis'ries t'assuage.<br/>
    Whene'er you please, unharmed, retreat,<br/>
    For you're no <i>Prisoner in the Fleet!</i></p>
