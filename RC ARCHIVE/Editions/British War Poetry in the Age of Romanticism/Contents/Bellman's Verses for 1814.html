    <p>1814.3<br/><b>Bellman's Verses for 1814<br/>
    Orange Boven</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    [James Henry Leigh Hunt]<br/><i>The Examiner</i> (January 23, 1814), p. 57<br/></p>
    <p>Huzza, my boys! our friends the Dutch have risen,<br/>
    Our good old friends, and burst the Tyrant's prison!<br/>
    Aye, and have done it without bloodshed too,<br/>
    Like men, to sense as well as freedom true.<br/>
    The moment, I'll be sworn, that Ocean heard it,<br/>
    With a new dance of waters it bestirr'd it;<br/>
    And Trade, reviving from her trance of death,<br/>
    Took a new lease of sunshine and of breath.<br/>
    Let's aid them, my fine fellows, all we can:—<br/>
    Where's finer business for an Englishman—<br/>
    Who knows what 'tis to eat his own good bread,<br/>
    And see his table-cloth securely spread—<br/>
    Than helping to set free a neighbour's oven?<br/>
    Huzza! The Dutch for ever! Orange Boven!</p>

The poem has been attributed to Leigh Hunt [see Simon Nowell-Smith, 'Leigh Hunt as Bellman,' <i>TLS</i> (April 2, 1970), p. 367.] The title "Orange Boven" was used for a number of other works around this time. <i>The Morning Chronicle</i> of December 11, 1814 notes a divertissement by Mr. Dibden with that title, and <i>The Scots Magazine</i> included a poem entitled "Orange Boven!—Hurra! Hurra! Hurra!" in the December 1814 issue.</span>
