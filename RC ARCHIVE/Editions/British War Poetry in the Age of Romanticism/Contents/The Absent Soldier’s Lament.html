    <p>1812.1<br/><b>The Absent Soldier's Lament</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (August 28, 1812)<br/></p>
    <p>Where slept these sinews when the deed was done;<br/>
        England all victory, and France dismay?<br/>
    It makes me hate to look upon the sun,<br/>
        Ev'n hate to think of that illustrious day.<br/></p>
    <p>Oh! what an odious, tedious task to toil<br/>
        Thro' life's low, lazy, and inglorious sphere;<br/>
    The swelling heart proud panting all the while,<br/>
        To beat and bound in glory's bright career!<br/></p>
    <p>What British soldier fir'd with such a heart,<br/>
        Who would not yield that heart's last throb to say,<br/>
    (Ev'n as its pulse the soul and body part)<br/>
        "I fought on Salamanca's<a href="#1">[1]</a> splendid day?"<br/></p>
    <p>What British warrior, red with unfelt wounds,<br/>
        Would not with all his limbs or life repay<br/>
    The proudest clang the trump of victory sounds,<br/>
        "I bled on Salamanca's trying day?"<br/></p>
    <p>What pious son, lamenting o'er the bier,<br/>
        Bending beneath a father's sacred clay,<br/>
    But tells us in the glow of nature's tear,<br/>
        "My father fell on Salamanca's day?"<br/></p>
    <p>O, that my better destinies had spared<br/>
        My sword one flourish in that noble fray,<br/>
    How had it <i>blush'd</i> because its master dared<br/>
        To add new glories to that glorious day.</p>
