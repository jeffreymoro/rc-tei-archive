<p>1796.1<br/><b>Sonnet to Peace</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Tomahawk</i> (January 4, 1796)</p>
<p>See, from the fading embers of despair,<br/>
        Reviving HOPE beams on the opening day;<br/>
    And glorious prospects with the new-born year<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
        ARISE, bedeck'd in all their colours gay.<br/></p>
<p>O'er England's land, lo! angel forms appear,<br/>
        Still hov'ring round to guard her sea-girt shore;<br/>
    And flit triumphant thro' th' expanse of air,<br/>
        To welcome PEACE, who visits her once more.<br/></p>
<p>And see, she comes array'd in form divine,<br/>
        Led on by FAME and sturdy VICTORY!<br/>
    On her right hand rich PLENTY rears her shrine,<br/>
        And on her left is smiling LIBERTY.<br/></p>
<p>    Sylvans and sea nymphs in the chorus sing,<br/>
        While PEACE once more extends her downy wing.</p>
