    <p>1796.10<br/><b>The Don's Dilemma</b><br/>
    "B."<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXVI (November 1796), p. 949<br/></p>
    <p>Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim.<a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
    <p>The Spaniard, always in the wrong,<br/>
        Spurr'd at a pinch, moves ne'er the brisker;<br/>
    Slow as the ass of Buridan<a href="#2">[2]</a> long,<br/>
        Till flashing cannons singe his whisker.<br/></p>
    <p>Drags on his solemn dull career,<br/>
        'Midst ev'ry call for animation;<br/>
    Fearless profess'd, when pall'd with fear,<br/>
        And blundring out of mere vexation.<br/></p>
    <p>Now, rous'd at length by many a shock,<br/>
        He views his follies drawn at full;<br/>
    First peck'd at by the <i>Gaulish Cock</i>,<br/>
        Then goaded by the <i>British Bull</i>.<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/></p>
