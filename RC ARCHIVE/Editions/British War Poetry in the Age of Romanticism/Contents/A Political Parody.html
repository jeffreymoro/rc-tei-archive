    <p>1809.1<br/><b>A Political Parody</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (January 3, 1809)<br/></p>
    <p>A Christmas Gambol.<br/></p>
    <p>As sung at the Priory.<br/></p>
    <p><i>By</i><i>the</i> War Minister.<br/></p>
    <p>This is the City of Lisbon.<br/>
    This is the gold that lay in the City of Lisbon.<br/>
    These are the French who took the gold<br/>
    That lay in the City of Lisbon.<br/></p>
    <p>This is Sir ARTHUR,<a href="#1">[1]</a> whose valour and skill<br/>
    Began so well, but ended so ill;<br/>
    Who beat the French who took the gold<br/>
    That lay in the City of Lisbon.<br/><br/>
    This is the Convention<a href="#2">[2]</a> that nobody owns,<br/>
    That saved old JUNOT'S baggage and bones,<br/>
    Altho' Sir ARTHUR (whose valour and skill<br/>
    Began so well, but ended so ill,)<br/>
    Had beaten the French, who took the gold<br/>
    That lay in the City of Lisbon.<br/></p>
    <p>These are the ships that carried the spoil<br/>
    That the French had plundered with so much toil,<br/>
    After the Convention, which nobody owns,<br/>
    Which saved old JUNOT'S baggage and bones;<br/>
    Altho' Sir ARTHUR (whose valour and skill<br/>
    Began so well, but ended so ill,)<br/>
    Had beaten the French, who took the gold<br/>
    That lay in the City of Lisbon.<br/></p>
    <p>This is JOHN BULL, in great dismay<br/>
    At the sight of the ships which carried away<br/>
    The gold and the silver, and all the spoil,<br/>
    The French had plundered with so much toil,<br/>
    After the Convention, which nobody owns,<br/>
    Which saved old JUNOT'S baggage and bones;<br/>
    Altho' Sir ARTHUR (whose valour and skill<br/>
    Began so well, but ended so ill,)<br/>
    Had beaten the French, who took the gold<br/>
    That lay in the City of Lisbon.<br/></p>
