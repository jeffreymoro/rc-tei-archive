    <p>1810.2<br/><b>Europa Reviviscens</b><br/>
    “The Rev. J. Brown”<br/>
    [John Brown]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Morning Post</i> (January 23, 1810)<br/></p>
    <p>    Despoil'd of verdure, and their fragrance lost;<br/>
    The groves display the virulence of frost;<br/>
    Streams cease to flow, and Nature's wither'd bloom<br/>
    Thro' all her works proclaims approaching doom.<br/>
    But when Sol's beams with plastic radiance play,<br/>
    And sterile Earth receives the vivid ray,<br/>
    Fresh flow'rets spring, the groves green liv'ries wear,<br/>
    And Winter flies before the blooming year.<br/>
    So pale Europa, war and ravage past,<br/>
    Will rise more potent from the furious blast;<br/>
    Flush'd with fresh grace, display a brighter bloom,<br/>
    Which time defies and cankers that consume.<br/>
    A Goddess bright in native charms confest,<br/>
    And fairer still from scars that mark her breast;<br/>
    Inflicted by a ruthless tyrant's steel,<br/>
    Whose fatal stab himself is doom'd to feel,<br/>
    Will from her fun'ral fires a Phoenix spring,<br/>
    In fairer form will clap her vig'rous wing;<br/>
    Will peace diffuse, and all the arts expand,<br/>
    Which bless and beautify a smiling land.<br/>
    Such Heav'n's decree—the ills we bear will bless,<br/>
    Pain has its solace, grievance its regress;<br/>
    So Nature, by an elemental strife,<br/>
    Refines that air which vigour gives and life.<br/>
    Then light'nings flash, and harmless thunders roll,<br/>
    Lest stagnant ether vitiate either pole;<br/>
    From death new life; from discord order springs,<br/>
    Such Nature's laws, such her harmonious strings.<br/>
    For when this planet in the fields of space,<br/>
    Shall, with the rest, quit its allotted place,<br/>
    The blazing comet, sever'd from its sun,<br/>
    A glorious course is destin'd still to run;<br/>
    Form'd by its Maker into bright abodes,<br/>
    The seat of Angels, and the haunt of Gods.<br/></p>
