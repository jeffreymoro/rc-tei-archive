    <p>1808.5<br/><b>The Curieux.<br/>
    A Tribute to Valour</b><br/>
    John Mayne <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, LIII (March, 1808), p. 217<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXVIII (April, 1808), p. 343<br/></p>
    <p>What mean the colours half-mast high,<br/>
        In yonder ship upon the main?<br/>
    Ah me! a seaman made reply,<br/>
        Some hero of renown is slain!<br/></p>
    <p>Yon brig is call'd the Curieux.<br/>
        To Britain's foes a deadly name;<br/>
    Her captain, Sherriff, and his crew<br/>
        No strangers in the lists of fame!<br/></p>
    <p>But, in a daring enterprise,<br/>
        Tho' glory has the conflict crown'd,<br/>
    A wreck his gallant vessel lies,<br/>
        While carnage reddens all around!<br/></p>
    <p>Behold, approaching to the shore,<br/>
        The tars, lamenting, bow their head!<br/>
    Poor Sherriff wounded to the core,<br/>
        And, for his king and country, dead!<br/></p>
    <p>Ye brave companions of his life,<br/>
        Ye heroes of the Curieux,<br/>
    Who join'd him in th' unequal strife,<br/>
        Who saw him bid the world adieu—<br/></p>
    <p>To honour's bed his corse convey,<br/>
        For glory was his leading star;<br/>
    Mild as the gentlest breeze of May,<br/>
        But like a lion in the war!<br/><br/>
    And keep your colours half-mast high,<br/>
        A mournful signal o'er the main!<br/>
    Seen only when th' illustrious die,<br/>
        Or are in glorious battle slain!</p>

                <span class="footnote_text">1. A Scottish poet, Mayne began his career as a printer in the office of the <i>Dumfries Journal</i>. He went to London in 1787 where he became proprietor and joint editor of <i>The</i><i>Star</i>. His long poem, <i>Siller Gun</i>, expanded over a period 1777-1836, was considered by Walter Scott to be superior to anything of Ferguson and close to Burns (<i>Lady of the Lake</i>, v. 20.).</span>
