    <p>1814.11<br/><b>For A' That and A' That</b><br/>
    Walter Scott<br/><i>The Scots Magazine</i>, LXXVI (July 1814), p. 535<br/></p>
    <p>[<i>A new Song to an old Tune</i>]<i>.</i><a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
    <p>Sung at the first Meeting of the Pitt Club<br/>
    of Scotland.<br/></p>
    <p>Written by Walter Scott Esq.<br/></p>
    <p>Tho' right be aft put down by strength,<br/>
        As mony a day we saw that,<br/>
    The true and leilfu' cause at length<br/>
        Shall bear the grie for a' that.<br/>
    For a' that an a' that,<br/>
        Guns, guillotines, and a' that,<br/>
    The Fleur-de-lis, that lost her right,<br/>
        Is queen again for a' that!<br/></p>
    <p>We'll twine her in a friendly knot<br/>
        With England's rose and a' that,<br/>
    The Shamrock shall not be forgot,<br/>
        For Wellington made bra' that.<br/>
    The Thistle, tho' her leaf be rude,<br/>
        Yet faith we'll no misca' that,<br/>
    She sheltered in her solitude<br/>
        The Fleur-de-lis, for a' that!<br/><br/>
    The Austrian Vine, the Prussian pine.<br/>
        (For Blucher's sake, hurra that,)<br/>
    The Spanish olive too shall join,<br/>
        And bloom in peace for a' that.<br/>
    Stout Russia's hemp, so surely twin'd<br/>
        Around our wreath we'll draw that,<br/>
    And he that would the cord unbind,<br/>
        Shall have it for his gra-vat!<br/></p>
    <p>Or if to chock sae puir a sot,<br/>
        Your pity scorn to thraw that,<br/>
    The Devil's Elbo' be his lot,<br/>
        Where he may sit and claw that.<br/>
    In spite of slight, in spite of might<br/>
        In spite of brags and a' that,<br/>
    The lads that battled for the right,<br/>
        Have won the day, and a' that!<br/></p>
    <p>There's ae bit spot I had forgot,<br/>
        They ca'd America that!<br/>
    A coward plot her rats had got<br/>
        Their father's flag to gnaw that;<br/>
    Now see it fly top-gallant high,<br/>
        Atlantic winds shall blaw that,<br/>
    And Yankee loun, beware your croun,<br/>
        There's kames in hand to claw that!<br/></p>
    <p>For on the land, or on the sea,<br/>
        Where'er the breezes blaw that,<br/>
    The British flag shall bear the grie,<br/>
        And win the day for a' that!<br/></p>
