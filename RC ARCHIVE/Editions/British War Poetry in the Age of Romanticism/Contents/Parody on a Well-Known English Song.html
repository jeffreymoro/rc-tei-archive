    <p>1804.1<br/><b>Parody<br/>
    On a Well-Known English Song</b><br/>
    “A. B.”<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (January 11, 1804)<br/></p>
    <p>By the British Horace<br/></p>
    <p>Welcome, welcome, brother CROAKER!<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
        To this debt-demolished isle!<br/>
    Where no scoffer, wag, or joker,<br/>
        <i>Now</i>, dares shew his sneering smile:<br/>
    Where, 'twixt tax and muskets resting,<br/>
        Muzzled FEAR locks up her soul!<br/>
    Much too ill at ease for jesting—<br/>
        Much too well dragoon'd to growl.<br/></p>
    <p>Sons of FREEDOM'S fond adoption,<br/>
        Britons, long so blest and brave!<br/>
    All you've left, seems now the option,<br/>
        'Twixt a Bankrupt and a Slave!<br/>
    HOPE, her choice of evils viewing,<br/>
        Doubts which first may stop her breath.<br/><i>There</i> the <i>Foe</i> lies, big with ruin—<br/><i>    Here</i> the <i>Budget</i>, big with death.<br/></p>
    <p>Bitter dose of BILLY'S brewing—<br/>
        BILLY!—bane of Britain's days!—<br/>
    In a few sad years undoing<br/>
        All that ages toil'd to raise.<br/>
    Like a wolf, let loose on plenty,<br/>
        He her vitals drain'd so fast,<br/>
    Now, good folks, nineteen in twenty,<br/>
        Feel BRITANNIA heaves her last.<br/></p>
    <p>Rouse! oh, rouse then, brother CROAKER!<br/>
        To DESPAIR let's scorn to bend:<br/>
    While we curse the hand that broke her,<br/>
        We'll BRITANNIA'S wreck defend!<br/>
    Tho' she's shatter'd, crush'd, and sinking,<br/>
        Bravely yet she tops the tide;<br/>
    And her <i>bottom's</i>, to my thinking,<br/>
        Fairly worth the world beside.<br/></p>
    <p>Now, an honest Pilot<a href="#2">[2]</a> steers her,<br/>
        Free from tyrant pride and hate;<br/>
    Now, a nation's voice too cheers her,<br/>
        Through this struggling storm of FATE;<br/>
    Then, tho' short our comfort's measure,<br/>
        Since we yet some crumbs may find,<br/>
    Curs'd by P-TT'S wide waste of treasure,<br/>
        Well we'll guard what's left behind.<br/></p>
    <p>All that's dear's at stake to move us;<br/>
        All that charms and soothes our lives;<br/>
    All we love, and all that love us—<br/>
        Children, Parents, Friends and Wives;<br/>
    King and Country, Laws and Altars,<br/>
        Claim the <i>pious hands</i> of all;<br/>
    And may SHAME brand him who faulters<br/>
        When the Gods of Battle call!<br/></p>
    <p>As we drink then, brother CROAKER,<br/>
        So we'll fight Old England's bout;<br/>
    Hand to hand, tho' hell provoke her,<br/>
        Like our flask, we'll see it out.<br/>
    At the field, as at the table,<br/>
        Jointly, bent to finish all;<br/>
    We'll stand to't like men while able,<br/>
        Or, like men, together fall.<br/></p>
    <p>Fill! oh, fill then, brother CROAKER,<br/>
        In my toast all virtues live;<br/>
    Call BRITANNIA! loud invoke her!<br/>
        While her <i>own great sons</i> I give:—<br/>
    Here's our KING! the best in story—<br/>
        Here's the PRINCE! our country's pride—<br/>
    Here's brave YORK! the soldier's glory—<br/>
        And all BRUNSWICK'S line beside.</p>
