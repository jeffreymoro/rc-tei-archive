    <p>1795.8<br/><b>The Vision</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Cabinet</i>, II (1795), pp. 35-36</p>
    <p>We met, a hundred of us met,<br/>
        At Curfew in the field;<br/>
    We talk'd of heav'n and Jesus Christ,<br/>
        And all devoutly kneel'd:<br/>
    When lo! we saw, all of us saw,<br/>
        The star-light sky unclose,<br/>
    And heard the far-high thunders roll<br/>
        Like seas where storm-wind blows.<br/>
    We listen'd, in amazement lost,<br/>
        As still as stones for dread,<br/>
    And heard the war proclaim'd above,<br/>
        And sins of nations read.<br/>
    The sound was like a solemn psalm,<br/>
        That holy christians sing,<br/>
    And by and by the noise was ceas'd<br/>
        Of all the angelic ring;<br/>
    Yet still beyond the cloven sky<br/>
        We saw the sheet of fire,<br/>
    Then came a voice, as from a throne,<br/>
        To all the heav'nly quire,<br/>
    Which spake—'Tho' many men must fall,<br/>
        'I will that these prevail;<br/>
    'To me the poor man's cause is dear.'—<br/>
        Then slowly sank a scale,<br/>
    The hand that pois'd was lost in clouds,<br/>
        One shell did weighty seem,<br/>
    But sceptres, scutcheons, mitres gold,<br/>
        Flew up and kick'd the beam.</p>
