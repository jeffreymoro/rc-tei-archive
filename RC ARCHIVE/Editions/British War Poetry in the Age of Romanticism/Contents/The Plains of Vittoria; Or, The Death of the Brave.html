    <p>1813.7<br/><b>The Plains of Vittoria;<br/>
    Or, The Death of the Brave</b><br/>
    “T. B.”<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle (</i>July 6, 1813)<br/><i>The London Chronicle</i>, CXIV (July 7, 1813), p. 23<br/></p>
    <p>All hail to the Heroes who gloriously sought<br/>
        On the Plains of Vittoria<a href="#1">[1]</a> a grave,<br/>
    Who in Liberty's cause irresistibly fought,<br/>
    And the Upstart of Gallia convincingly taught<br/>
        That nothing can conquer the Brave.<br/><br/>
    What are titles? what wealth? but a glittering prize,<br/>
        After which we all franticly rave;<br/>
    Life itself's but a meteor that flits through the skies;<br/>
    And since 'tis decreed that all human race dies,<br/>
       What can equal the "DEATH OF THE BRAVE?"<br/></p>
    <p>Let us kneel round our Soldiers' immortaliz'd urn,<br/>
        And this boon let each bold Briton Crave:—<br/>
    Oh! may I with Freedom's pure flame ever burn<br/>
    With "WELLINGTON" fight, and victorious return,<br/>
        Or—die the sweet "DEATH OF THE BRAVE!"<br/></p>
    <p>
    <i>Brompton.</i>
