    <p>1796.13<br/><b>Lines<br/>
    Occasioned by Mr. Sheridan's Poem<br/>
    On the Death of Col. Buller</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXIX (1796), pp. 399-400<br/></p>
    <p>As his own LAURA'S fond regrets require,<br/>
    Lo! GENIUS wakes the long-neglected lyre;<br/>
    And say, what object should the Muse attend—<br/>
    A HERO lost, his LAURA'S early friend.<br/></p>
    <p>    Vain thought! That Muse, debas'd by vulgar<br/>
                            rage,<br/>
    Pours Party venom on the tuneful page,<br/>
    And with low spleen defames a rightful cause,<br/>
    From BRITAIN wrung in justice to her laws<br/>
    Wrung by a race to human feelings dead,<br/>
    And whom th' indignant VIRTUES weeping fled;<br/>
    A race that scatters o'er the world dismay,<br/>
    And blot with foulest deeds the face of day;<br/>
    Deeds that, alas! involve such direful woe,<br/>
    As mournful HISTORY shall blush to show!<br/></p>
    <p>    See, too, that Muse traduce a Patriot band,<br/>
    Whose timely wisdom sav'd this happy land;<br/>
    And while mad Error shakes the States around,<br/>
    On Truth's sure basis shall its safety found.<br/></p>
    <p>    Can she, can LAURA, in whose features beam<br/>
    Youth's gen'rous glow, approve the hideous theme;<br/>
    And with those eyes, where heav'nly graces dwell,<br/>
    Smile on the eulogy of France or Hell?<br/></p>
    <p>    Recall, deluded Bard, th' injurious lay,<br/>
    A purer homage to thy LAURA pay;<br/>
    No more with factious spleen disgrace thy pow'rs,<br/>
    Nor mingle thorns with thy Parnassian flow'rs;<br/>
    But place, her empire o'er thy heart to prove,<br/>
    The wreath of Friendship on the shrine of Love.</p>
