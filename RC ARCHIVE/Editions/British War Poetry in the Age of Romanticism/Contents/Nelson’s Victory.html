    <p>1798.9<br/><b>Nelson's Victory<br/>
    An Ode.</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, VI (November 1798), pp. 366-367<br/></p>
    <p>Climb, climb, Abookir's tower. Not thus,<br/>
                        not thus,<br/>
    Abyss-born earthquakes bellow: yearning<br/>
                        deeps<br/>
        Prepare not to ingorge<br/>
        The eternal pyramids,<br/>
    Nor frowns the prophet; Eblis is not loos'd<br/>
    Flame-breathing, din-environ'd, smoke-inwrapt,<br/>
        By shouts of yelling fiends,<br/>
        To death and havoc urg'd.<br/>
    Though a destroying angel walks the wave,<br/>
    His step the thunder, and his frown the night.<br/>
        A searing sword of fate,<br/>
        Bare in his red right hand,<br/>
    'Tis Nelson he obeys: to Nelson's prayer,<br/>
    Almighty God his dread avenger sent<br/>
        In characters of death,<br/>
        To write the dooms of men.<br/>
    Ye trembling mothers, hot with scatter'd hair,<br/>
    From the long-sacred precincts of your home<br/>
        In wild disorder burst,<br/>
        Soothe, soothe, the close-claspt babe,<br/>
    And change its scream of fright to crowing joy:<br/>
    Your saviour conquers in this night of deeds—<br/>
        Here from Abookir's tower,<br/>
        We mark his triumph nigh.<br/>
    Athwart the smouldring smoke, that lowers<br/>
                        around,<br/>
    As had the hoarse-voic'd chaos call'd anew<br/>
        On earth, and sea, and sky,<br/>
        To mix in shapeless mist,<br/>
    Roar thunders thousand fold: by fits glares red,<br/>
    Like seething lavas the illumin'd wave.<br/>
        While o'er the pirates pale,<br/>
        Their thick-ribb'd bulwarks break,<br/>
    Bright, bright, yon proud pyre burns. The Orient<br/>
                        burns.<br/>
    Toulon, once more thou'rt humbled: thy huge<br/>
                        gift,<br/>
        To the French navy burns<br/>
        With fire unquenchable.<br/>
    Lo! it explodes! so from extinguish'd suns,<br/>
    Spurt their last lightnings to the rim of heaven,<br/>
        And the chill'd planets round,<br/>
        Their dark'ning shine forego.<br/>
    How the tower totters with the might crash,<br/>
    Shakes, far as Sinai's foot, the shuddering shore.<br/>
        The thick masts from the clouds<br/>
        Drop—like shafts shot in vain.<br/>
    Slow beams the blooming dawn as stills the strife.<br/>
    Hence, down the winding stairs. With pearled eye<br/>
        On the throng'd coast below,<br/>
        Pale pity beck'ning stands.<br/>
    Dare, dare, to meet the shrieks of mangled men—<br/>
    O stop the fire-swart hulks slow-drifting by,<br/>
        Least of the flitting wrack<br/>
        Their wounded limbs lose hold.<br/>
    Ah! not the midnight tear, nor morning prayer,<br/>
    Not e'en the sob that choak'd her farewell kiss,<br/>
        Avails the wife to save<br/>
        Her children's only hope.<br/>
    None is a foe who suffers—welcome all.<br/>
    Those whom the long-boats bring with oary speed,<br/>
        Are captives sworn to peace,<br/>
        Whom Nelson's mercy spares.<br/>
    They bear to Buonaparte's startled ear,<br/>
    This tale: "Thy hero friends have fought and<br/>
                        fail'd;<br/>
        Thy ships are ashes, strown<br/>
        On a rejoicing land.<br/>
    Time was, when Freedom waver'd in thy van<br/>
    The three streak'd banner, and thy legions<br/>
                       cheer'd—<br/>
        When thanking nations wash'd<br/>
        With tears thy step of blood—<br/>
    When from his long-dishonour'd tomb, the ghost<br/>
    Of Gracchus rising, show'd his wounds aveng'd—<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
        Now Rapine holds thy flag,<br/>
        Coy victory drops her palm."<br/></p>
