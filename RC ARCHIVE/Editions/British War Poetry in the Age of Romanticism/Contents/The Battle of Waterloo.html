    <p>1815.7<br/><b>The Battle of Waterloo</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    “Wm. Thos. Fitzgerald, Esq.”<br/>
    [William Thomas Fitzgerald]<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/><i>The New Monthly Magazine</i>, IV (August 1815), pp. 34-35<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXXV, ii (1815), p. 62<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, LXVIII (1815), pp. 55-56<br/></p>
    <p>"Arraign'd by Nations, let the CULPRIT stand<br/>
    At EUROPE'S bar, and there uplift his hand!<br/>
    The shades of murder'd ENGHIEN, PALM, and WRIGHT,<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/>
    Awful Accusers! shall appal his sight;<br/>
    With all the massacres that mark his reign—<br/>
    The bones that whiten JAFFA'S dreary plain,<br/>
    And those that bleach beneath the Northern sky,<br/>
    All on his head for RETRIBUTION CRY!<br/>
    MERCY, too long abused, will cease to plead,<br/>
    When the World dooms THE MAN OF BLOOD TO BLEED!<br/>
    And should DEGRADED FRANCE his cause maintain,<br/>
    She shares his guilt, and ought to share his pain."<a href="#4">[4]</a><br/>
    So sang THE BARD, whose lays for years express'd,<br/>
    The honest hatred of a Patriot breast,<br/>
    Against the vile OPPRESSOR of mankind,<br/>
    To whose black crimes some dazzled eyes were blind.<br/>
    The muse's prophecy's complete at last,<br/>
    Thy reign, DETESTED CORSICAN, is past!<br/>
    And HEAVEN decreed, in its appointed hour,<br/>
    That BRITAIN'S arm should crush the TYRANT'S power.<br/>
    But where's the BARD, however grac'd his name,<br/>
    Can venture to describe GREAT WELLESLEY'S fame?<br/><br/>
    Such Bard, in strength and loftiness of lays,<br/>
    May soar beyond hyperbole of praise,<br/>
    And yet not give the tribute that is due<br/>
    To BRITONS, WELLINGTON, led on by you!!<br/>
    For to the plains of WATERLOO belong<br/>
    The magic numbers of immortal song!<br/>
    A HOMER'S lyre, or CAESAR'S pen, should tell<br/>
    How BRUNSWICK died, and valiant PICTON fell;<br/>
    How PONSONBY, too, shar'd their honour'd fate,<br/>
    And join'd in death the GALLANT and the GREAT!<br/>
    How laurell'd WELLINGTON seiz'd Fortune's hour,<br/>
    To blast like lightning BUONAPARTE'S power,<br/>
    And with a mighty and tremendous blow,<br/>
    Confound, defeat, annihilate the Foe!<br/>
    In vain the CUIRASSIERS advance,<br/>
    The TYRANT'S boast, the pride of FRANCE,<br/>
    To break our HOLLOW SQUARE:<br/>
    Ten times they charge, ten times retire;<br/>
    Again they face the BRITISH fire,<br/>
    And perish in despair!<br/>
    New masses on our squares descend;<br/>
    They also charge to meet their end,<br/>
    And countless warriors fall;<br/>
    Horses and horsemen strew the plain,<br/>
    And cannon mingled with the slain,<br/>
    One fate attends them all<br/>
    So on some bold, projecting rock,<br/>
    The furious billows beat;<br/>
    But still it stands the mighty shock,<br/>
    And spurns them from its feet!<br/>
    Thus long defensive BRITONS stood,<br/>
    And brav'd the overwhelming flood,<br/>
    With constancy divine!<br/>
    'Till the brave PRUSSIAN'S distant gun<br/>
    Induced the GLORIOUS WELLINGTON<br/>
    To form the BRITISH LINE;<br/>
    His eagle eye discerns from far<br/>
    That moment which decides the war,<br/>
    "FORWARD! he cries, "FOR ENGLAND'S GLORY!"<br/>
    The veteran bands of GALLIA yield,<br/>
    And WATERLOO'S triumphant field<br/>
    Shall shine in BRITISH story!<br/>
    Not CRESSY, AGINCOURT, or BLENHEIM'S day,<br/>
    Could bear a nobler wreath of fame away;<br/>
    And PRINCELY EDWARD, HENRY, MARLBOROUGH too,<br/>
    Had done that justice, WELLINGTON, to you!<br/>
    Such mighty triumphs must be purchas'd dear,<br/>
    And on her LAURELS VICTORY drops a tear—<br/>
    The sweetest tribute to the fallen brave<br/>
    Are Soldier's sorrows on a Soldier's grave!<br/><br/>
    The blood that's shed gives every bosom pain,<br/>
    But with this solace—'tis not shed in vain;<br/>
    For to their noble death their COUNTRY owes<br/>
    Her high RENOWN! and EUROPE her repose.<br/></p>
    <p>On LOFTY COLÜMNS of eternal Fame<br/>
    Shall British Gratitude record each name!<br/>
    There ever shall each SISTER ISLE behold<br/>
    Her gallant Sons immortaliz'd in gold;<br/>
    But deeper far, eternally imprest,<br/>
    Shall live their memory in the PATRIOT BREAST!<br/>
    Nor shall the GALLANT GERMANS be forgot,<br/>
    Who shar'd their triumphs, and partook their lot.</p>
