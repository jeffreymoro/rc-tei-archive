    <p>1796.14<br/><b>An Elegy on War</b><br/>
    "Matho"<br/><i>The Protestant Dissenter's Magazine</i>, III (1796), pp. 32-33<br/></p>
    <p>From the drear mansions of the stygian shade<br/>
        Where glide the ghosts and images of woe;<br/>
    Come horror, and afford thy solemn aid,<br/>
        And give the strain in tearful plaints to flow.<br/></p>
    <p>If down thy cheeks the sympathetic dew<br/>
        E'er copious flow'd, when misery sought relief;<br/>
    Unloose the fountains; let them stream anew;<br/>
        And swell the ocean with a tide of grief.<br/></p>
    <p>Hark! the loud clangor of the trumpets breath,<br/>
        Rides the sad gale, and wakes the bloody plan:<br/>
    'Tis the dire prelude to the work of death,<br/>
        Big with th' <i>eternal</i> destiny of man.<br/></p>
    <p>See the mad squadrons rush to horrid fight;<br/>
        And lavish vengeance fling o'er all the plain:<br/>
    Humanity flies far in wild affright<br/>
        On some lone surge-beat rock to mourn the slain.<br/></p>
    <p>Ghastly and pale the wounded heroes bleed;<br/>
        Each sod redundant drinks the purple flood:<br/>
    And every moment wing'd with rapid speed<br/>
        Bears a free'd spirit to its last abode.<br/></p>
    <p>Amazing change!—This moment gaily clad<br/>
        In all the gorgeous panoply of war;<br/>
    The next a spectre, dreary, wan, and sad,<br/>
        Arraign'd before Jehovah's awful bar!<br/></p>
    <p>Deep fraught with tidings flies the sullen gale;<br/>
        The wife a husband mourns; the child a sire;<br/>
    The tear of friendship gushes at the tale<br/>
        And the sick heart desponds in anguish dire.<br/></p>
    <p>O fell ambition! foe to human kind!<br/>
        Thine the desire the passions to inflame;<br/>
    To kindle martial rage o'er all the mind,<br/>
        And gild destruction with the glare of fame.<br/></p>
    <p>Was it for this, O man, thy Maker God<br/>
        Illum'd with heavenly light the mental mine?<br/>
    Love, reason, conscience, graciously bestow'd<br/>
        And gave to aid them documents divine?<br/></p>
    <p>Ah no!—For nobler ends these powers were giv'n,<br/>
        Else had his plaudit ne'er pronounc'd them good:<br/>
    Cease then rebellion 'gainst the laws of heav'n,<br/>
        And thirst no more to spill a brother's blood.<br/></p>
    <p>Quick sheathe the sword, and for a moment pause:<br/>
        The cries of widows, and of orphans hear;<br/>
    Let sympathy awake and plead the cause,<br/>
        And check the passions in their mad career.<br/></p>
    <p>The gifts of heav'n are free; to none deny'd;<br/>
        But pour'd profuse as are the beams of day;<br/>
    Be they enjoy'd; and know no other pride<br/>
        Than highest to exalt the grateful lay.<br/></p>
    <p>Let the destructive arts be known no more,<br/>
        In dire oblivious dark abyss conceal'd:<br/>
    Turn swords and spears deep ting'd with human gore,<br/>
        To prune the Vine, and plough the fruitful field.<br/></p>
    <p>Then sportive loves, an ever jocund train,<br/>
        Shall chant in every grove the gladsome song;<br/>
    PEACE bless the nations with her genial reign,<br/>
        And friendship's balm diffuse from every tongue.<br/></p>
    <p>So when the angry north forbears to blow,<br/>
        And zephyrs bland announce th' approach of spring,<br/>
    The ice dissolves; the limpid fountains flow;<br/>
        The swains rejoice; and feather'd warblers sing.<br/></p>
    <p>The days of man are few.—As flies the shade<br/>
        When the light cloud flits o'er the face of day,<br/>
    So flies he hence: diseases fierce invade,<br/>
        Impair his strength, and hasten him away.<br/></p>
    <p>Why then fly o'er the distant climes of earth,<br/>
        With fire and sword to trouble his repose?<br/>
    Despoil creation; damp the voice of mirth;<br/>
        And add unfeeling to the list of woes.<br/></p>
    <p>O may the sun, in his ethereal tour,<br/>
        No more see man beneath his fellow bleed,<br/>
    Or seeing, veil his glory; and spread o'er<br/>
        A cloud of darkness horrid as the deed.<br/></p>
    <p>O come Benevolence, with ray benign;<br/>
        Spread o'er the nations thy magnetic sway;<br/>
    Teach the proud heart to bow at nature's shrine,<br/>
        And to the God of nature homage pay.<br/></p>
    <p>Bent low; submissive to his high behest,<br/>
        Be every pow'r in earth and heav'n above;<br/>
    And let his sacred laws, by all confess'd,<br/>
        Unite the world in happiness and love.</p>
