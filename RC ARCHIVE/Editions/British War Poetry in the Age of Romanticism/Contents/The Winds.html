    <p>1809.7<br/><b>The Winds</b><br/>
    “The Rev. Wm. Lisle Bowles”<br/>
    [William Lisle Bowles]<a href="1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIX (June, 1809), p. 550<br/></p>
    <p>    When pale October bade the flow'rs adieu,<br/>
    And Autumn sung amid the seaman's shrouds,<br/>
    Methought I saw four winged forms that flew<br/>
    With garments streaming light amid the clouds;<br/>
        From adverse regions of the sky<br/>
        In dim succession they went by;<br/>
    The first, as o'er the billowy deep he past,<br/>
    Blew from his shadowy trump a war-denouncing blast.<br/><br/>
        Upon a beaked promontory high,<br/>
    With streaming beard, and cloudy brow severe,<br/>
    I mark'd the Father<a href="2">[2]</a> of the frowning year:<br/>
        Dark vapours roll'd o'er the tempestuous sky.<br/>
    When creeping Winter from his cave came forth—<br/>
    "Stern Herald of the storm, what from the North!"<br/>
    'Shouts and the noise of Battle! and again<br/>
        He blew from his dark trump a deadlier blast,<br/>
    'Shouts and the noise of Battle: the long main<br/>
    Seem'd with hoarse voice to answer as he past.<br/></p>
    <p>The moody South went by, and silence kept;<br/>
        The cloudy rack oft hid his mournful mien,<br/>
    And frequent fell the show'r, as if he wept<br/>
        The eternal havock of this mortal scene;<br/>
    As if he wish'd for ever thus to throw<br/>
    His misty mantle o'er a world of woe.<br/></p>
    <p>But rousing him from his desponding trance<br/>
        Cold Eurus blew his short and shrilling horn,<br/>
    In his right hand he bore an icy lance,<br/>
        That far off glitter'd in the frost of morn.<br/>
    The Old Man knew the clarion from afar—<br/>
    "What from the East!" he cry'd: 'Shouts and<br/>
                       the noise of War!'<br/></p>
    <p>    Who comes in soft and spicy vest<br/>
        From the mild region of the West,<br/>
    An azure veil bends waving o'er his head,<br/>
    And show'rs of violets at his feet are spread?<br/>
    'T is Zephyr, with a look as young and fair<br/>
        As when his lucid wings conveyed<br/>
        That beautiful and gentle maid<br/>
    Psyche,<a href="3">[3]</a> transported thro' the air<br/>
    The blissful couch of Love's own god to share;<br/>
        He brings again the morn of May;<br/>
            The lark amid the clear blue sky<br/>
            Carols, but is not seen so high;<br/>
        And all the howling winds fly far away.<br/>
    I cried, "O Father of the world, whose might<br/>
        The storm, the darkness, and the winds obey;<br/>
    Oh when will thus the long tempestuous night<br/>
        Of warfare and of woe be roll'd away?<br/>
    O when will cease the uproar and the din,<br/>
    And Peace breathe soft, 'Summer is coming in'<a href="4">[4]</a></p>

                        <span class="footnote_text">1. William Lisle Bowles (1762-1850), divine, poet, and antiquary. In 1776, Bowles attended the Winchester School under Joseph Warton who encouraged him to write poetry. He later studied under Thomas Warton. In 1759, Bowles published <i>Fourteen Sonnets</i><i>written chiefly on Picturesque Spots during a Journey</i> which was an extraordinary success. He is the subject of a sonnet by Coleridge, first published in <i>The Morning Chronicle</i>, December 26, 1794. In 1806, Bowles edited Pope, an edition noted for the hostile spirit of its introduction. His <i>Poetical Works</i> in a collected edition with a memoir by Reverend George Gilfallan were published in Edinburgh in 1855.</span>
