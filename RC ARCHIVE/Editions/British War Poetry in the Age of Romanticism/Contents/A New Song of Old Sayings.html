    <p>1804.22<br/><b>A New Song of Old Sayings</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Anti-Gallican</i> (1804), pp. 417-418<br/><i>The Spirit of the Public Journals</i>, VIII (1805), pp. 64-65 <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Bonaparte, the bully, resolv'd to come over,<br/>
    With flat-bottom'd wherries, from Calais to Dover;<br/>
    No perils to him in the billows are found,<br/><i>'For if born to be hang'd he can never be drown'd.'</i><br/></p>
    <p>From a Corsican dunghill this fungus did spring,<br/>
    He was soon made a Captain and would be a King;<br/>
    But the higher he rises the more he does evil,<br/><i>'For a Beggar on Horseback will ride to the Devil.'</i><br/></p>
    <p>To seize all that we have and then clap us in jail,<br/>
    To devour all our victuals and drink all our ale,<br/>
    And to grind us to dust is the Corsican's will—<br/><i>'For we know all is grist that e'er comes to his mill.'</i><br/></p>
    <p>To stay quiet at home the FIRST CONSUL can't bear,<br/>
    Or mayhap <i>he would have other fish to fry there</i>;<br/>
    So as fish of that sort does not suit his desire,<br/><i>'He leaps out of the frying-pan into the fire.'</i><br/></p>
    <p>He builds barges and cock-boats and craft without end,<br/>
    And numbers the boats which to England he'll send,<br/>
    But in spite of his craft, and his barges and boats,<br/><i>'He still reckons, I think, without one of his hosts.'</i><br/></p>
    <p>He rides upon France and he tramples on Spain,<br/>
    And holds Holland and Italy tight in a chain;<br/>
    These he hazards for more, though I can't understand,<br/><i>'How one bird in the bush is worth two in the hand.'</i><br/></p>
    <p>He trusts that his luck will all danger expel,<br/><i>'But the pitcher is broke that goes oft to the well;'</i><br/>
    And when our brave soldiers this bully surround,<br/><i>'Though he's thought</i> PENNY-WISE, <i>he'll look foolish in</i><br/>
                                     POUND.'<br/></p>
    <p>France can never forget that our fathers of yore,<br/>
    Used to pepper and baste her at sea and at shore;<br/>
    And we'll speedily prove to this Mock-Alexander,<br/><i>'What was sauce for the goose, will be sauce for the<br/>
                                     gander.'</i><br/><br/>
    I have heard and have read in a great many books,<br/>
    Half the Frenchmen are tailors, and t'other half cooks;—<br/>
    We've fine trimmings in store for the Knights of the Cloth,<br/><i>'And the Cooks that come here will but spoil their own<br/>
                                     broth.'</i><br/></p>
    <p>It is said that the French are a numerous race,<br/>
    And perhaps it is true, <i>'for ill weeds grow a-pace;'</i><br/>
    But come when they will, and as many as dare,<br/><i>'I expect they'll arrive a day after the fair.'<br/></i></p>
    <p>To invade us more safely these warriors boast,<br/>
    They will wait till a storm drives our fleet from the coast,<br/>
    That t'will <i>'be an ill wind</i>, will be soon understood,<br/>
    For a wind <i>that blows</i> Frenchmen <i>blows nobody good</i>.'<br/></p>
    <p>They would treat Britain worse than they've treated Mynheer,<br/>
    But they'll find, '<i>they have got a wrong sow by the ear;</i><br/>
    Let them come then in swarms by this Corsican led,<br/>
    And I warrant, <i>'we'll hit the right nail on the head.'</i></p>
