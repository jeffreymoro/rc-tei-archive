    <p>1803.8<br/><b>Buonaparte's Will</b><br/>
    “Hafiz”<br/>
    [Thomas Stott]<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIII (October 1803), p. 956<br/><i>The Anti-Gallican</i> (1804), p. 427 (with its source given as <i>The Morning Post</i>)<br/></p>
    <p>As I am on a voyage bent,<br/>
        That may prove good or ill,<br/>
    I thus, confusion to prevent,<br/>
        Think fit to make my WILL:<br/></p>
    <p>And, first, Madame, my loving wife<br/>
        (Though sorry to forsake her),<br/>
    I leave, should I depart this life,<br/>
        To BARRAS<a href="#1">[1]</a>—if he'll take her.<br/></p>
    <p>She of unfruitful vines was one!<br/>
        I wish he still had kept her:<br/>
    Then, haply, to a duteous <i>son</i>,<br/>
        I now might leave—my <i>sceptre</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>But not a needle do I care<br/>
        Who wields it after me,<br/>
    Provided he be no proud heir<br/>
        Of BOURBON'S family.<br/><br/>
    Then, to my FELLOW-CONSULS, next,<br/>
        I leave their titled <i>bubble</i>—<br/>
    To TALLEYRAND,<a href="#2">[2]</a> this wholesome <i>text</i>,<br/>
        "A man is born to trouble!"<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/></p>
    <p>To my dear BROTHERS I bequeath<br/>
        All they can get by <i>rapine</i>;<br/>
    That is, provided that <i>my</i> death,<br/>
        Ere I return, shall happen.<br/></p>
    <p>To my companions, brave in arms<br/>
        (If they get safely over),<br/>
    I give up all the wealth, and charms,<br/><i>    Beyond the Cliffs of Dover.</i><br/></p>
    <p>My friends, th' <i>Italians, Dutch</i>, and <i>Swiss</i>,<br/>
        To me so true and steady,<br/>
    I leave my fond <i>fraternal kiss</i>—<br/>
        So now to die I'm ready.<br/></p>

Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (1754-1838), had aided Bonaparte's early career, and was especially influential in his appointment as First Consul. Talleyrand desired that the Peace of Amiens be kept, and he attempted to moderate Napoleon's ambition since he desired that the European system be maintained as far as possible. By 1803, Talleyrand found that more and more he disapproved of Napoleon's policies.</span></p>
