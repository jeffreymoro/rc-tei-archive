    <p>1804.5<br/><b>Ode On The Anniversary of the Birthday of Burns</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Hull Packet</i> (February 28, 1804)<br/></p>
    <p>While Gaul's martial Demon, inflated with pride,<br/>
    Of Invasion sends threat after threat o'er the tide,<br/>
    And the Sons of the Britons with banners unfurl'd,<br/>
    By patience heroic astonish the world:<br/>
        In wielding our arms, and our glasses by turns,<br/>
            We will spend the convivial hours;<br/>
        And fir'd by the bold independence of BURNS,<br/>
            Wake our social, our patriot powers:<br/>
    And till the loud roar of the battle shall cease,<br/>
    Round the chaplet of war wreath the garland of peace.<br/></p>
    <p>Should the menacing host e'er by stealth gain the land,<br/>
    Shall they marshall their minions secure on the strand?<br/>
    No—the AIR and the DOON, deeply stain'd by our blood,<br/>
    Shall first widely crimson the sea with the flood!<br/>
        At sight of the Tyrant, what fury will rise<br/>
            In the breasts of brave Scotia's sons!<br/>
        What noble resentment will flash from their eyes,<br/>
            As they handle their swords or their guns!<br/>
    Nor warlike exertion, nor conduct, shall cease,<br/>
    Till again we repose on the pillow of peace.<br/></p>
    <p>How throbs my proud bosom, oppress'd with delight,<br/>
    As I view these lov'd patrons of Genius so bright,<br/>
    Who befriended the unfriended poet, and drew<br/>
    From his pen the encomiums so justly their due.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
        O far, distant far, be the sorrowful day,<br/>
            When the Bard's benefactors and mine<br/>
        Shall like him bid me weave the funereal lay,<br/>
            And the Yew with the Cypress entwine.<br/>
    On earth, with your years, may your blessings increase,<br/>
            And may BURNS at last greet you in regions of peace.</p>
