    <p>1803.12<br/><b>Harlequin's Invasion</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIII (November 1803), pp. 1056-1057<br/><i>The Anti-Gallican</i> (1804), pp. 69-70 (with its source given as <i>The Morning Post</i>)<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>[The following little production was, some months since, offered to the publick, but through so confined a channel that we hope we shall stand excused to our readers in giving it a place in our Magazine.]<br/></p>
    <p>No comic pantomime before<br/>
        Could ever boast such tricks surprising:<br/>
    The hero capers Europe o'er—<br/>
        But hush! behold the curtain rising.<br/></p>
    <p>And, first, that little isle survey,<br/>
        Where sleeps a peasant-boy so hearty;<br/>
    That little isle is Corsica,<br/>
        That peasant-boy is Buonaparte.<br/></p>
    <p>Now lightnings flash, and thunders roar,<br/>
        Daemons of witchcraft hover o'er him,<br/>
    And, rising through the stage trapdoor,<br/>
        An evil genius stands before him.<br/></p>
    <p>His arms in solemn state are crost,<br/>
        His voice appals th' amaz'd beholders,<br/>
    His head in circling clouds is lost,<br/>
        And crimson pinions shade his shoulders.<br/></p>
    <p>"Mortal, awake!" the phantom cries,<br/>
        "And burst the bonds of Fear asunder:<br/>
    My name is Anarchy—Arise<br/>
        Thy future fortunes teem with wonder.<br/><br/>
    "To spread my reign the earth around,<br/>
        Here, take this sword, whose magic power<br/>
    Shall sense and right and wrong confound,<br/>
        And work new wonders every hour.<br/></p>
    <p>"Throw off that peasant-garb, begin<br/>
        T'assume the party colour'd rover;<br/>
    And, as a sprightly Harlequin,<br/>
        Trip, lightly trip, all Europe over."<br/></p>
    <p>He spoke, and, instant to the view<br/>
        Begins the curious transformation:<br/>
    His mask assumes a sable hue,<br/>
        His dress a pantomimic fashion.<br/></p>
    <p>Now round the stage, in gaudy pride,<br/>
        Capers the renovated varlet;<br/>
    Shakes the lath weapon at his side,<br/>
        And shines in blue, and white, and scarlet.<br/></p>
    <p>High on a rock, his cunning eye<br/>
        Surveys half Europe at a glance,<br/>
    Fat Holland, fertile Italy,<br/>
        Old Spain, and gay, regen'rate France.<br/></p>
    <p>He strikes with wooden sword the earth,<br/>
        Which heaves with motion necromantic;<br/>
    The nations own a second birth,<br/>
        And trace his steps with gestures antic.<br/></p>
    <p>The <i>Pope</i> prepares for war, but soon<br/>
        All-powerful Harlequin disarms him;<br/>
    And, changing into <i>Pantaloon</i>,<br/>
        Each motion frets, each noise alarms him.<br/></p>
    <p>With trembling haste he seeks to join<br/>
        His daughter <i>Gallia</i>, lovely rover!<br/>
    But she, transform'd to <i>Columbine</i>,<br/>
        Her father scorns, and seeks her lover.<br/></p>
    <p>The Dutchman next his magic feels,<br/>
        Chang'd to the <i>Clown</i>, he hobbles after;<br/>
    Blundering pursues the light of heels,<br/>
        Convulsing friends and foes with laughter.<br/></p>
    <p>But all their various deeds of sin,<br/>
        What mortal man has ever reckon'd?<br/>
    The mischief plann'd by Harlequin,<br/>
        Fair Columbine is sure to second.<br/><br/>
    They quickly kill poor Pantaloon,<br/>
        And now our drama's plot grows riper;<br/>
    Whene'er they frisk it to <i>some tune</i>,<br/>
        The Clown is forc'd to <i>pay the piper</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>Each foreign land he dances through,<br/>
        In some new garb beholds the hero,<br/>
    Pagan and Christian, Turk and Jew,<br/>
        Cromwell, Caligula, and Nero.<br/></p>
    <p>A butcher, Harlequin appears,<br/>
        The rapid scene to Egypt flying;<br/>
    O'er captive Turks his sword uprears,<br/>
        The stage is strew'd with dead and dying.<br/></p>
    <p>Next, by the crafty genius taught,<br/>
        Sportive he tries a Doctor's trick;<br/>
    Presents the bowl, with poison fraught,<br/>
        And kills his own unconscious sick!<br/></p>
    <p>Hey! pass! he's back to Europe gone,<br/>
        All hostile followers disappointed;<br/>
    Kicks five old women from the throne,<br/>
        And dubs himself the Lord's Anointed.<br/></p>
    <p>In close embrace with Columbine,<br/>
        Pass, gaily pass, the flying hours;<br/>
    While prostrate at their blood-stain'd shrine,<br/>
        Low bend the European Powers.<br/></p>
    <p>Touch'd by his sword, the morals fly,<br/>
        The virtues into vices dwindling;<br/>
    Courage is turn'd to cruelty,<br/>
        And public faith to private swindling.<br/></p>
    <p>And now th' Invasion scene comes on;<br/>
        The patch'd and pie-ball'd Renegado<br/>
    Hurls at BRITANNIA'S lofty throne<br/>
        Full many a mad and proud bravado.<br/></p>
    <p>The trembling Clown dissuades in vain,<br/>
        And finds too late there's no retreating<br/>
    Whatever Harlequin may gain,<br/>
        The Clown is sure to get a beating.<br/></p>
    <p>They tempt the main, the canvas raise,<br/>
        The British fleet destroys his legions,<br/>
    And the next change of scene displays<br/>
        Him sinking to th' infernal regions.<br/><br/>
    While Patriot Bands united throng<br/>
        Around BRITANNIA'S happy coast,<br/>
    By freedom fir'd, in courage strong,<br/>
        Each in his Country's cause an host.</p>
