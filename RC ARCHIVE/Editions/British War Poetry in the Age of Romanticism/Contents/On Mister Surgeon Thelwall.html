    <p>1795.17<br/><b>On Mister Surgeon Thelwall</b><br/>
    "Jack Bull"<br/><i>The Tomahawk</i> (October 27, 1795)</p>
    <p>Poor <i>Mister</i> Thelwall<a href="#1">[1]</a> has exhausted<br/>
        All his little stock of wit,<br/>
    The fellow <i>merits</i>—to be hoisted;<br/>
        So high he soars—<i>to pick a bit.</i></p>
    <p>He dealt with <i>resurrection-men</i>,<br/>
        To make the <i>Quick rise</i> now he's at;<br/>
    But sure we cannot wonder, when<br/>
        The fellow is a <i>Democrat</i>!</p>
    <p>If he would eat in peace his bread,<br/>
        Why let him follow ancient thriving;<br/>
    Go pick the BONES then of the dead<br/>
        And not the POCKETS of the <i>living</i>!</p>
