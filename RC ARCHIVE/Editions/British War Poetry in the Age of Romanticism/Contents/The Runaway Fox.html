    <p>1798.2<br/><b>The Runaway Fox</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The London Chronicle</i> (March 1798), p. 251<br/></p>
    <p>Shewing how Mr. FOX came to run away from<br/>
        the Parliament House: being quite a<br/>
        new Song, in praise of those Persons<br/>
        who resolve to keep the Ship, and ride<br/>
        it through the Storm.<br/></p>
    <p>There was one noted Fox, Sir,<br/>
        A man of sense and wit,<br/>
    And well he dealt his knocks, Sir,<br/>
        Against good Mr. PITT!<br/></p>
    <p>But PITT he was a fellow,<br/>
        Who trimm'd him in his turn;<br/>
    O! then how Fox did bellow,<br/>
        And all his wrath did burn.<br/></p>
    <p>Says Fox, this plaguy war, Sir,<br/>
        Doth prove you fool and mad;<br/>
    Says PITT, pray hold your tongue, Sir,<br/>
        For Peace it can't be had.<br/></p>
    <p>Said Fox, when bread was dear, Sir,<br/>
        The War was all the reason;<br/>
    But PITT he made it clear, Sir,<br/>
        It was a scanty season.<br/></p>
    <p>Says Fox, you've broke the Bank, Sir:<br/>
        O! now we're all undone!<br/>
    For this, says PITT, pray thank, Sir,<br/>
        The fools who made the <i>run</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>Says Fox, what fright and fear, Sir,<br/>
        In Ireland have you spread.<br/>
    Why there, says PITT, 'tis clear, Sir,<br/>
        Rebellion's rais'd her head.<br/></p>
    <p>Says Fox, I love those fellows,<br/>
        Those persons whom you blame.<br/>
    Says PITT, why you're the bellows<br/>
        That's blowing up the flame.<br/></p>
    <p>Says Fox, in England too, Sir,<br/>
        You've broke the Constitution.<br/>
    No, no, says PITT, 'tis you, Sir,<br/>
        That want a Revolution.<br/><br/>
    Then Fox, he storm'd and bounc'd, Sir,<br/>
        At what young PITT did say:<br/>
    And felt he was so trounc'd, Sir,<br/>
        At last he ran away.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p><i>St. Stephen's</i> House he quitted,<br/>
        As all the world doth know;<br/>
    Nor dar'd, he was so twitted,<br/>
        To stand another blow.<br/></p>
    <p>So now let every lip, Sir,<br/>
        Come sing, with praises warm,<br/>
    "The men who keep the Ship, Sir,<br/>
        "And ride it thro' the storm."</p>
