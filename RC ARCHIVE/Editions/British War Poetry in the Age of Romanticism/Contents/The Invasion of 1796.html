    <p>1798.5<br/><b>The Invasion of 1796</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXVIII (September 1798), p. 793<br/></p>
    <p>Now fair and strong the South-east blew,<br/>
        And high the billows rose;<br/>
    The French fleet bounded o'er the waves,<br/>
        Freighted with Erin's foes.<br/></p>
    <p>Oh! where was Hood—and where was Howe,<br/>
        And where Cornwallis then,<br/>
    Where Colpoys, Bridport, or Pellew,<br/>
        And all their gallant men?<br/><br/>
    Nor skill nor courage aught avail<br/>
        When Providence gainsays;<br/>
    The storm arose, and clos'd our ports,<br/>
        A mist o'erspread the seas.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>For not to feeble mortal men<br/>
        Did God his vengence trust;<br/>
    He rais'd his own tremendous arm,<br/>
        All powerful—and all-just!<br/></p>
    <p>Now fierce and loud the tempest blew,<br/>
        And swept the quiv'ring main,<br/>
    And part go South and part go West,<br/>
        And part the shore attain.<br/></p>
    <p>And tumbling on the boist'rous wave<br/>
        The shatter'd vessels lie;<br/>
    The billows mounting o'er their heads,<br/>
        To kiss the bending sky.<br/></p>
    <p>"Arise, ye sons of Erin, rise,<br/>
        The Gaul is on the shore;<br/>
    He comes begrim'd with murder foul,<br/>
        And red with royal gore."<br/></p>
    <p>The sons of Themis<a href="#2">[2]</a> proudly drew<br/>
        The sword of Justice bright,<br/>
    And thirty thousand yeoman's swords<br/>
        Reflected back its light.<br/></p>
    <p>Now firm and bold her hardy troops<br/>
        To Erin's coast repair;<br/>
    With ardent zeal they march along,<br/>
        Their banners fill the air.<br/></p>
    <p>But not to Albion's navy bold,<br/>
        Nor Erin's patriot land,<br/>
    Did Heav'n its ministry depute<br/>
        To save its favour'd land.<br/></p>
    <p>In Bantry's bold and rocky bay<br/>
        The hostile navy rode;<br/>
    And now the festal time arriv'd<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/>
        When earth beheld her God.<br/><br/>
    The impious crew with anxious eyes<br/>
        Gaz'd on each verdant plain<br/>
    And mock'd and scoff'd the holy hour<br/>
        With many a jest profane.<br/></p>
    <p>But sure such loud and angry winds<br/>
        Ne'er shook the seas before;<br/>
    Nor ever did the glaring skies<br/>
        In such deep thunder roar.<br/></p>
    <p>For thirteen nights and thirteen days<br/>
        The famish'd wretches strove,<br/>
    And some were wreck'd, and some despair<br/>
        Before the tempest drove.<br/></p>
    <p>Now ever praised be our God,<br/>
        Who sav'd us from their hand;<br/>
    And never more may foe presume<br/>
        To dare this Christian land.</p>
