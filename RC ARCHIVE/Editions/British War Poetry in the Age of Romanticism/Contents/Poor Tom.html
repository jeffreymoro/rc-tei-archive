    <p>1798.8<br/><b>Poor TOM</b><br/>
    “Peter Pindar”<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    [John Wolcot]<br/><i>The Scots Magazine</i>, LX (November 1798), pp. 771-772<br/><i>The Lady's Magazine</i>, XXIX (December 1798), p. 566<br/><i>The Courier</i> (January 8, 1799)<br/></p>
    <p>A Tale<br/></p>
    <p>From "Tales of the Hoy."<br/></p>
    <p>Now the rage of Battle ended<br/>
        And the French for mercy call;<br/>
    Death no more in smoke and thunder<br/>
        Rode upon the vengeful Ball.<br/></p>
    <p>Yet, what brave and loyal Heroes<br/>
        Saw the son of morning bright—<br/>
    Ah! condemn'd by cruel Fortune<br/>
        Ne'er to see the Star of Night.<br/></p>
    <p>From the main-deck to the quarter,<br/>
        Strew'd with limbs and wet with blood,<br/>
    Poor Tom Halliard, pale and wounded,<br/>
        Crawl'd where his brave Captain stood.<br/></p>
    <p>"O, my noble Captain! tell me<br/>
        Ere I'm borne a corpse away,<br/>
    Have I done a Seaman's duty<br/>
        On this great and glorious day?<br/></p>
    <p>"Tell a dying Sailor truly,<br/>
        For my life is fleeting fast;<br/>
    Have I done a Seaman's duty?<br/>
        Can there aught my mem'ry blast?"<br/></p>
    <p>"Ah! brave Tom!" the Captain answer'd,<br/>
        "Thou a Sailor's part hast done!<br/>
    I revere thy wounds with sorrow—<br/>
        Wounds by which our glory's won."<br/></p>
    <p>"Thanks, my Captain! life is ebbing<br/>
        Fast from this deep wounded heart;<br/>
    But, O grant one little favour.<br/>
        Ere I from the world depart.<br/><br/>
    "Bid some kind and trusty sailor,<br/>
        When I'm number'd with the dead,<br/>
    For my dear and constant Catharine<br/>
        Cut a lock from this poor head.<br/></p>
    <p>"Bid him to my Catharine give it,<br/>
        Saying, Her's alone I die!<br/>
    Kate will keep the mournful present,<br/>
        And embalm it with a sigh.<br/></p>
    <p>"Bid him too this letter bear her,—<br/>
        Which I've penn'd with panting breath:<br/>
    Kate may ponder on the writing<br/>
        When the hand is cold in death."<br/></p>
    <p>"That I will," reply'd the Captain,<br/>
        "And be ever Catherine's friend."<br/>
    "Ah! my good and kind Commander,<br/>
        Now my pains and sorrows end!"<br/></p>
    <p>Mute towards his Captain weeping,<br/>
        Tom uprais'd a thankful eye—<br/>
    Grateful then, his foot embracing,<br/>
        Sunk, with Kate on his last sigh!<br/></p>
    <p>Who, that saw a scene so mournful,<br/>
        Could without a tear depart?<br/>
    He must own a savage nature—<br/>
        Pity never warm'd his heart!<br/></p>
    <p>Now in his white hammock shrouded,<br/>
        By the kind and pensive Crew,<br/>
    As he dropp'd into the Ocean,<br/>
        All burst out—"Poor Tom, adieu!"</p>
