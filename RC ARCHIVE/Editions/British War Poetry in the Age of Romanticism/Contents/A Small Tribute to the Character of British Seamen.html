    <p>1810.12<br/><b>A Small Tribute to the Character of British Seamen</b><br/>
    “R. B.”<br/><i>The Poetical Magazine</i>, II (1810), pp. 139-142<br/></p>
    <p>Tho' heroes of Fancy oft furnish a theme<br/>
        For displaying the powers of verse,<br/>
    Of merit or valour let other men dream,<br/>
        Be it mine simple truths to rehearse:<br/>
    Not far shall I travel a subject to seek,<br/>
        No hero I'll bring from afar;<br/>
    My hero's mere name shall his merit bespeak—<br/>
        'Tis an honest and true British Tar.<br/></p>
    <p>When on the rough billows an insolent foe<br/>
        The battle tremendous provokes,<br/>
    With courage undaunted his spirit does glow,<br/>
        And at their loud thunder he jokes:<br/>
    Nought e'er can affright him tho' thick round his head<br/>
        The whizzing shot merciless fly!<br/>
    Tho' half the torn decks are besprinkled with dead,<br/>
        "Death or, victory!" still is his cry.<br/></p>
    <p>To knot the torn rigging he cheerily hies,<br/>
        Or steadily serves at his gun:<br/>
    If "Board" be the word, with his cutlass he flies,<br/>
        The foremost in danger to run:<br/>
    How dreadful the conflict! Death follows each blow!<br/>
        The enemy struggles in vain;<br/>
    Behold their red scuppers with streams overflow,<br/>
        And Britons the victory gain.<br/></p>
    <p>A lion in battle—nought e'er can withstand,<br/>
        His fury that dares to oppose,<br/>
    He fights for his Liberty, King, and his Land,<br/>
        And ruin dread hurls on their foes:<br/>
    Yet oft, when the din of contention was o'er,<br/>
        I've seen his bold visage adorn'd<br/>
    With a tear of compassion for those who before,<br/>
        When in arms, were the foes he had scorn'd.<br/></p>
    <p>If, urg'd by wild tempests, o'er mountainous waves,<br/>
        The vessel untractable sweeps;<br/>
    When landsmen see nothing but watery graves,<br/>
        The seaman still steadily keeps:<br/>
    Alert to his duty, tho' lightnings keen fly,<br/>
        He's true to his station on deck,<br/>
    Each well-fancy'd scheme of invention to try,<br/>
        And save his lov'd bark from a wreck.<br/><br/>
    "Away with the masts! quick, the wreck is all clear,"<br/>
        You hear him attentively call;—<br/>
    "All hands to the pumps, boys,—come, cheerly lads, cheer,—<br/>
        "Dear shipmates heave,—heave, one and all:<br/>
    "She lightens! she lightens! start, start boys, again,<br/>
        "The howling winds seem to abate;<br/>
    "A bowl of good grog shall soon banish our pain,<br/>
        "And we'll laugh at those chequers of Fate."<br/></p>
    <p>I've trac'd him when shipwreck'd, on many a shore,<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
        Thro' scenes that the soul might appal;<br/>
    Among serpents that hiss, or 'mid wild beasts that roar,<br/>
        Or men still more savage than all!<br/>
    I've seen him when hungry, when thirsty, and cold,<br/>
        Pale, naked, by Misery worn<br/>
    To life's lowest ebb; still intrepid and bold;<br/>
        Still with courage those ills he has borne.<br/></p>
    <p>From the wilds of Caffraria e'en to the poles,<br/>
        Such numberless evils await<br/>
    The life of a seaman, that those who have souls<br/>
        Must feel for their perilous state:<br/>
    For, happen what may, a true seaman ne'er shrinks,<br/>
        His pride is to rule on the main;<br/>
    And tho' boasting France still to humble him thinks,<br/>
        He'll foil her again and again.<br/></p>
    <p>I know he is wild in his manners on land,<br/>
        Accustom'd the ocean to range;<br/>
    His liberal heart sails too fast for his hand,<br/>
        He is thoughtless, oft simple, and strange:<br/>
    Yet say did he e'er see a shipmate distress'd,<br/>
        While his pocket with rhino<a href="#2">[2]</a> was stor'd,<br/>
    But the generous tar, with benevolence bless'd,<br/>
        Was delighted relief to afford?<br/></p>
    <p>In mirth and good humour there's none can compare<br/>
        With a seaman, when happy in port;<br/>
    He laughs at all perils, and banishes care,<br/>
        Is the life and the soul of each sport:<br/>
    Ye landsmen, who wish sterling merit to view,<br/>
        With me take a sociable trip;<br/>
    With me take a peep at the Albion's crew,<br/>
        You'll own they deserve such a ship.<br/><br/>
    Her timbers are sound, and her rigging is good,<br/>
        Her colours exultingly fly!<br/>
    But, thanks to her crew! who for ages have stood<br/>
        Firm to quarters, to conquer or die!<br/>
    Her standard's their glory; it floats on the wind,<br/>
        With triumph and victory crown'd!<br/>
    Throughout the whole world no such heroes you'll find—<br/>
        There ne'er was, nor e'er will be found.<br/></p>
