<blockquote>
<p>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, born 1798; died in London, 1st February 1851. She was the daughter of William Godwin, the author of <i>Caleb Williams</i>, &amp;c., and became the second wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley. During their residence on the banks of the Lake of Geneva in 1816, Byron, Shelley, and Mrs. Shelley agreed to beguile a rainy season by writing something in imitation of the weird German legends they had been reading. Mrs. Shelley produced <i>Frankenstein</i>, a romance, which, by its wildness and daring originality, obtained popularity at the date of its publication. She subsequently wrote: <i>Valperga</i>, or the Life and Adventures of Castruccio, Prince of Lucca; <i>Lodore</i>; <i>The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck</i>; <i>The Last Man</i>; <i>Falkner</i>-novels which are now little known. She also contributed to the annuals, &amp;c., and published an edition of the works of Shelley with biographical preface and notes. The following is a specimen of Mrs. Shelley's eerie powers of imagination. (III, 353)</p>
