<h2 align="center">SONNET.</h2>
<p align="center">by Sir Egerton Brydges, Bart.</p>
<p align="center">YEARS pass away; the worthy die, and leave<br/>
No successors their virtues to replace:<br/>
We win our way by trouble and by care;<br/>
Yet when 'tis past, it seems an arrow's flight.<br/>
For friends departed we are left to grieve,<br/>
And would again the course they ran, retrace;<br/>
For much that once was rugged, now seems fair<br/>
When memory clothes it with a soften'd light.<br/>
We cannot hope again; whence chilling age<br/>
Runs cold and feeble in our palsied veins;<br/>
No new affections will our hearts engage;<br/>
No sound of joyance in the distance reigns;<br/>
And when the cloud of darkness is before,<br/>
The rays behind us but afflict the more!</p>
