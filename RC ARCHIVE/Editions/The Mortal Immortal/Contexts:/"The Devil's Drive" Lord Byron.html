    <p>[1.]<br/>
    The Devil returned to Hell by two,<br/>
    And he stay'd at home till five,<br/>
    When he dined on some homicides done in <em>rago&#251;t</em>,<br/>
    With a rebel or so in an <em>Irish</em> stew--<br/>
    And sausages made of a selfslain Jew,<br/>
    And bethought himself what next to do--<br/>
    "And," quoth he, "I'll take a Drive.<br/>
    I walked in the morning--I'll ride tonight;<br/>
    In darkness my children take most delight,<br/>
    And I'll see how my favourites thrive.</p>
    <p>2.</p>
    <p>"And what shall I ride in," quoth Lucifer then?<br/>
    "If I followed my taste indeed,<br/>
    I should mount in a waggon of wounded men,<br/>
    And smile to see them bleed.<br/>
    But these will be furnished again and again,<br/>
    And at present my purpose is speed;<br/>
    To see of My manor as much as I may,<br/>
    And watch that no souls shall be poached away.</p>
    <p>3.</p>
    <p>"I have a state-coach at Carlton House,<br/>
    A chariot in Seymour place;<br/>
    But they're lent to two friends--who make me amends<br/>
    By driving my favourite pace;<br/>
    And they handle the reins with such a grace,<br/>
    I have something for both at the end of the race.</p>
    <p>4.</p>
    <p>"So now for the earth--to take my chance"--<br/>
    Then up to the earth sprung he,<br/>
    And making a jump from Moscow to France,<br/>
    He stepped across the Sea,<br/>
    And rested his hoof on a Turnpike road--<br/>
    No very great way from a Bishop's abode.</p>
    <p>5.</p>
    <p>But first as he flew, I forgot to say,<br/>
    That he hovered a moment upon his way<br/>
    To look upon Leipsic plain;<br/>
    And so sweet to his eye was its sulphury glare,<br/>
    And so soft to his ear was the cry of despair,<br/>
    That he perched on a Mountain of Slain;<br/>
    Then he gazed with delight from its growing height,<br/>
    Nor seldom on earth had he seen such a sight,<br/>
    Nor his work done half as well:<br/>
    For the field ran so red with the blood of the dead,<br/>
    That it blushed like the waves of Hell!<br/>
    Then loudly and wildly and long laughed he:<br/>
    "Methinks they have little need here of <em>Me</em>."</p>
    <p>6.</p>
    <p>Long he looked down on the hosts of each clime,<br/>
    While the warriors hand to hand were---<br/>
    Gaul---Austrian and Muscovite heroes sublime,<br/>
    And---(Muse of Fitzgerald arise with a rhyme!)<br/>
    A quantity of <em>Landwehr</em>!<br/>
    Gladness was there,<br/>
    For the men of all might and the monarchs of earth,<br/>
    Were met for the wolf and the worm to make mirth,<br/>
    And a feast for the fowls of the Air!</p>
    <p>7.</p>
    <p>But he turned aside and looked from the ridge<br/>
    Of hills along the river,<br/>
    And the best thing he saw was a broken bridge,<br/>
    Which a Corporal chose to shiver;<br/>
    Though an Emperor's taste was displeased with his haste,<br/>
    The Devil he thought it clever;<br/>
    And he laughed again in a lighter strain,<br/>
    O'er the torrent swoln and rainy,<br/>
    When he saw "on a fiery horse" Prince Pon,<br/>
    In taking care of Number <em>One</em>---<br/>
    Get drowned with a great <em>many</em>!</p>
    <p>8.</p>
    <p>But the softest note that soothed his ear<br/>
    Was the sound of a widow's sighing;<br/>
    And the sweetest sight was the icy tear,<br/>
    Which Horror froze in the blue eye clear<br/>
    Of a maid by her lover lying---<br/>
    As round her fell her long fair hair,<br/>
    And she looked to Heaven with that frenzied air<br/>
    Which seemed to ask if a God were there!<br/>
    And stretched by the wall of a ruined hut,<br/>
    With its hollow cheek, and eyes half shut,<br/>
    A child of Famine dying:<br/>
    And the carnage <em>begun</em>, when <em>resistance</em> is done,<br/>
    And the fall of the vainly flying!</p>
    <p>9.</p>
    <p>Then he gazed on a town by besiegers taken,<br/>
    Nor cared he who were winning;<br/>
    But he saw an old maid, for years forsaken,<br/>
    Get up and leave her spinning;<br/>
    And she looked in her glass, and to one that did pass,<br/>
    She said---"pray are the rapes beginning?"</p>
    <p>10.</p>
    <p>But the Devil has reached our cliffs so white,<br/>
    And what did he there, I pray?<br/>
    If his eyes were good, he but saw by night<br/>
    What we see every day;<br/>
    But he made a tour and kept a journal<br/>
    Of all the wondrous sights nocturnal,<br/>
    And he sold it in shares to the <em>Men</em> of the <em>Row</em>,<br/>
    Who bid pretty well---but they <em>cheated</em> him, though!</p>
    <p>11.</p>
    <p>The Devil first saw, as he thought, the <em>Mail</em>,<br/>
    Its coachman and his coat;<br/>
    So instead of a pistol he cocked his tail,<br/>
    And seized him by the throat;<br/>
    "Aha!" quoth he, "what have we here?<br/>
    'T is a new barouche, and an ancient peer!"</p>
    <p>12.</p>
    <p>So he sat him on his box again,<br/>
    And bade him have no fear,<br/>
    But be true to his club, and staunch to his rein,<br/>
    His brothel and his beer;<br/>
    "Next to seeing a Lord at the Council board,<br/>
    I would rather see him <i>here</i>."</p>
    <p>13.</p>
    <p>Then Satan hired a horse and gig<br/>
    With promises of pay;<br/>
    And he pawned his horns for a spruce new wig,<br/>
    To redeem as he came away:<br/>
    And he whistled some tune, a waltz or a jig,<br/>
    And drove off at the close of day.</p>
    <p>14.</p>
    <p>The first place he stopped at---he heard the Psalm<br/>
    That rung from a Methodist Chapel:<br/>
    "'T is the best sound I've heard," quoth he, "since my palm<br/>
    Presented Eve her apple!<br/>
    When <em>Faith</em> is all, 't is an excellent sign,<br/>
    That the <em>Works</em> and Workmen both are mine."</p>
    <p>15.</p>
    <p>He passed Tommy Tyrwhitt, that standing jest,<br/>
    To princely wit a Martyr:<br/>
    But the last joke of all was by far the best,<br/>
    When he sailed away with "the Garter"!<br/>
    "And"---quoth Satan---"this Embassy's worthy my sight,<br/>
    Should I see nothing else to amuse me tonight.<br/>
    With no one to bear it, but Thomas &#224; Tyrwhitt,<br/>
    This ribband belongs to an 'Order of Merit'!"</p>
    <p>16.</p>
    <p>He stopped at an Inn and stepped within<br/>
    The Bar and read the "Times;"<br/>
    And never such a treat, as---the epistle of one "Vetus,"<br/>
    Had he found save in downright crimes:<br/>
    "Though I doubt if this drivelling encomiast of War<br/>
    Ever saw a field fought, or felt a scar,<br/>
    Yet his fame shall go farther than he can guess,<br/>
    For I'll keep him a place in my <em>hottest Press</em>;<br/>
    And his works shall be bound in Morocco <em>d'Enfer</em>,<br/>
    And lettered behind with his <em>Nom de Guerre</em>."</p>
    <p>17.</p>
    <p><br/>
    The Devil gat next to Westminster,<br/>
    And he turned to "the room" of the Commons;<br/>
    But he heard as he purposed to enter in there,<br/>
    That "the Lords" had received a summons;<br/>
    And he thought, as "a <em>quondam</em> Aristocrat,"<br/>
    He might peep at the Peers, though to <em>hear</em> them were flat;<br/>
    And he walked up the House so like one of his own,<br/>
    That they say that he stood pretty near the throne.</p>
    <p>18.</p>
    <p>He saw the Lord Liverpool seemingly wise,<br/>
    The Lord Westmoreland certainly silly,<br/>
    And Jockey of Norfolk---a man of some size---<br/>
    And Chatham, so like his friend Billy;<br/>
    And he saw the tears in Lord Eldon's eyes,<br/>
    Because the Catholics would <em>not</em> rise,<br/>
    In spite of his prayers and his prophecies;<br/>
    And he heard---which set Satan himself a staring---<br/>
    A certain Chief Justice say something like <em>swearing</em>.<br/>
    And the Devil was shocked---and quoth he, "I must go,<br/>
    For I find we have much better manners below.<br/>
    If thus he harangues when he passes my border,<br/>
    I shall hint to friend Moloch to call him to order."</p>
    <p>19.</p>
    <p>Then the Devil went down to the humbler House,<br/>
    Where he readily found his way<br/>
    As natural to him as its hole to a Mouse,<br/>
    He had been there many a day;<br/>
    And many a vote and soul and job he<br/>
    Had bid for and carried away from the Lobby:<br/>
    But there now was a "call" and accomplished debaters<br/>
    Appeared in the glory of hats, boots and gaiters---<br/>
    <em>Some</em> paid rather more---but <em>all</em> worse dressed than Waiters!</p>
    <p>20.</p>
    <p>There was Canning for War, and Whitbread for peace,<br/>
    And others as suited their fancies;<br/>
    But all were agreed that our debts should increase<br/>
    Excepting the Demagogue <i>Francis</i>.<br/>
    That rogue! how could Westminster send him again<br/>
    To leaven the virtue of these honest men!<br/>
    But the Devil remained till the Break of Day<br/>
    Blushed upon Sleep and Lord Castlereagh:<br/>
    Then up half the house got, and Satan got up<br/>
    With the drowsy to snore---or the hungry to sup:---<br/>
    But so torpid the power of some speakers, 't is said,<br/>
    That they sent even him to his brimstone bed.</p>
    <p>21.</p>
    <p>He had seen George Rose---but George was grown dumb,<br/>
    And only lied in thought!<br/>
    And the Devil has all the pleasure to come<br/>
    Of hearing him talk as he ought.<br/>
    With the falsest of tongues, the sincerest of men---<br/>
    His veracity were but deceit---<br/>
    And Nature must first have unmade him again,<br/>
    Ere his breast or his face, or his tongue, or his pen,<br/>
    Conceived---uttered---looked---or wrote down letters ten,<br/>
    Which Truth would acknowledge complete.</p>
    <p>22.</p>
    <p><br/>
    Satan next took the army list in hand,<br/>
    Where he found a new "Field Marshal;"<br/>
    And when he saw this high command<br/>
    Conferred on his Highness of Cumberland,<br/>
    "Oh! were I prone to cavil---or were I not the Devil,<br/>
    I should say this was somewhat partial;<br/>
    Since the only wounds that this Warrior gat,<br/>
    Were from God knows whom---and the Devil knows what!"</p>
    <p>23.</p>
    <p>He then popped his head in a royal Ball,<br/>
    And saw all the Haram so hoary;<br/>
    And who there besides but Corinna de Sta&#235;l!<br/>
    Turned Methodist and Tory!<br/>
    "Aye---Aye"---quoth he---"'t is the way with them all,<br/>
    When Wits grow tired of Glory:<br/>
    But thanks to the weakness, that thus could pervert her,<br/>
    Since the dearest of prizes to me's a deserter:<br/>
    <em>Mem</em>---whenever a sudden conversion I want,<br/>
    To send to the school of Philosopher Kant;<br/>
    And whenever I need a critic who can gloss over<br/>
    All faults---to send for Mackintosh to write up the Philosopher."</p>
    <p>24.</p>
    <p>The Devil waxed faint at the sight of this Saint,<br/>
    And he thought himself of eating;<br/>
    And began to cram from a plate of ham<br/>
    Wherewith a Page was retreating---<br/>
    Having nothing else to do (for "the friends" each so near<br/>
    Had sold all their souls long before),<br/>
    As he swallowed down the bacon he wished himself a Jew<br/>
    For the sake of another crime more:<br/>
    For Sinning itself is but half a recreation,<br/>
    Unless it ensures most infallible Damnation.</p>
    <p>25.</p>
    <p>But he turned him about, for he heard a sound<br/>
    Which even his ear found faults in;<br/>
    For whirling above---underneath---and around---<br/>
    Were his fairest Disciples Waltzing!<br/>
    And quoth he---"though this be---the <em>premier pas</em> to me,<br/>
    Against it I would warn all---<br/>
    Should I introduce these revels among my younger devils,<br/>
    They would all turn perfectly carnal:<br/>
    And though fond of the flesh---yet I never could bear it<br/>
    Should quite in my kingdom get the upper hand of <i>Spirit</i>."</p>
    <p>26.</p>
    <p>The Devil (but't was over) had been vastly glad<br/>
    To see the new Drury Lane,<br/>
    And yet he might have been rather mad<br/>
    To see it rebuilt in vain; <a name="Hit1" id="Hit1"><br/>
    And had he beheld their "Nourjahad,"</a><br/>
    Would never have gone again:<br/>
    And Satan had taken it much amiss,<br/>
    They should fasten such a piece on a friend of his---<br/>
    Though he knew that his works were somewhat sad,<br/>
    He never had deemed them <em>quite</em> so bad:<br/>
    For this was "the book" which, of yore, Job, sorely smitten,<br/>
    Said, "Oh that <em>mine</em> enemy, <em>mine</em> enemy had written"!</p>
    <p>27.</p>
    <p>Then he found sixty scribblers in separate cells,<br/>
    And marvelled what they were doing,<br/>
    For they looked like little fiends in their own little hells,<br/>
    Damnation for others brewing---<br/>
    Though their paper seemed to shrink, from the heat of their ink,<br/>
    They were only <em>coolly</em> reviewing!<br/>
    And as one of them wrote down the pronoun "<em>We</em>,"<br/>
    "That Plural"---says Satan---"means <em>him</em> and <em>me</em>,<br/>
    With the Editor added to make up the three<br/>
    Of our Athanasian Trinity,<br/>
    And render the believers in our '<i>Articles</i>' sensible,<br/>
    How many must combine to make <em>one</em> Incomprehensible"!</p>
