    of a Young Man that would Read Unlawful Books, and how he was Punished'</h2>

    <p>CORNELIUS AGRIPPA went out one day;<br/>
    His study he lock'd ere he went away,<br/>
    And he gave the key of the door to his wife,<br/>
    And charged her to keep it lock'd on her life.</p>
    <p>"And if any one ask my Study to see,<br/>
    I charge you to trust them not with the key;<br/>
    Whoever may beg, and entreat, and implore,<br/>
    On your life let nobody enter that door."</p>
    <p>There lived a young man in the house, who in vain<br/>
    Access to that Study had sought to obtain;<br/>
    And he begg'd and pray'd the books to see,<br/>
    Till the foolish woman gave him the key.</p>
    <p>On the Study-table a book there lay,<br/>
    Which Agrippa himself had been reading that day;<br/>
    The letters were written with blood therein,<br/>
    And the leaves were made of dead men's skin;-</p>
    <p>And these horrible leaves of magic between<br/>
    Were the ugliest pictures that ever were seen,<br/>
    The likeness of things so foul to behold,<br/>
    That what they were is not fit to be told.</p>
    <p>The young man he began to read<br/>
    He knew not what; but he would proceed,<br/>
    When there was heard a sound at the door<br/>
    Which, as he read on, grew more and more.</p>
    <p>And more and more the knocking grew;<br/>
    The young man knew not what to do;<br/>
    But, trembling, in fear he sat within,<br/>
    Till the door was broke, and the Devil came in.</p>
    <p>Two hideous horns on his head he had got,<br/>
    Like iron heated nine times red-hot;<br/>
    The breath of his nostrils was brimstone blue,<br/>
    And his tail like a fiery serpent grew.</p>
    <p>"What wouldst thou with me?" the Wicked One cried,<br/>
    But not a word the young man replied;<br/>
    Every hair on his head was standing upright,<br/>
    And his limbs like a palsy shook with affright.</p>
    <p>"What wouldst thou with me?" cried the Author of ill;<br/>
    But the wretched young man was silent still;<br/>
    Not a word had his lips the power to say,<br/>
    And his marrow seem'd to be melting away.</p>
    <p>"What wouldst thou with me?" the third time he cries,<br/>
    And a flash of lightning came from his eyes,<br/>
    And he lifted his griffin claw in the air,<br/>
    And the young man had not strength for a prayer.</p>
    <p>His eyes red fire and fury dart<br/>
    As out he tore the young man's heart;<br/>
    He grinn'd a horrible grin at his prey;<br/>
    And in a clap of thunder vanish'd away.</p>
    <p>THE MORAL</p>
    <p>Henceforth let all young men take heed<br/>
    How in a Conjurer's books they read.</p>
