<p align="center">Letter III. From Miss Fanny Fudge, to her Cousin, Miss Kitty ---</p>
<p align="center">by <a href="/editions/mws/immortal/bibliography.html#Moore">Thomas Moore</a> (641-643)</p>

<p align="center">STANZAS (ENCLOSED) TO MY SHADOW;<br/>
OR, WHY?---WHAT?---HOW?</p>
<p>Dark comrade of my path! While earth and sky<br/>
Thus wed their charms, in bridal light array'd,<br/>
Why in this bright hour, walk'st thou ever nigh,<br/>
Blackening my footsteps with thy length of shade---<br/>
Dark comrade, Why?</p>
<p>Thou mimic Shape that, mid these flowery scenes,<br/>
Glidest beside me o'er each sunny spot,<br/>
Sadd'ning them as thou goest---say, what means<br/>
So dark an adjunct to so bright a lot---<br/>
Grim goblin, What?</p>
<p>Still, as to pluck sweet flowers I bend my brow,<br/>
Thou bendest, too---then risest when I rise;---<br/>
Say, mute mysterious Thing! how is't that thou<br/>
Thus com'st between me and those blessed skies---<br/>
Dim shadow, How?</p>
<p align="center">(ADDITIONAL STANZA, BY ANOTHER HAND)</p>
<p><br/>
Thus said I to that Shape, far less in grudge<br/>
Than gloom of soul; while, as I eager cried,<br/>
Oh Why? What? How?---a Voice, that one might judge<br/>
To be some Irish echo's, faint replied,<br/>
Oh fudge, fudge, fudge!</p>
<p>You have here, dearest Coz, my last lyric effusion;<br/>
And, with it, that odious "additional stanza,"<br/>
Which Aunt <em>will</em> insist I must keep, as conclusion,<br/>
And which, you'll <em>at once</em> see, is Mr. Magan's;---a<br/>
Most cruel and dark-design'd extravaganza,<br/>
And part of that plot in which he and my Aunt are<br/>
To stifle the flights of my genius by banter.</p>
<p><br/>
Just so 'twas with Byron's young eagle-ey'd strain,<br/>
Just so did they taunt him;---but vain, critics, vain<br/>
All your efforts to saddle Wit's fire with a chain!<br/>
To blot out the splendour of Fancy's young stream,<br/>
Or crop, in its cradle, her newly-fledg'd beam!!!<br/>
Thou perceiv'st, dear, that, ev'n while these lines I indite,<br/>
Thoughts burn, brilliant fancies break out, wrong or right,<br/>
And I'm all over poet, in Criticism's spite!</p>
<p>That my Aunt, who deals only in Psalms, and regards<br/>
Messrs. Sternhold and Co. as the first of all bards---<br/>
That <em>she</em> should make light of my works I can't blame;<br/>
But that nice, handsome, odious Magan---what a shame!<br/>
Do you know, dear, that, high as on most points I rate him,<br/>
I'm really afraid---after all, I---<em>must</em> hate him.<br/>
He is <em>so</em> provoking---nought's safe from his tongue;<br/>
He spares no one authoress, ancient or young.<br/>
<a name="Hit1" id="Hit1">Were you Sappho herself, and in Keepsake</a> or Bijou<br/>
Once shone as contributor, Lord how he'd quiz you!<br/>
He laughs at <em>all</em> Monthlies---I've actually seen<br/>
A sneer on his brow at the Court Magazine!---<br/>
While of Weeklies, poor things, there's but one he peruses,<br/>
And buys every book which that Weekly abuses.<br/>
But I care not how others such sarcasm may fear,<br/>
<em>One</em> spirit, at least, will not bend to his sneer;<br/>
And though tried by the fire, my young genius shall burn as<br/>
Uninjured as crucified gold in the furnace!<br/>
(I suspect the word "crucified" must be made "crucible,"<br/>
Before this fine image of mine is producible.)</p>
<p>And now, dear---to tell you a secret which, pray<br/>
Only trust to such friends as with safety you may---<br/>
You know, and, indeed the whole county suspects<br/>
(Though the Editor often my best things rejects),<br/>
That the verses signed <em>so</em>, <a name="anchor1" id="anchor1"> </a><a href="#(1)">(1)</a>, which you now and then see<br/>
In our County Gazette (vide <em>last</em>) are by me.<br/>
But 'tis dreadful to think what provoking mistakes<br/>
The vile country Press in one's prosody makes.<br/>
For you know, dear---I may, without vanity, hint---<br/>
Though an angel should write, still 'tis <em>devils</em> must print;<br/>
And you can't think what havoc these demons sometimes<br/>
Choose to make of one's sense, and what's worse, of one's rhymes.<br/>
But a week or two since, in my Ode upon Spring,<br/>
Which I <em>meant</em> to have made a most beautiful thing,<br/>
Where I talk'd of the "dewdrops from freshly-blown roses,"<br/>
The nasty things made it "from freshly-blown noses!"<br/>
And once when, to please my cross Aunt, I had tried<br/>
To commem'rate some saint of her <em>clique</em>, who'd just died,<br/>
Having said he "had tak'n up in heav'n his position,"<br/>
They made it, he'd "tak'n up to heav'n his physician!"</p>
<p>This is very disheartening;---but brighter days shine,<br/>
I rejoice, love, to say, both for me and the Nine;<br/>
For, what do you think?---so delightful! next year,<br/>
Oh, prepare, dearest girl, for the grand news prepare--- <a name="Hit2" id="Hit2"><br/>
I'm to write in the Keepsake---yes, Kitty, my dear,<br/>
To write in the Keepsake</a>, as sure as you're there!!<br/>
T'other night, at a Ball, 'twas my fortunate chance<br/>
With a very nice elderly Dandy to dance,<br/>
Who, 'twas plain, from some hints which I now and then caught,<br/>
Was the author of <em>something</em>---one couldn't tell what;<br/>
But his satisfied manner left no room to doubt<br/>
It was something that Colburn had lately brought out.</p>
<p>We convers'd of <em>belles-lettres</em> through all the quadrille,---<br/>
Of poetry, dancing, of prose, standing still;<br/>
Talk'd of Intellect's march---whether right 'twas or wrong---<br/>
And then settled the point in a bold <em>en avant</em>.<br/>
In the course of this talk 'twas that, having just hinted<br/>
That I too had Poems which---long'd to be printed,<br/>
He protested, kind man! he had seen, at first sight, <a name="Hit3" id="Hit3"><br/>
I was actually <em>born</em> in the Keepsake</a> to write.<br/>
"In the Annals of England let some," he said, "shine,<br/>
"But a place in her Annuals, Lady, be thine! <a name="Hit4" id="Hit4"><br/>
"Even now future Keepsakes</a> seem brightly to rise,<br/>
"Through the vista of years, as I gaze on those eyes,---<br/>
"All letter'd and press'd, and of large-paper size!"<br/>
How unlike that Magan, who my genius would smother,<br/>
And how we, true geniuses, find out each other!</p>
<p>This, and much more he said, with that fine frenzied glance<br/>
One so rarely now sees, as we slid through the dance;<br/>
Till between us 'twas finally fix'd that, next year,<br/>
In this exquisite task I my pen should engage;<br/>
And, at parting, he stoop'd down and lisp'd in my ear<br/>
These mystical words, which I could but <em>just</em> hear,<br/>
"Terms for rhyme---if it's <em>prime</em>---ten and sixpence per page."<br/>
Think, Kitty, my dear, if I heard his words right,<br/>
What a mint of half-guineas this small head contains;<br/>
If for nothing to write is itself a delight,<br/>
Ye Gods, what a bliss to be paid for one's strains!</p>
<p>Having dropp'd the dear fellow a court'sy profound,<br/>
Off at once, to inquire all about him, I ran;<br/>
And from what I could learn, do you know, dear, I've found<br/>
That he's quite a new species of lit'rary man;<br/>
One, whose task is---to what will not fashion accustom us?---<br/>
To <em>edite</em> live authors, as if they were posthumous.<br/>
For instance---the plan, to be sure, is the oddest!---<br/>
If any young he or she author feels modest<br/>
In venturing abroad, this kind gentleman-usher<br/>
Lends promptly a hand to the int'resting blusher;<br/>
Indites a smooth Preface, brings merit to light,<br/>
Which else might, by accident, shrink out of sight,<br/>
And, in short, renders readers and critics polite.<br/>
My Aunt says---though scarce on such points one can credit her---<br/>
He was Lady Jane Thingumbob's last novel's editor.<br/>
'Tis certain the fashion's but newly invented;<br/>
And, quick as the change of all things and all names is,<br/>
Who knows but, as authors, like girls, are <em>presented</em>,<br/>
We, girls, may be <em>edited</em> soon at St. James's?</p>
<p>I must now close my letter---there's Aunt, in full screech,<br/>
Wants to take me to hear some great Irvingite preach.<br/>
God forgive me, I'm not much inclined, I must say,<br/>
To go and sit still to be preach'd at, to-day.<br/>
And, besides---'twill be all against dancing, no doubt,<br/>
Which my poor Aunt abhors, with such hatred devout,<br/>
That, so far from presenting young nymphs with a head,<br/>
For their skill in the dance, as of Herod is said,<br/>
She'd wish their own heads in the platter, instead.<br/>
There, again---coming, Ma'am!---I'll write more, if I can,<br/>
Before the post goes,</p>
<p>Your affectionate Fan.</p>
<p align="center"><em>Four o'clock.</em></p>
<p>Such a sermon!---though <em>not</em> about dancing, my dear;<br/>
'Twas only on the' end of the world being near.<br/>
Eighteen Hundred and Forty's the year that some state<br/>
As the time for that accident---some Forty Eight: <a name="anchor2" id="anchor2"> </a><a href="#(2)">(2)</a><br/>
And I own, of the two, I'd prefer much the latter,<br/>
As then I shall be an old maid, and 'two'n't matter.<br/>
Once more, love, good-bye---I've to make a new cap;<br/>
But am now so dead tired with this horrid mishap<br/>
Of the end of the world, that I <em>must</em> take a nap.</p>
