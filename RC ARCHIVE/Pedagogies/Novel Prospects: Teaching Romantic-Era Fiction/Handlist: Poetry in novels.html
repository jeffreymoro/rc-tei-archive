<p align="left">Please note that this is not an exhaustive list and that for the purposes of the course, I include excerpts from Shakespearean drama among the poems. Most of the texts listed below are identified in the modern edited versions of the class novels listed on the syllabus. Full texts can be found in <em>The Columbia Granger's World of Poetry</em> database, published by Columbia University Press, and the <em>English Poetry Database,</em> published by Chadwyck-Healy, as well as in numerous print collections. Both of the databases include search engines that are invaluable for the research in this course.</p>
