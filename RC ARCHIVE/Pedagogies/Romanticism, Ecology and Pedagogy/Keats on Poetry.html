    Class handout</h3>
    <p>"The cliff of poesy towers above me."</p>
    <p>"I read and write about 8 hours a day."</p>
    <p>"The faint conceptions I have of poems to come brings the blood frequently into my forehead."</p>
    <p>"I find that I cannot exist without poetry&#8212;half the day will not do&#8212;I had become all in a tremble from not having written anything of late."</p>
    <p>"I live under an everlasting restraint&#8212;never relieved except when composing."</p>
    <p>"I have been very idle lately, very averse to writing: both from the overpowering idea of our dead poets and from abatement of my love of fame&#8212;I hope I am a little more of a Philosopher than I was, consequently a little less of a versifying pet lamb."</p>
    <p>"I never wrote one single line of poetry with the least shadow of public thought."</p>
    <p>"That which is creative must create itself."</p>
    <p>"The poet by one cup should know the scope of any particular wine without getting intoxicated."</p>
    <p>"If a sparrow come before my window I take part in its existence and pick about the gravel."</p>
    <p>"I lay awake last night&#8212;listening to the rain with a sense of being drown&#8217;d and rotted like a grain of wheat."</p>
    <p>"Let us open our leaves like a flower and be passive and receptive."</p>
    <p>Dilke is "a man who cannot feel he has a personal identity unless he has made up his mind about everything. The only means of strengthening one&#8217;s intellect is to make up one&#8217;s mind about nothing&#8212;to let the mind be a thoroughfare for all thoughts. Dilke will never come at a truth as long as he lives because he is always trying at it."</p>
