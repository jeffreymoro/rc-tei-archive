    </div>
    <p>This volume of <i>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</i> includes an editor's introduction and an essay by <a href="#hewitt">Regina Hewitt</a>, as well as essays by <a href="#mclean">Thomas McLean</a>, <a href="#hale">Robert C. Hale</a>, <a href="#brewer">William D. Brewer</a>, and <a href="#purinton">Marjean D. Purinton</a>.</p>
    <p>This volume contextualizes work by and work about Joanna Baillie with respect to revisionist thinking about utopianism. Since utopianism has become a positively valued concept within sociological, legal, and other fields, its implications for an understanding of Baillie's approach to social change/social problems, as well as for an understanding of scholarship recovering Baillie for contemporary purposes, deserve to be explored.</p>

    <h3 align="center">About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</h3>
    <p>The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>
