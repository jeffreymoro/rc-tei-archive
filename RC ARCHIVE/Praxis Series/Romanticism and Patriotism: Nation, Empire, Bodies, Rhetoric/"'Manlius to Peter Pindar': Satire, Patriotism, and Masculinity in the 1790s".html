                <p>In the summer of 2004, spokesmen for the Bush
                administration did not refer to Michael Moore as "a
                bloated mass, a gross, blood-bolter&rsquo;d clod" who
                "spunge[d] on dirty whores for dirty bread" (Gifford
                lines 67, 124). They did not exactly call him a
                "scourge of society . . . polluted with vanity,
                cowardice, and avarice" (Albion 12), nor did they mask
                their ad hominem attacks behind patriotic pseudonyms
                such as "Manlius" or "Albion." Moore&rsquo;s detractors
                in the White House concealed neither their identities
                nor their actual ignorance of his work, including the
                new film that provoked them, <em>Fahrenheit 9/11</em>.
                Patriotic pseudonyms did play a significant role in
                conservative attacks on Moore&rsquo;s Georgian
                predecessor John Wolcot, alias Peter Pindar
                (1738-1819), but his detractors nonetheless tended to
                ground their charges on a thorough knowledge of his
                popular satires. From at least 1787 until well after
                1800, these numerous polemicists, sometimes employed
                directly by the government, attacked Wolcot&rsquo;s
                patriotism by questioning his manhood. Like
                Moore&rsquo;s work in some ways, Wolcot&rsquo;s
                anti-monarchical satire brought more outrageous and yet
                more accurate criticism of the government before a
                larger public than any comparable work. His
                critics&rsquo; retaliation could be compared to such
                recent works as <em>Michael Moore Hates America</em>
                and <em>Michael Moore is a Big, Fat, Stupid White
                Man</em>. As their epithets attest, Wolcot&rsquo;s
                opponents similarly emphasized his corpulent body and
                his deviant masculinity, made more dangerous by its
                challenge to a militarized culture and the exalted
                masculinity of a wartime leader. Moore&rsquo;s claim to
                be a patriot is especially offensive to the right, and
                Wolcot too presented himself as a member of the loyal
                opposition; but the term "patriotism" (or
                "unpatriotic") is more rarely applied to Wolcot because
                its sense has shifted along with the composition of the
                body politic.<a href=
                "#note1">[1]</a>
                What we might call unpatriotic in Wolcot&rsquo;s satire
                appeared instead as libel, sedition, and blasphemy,
                especially when he targeted the royal body of George
                III.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Wolcot, as Pindar, politicized the King&rsquo;s
                corporeal masculinity and thereby invited attack on his
                own. Clearly relishing the verbal combat, Wolcot set
                forth a grossly embodied masculinity as a condition of
                the genuine political agency he opposed to the
                bloodless, moralistic loyalism inculcated under the
                government of William Pitt. The difference between
                these two opposing forms of masculine patriotism, I
                will argue, corresponds to the rift between the
                king&rsquo;s two bodies exploited by Wolcot&rsquo;s
                satires. At the same time, Wolcot&rsquo;s poetry
                promoted a conflict that allowed both sides to taste
                the libidinal pleasures of patriotic struggle: he
                became the focal point of scatological and sodomitic
                fantasies as well as attempts to politicize sexual
                morality. Wolcot&rsquo;s many satirical antagonists
                used his own ribald persona more or less skillfully
                against him to unman or infantilize the robust social
                critic implied as the author of his satires. William
                Gifford of the <em>Anti-Jacobin Review</em> dismissed
                the "filthy drivel of this impotent dotard" (11) as
                sexual wish-fulfillment, adding more than twenty years
                to Wolcot&rsquo;s real age in an elaborate attack in
                verse. "Manlius," in the pages of the
                <em>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</em>, took Wolcot to
                task as "foremost among the enemies of Royalty" and
                condemned the unmanly sentiments of a poet who could
                lampoon a monarch recently recovered from madness
                (1044). Ironically, however, Wolcot himself continually
                upbraided George for failures of manly sentiment:
                sometimes selling thousands of copies a day,
                Wolcot&rsquo;s lampoons gleefully ridiculed the
                King&rsquo;s stutter, his vulgar social and natural
                curiosity, his taste for castrati, his failings as a
                father, and his politically obnoxious avarice.<a href=
                "#note2">[2]</a>
                In a similar vein, Wolcot dismissed the natural history
                of George&rsquo;s favorite Sir Joseph Banks as "well
                suited to the idle hour of some old maid," not fit for
                "men who labour . . . with a Titan mind" for the
                benefit of humanity (<em>Works</em> 235).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The political satire of Wolcot and his critics
                dramatizes the political charge of sexual deviance.
                Today&rsquo;s Georgians, like the
                <em>Anti-Jacobin</em>, seem to have claimed "the
                manlier virtues, such as nerv&rsquo;d / Our
                fathers&rsquo; breasts" for themselves (Canning 326).
                In this view, the satirist&rsquo;s vitiated manhood is
                the unmistakable symptom of his treasonous intent. At
                the same time, the success of Wolcot&rsquo;s sharp
                attacks on the King and the Pitt government depended in
                no small part on his own ability to construct highly
                politicized definitions of masculinity. For both sides,
                then, sexual deviance is political deviance. Though
                currently the right seems to control this equation, the
                right-wing bloggers&rsquo; obscene conflations of
                Moore&rsquo;s personal and political manhood, his body
                and his work, betray a complex and unstable ideological
                foundation informed by the politics of the 1790s. I
                won&rsquo;t begin to speculate about the
                bloggers&rsquo; frequent recourse to homophobic
                epithets and images in their attacks on Moore, but the
                charge of sodomy also curiously frames Wolcot&rsquo;s
                career in the prose and verse of his detractors. In
                March 1789 the <em>Times</em> reported, in brief,
                oblique installments, that a scullion from the royal
                kitchens had been caught in flagrante delicto with
                Peter Pindar in the Birdcage Walk. This
                charge&mdash;probably because it was spurious&mdash;lay
                dormant for eleven years until Gifford introduced it in
                the prose apparatus to his Epistle to Peter Pindar.
                Gifford&rsquo;s attack is also the most vehement and
                elaborate of the dozens I have read, and for some
                readers it sank Wolcot&rsquo;s reputation for good.
                Previous critics had tended to concentrate on other
                vices&mdash;Peter&rsquo;s obesity, his promiscuity
                and/or impotence, drunkenness, irreverence, and
                propensity to libel and falsehood. Gifford&rsquo;s
                willingness to air eleven-year-old dirty laundry may
                reflect a new level of investment in professional
                literary authority of the kind that Michael Gamer
                describes in his recent reading of Gifford&rsquo;s
                <em>Baviad</em>: "For Gifford . . . [the publisher
                John] Bell&rsquo;s attempts to repackage Della Cruscan
                verse into high cultural artifacts amounted to multiple
                usurpations of literary authority" (48). Wolcot&rsquo;s
                commercial success in the arena of political satire may
                well have been similarly threatening. In its virulence
                Gifford&rsquo;s attack on Wolcot also consolidates a
                decade&rsquo;s worth of increasing intolerance, of ever
                tighter strictures on patriotism and masculinity.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Wolcot began his career with a confident control of
                masculinity enabled by his robust opposition
                patriotism, a mode the 1790s did much to circumscribe.
                From 1782-87 he produced much of his best-known work:
                four sets of annual odes to the Royal Academicians, two
                satires on Boswell&rsquo;s <em>Life of Johnson</em>,
                and his first satires on George III, including the
                first two cantos of his mock-epic, <em>The
                Lousiad</em>.<a href=
                "#note3">[3]</a>
                Wolcot&rsquo;s masculinity in these works is prominent,
                yet hard to classify. Persistent attempts to dismiss
                him as a hireling of the Foxite Whigs were confounded
                by his openly declared Toryism and eventually by his
                rebukes to Thomas Paine and occasional anti-Gallic
                fervor. Neither the patriarchal model of chivalric
                manhood as retailed to the middle classes by Edmund
                Burke, nor the fraternal, unstable identity derived
                from the man of feeling&mdash;two possibilities
                outlined by Tim Fulford&mdash;seem to fit Wolcot,
                though at times he seems close to the virile populism
                of William Cobbett, identified by Fulford as the source
                of the anxiety that drove Coleridge back to Burke in
                later years (ch. 5). In his <em>Epistle to James
                Boswell</em>, Wolcot skewers Boswell for retailing
                biographical trivialities, a sign of puerile
                hero-worship as well as the cognitive myopia that
                Wolcot is quick to condemn in many of his victims,
                including the king and Joseph Banks. In the more
                carnivalesque <em>Bozzy and Piozzi, a Town
                Eclogue</em>, Boswell is simply a drunk and a puppy,
                and Wolcot identifies more explicitly with the
                impatient paternal authority of Johnson himself. The
                same manly Johnsonian independence enables him, as an
                art critic, to puncture the stylistic mannerisms of
                each year&rsquo;s Royal Academy pictures, yet this
                attitude is fractured by his own puppyish admiration of
                Joshua Reynolds, who is always exempted from these
                criticisms. In his political poetry Wolcot&rsquo;s
                eccentric masculinity takes on the important
                connotation of non-partisanship: "Know, I&rsquo;ve not
                caught the itch of party sin. / To Fox, or Pitt, I
                never did belong" (<em>Works</em> 278), he instructs
                Thomas Warton in <em>Ode upon Ode</em> (1787).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Wolcot&rsquo;s propensity to "lose the monarch in
                the man," as one poetical adversary put it ("The Two
                Pindars"), began with <em>The Lousiad</em>, in which
                the King declares war on his entire kitchen staff,
                ordering their heads shaved in his presence after he
                finds a louse on his plate. Wolcot brilliantly
                politicizes the model he inherits from Alexander Pope
                by framing the epic battle in a way that underscores
                the king&rsquo;s human needs: the resentful cooks, in a
                colloquy that recalls Milton&rsquo;s Pandemonium as
                much as <em>The Rape of the Lock</em>, declare: "Yes;
                let him know with all his wondrous state / His teeth,
                his stomach on our wills shall wait" (<em>Works</em>
                30). The angry cooks invoke John Wilkes and America to
                politicize the King&rsquo;s human nature, but for the
                narrator George&rsquo;s masculinity is equally
                problematic. His uncontrollable anger over finding the
                louse exacerbates his stutter, the "broken language" in
                which he responds to the crisis (36), but also
                illustrates the narrow vision of a king "delighted with
                the world of little" (34). Even when engaging
                scientifically with the natural world, George&rsquo;s
                inspiration is like that of "vain Sapphos, who fancy
                all Parnassus in their brain" (34)&mdash;and yet his
                unwillingness to read dispatches except in the presence
                of "buxom Nanny" (29) suggests a certain virility as
                well. (This charge of lechery, incidentally, is one of
                several soon reversed upon the satirist.) "All eye, all
                ear, all mouth, all nose" (44), the king&rsquo;s
                unstable, imperfectly gendered body produces the
                unregulated appetites and the vulgar curiosity that
                fuel the political vices of avarice and favoritism
                emphasized more strongly in the topical odes of
                1787-88.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The terms of the conflict over Wolcot&rsquo;s poetry
                were set before the French Revolution, yet the conflict
                was also intensified by the rise of English
                Anti-Jacobin sentiment in the 1790s. Two bodies of
                thought are thus needed to theorize the development of
                Wolcot&rsquo;s satire and the critical response: the
                traditional politico-theology of monarchy, on the one
                hand, and the representation of revolutionary change,
                on the other, particularly in terms of gender and
                aesthetics. Concerted attacks on Peter Pindar in
                periodical prose and pamphlet verse began soon after
                the <em>Lousiad</em>, informed politically by
                prerevolutionary, metaphysical loyalties and
                historically by the events of the first Regency crisis,
                among others. "Manlius," troubled by Wolcot&rsquo;s
                failure to respect the vulnerability of a king verily
                unmanned by madness, alleges that Wolcot&rsquo;s
                erstwhile pupil John Opie has fittingly depicted him in
                a historical painting as one of the murderers in
                <em>The Assassination of James I</em> (1044).<a href=
                "#note4">[4]</a>
                This insinuation was not nearly as incendiary in 1788
                as it would have been four years later, after the
                arrest of Louis XVI, but nonetheless draws on a long
                tradition of imagining violence against the royal body.
                Louis Marin argues that "the body of the King is really
                present in the form of his portrait" (190), and the
                intensity of reaction against Wolcot suggests a strong
                analogy between his verbal "portraits" and the
                representations theorized by Marin. Developing the
                psychoanalytic implications of Ernst
                Kantorowicz&rsquo;s thesis in <em>The King&rsquo;s Two
                Bodies</em>, Marin reads the portrait as "the
                theologico-political theory of the royal body" (201),
                according to which the king must be "seduced by his own
                image" (210). Marin locates the converse of this
                fetishistic masochism in "the sadism of the subject who
                is fascinated by the body of the King," exemplified as
                much in Wolcot as in the caricature that Marin goes on
                to analyze. The caricature (a drawing by William
                Makepeace Thackeray) separates the king&rsquo;s two
                bodies: "it tries to make us believe that the natural
                body . . . is the truth of the body of signs" (211-12).
                The pleasure of the caricature is therefore like that
                of "a voyeur witnessing a sexual aggression against the
                King&rsquo;s body," which becomes feminized and
                "mortified by an encroaching senility" (216-17). Marin
                thus helps to clarify Wolcot&rsquo;s strategy and the
                reaction to it: the king&rsquo;s "broken language"
                aligns him with the material, the feminine, and the
                human against the spiritual, masculine, and divine.
                Ronald Paulson&rsquo;s summary of one stage of the
                French Revolution captures one of the reasons why it
                intensified the need to reclaim a divinely authorized
                masculinity, a need already apparent in the strictures
                of Manlius and others like him: "These are horrible,
                ugly, violent, aggressive <em>women</em> . . . of the
                Parisian mob who march to the royal palace and bring
                back the king and queen&mdash;women who in effect
                <em>are</em> the Revolution" (81).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Historical and personal factors also contributed to
                Wolcot&rsquo;s refusal to fall into line, which
                unsettled the increasingly polarized, militarized
                landscape of the 1790s. Wolcot was past fifty in 1789,
                and his avoidance of partisanship, even in these
                difficult conditions, harks back to the politics of an
                earlier period. His phrase "the itch of party sin"
                suggests a disease transmitted by the too-close
                proximity of politicians to power and seems to allude
                to the clubbish elitism of Parliament first brought
                into focus by John Wilkes, Wolcot&rsquo;s slightly
                older contemporary, in the 1760s. Wolcot&rsquo;s own
                Tory affiliation seems to have been wholly ingenuous:
                he campaigned for the Tories in a local election in
                1790 and gave the name <em>True Blue</em> to his
                pleasure boat (Girtin 134). But while maintaining the
                prescribed constitutional role of the King and Lords
                Wolcot also subjects a range of exploitative state
                institutions and private industries to a stringent
                critique rightly identified as socialist by Grzegorz
                Sinko.<a href=
                "#note5">[5]</a>
                Wolcot&rsquo;s non-partisan Toryism, egalitarian and
                fiercely secular, thus informs his separation of the
                king&rsquo;s two bodies. The incompetence of the royal
                physical body, as in <em>The Lousiad</em>, becomes a
                legitimate political issue, while the king&rsquo;s
                divine body (or "great name") provides the poet with
                cultural capital, as Peter observes in <em>Brother
                Peter to Brother Tom</em>: "The world may call me liar;
                but sincerely / I love him&mdash;for a partner, love
                him <em>dearly</em>; / Whilst his great name is on the
                <em>ferme</em>, I&rsquo;m sure / My credit with the
                public is secure" (<em>Works</em> 78). At the same
                time, Wolcot foregrounds the appetitive body of the
                patriot, rejecting patriotic idealism: "Yes, beef shall
                grace my spit, and ale shall flow, / As long as it
                continues George and Co." The poet&rsquo;s corpulent
                body serves as a kind of populist credential, which can
                be illustrated with reference to Cobbett or Michael
                Moore or even William Hone, the defiant radical
                publisher who, though not corpulent himself, became a
                reverent student of carnival and popular tradition in
                his antiquarian work on Bartholomew Fair.
                Wolcot&rsquo;s stylized Epicureanism also links him to
                the carnivalesque "comic / picturesque" aesthetics that
                Ronald Paulson associates with Thomas Rowlandson and
                the political tradition of Wilkes and the Foxite
                Whigs.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>But in the main Wolcot belongs with the grotesque
                rather than the picturesque, to borrow Paulson&rsquo;s
                vocabulary further. Paulson&rsquo;s account of the
                grotesque helps to contextualize Wolcot in the
                postrevolutionary setting in terms of gender as well as
                aesthetics&mdash;whether or not one wishes to agree
                categorically that "the grotesque is all in all the
                dominant aesthetic mode of the period" and that hence
                "the cartoonist Gillray&rsquo;s George III, John Bull,
                and Louis XVI all merge into the same figure" (7).
                Paulson makes a distinction between the "weak
                revolutionary imagery" of Rowlandson, Charles James
                Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, and the Prince of Wales
                (115) and the stronger images of James Gillray, a
                distinction that also helps to underscore
                Wolcot&rsquo;s distance (despite public misperceptions)
                from that camp. In fact, although Wolcot is not cited,
                Paulson&rsquo;s reading of Gillray brings out the
                poet&rsquo;s influence on the younger satirist. Gillray
                acknowledges Wolcot most forcefully in <em>Ancient
                Music</em> (1787), an early satire on the King&rsquo;s
                vulgar taste for Handel and flattery&mdash;a favorite
                topic of Wolcot&rsquo;s&mdash;that draws its images and
                quotes a passage from <em>Ode upon Ode</em>.<a href=
                "#note6">[6]</a>
                Paulson points out that the grotesque had long been
                "associated with both political and artistic freedom
                and creativity" (175) and gives a number of reasons for
                its rise to prominence, culminating in the
                revolutionary confusion of high and low, English and
                French, human and animal. Paulson argues that a
                "physical resemblance between the French and English
                kings began to emerge" in Gillray&rsquo;s prints in the
                1790s (193), a resemblance with harsh implications for
                the corporeality of king and commoner alike. This
                grotesque elision of difference (as I will suggest
                later) helps to account for the scatological and
                sodomitic references in the criticism of Wolcot. The
                grotesque also conflates the king&rsquo;s two bodies in
                such a way as to shift the discussion from theological
                to political ground. Alluding to a whole series of
                Gillray images, Paulson surveys the indiscriminate
                corporeality that makes the grotesque a revolutionary
                aesthetic par excellence:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Whether eating is excessive or the opposite, the
                  figures on both sides of the channel share the lowest
                  common denominator of regression to orality and
                  anality. Orality extends from cannibalism to the
                  peculiar diet of the royal family, to both England
                  and France devouring the globe, to the Jacobins
                  firing the bread of liberty into the mouths of other
                  European nations and being devoured themselves by
                  hungry crocodiles. The scatology that distinguished
                  the imagery of Burke&rsquo;s anti-Jacobin tracts
                  becomes in Gillray&rsquo;s cartoons the extraordinary
                  emphasis on both food and feces, both eating and
                  excreting. Scatological references extend from Pitt
                  as a toadstool on a royal dunghill to John
                  Bull&rsquo;s guts-ache and George III sitting on the
                  royal closestool or defecating ships onto the royal
                  mainland, to the Napoleon who . . . tries to pass
                  himself, in fact a horse turd, off as a golden
                  pippin. (200)</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>If it is true that for Gillray "kings and subjects
                [become] equally alike cannibals or tyrants," the same
                degree of regression would not be possible in Wolcot
                for a number of reasons.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Moreover, according to other readings of Gillray,
                honest John Bull is distinguished much more sharply,
                and in fact defined against, a feminized French other.
                The absence of such dichotomies in Wolcot may explain
                why his own popular, politically ambivalent, grossly
                embodied image of George III did not survive as well
                through the 1790s. Paulson&rsquo;s observation that "in
                consistently applied caricature there are no
                &lsquo;heroes&rsquo;" (203) applies more clearly to
                Wolcot than to Gillray, and helps to explain why
                Wolcot&mdash;to judge from the volume of printed
                discussion&mdash;was the more controversial figure. The
                revolution features consistently in Gillray&rsquo;s
                images, however disturbing, and there is a sense in
                which the virility of his regressive figures stands
                against the "women who <em>are</em> the Revolution," as
                feared by Burke. But for Wolcot&mdash;partly, I think,
                because of his age&mdash;the revolution is a much
                smaller piece of the English "pie" (Paulson 37), and by
                insisting on domestic political issues in his poems of
                the mid-to-late 1790s (the tax burden, restrictions on
                civil liberties, civil unrest) he appeared to his
                critics to be evading the challenge posed by the enemy.
                There are no heroes, then, in Wolcot, and no resolute
                men to stand up to the mob of women. To make matters
                worse, his pseudonym, Peter Pindar, deliberately courts
                comparison with the most robustly masculinist and
                hero-worshipping bard produced by the ancient world.
                The revolution helped to focus the anxiety already
                attached to the royal body as a result of
                George&rsquo;s madness in 1788. The intensified
                reaction to Wolcot suggests that once the king is no
                longer unequivocally the body of the nation, there is
                increased pressure on the body and the masculinity of
                the individual subject. The exercise of vilifying
                "Peter Pindar" (the pseudonym itself served his
                critics&rsquo; rhetorical purposes) allowed
                anti-Jacobin commentators to superimpose the paradigm
                of two bodies on the body politic as a whole: the "two
                Pindars" allegorize a division between disciplined and
                vulnerable bodies, true and false patriotism, manly and
                unmanly sentiment. The recurring topos of
                Wolcot&rsquo;s prostituted Muse also maintains the
                connection between unmanly sentiment and abjected
                femininity. Wolcot&rsquo;s mode of opposition
                patriotism was also circumscribed, finally, by the
                infringement of civil liberties that he addressed in
                poems such as <em>Liberty&rsquo;s Last Squeak</em>
                (1795) and <em>1796</em>. Yet Wolcot was never
                prosecuted for libel, as Gillray was, or charged with
                any of the other forms of sedition so freely imputed to
                dissidents in the mid-1790s.<a href=
                "#note7">[7]</a>
                It may have helped that Wolcot was prepared: he
                anticipated being silenced by the state in various
                satires as early as 1787. The conceit of
                <em>Peter&rsquo;s Pension</em>, published in 1788,
                briefly became an uncomfortable reality in 1795 when he
                accepted an advance on a pension from the Treasury
                (Girtin 172-78); but Wolcot had second thoughts and
                returned the money before writing anything for the
                government&mdash;thus bearing out the assertion of the
                poem: "No, Sir, I cannot be your humble hack; / I fear
                your majesty would break my back" (<em>Works</em>
                266).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>At this pre-revolutionary stage even Wolcot&rsquo;s
                respectable readers remonstrated fairly gently. In 1787
                the <em>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</em>, thus far an
                eager, if somewhat ironic supporter of Wolcot&rsquo;s
                poetry, earnestly took issue with insinuations
                detrimental to George&rsquo;s fatherly affection in
                <em>The Progress of Curiosity, or A Royal Visit to
                Whitbread&rsquo;s Brewery</em>. Having lampooned the
                king&rsquo;s "<em>minute</em> curiosity" and "profound
                questions" concerning the art of brewing with
                characteristic verve, Wolcot goes on to suggest that
                George showed too little sensibility at the illness of
                his son: "Sing how a monarch, when his son was dying, /
                His gracious eyes and ears was edifying, / By abbey
                company and kettle drum" (<em>Works</em> 18). (This is
                one of several satires in which Wolcot develops the
                theme taken up by Gillray in <em>Ancient Music</em>.)
                Responding to this passage, the
                <em>Gentleman&rsquo;s</em> reviewer admonishes him:
                "Put thyself in the Stead of any Parent . . . and
                correct thy severities" (57.620).<a href=
                "#note8">[8]</a>
                In a similar case the magazine passes "severe censure .
                . . [on] Peter&rsquo;s unfeeling heart," turning the
                tables on his charge of inadequate sensibility
                (58.440). At the same time, John Nichols and his
                reviewers dismissed the attacks in verse that were
                beginning to appear in 1787, suggesting that "poetry is
                not the most proper vehicle for exposing" Peter Pindar,
                and perhaps reserving the right of censure for
                themselves (57.20). Yet such poems began appearing in
                the magazine as well: "The Two Pindars," which faults
                Wolcot for "los[ing] the monarch in the man,"
                inaugurates an unfavorable comparison that
                Wolcot&rsquo;s chosen pseudonym seems to court and that
                becomes a staple in attacks on him. The contribution of
                "Manlius"&mdash;a pseudonym alluding to the severely
                upright Roman father whose patriotism was made
                exemplary by Livy and anthologized in turn by William
                Enfield&rsquo;s <em>The Speaker</em> among other
                schoolbooks&mdash;blames Wolcot, as I mentioned, for
                failing to spare the king&rsquo;s madness and
                introduces two further anti-Wolcot tropes, the
                prostituted muse and the supposed resentment of
                Wolcot&rsquo;s former prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the
                painter John Opie. Manlius&rsquo;s discussion of Wolcot
                as assassin in Opie&rsquo;s <em>Assassination of James
                I</em> (as well as another painting) highlights
                Wolcot&rsquo;s designs on the royal body that would
                become even more contentious after the revolution.
                Paulson maintains that this revolutionary contention is
                always "about England; the French Revolution was only
                one foreign ingredient in a pie of their own making"
                (37). Wolcot, with his refusal to focus on the
                revolution, well illustrates this continuity; so too
                the discourse about him, from the beginning, takes the
                "oedipal" and "oral-anal" forms assigned by Paulson to
                revolutionary conflict itself (8), though certainly the
                discourse becomes more violent in the 1790s.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>After the revolution, regressive violence
                increasingly prevailed and even the issue of classical
                education&mdash;initially a common idiom, even if used
                for satirical combat&mdash;became more volatile. Wolcot
                may have chosen Pindar as a namesake because of the
                ancient Theban&rsquo;s reputation for "belong[ing] . .
                . to no faction," or being above politics (Lattimore
                vii)&mdash;a more acceptable stance before the war.
                Later T. J. Mathias and others challenged
                Wolcot&rsquo;s pretensions to classical learning and
                implicitly dismissed the whole tradition of satire as
                patriotic opposition. Yet Mathias feels compelled to
                footnote both his allusions to the Theban Pindar to
                make clear that he means Pindar and "not that
                detestable writer, calling himself Peter Pindar"
                (<em>Pursuits of Literature</em>, pt. 3, p. 7n.). The
                anonymous "To the Soi-disant Peter Pindar" elaborates
                the comparison over several stanzas, concluding:</p>

                <p>The concluding image of this 1799 poem, suggesting
                premature ejaculation, aptly illustrates the sharply
                increased hostility and sexualized combat
                characteristic of the postrevolutionary satiric
                idiom.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Wolcot himself may have helped to set the tone of
                sexual aggression, not only by exposing the
                king&rsquo;s natural body, but also by turning his
                attention to the increasingly powerful Prime Minister,
                William Pitt. In the first of many satires addressed to
                Pitt, "Epistle to a Falling Minister," Wolcot first of
                all renders him a prude or worse: "A Joseph thou,
                against the sex to strive&mdash; / Dead to those charms
                that keep the world alive" (92). But most of his satire
                follows the more sinister line of presenting Pitt as a
                fiend from hell, comparing him to Oliver Cromwell and
                to Cain among other arch-demons, and accurately
                predicting (in a 1789 poem) Pitt&rsquo;s terrible
                assault on civil liberties. "It cannot be long an
                object of consideration with us whether to pity or
                detest the writer and publisher who can submit to the
                disgraceful labour of circulating such indecent
                reflections on the brightest character . . . the idol
                of the people of England," intoned the
                <em>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</em> (59.250-51). This
                reviewer also impugned Wolcot&rsquo;s anger as unmanly
                and ungenuine. Other criticisms of Wolcot in this era
                preceding the <em>Anti-Jacobin</em>, though increasing
                in number, also tended toward paternalistic correction
                or toward the burlesque rather than violent aggression.
                "Birch for Peter Pindar" (1788), by the prolific
                Pindaromastix, constructs a bizarre scenario in which
                the Privy Council puts Peter Pindar on trial for
                conspiring to kill the king through constipation, by
                quite literally "keep[ing] the key to his behind"
                (17).<a href=
                "#note9">[9]</a>
                This poem also works through several stock criticisms,
                depicting Wolcot as impotent and his muse as being "of
                easy virtue and unblushing face" (51), but it lacks the
                deadly earnestness of later satires such as
                Gifford&rsquo;s. Remarkably, Pindaromastix is content
                to let the blasphemous suggestion of Peter Pindar
                sodomizing the king pass without comment. Given that
                rumors were already circulating about Peter&rsquo;s
                disloyal association with the lowliest members of the
                royal household, assigning him a royal bedfellow
                testifies to a sexual fantasy thoroughly at odds with
                Pindaromastix&rsquo;s professed politics. When in 1800
                Gifford revived the report of Wolcot&rsquo;s
                involvement with a palace scullion, he put it&mdash;by
                contrast&mdash;in the most strident moral terms,
                causing a crisis in Wolcot&rsquo;s career.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>1789&rsquo;s <em>Brother Tom to Brother Peter</em>
                (by "A Moonraker") takes the scatological approach to
                more outrageous lengths. According to this allegory,
                Wolcot&rsquo;s technique originated as a project
                proposed to the king for catching the farts of the
                great, a technology that predictably backfires on
                Wolcot when his first subject&mdash;Benjamin West, the
                royal favorite and frequent victim of Wolcot&rsquo;s
                Royal Academy satires&mdash;"let[s] fly," like the
                "daubing dog" he is, in the poet&rsquo;s face (25). The
                devil, who appears in many of these satires (cp.
                Gillray, <em>Satan in All His Glory</em>), then brokers
                a contract between Wolcot and the Prince that allows
                him to get his revenge on the king as a paid mouthpiece
                of the Foxite Whigs. Though undeniably hostile, these
                verses also owe much to Wolcot&rsquo;s own imagery and
                technique. The first Regency crisis at this moment
                helps to explain their partisan spirit (equally present
                in versified defenses of Peter Pindar) and the
                insistent comparisons between Peter and Falstaff that
                arise at this time and persist into the nineteenth
                century. This analogy is developed in a prose tract
                addressed to the Prince by "Albion," warning him
                against Wolcot and other low companions (12; cp.
                Gifford 39). Paulson&rsquo;s oedipal and regressive
                (oral-anal) models of contention are both already in
                place in these works of 1788-89, and <em>Brother Tom to
                Brother Peter</em> in particular suggests a political
                lineage for the scatological extremes that Paulson
                traces to Burke. If it is true that, for Gillray at
                least, "figures on both sides of the channel share the
                lowest common denominator of regression to orality and
                anality" (200), then the discourse around Wolcot could
                have provided the idiom adopted for these revolutionary
                representations. Richard Godfrey provides several
                visual analogues to Gillray&rsquo;s scatological
                approach in <em>The French Invasion;
                &mdash;or&mdash;John Bull, bombarding the
                Bum-Boats</em> (1793), also analyzed by Paulson.
                Godfrey suggests that Gillray must have influenced two
                French cartoons of 1794, one of which depicts George
                III&rsquo;s face, spewing bayonets, as the posterior of
                a grotesque figure. Richard Newton&rsquo;s "extremely
                daring" <em>Treason</em> (1798) shows John Bull farting
                in the king&rsquo;s face (Godfrey 112), and it is
                telling that Newton dedicated another of his prints to
                "Peter Pindar, Prince of Satyrists," all the more
                because Wolcot himself was never quite so extreme. The
                early satires against him, however, already cultivate
                the grotesque elision of difference and the sexual
                violence later intensified by revolutionary conflict.
                The image of Peter "keep[ing] the key to [the
                King&rsquo;s] behind," in particular, encapsulates what
                is remarkable in these early attacks on Wolcot,
                conflating as it does satire and sexual aggression,
                sodomy and scatology, and the two bodies of king and
                scullion.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>None of these attacks denied Wolcot&rsquo;s innate
                literary ability, as later critics would. <em>The
                Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</em>, even as it became more
                hostile, preserved an atmosphere of serious literary
                discussion and was the first to welcome him back to the
                fold in 1791 when he came out against Paine and
                Revolutionary France. "On the Abuse of Satire," a piece
                of Isaac D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s <em>A Defence of
                Poetry</em> first published in the magazine, exhorts
                the laureate (Warton) to punish Wolcot with satire,
                since he continues to find ingenious ways of avoiding
                legal prosecution for libel and sedition. Wolcot
                himself, though, was surely pleased to note that his
                abuse of satire had "waken[ed] all the fires" of
                D&rsquo;Israeli, who claims that his "patriot zeal
                inspires / [his] honest verse" (59.648).<a href=
                "#note10">[10]</a>
                D&rsquo;Israeli, like many of Wolcot&rsquo;s opponents,
                is forced to adopt his tactics of character
                assassination, calling Peter the pander to a muse who
                "prostitutes [her] charms&mdash;for half a crown."
                D&rsquo;Israeli reassures Warton somewhat comically
                that since Peter "has made art a trade," his libelous
                effusions will quickly be forgotten while
                Warton&rsquo;s own encomia will "make all the King, the
                Husband, Father, shine!" into eternity. This last
                description also reinforces the increasing political
                sensitivity of the king&rsquo;s domestic masculinity.
                Soon enough, Wolcot took devastating aim at John
                Nichols and his magazine in three publications,
                including one of his trademark epistles, a pretended
                reply fathered semi-convincingly on Nichols himself,
                and a set of manuscript lyrics collected and
                indignantly introduced by this pseudo-Nichols to the
                ostensible shame of the bard.<a href=
                "#note11">[11]</a>
                Alongside its class snobbery and scurrilous hilarity
                this poem also argues that truth cannot reside in a
                periodical publication: "Truth," Peter declaims, "Lifts
                her fair head, and looks with brow sublime / On all the
                fading pageantries of time" (<em>Works</em> 271) and
                especially on a magazine full of puffery, interest, and
                sham learning. Here is an echo of the professionally
                motivated argument against periodical verse that
                Michael Gamer attributes to Wolcot&rsquo;s rival
                Gifford. Nichols (or his reviewer Gough) nonetheless
                reverses D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s charge back on Wolcot
                in reviewing this poem: "True satire, from Juvenal to
                Churchill, has had Truth for its object" (60.439). But
                by the time of Wolcot&rsquo;s anti-Paine and
                anti-French poems of 1791, he is content to observe
                that "Peter is a clever fellow, and now got on our
                side" (61.930), reprinting two poems in the magazine to
                demonstrate Peter&rsquo;s "improvement."<a href=
                "#note12">[12]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Other critics were less conciliatory. Wolcot
                continued his attacks on Pitt, even as he noted with
                increasing bitterness and resignation the curbs on
                freedom of speech that inhibited his work. This
                persistence earned him a particularly influential enemy
                in 1794 in the person of T. J. Mathias. Mathias not
                only feels compelled to clarify his allusions to Pindar
                by distinguishing Peter&rsquo;s "depravity and
                malignity" from the patriotic lyricism of his ancient
                namesake, as I mentioned earlier; he also delivers a
                substantial analysis of Peter&rsquo;s political
                apostasy, though pointedly confined to a note: "he has
                perpetually reviled and held up to scorn every master
                principle by which government and society are
                maintained. I will not waste a verse on such a
                character" (pt. 1, p. 50n.). Gary Dyer notes that
                Mathias was widely praised for his "unequalled
                manliness of sentiment" (25), adding that "people
                recognized in Gifford and Mathias a pose of orthodoxy "
                (30) that eventually trumped Wolcot&rsquo;s
                anti-establishment masculinity (37).<a href=
                "#note13">[13]</a>
                At the same time, a radical publication of 1796,
                <em>The Volunteer Laureate: or Fall of Peter
                Pindar</em>, though it owes much of its superbly
                pointed anti-monarchical satire to Wolcot, condemns him
                for not being political <em>enough</em>. The liberal
                media, however, in sources duly referenced by Mathias
                and Gifford, continued to try to shelter Wolcot from
                the worst abuse. (The concept of "liberal media" itself
                is a current distortion with roots in the period,
                carefully tended, if not originally planted, by the
                <em>Anti-Jacobin</em> in 1797.) Wolcot, of course,
                retaliated, but seems to have played into the
                enemy&rsquo;s hands in a particularly ill-advised and
                weakly argued satire of 1799, <em>Nil admirari, or a
                Smile at a Bishop</em>. The epigraph, taken, as often,
                from the poem itself, sets the tone by skewering "that
                miserable imp Mathias." In exposing what he takes to be
                the Bishop of London&rsquo;s obscenely extravagant
                praise for Hannah More, Wolcot insists that good morals
                don&rsquo;t make good art, suggesting also that the
                Bishop&rsquo;s "high-toned morality" makes him an
                unmanly critic: "I own Miss Hannah&rsquo;s life is very
                good, / But then her verse and prose are very bad"
                (lines 43-44). Wolcot&rsquo;s honorable motive, the
                decline of criticism into flattery and partisanship in
                this time of intense ideological conflict, is
                compromised by spurious charges of plagiarism and
                infantilizing, quasi-pornographic ridicule of
                bluestockings&mdash;"an indecent and scurrilous
                attack," as the <em>Anti-Jacobin</em> Review was quick
                to point out, "on two of the most amiable, and
                exemplary, characters of the age!" ("To the Soi-Disant
                Peter Pindar" 472).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As often, Wolcot published the eponymous main piece
                in a slim quarto followed by a number of more strictly
                humorous afterpieces (to borrow an analogy from the
                theater), among which "An Ode to the
                Blue-Stocking-Club" and "An Ode to Some Robin
                Red-Breasts in a Country Cathedral" (an attack on
                church music) drew particularly angry replies. These
                shorter poems allowed some critics to take on
                Wolcot&rsquo;s sexual license and religious irreverence
                without addressing the more serious context provided by
                the longer poem: the sophisticated anticlerical satire
                of the latter, for example, gives way to a facetious
                comparison in the "Ode to Some Robin-Redbreasts"
                between the choir of robins and the venal pomp of
                "Bishop, Dean, and bawling Boys" (<em>Nil admirari</em>
                p. 56). <em>Nil admirari</em> itself takes its title
                from the sixth epistle of the first book of Horace,
                adapted by Wolcot to implicate Bishop Porteus&rsquo;
                admiration of More (lines 105-06). Howard Weinbrot
                notes that Wolcot adapts Horace by "turn[ing] away from
                the modest disclaimer of the world&rsquo;s attractions
                and towards his own more vigorous attack" (199), and
                thus compounding (for some readers) the literary
                offense. This elaborate 300-line adaptation, addressed
                to the Bishop, argues convincingly in places that
                posterity will revalue many of the literary judgments
                of the day as obscured by "clouds of prejudice" and the
                "varnish" of flattery, but undercuts the argument with
                images as frivolous as any in the shorter poems: "And
                lo, this varnish with thy daubing brush / Smear&rsquo;d
                o&rsquo;er Miss Hannah must by time be roasted, / The
                nymph in all her nakedness will blush, / And courtly
                Porteus, for a flatterer posted" (125-28). By imagining
                Hannah More naked Wolcot advances a largely distinct
                line of satirical attack on the partisan criticism of
                the age (his ideological view of which, though applied
                unfairly to More, still holds true as a whole): his own
                heterosexually charged masculinity rides triumphant (as
                he imagines) over the flattering prudes who control the
                reviews. More again unfairly bears the brunt of this
                indictment of male critics of Jacobinism and sexual
                morality, as Peter, in the words of his own Miltonesque
                "argument," "severely reprimandeth her uncharitableness
                toward the frail ones of her own sex" (see lines
                153-68). His reprimand not only eroticizes the relation
                between More and Porteus but uses allegory to inject a
                charge of plagiarism: "Some years ago I saw a female
                race; / The prize a shift&mdash;a Holland shift, I
                ween: / Ten damsels, nearly all in naked grace, /
                Rush&rsquo;d for the precious prize along the green"
                (193-96). The winner of this race, notes Peter, cheated
                the others by accepting help from her lover, who
                carried her part of the way on a mule, just as Porteus
                supposedly supplied his prose to More: "Did no kind
                swain his hand to Hannah yield&mdash; / No
                bishop&rsquo;s hand to help a heavy rear, / And bear
                the nymph triumphant o&rsquo;er the field?" (210-12).
                To complete the outrage, Wolcot then adapts images
                familiar in the 1790s from representations of the
                September Massacres to a caustic declaration of his
                "love for bishops" (253). Porteus and his kind are, at
                any rate, more loveable than their medieval
                counterparts who persecuted heretics and nonbelievers:
                "Grill&rsquo;d, roasted, carbonaded, fricaseed, / Men,
                women, children, for the slightest things; / Burnt,
                strangled, glorying in the horrid deed; / Nay,
                starv&rsquo;d and flogg&rsquo;d God&rsquo;s great
                vicegerents, Kings!" (265-68). The volume concludes
                with a parody of a disinterested review of the
                preceding verse, but Wolcot points the moral to be sure
                we don&rsquo;t miss it: the reviewers of this
                acrimonious time are his real targets in this satire,
                "despicable Pimps, hired to debauch the Public Taste"
                (p. 64).</p>

                <p>At this point even William Cobbett took up the cry
                against Wolcot, and many less unlikely defenders also
                came to the aid of Religion and Virtue as personified
                by Bishop Porteus and More. Cobbett, then in the United
                States, collected and reprinted the anti-Wolcot verses
                and numerous diatribes in prose from the
                <em>Anti-Jacobin Review</em> as an appendix to Richard
                Polwhele&rsquo;s <em>The Unsex&rsquo;d Females</em>, a
                poem that makes no mention of Wolcot but must have
                seemed to Cobbett to make a marketable
                combination.<a href=
                "#note14">[14]</a>
                Certainly <em>Nil admirari</em> is no less misogynistic
                than <em>The Unsex&rsquo;d Females</em>, but
                Wolcot&rsquo;s eroticism unmasks the damsel in distress
                as a sex object, an ideological move that accounts for
                much of the outcry against him. This reaction seems to
                support Tim Fulford&rsquo;s contention that "chivalric
                manhood did not die; it was relocated to the middle
                classes" (9). Fulford&rsquo;s study traces
                Coleridge&rsquo;s long struggle to revise Burke&rsquo;s
                view of "chivalry, beauty, and sublimity" (11), and his
                anxiety over his lack of public influence. Ironically
                in this context, Coleridge&rsquo;s most widely quoted
                remark on Wolcot excoriates him for publishing
                scurrilous remarks on Mary Robinson in a 1783 poem.
                Writing to Robinson&rsquo;s daughter in 1801, Coleridge
                admonishes her to omit the mention of Robinson&rsquo;s
                long friendship with Wolcot in the preface to a
                posthumous volume of her poems: "my flesh creeps at his
                name!" (qtd. in Girtin 221). Wolcot himself reprimanded
                Gifford for insulting Robinson, to which Gifford
                replied, ostensibly addressing Robinson, that she would
                do better to rely for protection on a "broken reed"
                (qtd. in Clark 107). William Hazlitt, not to be
                outdone, reiterated the defense of Robinson against
                Gifford: "His attacks on Mrs. Robinson were unmanly"
                (125). Wolcot&rsquo;s treatment of More provoked
                commensurably greater outrage, and the critics of
                <em>Nil admirari</em> coded their chivalry in more
                strictly Burkean, and political, terms: "Yet Walcot
                becks the dire banditti on, / And smiles complacent
                o&rsquo;er his country&rsquo;s tomb" (<em>Peter Not
                Infallible</em> 25).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>William Gifford proved to be the greatest knight of
                them all in his chastisement of the dragon Peter
                Pindar. He not only exposed Wolcot&rsquo;s inmost vices
                and defended his victims but defeated him in
                hand-to-hand combat. It was so much the worse for the
                now 62-year-old Wolcot that he was the aggressor,
                attempting to chastise Gifford for the brutal slanders
                of his <em>Epistle to Peter Pindar</em> and
                particularly for his allusion to the 1788-89 Birdcage
                Walk affair in a postscript to the second edition.
                Wolcot thus gave him the opportunity to make good his
                claim in the poem that he was "Prepared each threat to
                baffle or to spurn, / Each blow with ten-fold vigour to
                return," a vindication Gifford noted eagerly for his
                readers in his third edition (37) (in which he also
                quoted the full text of the 1789 <em>Times</em> account
                for good measure). Their combat was itself the subject
                of much dispute and of numerous verse satires,
                including Alexander Geddes&rsquo;s
                <em>Bardomachia</em>, but the most widely credited
                account suggests that Gifford beat Wolcot bloody with
                his own stick. This success flattered Gifford&rsquo;s
                literary ambitions, and the third edition of his
                epistle, published soon after the combat, swelled to
                forty pages of prose superadded to the 172-line poem.
                Gifford&rsquo;s prose apparatus conveniently quotes at
                length or paraphrases all the recent invective against
                Wolcot in the <em>Anti-Jacobin Review</em> and
                elsewhere, consolidating the improbable catalogue of
                vices imputed to Wolcot and rehearsing the more meager
                criticisms of his verse. These criticisms take
                Wolcot&rsquo;s satirical tactic of "comparing great
                things with small" in deadly and ludicrous earnest as
                threatening to the state: "we allude to his
                observation, in one of his libellous productions, (we
                forget which) that Kings, like candles, are better for
                snuffing, i.e. taking off their heads" (Cobbett 64; cp.
                Gifford 51n.). Gifford gleefully summarizes more
                seditious passages and all the charges of vulgarity,
                sodomy, drunkenness, whoring, impotence, cowardice,
                bribe-taking, cruelty, and blasphemy, all supported by
                improbable "authentic" anecdotes from the poet&rsquo;s
                "friends" and presented with "manly confidence" (42):
                "I have rescued Dignity, and Worth, and Talents, and
                Virtue, and Religion, from the malignant attacks of
                their bitterest foe" (53). The volume and tone of
                Gifford&rsquo;s compendium attest to a level of
                hysteria now associated with orthodox masculinity that
                exceeds even the intensity of conflict during the first
                Regency crisis&mdash;one possible explanation for his
                digging up the <em>Times</em> account of Wolcot&rsquo;s
                intercourse with a royal scullion in the Birdcage
                Walk.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The old sodomy charge performs a labor of sexual
                aggression that is difficult to accommodate in
                Gifford&rsquo;s own poetic idiom. Gifford&rsquo;s
                satire contains nothing comparable even to the mild
                innuendo quoted earlier from "To the Soi-Disant Peter
                Pindar": "Thy spurts of envy, thy malignant rhyme, /
                With infamy shall die before their Sire" (473).
                Gifford&rsquo;s scorn, like his use of the cane,
                carries its libidinal content as a subtext, in a manner
                that the paradox "hysterical masculinity" may help to
                elucidate. His intense emotion refuses embodiment,
                subsisting on a plane of moral outrage that Wolcot
                himself associates with prudery and repression. Put
                another way, Gifford&rsquo;s punishing masculinity
                rises above the ribald homosocial combat of earlier
                times, leaving behind the natural body to inhabit the
                beleaguered divine body of royalty and of the kingdom.
                He sublimates his own sadistic pleasure by means of a
                threefold strategy. First, Gifford&rsquo;s impoverished
                stock of metaphors keeps his victim anchored firmly in
                the sphere of the savage and subhuman (dog, snake,
                toad, Mohawk, sot, profligate, dotard), in a grotesque
                conflation of human and animal bodies. Second, he keeps
                the focus on his victim&rsquo;s grotesquely debased
                desires, admitting none of his own, but also observes a
                certain decorum: Peter Pindar is "a prodigy of
                drunkenness and lust" (line 98) with an added measure
                of sacrilege, deviating in recognizable ways from
                recognizable norms.<a href=
                "#note15">[15]</a>
                Finally, Gifford hints at and then introduces the
                <em>Times</em> articles as supporting evidence, as
                neutral facts that on the one hand prove his superior
                objectivity but on the other hand cannot implicate his
                own imagination because derived from an external
                source&mdash;in fact, the charge is more obscene than
                anything fancied in the verse. The journalistic record
                (if taken as fact) answers Wolcot&rsquo;s grotesque and
                blasphemous conflation of the king&rsquo;s two bodies
                by exposing the truth of his desire, his own corrupted
                masculinity.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Gifford&rsquo;s "documentation" of his charges is
                complicated by the legal status of sodomy allegations,
                on the one hand, and by the currency of sodomy in
                political rhetoric, on the other. These are large
                issues, and here I hope only to sketch in the immediate
                context of the <em>Times</em> articles that would have
                made even sympathetic readers of Gifford aware of the
                rhetorical nature of these charges, before moving
                briefly to an analogous image by Gillray, <em><a href=
                "../images/gillray_hopes.html">
                The Hopes of the Party</a></em> (1791), as an
                illustration of the continued currency of sodomy as an
                image of sedition.<a href=
                "#note16">[16]</a>
                Given the absence of any corroborating evidence in the
                biographical record, it makes sense to classify the
                insinuations of the <em>Times</em> with other spurious
                charges of sodomy. David Garrick successfully rebuffed
                the charge of William Kenrick&rsquo;s satirical verses,
                <em>Love in the Suds</em> (1772), that he had engaged
                in illicit relations with the playwright Isaac
                Bickerstaffe, who had fled the country on the basis of
                a newspaper report on his relations with a soldier
                (McCormick 162). Samuel Foote won his case in court
                against his former coachman who had him indicted for
                assault "with Intent to Commit Buggery" in 1776 (qtd.
                in Goldsmith 99). Netta Goldsmith points out that in
                Foote&rsquo;s case <em>The Public Ledger</em>, whose
                editor Foote had mocked, originally published this
                charge and continued to maintain it even after his
                legal victory, contributing in her view to
                Foote&rsquo;s death by a stroke in 1777 (104).
                Goldsmith cites Jeremy Bentham&rsquo;s manuscript essay
                on "Paederasty" (c. 1785) for evidence that sodomy
                allegations, given the legal status of the crime, were
                very difficult to refute and therefore an easy avenue
                for blackmail (97). It may be true that Bentham would
                have been exiled if he had published this essay (21),
                but a similar argument was made in print by one of
                Wolcot&rsquo;s staunchest defenders in 1800. In March
                1789, following a number of sarcastic references to
                Wolcot&rsquo;s disloyalty in the preceding months, the
                <em>Times</em> announced that "there is now a Kitchen
                Rat at Buckingham-House, that was caught about twelve
                months since, in a trap with Peter Pindar, in the
                Bird-Cage Walk," threatening serious consequences "if
                this same Rat and Peter Pindar continue their disloyal
                and ******** intercourse" (3/19/89, 2d). Two more
                allusions to this affair continue to develop a larger
                account of how Wolcot obtained his information about
                the royal family and who paid him (a "fallen print,"
                perhaps the <em>Morning Chronicle</em>) to write it
                up.<a href=
                "#note17">[17]</a>
                In his <em>Admonitory Epistle to William Gifford</em>,
                Thomas Dutton took Gifford severely to task for
                reviving these allegations against Wolcot. As editor of
                the <em>Dramatic Censor</em>, Dutton would have
                remembered the spurious charges against Garrick and
                Foote. Even more important, Dutton remembered and was
                willing to remind the public that in its earliest years
                the <em>Times</em> routinely engaged in this sort of
                political blackmail against perceived enemies of the
                state: "What shall we say to the man, who brings
                forward such an accusation, knowing it to be false!
                knowing, that the very newspaper, on which he rests his
                charge, has been prosecuted for dealing in this very
                species of libel! knowing, as he must, that the
                fabricator of the report (now dead, the late Mr.
                Finney, a name notorious for profligacy . . . ) was in
                the habit of making this charge an engine of
                extortion," further cases of which Dutton goes on to
                specify ("Manners and Morals" 99).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>These accusations, then, at least in the
                prerevolutionary context, would have appeared no more
                serious than Kenrick&rsquo;s <em>Love in the Suds</em>.
                Even Kenrick invokes a satirical tradition more
                respectable than periodical prose by alluding to
                Charles Churchill&rsquo;s <em>The Rosciad</em> in one
                of his subtitles, "Being the Lamentation of Roscius for
                the Loss of his Nyky." As Howard Weinbrot demonstrates,
                the charge of sodomy incorporated into homosocial
                satirical combat has its roots in a political tradition
                epitomized in Pope&rsquo;s <em>Epistle to Dr.
                Arbuthnot</em>. By depicting John, Baron Hervey as
                "Sporus, the male whore of Nero" (190), Pope charges
                that "protection of the satirist is replaced" in the
                court of George II "by hostility to the satirist,
                especially if he opposes the sexual deviance that is an
                emblem of political deviance. The poem . . . becomes an
                effort to stop the sodomizing of Britain" (190). By a
                "devolution of satiric kinds" the charge of sodomy
                becomes a vehicle of merely personal satire in
                Garrick&rsquo;s <em>Fribbleriad</em> (1761) and of
                grotesquely overblown Juvenalian indignation in
                Churchill&rsquo;s <em>The Times</em> (1764), Weinbrot
                argues (195). Wolcot, by contrast, remains more fully
                in touch with social reality, but he abandons the
                Horatian aspirations still present in Pope: sodomy
                drops out of the picture in Wolcot because "he is most
                at home strutting and raging among ruins" (202),
                resigned to a political climate in which there is no
                longer any point in attacking vice at all. Weinbrot
                does not discuss Wolcot&rsquo;s reception, but his
                argument about Churchill helps to illuminate the merely
                personal, politically non-substantive charges
                (including sodomy) leveled by his critics. In fact,
                Churchill is cited in at least two attacks on Wolcot:
                the <em>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</em> review quoted
                above and the anonymous <em>Poetical Epistle to John
                Wolcot</em> (1790), which takes its epigraph from
                Churchill&rsquo;s <em>Epistle to William
                Hogarth</em>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Some of Wolcot&rsquo;s critics, however, did see
                themselves as setting out to "stop the sodomizing of
                Britain," and in the context of the Revolution the
                charge of sodomy&mdash;of sodomizing the king
                especially&mdash;takes on a kind of political weight
                unaccounted for by Weinbrot&rsquo;s model. Even the
                frivolous charge of Finney in the <em>Times</em> (if
                Dutton is right about his authorship) insinuates
                violence against the king by a fairly transparent
                substitution of a servant&rsquo;s body (the "Kitchen
                Rat") for the sovereign&rsquo;s natural body. In the
                postrevolutionary context the image haunts the public
                imagination, attested by the renewed currency of this
                charge prompted by Gifford and also in graphic satire.
                Thomas Dermody ("Mauritius Moonshine") is one partisan
                who takes up Gifford&rsquo;s case, alluding darkly in
                <em>The Battle of the Bards</em> to "such odious hints
                as his [Wolcot&rsquo;s] own manhood stain" (qtd. in
                Clark 110). Newton&rsquo;s <em>Treason</em> and the
                French cartoons cited earlier, which bring the king and
                the anus into dangerous proximity, are also relevant
                here. But the most striking visual image of this kind
                is Gillray&rsquo;s <em>The Hopes of the Party</em>,
                prior to July 14th (1791; Fig. 1), which has no
                apparent connection to Wolcot. Gillray puts John Horne
                Tooke in the position of royal sodomizer. Godfrey is
                the only commentator I have found who addresses this
                rather obvious representation directly: "The position
                of Tooke, who spreads the King&rsquo;s legs and thrusts
                his own body between them, is outrageously suggestive"
                (93). The image projects the execution of George III,
                organized by Tooke, Fox, Joseph Priestley, Sheridan,
                and Sir Cecil Wray. Tooke stands at left; Fox, at
                center, holds the axe over George&rsquo;s hapless neck;
                and the other three cluster at right offering
                consolation to the king as Sheridan holds his head in
                place on the block.<a href=
                "#note18">[18]</a>
                Pitt and Queen Charlotte dangle suggestively from the
                lamps above the Crown &amp; Anchor sign. As Godfrey
                points out, "it is an extraordinary and gross satire,
                which would not have been possible to publish after the
                guillotining of Louis XVI in 1793." For Paulson,
                however, this image is part of an unfolding grotesque
                narrative, and he argues that later images of Louis
                XVI, including "even Gillray&rsquo;s print of the
                execution of Louis XVI in 1793, should be compared with
                the earlier mock execution he projects of George III"
                (193). The king too has a speech bubble reading "What!
                What! What! what&rsquo;s the matter now?" Godfrey
                suggests that George&rsquo;s "bewildered innocence"
                takes "some of the sting . . . out of the design," but
                it seems likely that Gillray&rsquo;s audience would
                have remembered Wolcot&rsquo;s persistent mockery of
                the king&rsquo;s explosive speech and other
                idiosyncrasies dating from 1785 up to the present. They
                might well have taken Gillray&rsquo;s image as
                continuing Wolcot&rsquo;s grotesque narrative, a
                narrative that forcibly separated the king&rsquo;s two
                bodies for dubious political ends. Gillray&rsquo;s
                admirers&mdash;those not shocked or outraged by the
                image&mdash;would surely have identified with the
                tradition of grossly embodied masculine patriotism
                developed by Wolcot and maintained against mounting
                criticism through and beyond the contentious moment of
                <em>The Hopes of the Party</em>. Loyalist readers of
                the print, on the other hand, were probably more than
                willing to associate the veteran dissident Tooke (born
                1736) with another grizzled profligate known for his
                designs on the backside of the divine national body:
                Peter Pindar.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Wolcot himself recovered sufficiently from the
                assaults of Gifford, Dermody, and others to answer much
                of their abuse in <em>Out at Last</em> (1801), in which
                he was supported by a convenient accident of history:
                the fall of Pitt. His subtitle, "The Fallen Minister,"
                triumphantly echoes his "Epistle to a Falling Minister"
                of eleven years before. Wolcot&rsquo;s patriotism gains
                new force from his renewed ability to ventriloquize
                "Old England&rsquo;s genius," which thus addresses Pitt
                in the poem: "Harpoon&rsquo;d at last, thou
                flound&rsquo;ring porpoise&mdash; / Thou who hast
                swallowed all my rights, / Gobbling the mightiest just
                like the mites&mdash; / Devouring like a sprat my
                habeas corpus. / Thou, who didst bind my sons in
                chains, / . . . For fear their wrath might kindle riot"
                (lines 73-84). Only after celebrating the
                nation&rsquo;s liberty does Wolcot turn to his more
                narrowly literary concerns, condemning Pitt&rsquo;s
                gagging of the Muse, exposing Gifford and Mathias as
                the prime minister&rsquo;s hirelings (204n.), and
                reserving for Gifford the particular fate of being
                hanged in a note&mdash;taking his cue archly from
                Mathias&rsquo;s attack on him (127n.). Wolcot&rsquo;s
                account of Gifford as a hypocrite, parvenu, sycophant,
                seducer, and pander to his aristocratic patron is no
                more truthful than Gifford&rsquo;s attacks on him, but
                it includes some substantive criticism of
                Gifford&rsquo;s verse and above all it is playful and
                ironic. Wolcot&rsquo;s note brilliantly parodies all
                the earnest strategies of character assassination
                practiced by Gifford and the <em>Anti-Jacobin
                Review</em>. The poem then concludes with a procession
                of the people taking their revenge on their erstwhile
                oppressor: authors, printers, shoemakers led by Thomas
                Hardy, washerwomen, politicians, even cats and dogs are
                finally free to speak their minds. At this point,
                alluding again to Pitt&rsquo;s apparently asexual
                nature, Wolcot enlists the women of England in the
                cause of his own unrepenant, libertine, eccentric
                masculinity:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>And, see! the girls around thee throng<br />
                    "Art thou the wight, thus stretch&rsquo;d
                    along,<br />
                    An enemy well known to wives and misses?<br />
                    Art thou the man who dost not care<br />
                    For oglings, squeezes of the fair;<br />
                    Nay, makest up wry mouths at woman&rsquo;s
                    kisses?"<br />
                    Then shall the nymphs apply their birchen
                    rods,<br />
                    And baste thee worse than Peter Pindar&rsquo;s
                    Odes.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>Apart from occasional references to this apparently
              deviant sexuality and to Pitt&rsquo;s drunkenness, Wolcot
              does not expose the Prime Minister&rsquo;s natural body
              as avidly as the king&rsquo;s. The commoner Pitt lacks
              the "body of signs," the divine body that gives
              Wolcot&rsquo;s satires on the king their semiotic energy.
              But on some level Marin&rsquo;s definition of
              caricature&mdash;an image presenting "the natural body"
              as "the truth of the body of signs"&mdash;extends to all
              caricature and especially visual caricature. Thus Gillray
              seizes on Pitt&rsquo;s rail-thin figure to create some of
              his most memorable political satires, such as <em>Sin,
              Death, and the Devil</em> (1792) and <em>Presages of the
              Millennium</em> (1795). By way of contrast, <em>A Sphere
              Projecting against a Plane</em> (1793), which features
              Pitt "projecting" against the rotund Mrs. Hobart,
              illustrates the comparatively depoliticized humor of the
              corpulent body in Gillray. Although Gifford calls Wolcot
              "a bloated mass," Wolcot&rsquo;s corpulence in and of
              itself pales as a political vice next to his insistent
              embodiment both of the king and of his own national
              sentiment. Pat Rogers (182) and Denise Gigante (ch. 8)
              have both suggested, in very different contexts, that fat
              becomes politicized, and takes on a peculiar moral
              stigma, only with the advent of the Regency and the
              growing waistline of "great George" IV. If the royal body
              is no longer sacred, caricatures like Thackeray&rsquo;s
              (in his sketch of Louis XIV and his verbal sketch of
              George IV as Jos Sedley in <em>Vanity Fair</em>) become
              permissible as liberal discourse. Wolcot&rsquo;s earlier
              satires contributed to this revolutionary process. Yet
              the grotesque, libidinal, broadly transgressive masculine
              contest between Wolcot and his antagonists carried older
              forms of patriotism forward into the polarized debate
              over the French Revolution. Wolcot&rsquo;s insistence on
              the appetitive natural body as the seat of political
              agency has deep roots in English popular tradition. The
              subject&rsquo;s desiring body, as James I recognized in
              <em>A Counterblast to Tobacco</em> (1616), is at odds
              with the divine body of the sovereign, or with his
              divinely authorized demand for laboring and fighting
              subjects. By the time of George III, even the
              king&rsquo;s defenders were presenting him in a role that
              seems to compromise the doctrine of the king&rsquo;s two
              bodies, namely as a paragon of domestic masculinity.
              Wolcot&rsquo;s critics, then, were not championing the
              king&rsquo;s divine body so much as domestic masculinity
              and war culture. Among Michael Moore&rsquo;s critics,
              too, the profanely embodied masculinity that is
              supposedly repressed in political discourse returns as a
              fascination with the transgression that has shadowed
              patriotism as a word and a practice since at least the
              eighteenth century.</li>

    <p>I would like to thank Joshua Gonsalves, Brad Prager, and
            Orrin Wang for insightful comments and bibliographical
            suggestions on an earlier draft of this essay.</p>
    
            <p class="indent">1.<a name="note1" id="note1"></a>
            According to the <em>OED</em>, in the late seventeenth
            century "patriot" was "applied to one who supported the
            rights of the country against the King and court. . . .
            Hence the name itself fell into discredit in the earlier
            half of the 18th c., being used, according to Dr. Johnson,
            &lsquo;ironically for a factious disturber of the
            government'" (II.2099). Many examples from the 1790s bear
            out this point: caustic references to John Wilkes as a
            "patriot" in the <em>Times</em> (3/19/1788); Gillray's
            <em>Patriotic Regeneration</em> (1795), envisioning a
            Jacobin Parliament with Fox as Robespierre; and pieces in
            the first <em>Anti-Jacobin</em> (1797-98) such as the
            letter of "A Batchelor." Ironically, Wolcot may have been
            closer to the nonpartisan Toryism of Henry, Viscount
            Bolingbroke in <em>The Idea of a Patriot King</em> (1738)
            than was George III, whose patriotism very much involved
            partisan politics and royal prerogative.</p>
    
            <p class="indent">2<a name="note2" id="note2"></a>. This is
            a selective list. Although there is only one numerical
            estimate of Wolcot&rsquo;s sales, ample anecdotal evidence
            suggests that it is at least not wildly exaggerated:
            "According to Cyrus Redding [a relative] in what is
            possibly an exaggeration, at the height of this period of
            his fame between twenty and thirty thousand copies of his
            work were sold in a single day" (Girtin 113).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">3<a name="note3" id="note3"></a>. Wolcot
            was a wide-ranging man of letters who worked in many other
            forms besides the satires that concern me here, beginning
            with the sentimental <em>Elegy</em> for William Boscawen
            that launched his London career (1768; 1779). He produced
            occasional satires in his native Cornwall and in Jamaica
            before coming to London in 1781. After the success of his
            Royal Academy odes he also published, over the next thirty
            years, art criticism (as well as a volume of aquatints of
            his own landscapes); dramatic prologues, epilogues, and
            criticism; opera librettos and translations; reviews in the
            <em>Monthly Review</em> (1793-96); a blank verse tragedy,
            <em>The Fall of Portugal</em>; and a wide variety of other
            verse, including beast fables, romantic tales, and
            significant contributions (along with Robert Burns) to
            George Thomson&rsquo;s <em>A Select Collection of Scottish
            Airs</em>. His serious verse is reminiscent of James
            Thomson in diction and sentiment.</p>
    
            <p class="indent">4<a name="note4" id="note4"></a>. Tom
            Girtin points out that Wolcot may have suggested this role
            for himself and that Opie in any case included himself in
            this picture as well as the "fiercer" of the two assassins
            (111). As in so many cases the political signification is
            much more equivocal than in Manlius&rsquo;s strict
            ideological reading (and is complicated further by the
            biographical facts of Wolcot&rsquo;s relationship with
            Opie).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">5<a name="note5" id="note5"></a>.
            Wolcot&rsquo;s most political poems in this sense include
            <em>A Commiserating Epistle to Lord Lonsdale</em> (1791)
            and <em>Resignation; An Ode to the Journeymen
            Shoemakers</em> (1794).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">6<a name="note6" id="note6"></a>. Many
            other prints bear witness to Wolcot&rsquo;s influence.
            <em>Affability</em> (1795) takes up the King&rsquo;s habit
            of engaging laborers in conversation, as lampooned
            extensively by Wolcot. <em>Satan in All His Glory, or Peter
            Pindar Crouching to the Devil</em> (1792) is particularly
            important for its portrait of the man himself and for its
            Oedipal misreading of the poem referenced in the image, the
            "Conciliatory Ode" to Lord Lonsdale (see further M. Dorothy
            George 951-52).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">7<a name="note7" id="note7"></a>. When
            Wolcot sued his publisher in 1801, Lord Eldon refused to
            grant the injunction he was seeking on the grounds that his
            works were "libellous publications" (qtd. in Girtin 219).
            But he was never prosecuted in his own right. Gillray,
            according to Paulson, was "drawn into the arms of the
            Tories . . . by a blasphemy prosecution arising from a 1796
            print showing Fox and Sheridan as Magi" (184), and agreed
            to produce propagandistic images in return for a
            pension.</p>
    
            <p class="indent">8<a name="note8" id="note8"></a>. As it
            turned out, Peter&rsquo;s severity would grow much worse
            before he mended, though the increasingly harsh reviews in
            this magazine, as well as other criticisms through the
            early 90s purporting to speak for the king and the nation,
            maintain the aggrieved paternal tone used by the king
            himself (for example) in his proclamations to the
            rebellious colonies in 1775.</p>
    
            <p class="indent">9<a name="note9" id="note9"></a>. Wolcot
            alludes to a meeting of the Privy Council concerning
            himself as early as 1787 in <em>Ode upon Ode</em>: "No!
            Free as air the Muse shall spread her wing, / Of whom, and
            when, and what she pleases sing: / Though privy councils,
            jealous of her note, / Prescribed, of late, a halter for
            her throat" (<em>Works</em> 278). The OCLC database
            identifies Pindaromastix as Joseph Reed, also a possible
            collaborator of William Kenrick on <em>Love in the
            Suds</em> and hence&mdash;assuming both attributions are
            correct&mdash;a veteran fabricator of sodomy charges.</p>

            Johnson&rsquo;s definition notwithstanding (see note 1),
            "patriot" occurs here and in a few other anti-Wolcot texts
            in its straightforward sense, which may have experienced a
            resurgence by the 1790s. Canning, in <em>New Morality</em>,
            uses the word numerous times in both its straightforward
            and ironic senses.</p>

            Nichols actually had printed at least one early manuscript
            poem of Wolcot&rsquo;s submitted by a correspondent
            (<em>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</em> 58.733).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">12<a name="note12" id="note12"></a>.
            Nichols excerpted a significant portion of "The
            Remonstrance" in this review and printed "The Magpie and
            the Robin," one of Wolcot&rsquo;s characteristic beast
            fables, in full in the poetry section of this issue. From
            this point the magazine is noticeably conciliatory toward
            Wolcot: "Peter, under affliction, improveth" (62.155).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">13<a name="note13" id="note13"></a>.
            Dyer&rsquo;s superb calendar of satirical publications
            between 1789 and 1832 provided me with crucial references
            for this article. He is also one of several critics to
            highlight Wolcot&rsquo;s influence on Lord Byron (3).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">14<a name="note14" id="note14"></a>.
            Cobbett must have forgotten his earlier partisanship by
            1816, because in that year he incorporated a defense of
            Wolcot against Gifford in a criticism of the latter, by
            that time editor of the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, in his
            P<em>olitical Register</em> (qtd. in Clark 109). Wolcot had
            in fact been an early patron of Polwhele&rsquo;s and
            Polwhele never repudiated him (see further Girtin 210).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">15<a name="note15" id="note15"></a>.
            Wolcot&rsquo;s actual career in vice must have paled by
            comparison to the excesses of which he was accused in
            print. But in what seems a curious instance of life
            imitating art, Wolcot was tried for criminal conversation
            with his landlady and acquitted in June 1807, when he was
            69. The enraged (or opportunistic) husband charged that
            Wolcot pretended to serve his wife as an acting coach. The
            couple&rsquo;s servants provided (ultimately ineffective)
            testimony that might well have been drawn from the body of
            satire on Wolcot. See further Girtin 226-223.</p>
    
            <p class="indent">16<a name="note16" id="note16"></a>.
            Previous discussion of Wolcot&rsquo;s real sexual
            proclivities has been limited to pointing out that although
            he remained unmarried, his close relationships with much
            younger male prot&eacute;g&eacute;s (Opie most
            famously)"Though they "would in the twentieth century be
            regarded with some reserve" (Girtin 60) "were attended by
            "no contemporary breath of scandal" (67).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">17<a name="note17" id="note17"></a>. The
            numerous and tantalizing references to Peter Pindar in the
            <em>Times</em> beginning in 1787 deserve much more
            extensive treatment than I can give them here.</p>

            Priestley considerately advises the king not to trouble
            himself about a future state. Priestley also features more
            centrally in another Gillray print published the same week,
            which brings out the blasphemy in <em>The Hopes of the
            Party</em>. In <em>A Birmingham Toast</em>, Priestley gives
            the toast "The K[ing&rsquo;s] Head, here!" while holding up
            an empty communion dish.</p>
