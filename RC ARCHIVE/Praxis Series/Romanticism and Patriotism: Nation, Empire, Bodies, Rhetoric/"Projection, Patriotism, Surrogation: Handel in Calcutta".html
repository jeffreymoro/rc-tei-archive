                <p>Unlike the 1770s and 80s, the 1790s were a period of
                consolidation in the British empire. Military victories
                over Tipu Sultan in Mysore and the establishment of the
                Permanent Settlement not only confirmed actual British
                domination in India, but also provided an occasion for
                phantasmatic constructions of global supremacy.<a href=
                "#note1">[1]</a>
                I&rsquo;ve written elsewhere about how these events
                were staged at Astley&rsquo;s Royal Amphitheatre and at
                Sadler&rsquo;s Wells, but in this essay I am more
                concerned with the enactment of masochistic nationalism
                among Britons in Calcutta&mdash;i.e. a nationalism that
                coheres in the pain of its mutilated members<a href=
                "#note2">[2]</a>&mdash;whose
                dynamics are deeply connected to the recalibration of
                British subjectivity following the loss of the American
                colonies. Masochistic nationalism may seem
                counter-intuitive to our normative understanding of
                national character since masochism carries with it the
                connotation of perversion, a turning aside from truth
                or right, and specifically a turning from pleasure to
                pain. But it helps to explain the allegorical tactics
                employed in Calcutta on the particular evening I will
                be discussing in this essay. Prior catastrophic losses
                both in Mysore and in America had a lingering effect on
                future actions in India not only because the British
                could not afford further defeat, but also because the
                primary British actant in the Mysore Wars and the
                Permanent Settlement, Lord Cornwallis, carried his
                experience of defeat at Yorktown, and other American
                campaigns to India when he was appointed
                Governor-General of Bengal.<a href=
                "#note3">[3]</a>
                As an icon of both imperial humiliation and domination,
                Cornwallis plays an oddly double role in the
                celebration of victory over Mysore. Because the
                commemoration of Cornwallis&rsquo;s actions in India
                always carries the threat of re-activating traumatic
                memories of the American war, the performance of
                fragments from Handel&rsquo;s oratorios that I discuss
                in this essay compulsively repeat and repudiate scenes
                of national humiliation. What interests me is the way
                both the actants and the audience, who are largely
                indistinguishable from each other, tie their fantasies
                of national and imperial election to an unresolved
                cultural wound.</p>

              <li>
                <p>The chequered history of British conflict with the
                Sultans of Mysore prior to the early 1790s activated
                deeply felt anxieties not only about the susceptibility
                of British subjectivity to Indianization, but also
                about the viability of the imperial enterprise. As
                Linda Colley has reminded us, news of Britain&rsquo;s
                spectacular defeat at Pollilur in the first Mysore War
                reached London at almost precisely the same time as the
                news of the fall of Yorktown and there was general
                consternation that the entire empire was going to
                collapse (269-77). These anxieties were only
                exacerbated not only by heavily contested accounts of
                British atrocities in India, but also by widely
                circulated captivity narratives from the 1780s which
                revolve around scenes of bodily degradation and
                mutilation. Many of Tipu&rsquo;s prisoners were
                enslaved and forced to fight against the British
                forces. These cheyla battalions were the site of
                intense anxiety because most of the cheylas, or slaves,
                were forced to convert to Islam and were circumcised.
                As Kate Teltscher states, "The British cheylas, marked
                with the stigma of Muslim difference but otherwise
                unconverted to Islam, were stranded in a doctrinal no
                man&rsquo;s land, and the texts reveal their sense of
                marginalization" (240). However, she is also quick to
                point out, following Pratt, that the very fact of the
                existence of the survival narratives performs a kind of
                inoculation of their dangerous contents (243).
                Presented within the frame of a survivor&rsquo;s tale,
                the mutilation of the penis, and by extension of the
                religious and national subject, can be presented and
                contained. However, the line separating circumcision
                and castration is at times hard to discern in these
                texts because the mutilation, whether partial or
                complete, seems to instantiate a form of subjectivity
                that for all attempts at containment continues to
                inhere in the narratives and haunts even the most
                triumphant accounts of victory over Tipu in the early
                1790s.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Like earlier campaigns against the Sultans of
                Mysore, the Third Mysore War did not start well for the
                British forces. The initial campaigns were conducted
                under the leadership of General William Medows, the
                Governor of Madras. Medows served under Cornwallis in
                the American war and despite his prior experience made
                a number of tactical errors that reminded Cornwallis of
                his own miscalculations in Pennsylvania and South
                Carolina.<a href=
                "#note4">[4]</a>
                Tipu took almost immediate strategic advantage in the
                early phases of the conflict and forced Cornwallis to
                take over Medows&rsquo;s command in mid-December of
                1791. Cornwallis undertook one of the most massive
                deployments of men, animals and artillery in British
                military history and eventually conquered the strategic
                fortress of Bangalore. However, insufficient supply
                lines and uncooperative weather prevented him from
                successfully taking Tipu&rsquo;s capital Seringapatam.
                The monsoon and other logistical problems forced
                Cornwallis to retreat.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This anxiety regarding the mutilation of the
                national subject was partially resolved by
                Cornwallis&rsquo;s victory over Tipu Sultan at
                Seringapatam some months later. However, the resolution
                was partial because this conflict did not conclude with
                a decisive military annihilation, but rather with an
                extraordinary diplomatic transferral of money, lands
                and two of Tipu&rsquo;s sons as hostages to British
                rule. That transferral generated three successive
                performances of patriotism in Mysore and Calcutta, each
                of which had a supplementary relation to its immediate
                precursor. On February 23, 1792, Cornwallis himself
                engineered the first of these when he carefully staged
                a spectacle outside Tipu&rsquo;s fortress at
                Seringapatam involving elephants, artillery and
                soldiers in full ceremonial costume, in which he
                publicly received Tipu&rsquo;s two sons, "dressed for
                the melancholy occasion in muslin adorned with pearls
                and assorted jewellry", with a gesture of paternal
                care. The <em>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine&rsquo;s</em>
                account of the event is symptomatic:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Lord Cornwallis received [Tipu&rsquo;s sons] in his
                  tent; which was guarded by a battalion of Sepoys, and
                  they were then formally delivered to his Lordship
                  Gullam Ally Beg, the Sultan&rsquo;s Vackeel, as
                  hostages for the due performance of the treaty....At
                  length Gullum Ally, approaching Lord Cornwallis, much
                  agitated, thus emphatically addressed his Lordship:
                  "These children," pointing to the young princes, whom
                  he then presented, "were this morning the sons of the
                  Sultan, my master: their situation is changed, and
                  they must now look up to your Lordship as their
                  father." The tender and affectionate manner in which
                  his Lordship received them, seemed to confirm the
                  truth of the expression. The attendants of the young
                  princes appeared astonished, and their countenances
                  were highly expressive of the satisfaction they felt
                  in the benevolence of his Lordship. (72: 760)<a href=

                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Teltscher argues that the representation of
                Cornwallis&rsquo;s acceptance of Tipu&rsquo;s sons as a
                scene of paternal benevolence contrasts with the
                popular accounts of Tipu&rsquo;s alleged mistreatment
                of British captives. After the defeat of Tipu in 1793,
                war between the East India Company and Mysore was now
                refigured as a tropological struggle between normative
                and errant models of paternal care. The wide
                circulation of visual representations of this scene, on
                everything from prints to tea-trays, achieved the
                two-fold effect of putting the prior atrocities into
                abeyance and of re-enforcing British fantasies of
                colonial rule as a form of affectionate
                paternalism.<a href=
                "#note6">[6]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This spectacle of military paternalism outside of
                Seringapatam was followed by elaborate celebratory
                performances in Calcutta. A Gala Concert was performed
                using amateur musicians and singers from the ranks of
                the East India Company and an extraordinary number of
                illuminations or projected transparencies were
                displayed throughout the town. Pre-cinematic
                transparencies had been used to powerful effect in
                other colonial locales, but in this case it is the
                screens themselves that are most important.<a href=
                "#note7">[7]</a>
                By illuminating the key offices of the East India
                Company, the celebrations in Calcutta took icons of the
                bureaucratic regulation of subject peoples and made
                them contiguous with Cornwallis&rsquo;s paternal care
                of Tipu&rsquo;s sons:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The Government house as it ought, the swelling of
                  "public cause of pride" surpassed in magnificence
                  grandeur all the rest:&mdash;the symmetry and style
                  of the whole building, was particularly favorable to
                  the occasion, and it was seen and embraced by the
                  ingenious contrivers on this occasion with felicitous
                  effect, the balustrades along the wings were ranged
                  with party coloured lights, and intervening pedestals
                  with lamps in festoons....A transparent painting of
                  32 feet high by 27 completed in its contrast an
                  admirable idea of the whole spectacle; the scene bore
                  a figurative allusion to memorable signature of the
                  preliminary articles; and the introduction of the
                  hostages to Earl Cornwallis on that
                  occasion&mdash;three oriental figures in chief were
                  the most remarkably distinguishable, and we think
                  with propriety of judgement in the artist: They were
                  the Vakeel and the Princes hostages presenting to
                  Britannia, or her genius in the usual habiliment, a
                  scroll&mdash;she appeared seated and behind her a
                  figure of Hercules, emblematic of the great work so
                  completely and speedily performed: above Fame
                  appeared with a medallion of his Lordship and in the
                  background a perspective view of
                  Seringapatam.<a href="#note8">[8]</a>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>The substitution of Britannia and Hercules for
                Cornwallis in this visualization of the hostage
                transaction has the curious effect of hollowing out his
                specific actions in favour of a fantasy of abstract
                national agency here projected onto the surface of
                Company rule. Removing him from the scene and
                re-locating him into an apotheosis of Fame
                simultaneously exemplifies Cornwallis and contains his
                heroism as a subset of Britain&rsquo;s "clement
                bravery."<a href=
                "#note9">[9]</a>
                And does the eruption of femininity into the scene in
                the form of seated Britannia reinforce the notion of
                benevolent rule or undermine the particular
                significance of paternity to this ideological
                construct? It is as though each subsequent allegorical
                gesture calls into question the self-confirming fantasy
                of benevolent paternalism.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>One could argue that Cornwallis&rsquo;s history of
                defeat and victory in colonial warfare makes him a
                volatile emblem of patriotic paternalism. That
                volatility requires not only repeated reassertions of
                his paternality&mdash;as Teltscher demonstrates, this
                ideological assemblage is highly
                over-determined&mdash;but also supplementation by a
                series of more complex phantasmatic constructions which
                not only undo the tight ideological sutures achieved in
                the initial performance, but also raise questions about
                how the nation can be seen at this distance from the
                metropole. The colonial newspaper accounts devote
                extensive coverage to the technical achievements of the
                illuminations that amounts to a subtle declaration of
                cultural superiority of technological modernity.
                Throughout the newspaper coverage there is a
                fascination with how the illuminations transform the
                quotidian spaces of Calcutta into "one continuous
                blaze" of allegorical splendor in which the very loci
                of formerly precarious rule emerge as classical emblems
                of virtue. As the <em>Madras Courier</em> declared,
                "suffice it to say, that where so general a display of
                beauty, splendor, and magnificence were combined to
                render Calcutta, and its vicinity, one of the most
                superb Coup d&rsquo;oeil&rsquo;s it has ever
                exhibited."<a href=
                "#note10">10]</a>
                This declaration of artifice is to the point because it
                both invests in the power of representation and
                recognizes its limitations.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As the papers literally take the reader on a walk
                about town something strange begins to occur. In
                attempting to catalogue all the transparencies, the
                loco-descriptive act testifies to divergent visual
                interpretations of Cornwallis&rsquo;s victory. As the
                papers turn their attention from the official Company
                buildings to the private houses of Company members,
                "Cornwallis" is increasingly figured forth by his coat
                of arms and the buildings become the surfaces on which
                a fantasy of pastoral peace is projected:</p>

                  extended considerably beyond the supporters, and over
                  the crest displayed the roof a superb and splendid

                  temple dedicated to peace; within which was an urn
                  inscribed to the memory of the brave dead; and
                  without the motto <em>Glorious Peace</em>&mdash;the
                  perspective was so happily preserved, that nothing
                  appeared out of proportion, and yet the object
                  immensely distant.<a href=

                this image carries out a crucial act of memorialization
                which simultaneously marks the dead, so that they may
                be forgotten, and projects the viewer forward into a
                state of peace that is not only precarious, but also
                not fully achieved until almost a decade later. Tipu
                would not be killed until 1799.</p>

                <p>If we think of Calcutta on that night as a precursor
                to the image city, then the emphasis on the illusion of
                perspective in the description of both transparencies
                is resonant for it quite literally takes the present
                historical buildings and ruptures their very
                contemporaneity by giving them both spatial and
                historical "depth." In the case of government house,
                the view of Seringapatam puts observers in a position
                of elevated contemplation&mdash;quite literally, the
                lord of all they survey. In the case of Gibbon and
                Brown&rsquo;s house, the everyday residence is
                literally and phantasmatically transformed into a
                picturesque pastoral scene of the kind that Britons
                were well acquainted with not only in the Georgic
                experiments of eighteenth-century poetry, but also in
                picturesque visual representation. Thomson&rsquo;s "The
                Seasons" is the most apposite exemplar of this kind of
                deployment of the prospect as a tool for representing
                good governance and eliminating all manner of social
                resistances.<a href=
                "#note14">[14]</a>
                As Beth Fowkes Tobin demonstrates, these same Georgic
                strategies were vital to William Hodges&rsquo;s almost
                contemporaneous picturesque erasure of warfare in his
                illustrations to <em>Travels in India during the Years
                1780, 1781, 1782 and 1783</em> which was published in
                1793 (117-43). Significantly, the battles being veiled
                by Hodges's picturesque representation of captured
                Indian fortresses are precisely those troubling
                conflicts of the First Mysore War which generated so
                much anxiety among British observers. To employ John
                Barrell&rsquo;s resonant phrase, both Hodges&rsquo;s
                illustrations and the projections in Calcutta
                manipulate light to hide "the dark side of the
                landscape," only here it is not the rural poor who are
                occluded by representation but the ongoing social
                conflict between British imperial power and native
                colonial resistance (1-33).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>We should not be surprised to see geographically
                displaced Britons using the representational strategies
                of an earlier form of patriotic identification to
                figure forth a rather different imperial vision. But
                what remains so resonant here is the very duplicity of
                the image, for the projection of metropolitan fantasy
                is literally cast on the contours of colonial space.
                One has the sense that one could look upon the house of
                Messrs Gibbon and Brown and see conflicting images of
                triumph and ongoing struggle, past victory and present
                strife, the prospect of peace modelled on
                England&rsquo;s past and the portent of continuing
                conflict with Tipu that inheres in the very ground on
                which the viewer walks. And if this overlay of
                contradictory representations and ideological scenes
                isn&rsquo;t complex enough, it is important to remember
                that perspective is understood as a technology suited
                not only to the representation of peace, but also to
                the practice of warfare itself as practised by
                Cornwallis. The British ability to effectively target
                Tipu&rsquo;s fortresses&rsquo;s with their artillery
                relies on precisely the same geometric abstraction of
                physical space as that employed in the transparencies.
                The very technology of war figures forth the fantasy of
                peace.</p>

                <p>Oddly enough, it is the parallel acts of walking and
                reading, that ultimately give the image city its
                political purchase, but it is important to remember
                that this stroll does not climb up to an "eminence" but
                rather ends up in the theatre. Once inside the doors,
                the collocation of might, moderation and pre-cinematic
                visual wonder was similarly enacted in the Gala Concert
                held in the Calcutta theatre:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Entering at the west door, the first object that
                  rivetted the attention was a beautiful semicircular
                  temple, of the Ionic order, dedicated to Victory,
                  placed at the east end, whose dome reached within a
                  foot of the ceiling. In this was placed a
                  transparency, representing a bust of Lord Cornwallis
                  on a pedestal, with the Goddess of Victory flying
                  over it, with a wreath of Laurel in her hand, which
                  she was in the act of placing on his Lordship&rsquo;s
                  brows:&mdash;on the plinth of the pedestal was his
                  Lordship&rsquo;s motto,
    
                  <blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                      <em>Virtus Vincit Invidiam.</em><br />
                      And over the bust<br />
                      <em>Regna Assignata.</em>
                    </blockquote>And on each side of this was a nich,
                    &mdash;in one of which a figure of Fortitude, and
                    in the other, of Clemency, was placed. Over these,
                    and extending the whole breadth of the temple, was
                    a transparent painting of the action of the
                    6<sup>th</sup> of Feb. 1792, and beneath, the
                    following four lines:
    
                    <blockquote>
                      <em>Still pressing forward to the fight, they
                      broke<br />
                      Through flames of sulpher, and a night of
                      smoke,<br />
                      Till slaughter&rsquo;s legions fill&rsquo;d the
                      trench below,<br />
                      And bore their fierce avengers to the foe.</em>
                    </blockquote>
                  </blockquote>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>The contiguity of the emblem of Clemency and the
                images of slaughter encapsulate a specific patriotic
                style that unites the illuminations and the musical
                entertainment. The projected lines are from
                Addison&rsquo;s <em>The Campaign,</em> which celebrates
                the victory of the Duke of Marlborough over the French
                at Blenheim in 1704.<a href=
                "#note15">[15]</a>
                This comparison is bolstered by other elements of the
                poem which represent valiant British troops breaching
                the defences of hillside forts not unlike those
                Cornwallis encountered at Bangalore, Nundydroog and
                Severndroog.<a href=
                "#note16">[16]</a>
                Equating Cornwallis and Marlborough is an extremely
                important gesture not simply because it consolidates
                Cornwallis&rsquo;s heroism, but because it suggests
                that Cornwallis&rsquo;s treaty with Tipu, like the
                Treaty of Utrecht eighty years earlier, will establish
                a balance of power in the Asian subcontinent which will
                permanently check French aspirations to commercial and
                territorial empire. This allusion is effective because
                Tipu was widely supported by the French and British
                observers generally saw war with Mysore as a subset of
                a larger global struggle with France. What the
                projection suggests is that with this victory, the
                British have entered a new phase of imperial
                domination. However, this involves a misrecognition of
                both the past and the future that gets played out in
                the musical celebration.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The accounts of the concert indicate that
                transparencies were illuminated and extinguished in
                order to direct audience attention to various patriotic
                emblems before the performance of excerpts from
                Handel&rsquo;s <em>Judas Maccabaeus</em>. Like the
                mobilization of the prospects in the city itself and
                the citation of Addison&rsquo;s <em>The Campaign</em>,
                the choice of repertoire here takes arguably the most
                famous example of patriotic discourse in the eighteenth
                century and modifies it to suit the present
                circumstance. Contrary to what one might expect, the
                members of the civilian cadre of the Company who put on
                the celebration decided not to perform the famous
                "liberty airs" or even the more direct celebration of
                martial victory, but rather focused on pastoral
                passages which drew attention to the terms of new found
                peace. Act I takes the audience directly to an
                ambivalent moment from <em>Judas Maccabaeus</em> which
                both looks back at momentary victory and anticipates a
                return to war. This return, and its attendant
                anxieties, is averted by a surrogative shift to a
                passage from <em>Joshua</em> which focuses on the
                Israelite conquest of Canaan. This activation and
                containment of anxiety is repeated in the Second Act
                with even more intensity. Despite the celebration of
                conquest at the end of Act I, Act II opens with the
                overture from <em>Samson</em> which calls forth the
                abject and dispossessed leader of the Israelites. This
                invocation of national weakness is answered by a return
                to the closing pastoral scenes of <em>Judas
                Maccabaeus</em>. Thus the evening&rsquo;s entertainment
                both segmented and sutured together often divergent
                patriotic images, texts and oratorios into a hybrid
                performance that engages with and re-configures the
                allegorical objectives of the primary source material.
                The depth of that engagement is breathtaking, for it
                returns to the very scenes of forced conversion,
                circumcision and dispossession which crystallized
                British imperial anxiety in the 1780s.</p>

              <li>
                <p><em>Judas Maccabaeus</em> was originally, and
                continued to be, understood as an allegory for George
                II&rsquo;s victory over the Jacobite rebellion of 1745,
                but as Ruth Smith has argued it is an exceedingly
                complex and ambivalent expression of patriotism (50-7).
                James Morrell&rsquo;s libretto is based on both books
                of Maccabees, but much of its larger argument is
                implied. In 175 BC Antiochus Epiphanes ascended to the
                Syrian throne and was immediately involved in
                expansionist campaigns against Egypt. The Jews under
                Syrian rule were divided into orthodox and hellenized
                Jews who were open to the Greek culture of their
                rulers. Through a series of accommodations between
                these hellenized Jews, represented by Jason, and their
                Syrian rulers, steps were taken to turn Jerusalem into
                a Greek city with Greek institutions. More orthodox
                Jews came to fear that these developments would
                contaminate their religion and the ensuing conflict
                between orthodox and reform factions within the Jewish
                population was interpreted by Syrian rulers as
                rebellion and brutally put down. Following a massacre
                of Jews and a profanation of the Temple, Antiochus
                effectively outlawed Judaism including the act of
                circumcision. In 2 Maccabees these events are
                interpreted as a warning from God not to diverge from
                traditional religious practice: "Now I beseech those
                that read this book, that they be not discouraged for
                these calamities but that they judge those punishments
                not to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our
                nation" (2 Macc 6:12). As Ruth Smith indicates, this
                passage is presented nearly verbatim early in Part I of
                <em>Judas Maccabaeus</em> and needs to be understood as
                the condition of possibility for the oratorio&rsquo;s
                patriotism (59). The period of national, ethnic and
                religious division constitutes that which must be
                overcome to secure the political liberty of the
                Maccabees and by extension their British counterparts.
                This period of chastisement precedes the action of the
                oratorio, which focuses instead on the Maccabees&rsquo;
                revolt against Antiochus&rsquo;s attempt to enforce
                pagan sacrifice among them. The patriarch of the
                family, Mattithias, refuses the edict, flees with his
                sons into the mountains and upon his death establishes
                his sons, Simon and Judas, as the political and
                military leaders of a rebellion against Syrian
                rule.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The oratorio begins at this point in the story, and
                the first two parts track Judas&rsquo;s victories over
                the Syrian forces. Significantly, Morrell and Handel
                relegate much of the military action to the intervals
                between the parts of the oratorio and present the
                audience with retroactive, largely choral, celebrations
                of victory. The spiritual and political centre of the
                work occurs in the beginning of Part III when Simon
                recovers the Sanctuary of the Temple&mdash;i.e. the
                events still celebrated at Chanukah. In response to the
                recovery of the temple and the defeat of his general
                Lysias, Antiochus withdrew his repressive orders and
                Jews could now live in accordance with their own laws.
                The oratorio thus shifts its attention from the
                struggle for religious freedom to the pursuit of Jewish
                independence and concludes with a treaty which
                guarantees independence for the Maccabees. This
                structure allows Handel and Morrell to indulge in some
                of the most resonant celebrations of political liberty
                in the eighteenth century, while downplaying a whole
                series of reverses in the historical account of the
                Maccabees rebellion.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>When excerpts of this oratorio a performed in
                Calcutta in 1792, the audience was confronted with a
                cascade of allegories each laid over the top of the
                other, and like any palimpsest this act of layering
                erases as much as it figures forth. At the centre of
                these layers is the counter-intuitive allegorical
                connection between the Maccabees story and the Jacobite
                rebellion in Handel&rsquo;s oratorio. In order to
                understand the allegory, it is crucial to recognize
                that the Jacobite rebellion was widely understood to be
                part of a larger French threat to English political and
                religious liberty. In this allegory, the Duke of
                Cumberland maps onto Judas, and the alliance between
                Scottish Jacobites and France becomes comparable to
                that of the alliance between the hellenized Jews and
                their Syrian rulers. As Smith states,</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  At first sight, it might have seemed that the analogy
                  would have appeared paradoxical or strained to its
                  intended audiences...; the Maccabean story of a
                  successful rebellion in which the rebels were in the
                  right was apparently being used to celebrate the
                  suppression of a rebellion in which the rebels were
                  in the wrong. But Morrell is careful not to
                  transcribe from Maccabees the instances in which the
                  Jewish opposition resembled the Jacobite campaign,
                  and the parallel is not between Syrians attempting to
                  suppress a rebellion by the native Jewish population
                  and Britain suppressing a rebellion by the native
                  Scottish population. Rather, in the light of the
                  contemporary perception of the rebellion as part of
                  France&rsquo;s plan to dominate Britain politically
                  and forcibly to change its religion, Judas unifying a
                  nation disrupted from within by hellenizers who
                  co-opt foreign hellenizing Syrian forces is
                  equivalent to Cumberland unifying a nation disrupted
                  from within by Jacobites who co-opt foreign Catholic
                  French forces. This factual analogy is given vitality
                  by an emotional one: the purgation of hellenistic
                  tendencies...parallels British affirmation of loyalty
                  after the upsurge of popular anti-Hanoverian feeling
                  in 1742-4. (61-2)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>So in its original context, Judas Maccabaeus
                allegorizes the Jacobite rebellion in order to
                repudiate the larger threat of French aggression and to
                argue for the necessity of purging not only schism, but
                also forms of political reform which threaten to make
                incursions on traditional notions of English political
                liberty. As Sudipta Sen argues, this "natural liberty"
                was not only "enshrined in legislation that reflected
                the intimate connections between liberty, private
                property, and law," but also supported by the
                continuing constitutional investment in the Protestant
                monarchy (13). What becomes portable, therefore, in
                subsequent performances of the oratorio, is its ability
                to call forth the anxious spectre of French aggression
                and the supposedly dire consequences of political
                apostasy or reform. And it is precisely this
                dramatization of disaster averted that fuels the
                oratorio&rsquo;s most patriotic moments. However, the
                activation of these anxieties does not always result in
                their resolution, and their performance has the
                potential to resuscitate past reversals and
                humiliations without fully resolving them.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>With some sense of the political allegory of
                <em>Judas Maccabaeus</em> we can now return to the
                Calcutta theatre and sketch in the remaining
                allegorical layers. Addison&rsquo;s lines on the Temple
                implicitly compare Cornwallis&rsquo;s victory over Tipu
                to the Duke of Marlborough&rsquo;s victory at the
                Battle of Blenheim. What links the two historical
                moments, aside from some obviously wishful thinking
                that the treaty with Tipu will be another Treaty of
                Utrecht, is the fact that British forces prevail
                against alliances between Mysore and France and Bavaria
                and France respectively. The inscription on the Temple
                globalizes the conflict in India by emphasizing French
                involvement in both conflicts and thus establishes the
                alliance needed for translating the Maccabean allegory
                to the third Mysore War. This is crucial because the
                Mysorean uprising of the early 1790s, like that of the
                Scottish Jacobites in the 1740s, needed to be figured
                not as rebellions but as French aggression carried out
                by proxy native forces for the allegory to operate
                properly.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The parallels being drawn between Judas&rsquo;s war
                against Syria, Marlborough&rsquo;s campaign against the
                Franco-Bavarian alliance, Cumberland&rsquo;s
                suppression of the French sponsored Jacobites, and
                Cornwallis&rsquo;s victory over Tipu Sultan all revolve
                around the spectre of French interference in British
                affairs. Impending war with France in Europe is again
                setting up the political and emotional condition for
                the Maccabean allegory to have some purchase on the
                audience. The Calcutta papers were full of the news of
                revolutionary France and the palpable evidence of
                English social and cultural schism in response to the
                French example were as much a topic of concern in the
                colonies as they were in the metropole. Just as the
                adverse incidents which beset the Jews in Syria prior
                to the Maccabean revolt are interpreted as temporary
                punishment&mdash;or "chastening"&mdash;for
                hellenization, the staging of <em>Judas Maccabeus</em>
                in Calcutta plays out the reverses of British fortune
                in the first two Mysore wars not only as punishment for
                comparable prior examples of Indianization in which
                some British colonial subjects adopted the cultural and
                social norms of India, but also as a warning against
                current sympathy towards the French revolution among
                some British constituencies. In both the Maccabees
                story and the revisionist history implied by
                Cornwallis&rsquo;s reforms of the East India Company,
                any deviation from national and racial purity implied
                by openness to surrounding Syrian or Indian society is
                punished and then overcome. This historical comparison
                is crucial because it speaks directly to the current
                moment of social schism in Britain itself. In the face
                of increasingly polarized British reaction to events in
                France, my suspicion is that the celebrants in Calcutta
                are exorcizing the dangers of social and cultural
                apostasy by turning the defeat of Tipu into a
                phanttasmatic victory over France. In other words, this
                performance both chastens the nation by invoking past
                humiliation in the time of political crisis
                <em>and</em> projects the future triumph of the
                re-consolidated nation in a larger geopolitical
                frame.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This fantasy of unification, and its allegorical
                support, may have had particularly strong purchase
                because many of the audience members would have been
                Scots&mdash;the East India Company was composed of an
                inordinate number of Scottish employees. For these
                audience members, the entire allegorical economy is
                predicated on the historical ejection of forms of
                political affiliation perhaps not at all distant from
                some audience members&rsquo; pasts. In very real ways,
                the loyal Scottish members of the Company are the
                normative counter-example not only to past rebels, but
                also to current factions opposed to the actions of the
                state. One of the primary objectives of the Calcutta
                celebration is to crystallize this counter-exemplarity
                in the very space where previous observers, including
                Cornwallis, bemoaned the openness of Company officials
                to Indian styles of sociability.<a href=
                "#note17">[17]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In this context, the earlier British losses to
                Mysore with all their attendant narratives of abjection
                become evidence of Britain&rsquo;s voluntary descent
                into faction and apostasy in the late 1780s and early
                1790s. The allegory is at its most insistent here
                because Tipu&rsquo;s forceable conversion of British
                soldiers to Islam is implicitly compared to
                Antiochus&rsquo;s demand that the Maccabees take up
                Pagan worship. As noted earlier, the anxiety produced
                by forced circumcision and the intense resistance to
                such blurring of religious and ethnic identity is felt
                throughout subsequent representations of conflict in
                Mysore ,and they mirror the Maccabees story in eerie
                and powerful ways. But the allegory replaces the
                Mysorean act of forced circumcision with
                Antiochus&rsquo;s prohibition of the act: that which is
                most terrifying is tropologically cancelled yet
                nonetheless activated. This is because, in the chain of
                allegories, forced Indianization in Mysore is being
                used to figure the openness of both Whig and more
                radical British constituencies to French constitutional
                reform, and thus the voluntary desire for reform among
                Britions is being recast as French desire for the
                absorption of British society. The entire figural
                economy aims to cancel past and present forms of
                voluntary cultural hybridization which were routinely
                satirized as an adoption of Eastern and/or French
                effeminacy by positing an external tormentor who
                violates the cultural, social and sexual autonomy of
                the patriot Briton. Thus the ostensibly prior hollowing
                out of masculinity from the inside is replaced by a
                fantasy of violation which paradoxically re-establishes
                the "integrity" of the patriotic subject at a future
                date. Put bluntly, the disturbing evidence of
                consensual, dare we say seditious, deviation from
                normative masculinity is replaced by a fantasy of being
                raped by the other. This ideological manipulation of
                what Reik in his analysis of Christian masochism refers
                to as "adverse incidents" not only allows the audience
                to re-configure past instances of abjection into
                prophetic signs of future imperial pleasure, but also
                to effectively subsume the real threat posed by Tipu or
                France into a masochistic fantasy where the tormented
                remains fully in control of the scene.<a href=
                "#note18">[18]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Because the Maccabean allegory is so concerned with
                establishing the threat posed by an alliance between an
                internal other and a larger external force, the entire
                event is traversed by fantasies of persecution and
                vulnerability. The Calcutta concert picks at the wound
                in revealing ways. The first Act of the Calcutta
                performance takes a brief recitative and song from the
                beginning of the oratorio&rsquo;s second part which not
                only celebrates Judas&rsquo;s first victory&rsquo;s
                over Syrian forces, but also precedes a return to war.
                This return is negated by a sudden shift to a chorus
                from <em>Joshua</em> which focuses not on the
                contamination of the nation by foreign influence, but
                rather on the triumphant subjection of foreigners.
                <em>Joshua</em>, unlike <em>Judas Maccabaeus</em>, is
                largely about the acquisition of territory&mdash;in
                this case Canaan&mdash;through conquest. The
                surrogative effect of shifting from <em>Judas
                Maccabaeus</em> to <em>Joshua</em> is clarified by
                remembering the role of Canaan in seventeenth British
                theories of governmentality. In her analysis of
                <em>Joshua</em>, Smith argues that</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The partition of Canaan was for Harrington the origin
                  of the Israelite &lsquo;agrarian&rsquo;, the ordering
                  of society based on land ownership which in his view
                  formed the foundation of right government....In other
                  words, the division of Canaan by Joshua under
                  God&rsquo;s direction was the birth of the Israelite
                  nation, and since the division was based on
                  principles of land ownership essential to the
                  prosperity and stability of any society, it was or
                  should be the pattern of all
                  societies&mdash;including, for the audience of
                  <em>Joshua</em>, their own. According to Harrington
                  their agrarian law was the key factor which saved the
                  Israelites from falling into typical eastern
                  servility. (Handel&rsquo;s <em>Oratorios</em>, 251-2)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>This hypostatization of landed property as the
                source of governmental and social security is precisely
                what underpinned Cornwallis&rsquo;s implementation of
                the Permanent Settlement following the 1792 treaty with
                Tipu. And the Permanent Settlement was itself as an
                allegorical policy&mdash;one which utilizes one form of
                social and economic relations to figure forth
                another.</p>

              <li>
                <p>When, in Act 2, Mrs. Elizabeth Barlow, the wife of
                the very man who would attempt to reconfigure Indian
                property relations in terms of British notions of
                landed property <a href=
                "#note19">[19]</a>,
                and Captain Haynes sing the following lines, one is
                presented with the aural equivalent of what C.A. Bayly
                refers to as the Permanent Settlement&rsquo;s "massive
                effort in wishful thinking" (186):</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Oh! lovely peace! With plenty crown&rsquo;d,<br />
                  Come spread thy blessings all around,<br />
                  Let fleecy flocks the hills adorn,<br />
                  And vallies smile with waving corn!<br />
                  Let the shrill trumpet cease<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other sound<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Nature&rsquo;s
                  songsters<br />
                  Wake the cheerful morn (3.27)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>In a significant alteration of Handel&rsquo;s
                oratorio, this song, originally scored for the
                Israelitish woman, is transformed into a duet with the
                counter-tenor Captain Haynes. The uneasy association
                betwen counter-tenor roles and castrati reactivates the
                castration threat at this key moment, but with a
                crucial difference. The audience is presented with the
                civilian and the military wings of the East India
                Company singing in concert. Would it be too much to
                suggest that the duet re-fashions the pastoral moment
                such that the military man is tamed by the implied
                domestic relation between male and female singer? It is
                precisely this sublation of the soldier into the
                paternal, the military into the familial/bureaucratic
                that informs both the treaty ceremony and many of the
                projections. Thus the performance supplements the
                complex re-orientation of Cornwallis as imperial icon
                such that the spectre of castration is put into
                abeyance by the plenitude not simply of the imperial
                father, but of the biopolitical imperatives of the
                middle classes.<a href=
                "#note20">[20]</a>
                This supplemental relation is revealing, for it
                emphasizes that the fantasy of benevolent paternalism
                and the Permanent Settlement are ineffective in and of
                themselves and thus require the deep micrological
                regulation of domestic relations which came to
                pre-occupy British rule in India in the early
                nineteenth-century. As Sen, Collingham and others have
                recognized, sexual and racial deployments which the
                middle classes first utilized to consolidate their own
                power both at home and abroad became crucial norms for
                managing colonial populations.<a href=
                "#note21">[21]</a>
                It is precisely these deployments in the form of the
                singing conjugal pair which are grafted onto now
                obsolete figurations of pastoral peace and which
                re-orient the ideological import of this patriotic
                performance.</p>
    
                <p><em>The American Ghost</em></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>However, the full depth of this re-orientation can
                only be fully understood when we look closely at how
                these pastoral lines are deployed. This happy fantasy
                in which India starts to look like England and the
                future French threat is conveniently consigned to
                allegorical oblivion, is haunted by an American ghost.
                Act 2 of the Calcutta performance opens with the
                overture from Handel&rsquo;s <em>Samson</em>.
                <em>Samson</em>, like many of the Israelite oratorios,
                offers recurrent images of national weakness and opens
                with its hero collapsed on the ground, dispossessed by
                a foreign foe. As Smith argues,</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Samson and the Israelites, no longer hero and
                  inferiors but, at the crisis, equally powerless, wait
                  upon God&rsquo;s aid, and there is no certainty that
                  it will materialize....The nation&rsquo;s setbacks,
                  its oppression by an alien race, the only partly
                  heroic career of its hero, its absolute dependence on
                  divine favour which cannot be claimed to be merited,
                  and its recognition of divine agency in every
                  success&mdash;all these aspects of this oratorio,
                  which recur throughout the librettos of the
                  Israelites, even when taken with the many expressions
                  of faith, strength and confidence which also recur,
                  do not add up to triumphalism. (Handel&rsquo;s
                  <em>Oratorios</em>, 299)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Smith is highly attentive to how anxiety works in
                each of the Israelite oratorios and argues that their
                patriotism is often shadowed by fundamental moments of
                doubt regarding British national election. But the
                performance we are examining in this essay fragments
                these patriotic texts and stitches them together such
                that "adverse incidents" are located in a very specific
                temporal structure. For audience members familiar with
                Handel&rsquo;s music, the overture would have engaged
                the anxiety attending Cornwallis&rsquo;s previous
                failures in America. Read in this way the sudden return
                to the pastoral passages of <em>Judas Maccabaeus</em>
                quoted above would amount to nothing less than an
                attempt to bury some particularly bad memories. But why
                risk engaging the very nightmare of colonial defeat? As
                in the previous allegorical cascade, imperial setbacks
                are mobilized to highlight the act of overcoming them.
                But there is also something else at stake, which lies
                deep in the heart of the allegory itself and perhaps
                explains why everything about this performance seems so
                overdetermined.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>When we consider the historical structure that
                allows the Maccabean allegory to function, what we
                encounter is a figure that cannot help but call forth
                the American disaster. After all the historical
                situation which most powerfully resembles the Maccabean
                story is that of the American colonies in 1776. As Dror
                Wahrman and others have argued, the key problem for
                British subjectivity posed by the American crisis is
                that the people most like them not only take up arms in
                internecine strife but form an alliance with the
                French.<a href=
                "#note22">[22]</a>
                If we run this through the Maccabean allegory, the
                Americans become the hellenized Jews, the French remain
                in the role of the Syrian oppressors, and the English
                find themselves cast as the orthodox Jews. Only in this
                story, no unification is effected, the orthodox Britons
                simply lose and are forced to re-imagine Britishness
                without their American brothers. In this story,
                Cornwallis is desolate, alone and dispossessed; a
                figure not unlike Samson who is in desperate need of
                recuperation. The nightmare of Yorktown becomes
                inextricably linked to the dreams fostered by the
                Mysorean treaty: a dream of Permanent Settlement and
                benevolent paternal rule, no less than a dream of
                global supremacy over France.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Could we not argue that by 1792, this dispossessed
                figure has finally become politically useful, not only
                literally in the sense that he has a job to do in
                India, but also figuratively in the way he is invoked
                in the Gala Concert: as the chastened sign of history
                whose recurrent pain retroactively anticipates the
                pleasures of as-of-yet unrealized imperial domination.
                And it is the ultimate un-presentability of global
                supremacy either in fact or in fantasy that allows for
                its figural presentation in the person of Cornwallis.
                By invoking Lyotard&rsquo;s reading of Kant&rsquo;s
                famous notion of the "sign of history" I am trying to
                suggest that Britons at this moment of patriotic
                investment see human progress as a form of national
                election which is not susceptible to direct
                presentation but rather must operate through a complex
                temporal game in which patriotic enthusiasm&mdash;with
                all its recollected pain and forestalled
                pleasure&mdash;is itself an as-if presentation of
                supremacy.<a href=
                "#note23">[23]</a>
                As a "chastened" sign of history it is a perversion of
                the very notions Kant was attempting to explore in the
                late historical and political writings, but it should
                not come as a surprise because British patriotic
                discourse claims "liberty" in an altogether different
                fashion than Kant&rsquo;s analysis of the French
                Revolution. Throughout this phantasmatic exchange the
                particular term "Briton" trumps any universal notion of
                the human; English "liberty" overrules any abstract
                notion of freedom as the tendency toward the moral idea
                of the Absolute Good; and thus the story inexorably
                reverts to arrogant attributions of God&rsquo;s will.
                As Kaja Silverman states, all adverse incidents, all
                "sufferings and defeats of the fantasizing subject are
                dramatized in order to make the final victory appear
                all the more glorious and triumphant" (196). Imperial
                Britain&rsquo;s calamities in America and Mysore are
                transformed into exemplary and necessary punishments
                which presage a level of future supremacy only God can
                bestow, because it has not&mdash;and we might add, will
                not&mdash;come to pass. But the supposed deviations
                from appropriate national
                character&mdash;Britons&rsquo; flirtations with hybrid
                forms of sociability whether they be understood as
                Indianization or Francophilia&mdash;for which the
                nation has been chastened or is to be chastened will
                become all too evident in the emergent patriotisms of
                the early nineteenth century. They will become the
                negative ground from which racialized notions of
                national election are activated and maintained.</p>

            evidence of Cornwallis's fear of interracial relations see
            Wickwire, 110. As C.A. Bayly argues, "Cornwallis moved
            heavily against European revenue officers involved in
            Indian trade and tried to create a wall of regulations to
            separate the Indian and European worlds&rdquo; (149). See

            consolidation of racial and social hierarchies from the
            Governor-Generalship of Cornwallis. Beth Fowkes Tobin, in
            <em>Picturing Imperial Power</em> (117-8) also argues
            Cornwallis's reforms were designed not only to minimize the
            amount of intermingling between British and Indian subject
            in the realms of commerce and civil administration, but
            also to avert miscegenation. See Collingham, 51-89 for a

            Cornwallis in 1793. He was given responsibility for
            drafting the judicial regulations, known as the Cornwallis
            code. Barlow's correspondence with Cornwallis shows his
            total commitment to the principles embodied in the
            permanent settlement: security of property and government
            accountable to law. Cornwallis was generous enough to say
            that his &lsquo;system' had been based on &lsquo;adopting
