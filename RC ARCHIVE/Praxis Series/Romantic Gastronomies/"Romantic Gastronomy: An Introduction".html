                <p>Romanticism may be associated with gusto, but it has
                hardly been recognized&mdash;at least within literary
                circles&mdash;as the period that saw the invention of
                the restaurant and a unique, comic-philosophical genre
                of writing about food. But in fact Romanticism was
                coterminous with, and in many ways emblematic of, the
                culture of sophistication and social positioning we
                associate with modern gastronomy. On the heels of the
                French Revolution, gastronomy developed as a
                self-conscious aesthetic, modeled on the
                eighteenth-century discourse of taste.<a href=
                "#1"><sup>1</sup></a>
                The gastronomer around the turn of the nineteenth
                century began to make a fine art of food just as his
                better-known peer, the dandy, would do of fashion. Both
                were French-influenced phenomena, figures who crusaded
                for the value of the aesthetic in an age of increasing
                consumerism. The dandy famously flouted bourgeois
                ideals of common-sensical economy, insisting on
                pleasure as a path out of the everyday into the more
                elevated pleasures of the imagination. So too did the
                Romantic gastronomer, a strangely forgotten figure,
                help prepare the way for today's <i>haute
                couture</i>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The current shift in attention across academic
                disciplines from the high to the low, from "The Sublime
                to the stomach" as Harold Bloom remarks (xiv), prepares
                us to consider the fate of the aesthetic
                connoisseur&mdash;the prototype, after all, for today's
                critic&mdash;as he navigates the shift from a rarefied,
                abstracted appreciation for the fine arts to the more
                full-bodied experience of gusto. William Hazlitt
                remains our spokesman for this distinctively Romantic
                aesthetic, first outlined in his 1816 essay "On Gusto."
                Originally published in <i>The Examiner</i> as part of
                "The Round Table" series, Hazlitt's essay defines gusto
                as "power or passion defining any object" (4:77). The
                work in the Round Table was explicitly modeled on the
                early periodical essays of Joseph Addison and Richard
                Steele, and Hazlitt is remembering the analogy Addison
                makes in <i>Spectator</i> #409 between a "mental" taste
                for fine writing and a "sensitive" taste for things
                perceived physically through the palate (450). Addison
                had compared the art connoisseur to a consumer of tea
                with a superbly refined palate, able to discern among
                several different blends, but Hazlitt takes the analogy
                further. Far from the disinterested attitude of the
                Enlightenment critic, who would strive to discern
                particular "beauties" or "defects" in the aesthetic
                object of contemplation in order to pronounce
                definitive taste judgments, the Romantic "Man of Taste"
                calls the full range of his faculties and senses into
                play. In the experience of gusto, "the impression made
                on one sense excites by affinity those of another"
                (4:78).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>With the Romantic revision of taste as gusto, the
                sense of sight is dragged down from its lofty eminence
                at the top of the hierarchy of the senses to a
                thoroughly physiological position in which the eye
                itself, in Hazlitt's words, may "acquire a taste or
                appetite for what it sees" (4:78). Such appetite is
                precisely what eighteenth-century taste theory had
                sought to exclude from aesthetic experience. Sight had
                always been privileged among the senses for the
                cognitive distance it was thought to maintain from the
                object, and the space it therefore allowed for the
                mediating work of representation. In his opening paper
                on "The Pleasures of the Imagination," Addison could
                thus confidently assert: "Our Sight is the most perfect
                and most delightful of all our Senses . . . and may be
                considered as a more delicate and diffusive Kind of
                Touch, that spreads its self over an infinite Multitude
                of Bodies, comprehends the largest Figures, and brings
                into our reach some of the most remote Parts of the
                Universe" (460). Despite the prevalent view that
                aesthetic perception of the Romantic period is also
                marked by this "diffusive" touch&mdash;as in
                Wordsworth's disembodied portrayal of the mind
                that&nbsp; "feeds upon infinity" in <i>The</i>
                <i>Prelude</i> and "draws its nourishment
                imperceptibly" from nature in <i>The</i>
                <i>Excursion</i>&mdash;the Romantic writers for the
                most part sought a more proximate taste experience.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Hazlitt admires Milton for his "double relish" of
                the objects his imagination calls into account, and in
                his essay "On Reading Old Books" insists on the
                necessary ingredients of "the pleasure of imagination
                and of a critical relish" (5:221). Relish (a food in
                its own right) refers specifically to the physical act
                of degustation and signifies the distinctive taste or
                flavor of an object. In the act of re-reading (seeking
                that <i>double relish</i> from the printed text),
                Hazlitt's seasoned eye works to "retrace the story and
                devour the page," often discovering thereby a
                "different relish" from the previous occasion (5:222).
                Hazlitt's ideal reader does not merely consume a text;
                he registers its flavors, an effort that requires (as
                the food or wine connoisseur will explain) both
                olfactory sensation and oral degustation. Smell
                registers flavor, and Hazlitt involves the two most
                subjective sensations (considered chemical rather than
                mechanical in contemporary physiology) in the act of
                mental taste when he suggests that in an inferior
                reading experience, the "sharp luscious flavour, the
                fine <i>aroma</i> is fled, and nothing but the stalk,
                the bran, the husk of literature is left" (5:225). The
                harvest is done and the squirrel's granary is full, but
                we must feel as sick as the knight in Keats's "La Belle
                Dame Sans Merci" if we cannot relish the pleasures of
                the imagination with all our five senses.&nbsp;</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>A book, like fine wine, requires time to age in
                order for its fullest flavor to emerge, and the
                quintessential Romantic critic finds it difficult to
                confront the dizzying array of print culture ready for
                immediate consumption. "There is a want of confidence
                and security to second appetite," Hazlitt complains.
                "New-fangled books are also like made-dishes in this
                respect, that they are generally little else than
                hashes and <i>rifaccimentos</i> of what has been served
                up entire and in a more natural state at other times"
                (5:221). Hazlitt is at once having fun with the
                metaphor of taste and working hard to make the case for
                <i>gusto</i>, a term that had been in use on the
                continent before British taste philosophy stripped it
                of its lustier pleasures and abstracted it into
                aesthetic disinterestedness. In this, Hazlitt, like his
                fellow knights of the Round Table, was in tune with the
                post-revolutionary, gastronomical Spirit of the
                Age.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In his introductory paper to <i>The Round Table</i>,
                Leigh Hunt reconstructs the Arthurian locus classicus
                as a gathering place for Romantic knights errant,
                crusading for the value of aesthetic pleasure in an age
                of consumer materialism. Yet the idealism implicit in
                his project, which, I have suggested, runs parallel to
                dandyism, is complicated by the awareness that the
                Round Table is also a dinner table. Hunt promises to
                keep the "long train of romantic associations and
                inspired works connected with it" fresh in his
                periodical, just as he "shall keep the more familiar
                idea of the dining Table before us" (2:9).&nbsp; When
                he proposes to meet weekly with other members of the
                Round Table "to discuss the merits of a leg of mutton"
                as well as other subjects worthy of critical reflection
                over "a philosophic bottle of wine" (as in the
                epigraph), he captures the flavor of gastronomical
                writing from France. Writing "On the Progress of
                Culinary Art in the Nineteenth-Century" in 1812
                (modeled on the more typical essay on the progress of
                the fine arts, such as that by David Hume), the French
                father of gastronomical literary tradition, Alexandre
                Balthazar Laurent Grimod de la Reyni&egrave;re
                (1758-1837), claims that "The Dining Table has become
                the linchpin of political, literary, financial, and
                commercial matters" (40). For him, this is evidence of
                the great strides the culinary arts had made into the
                province of the fine arts and <i>belle lettres</i>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Napoleon, at the height of his empire, was no
                gastronome, but he too recognized the power of the
                table as an engine of state and emblem of cultural
                prestige. Besides the sumptuous table of his
                arch-chancellor Jean-Jacques Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s,
                to which he would dismiss emissaries with an appetizing
                flourish, Napoleon profited from the exquisite taste of
                his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Charles-Maurice de
                Talleyrand-P&eacute;rigord. Prince Talleyrand held a
                daily conference with his chief officers of the
                kitchen, at which the assembled artists of his staff
                would submit their culinary proposals for the evening's
                meal. Often this involved exquisite taste tests, with
                Talleyrand sampling particular ingredients and sauces,
                conferring on their merits, and pronouncing
                judgment.&nbsp; All provinces of France were
                tributaries to this crowning event of the gourmand's
                day. An Englishman recollecting his travels through
                France from 1802-1805 observed that French gastronomy,
                as treated in Grimod's <i>Almanach des gourmands</i>,
                "embraces one branch of luxury, but a branch
                particularly cultivated by the new rich; whose cellars
                and larders are far better replenished than their
                libraries. This taste has become so general, that many
                booksellers have become <i>traiteurs</i>, and find the
                corporeal food far more profitable than the mental"
                (Pinkerton 2: 196). By January of 1817, the English
                Prince Regent (or future George IV), would score his
                own coup by luring Car&ecirc;me, head of the Romantic
                school of cookery, to Brighton to prepare hundred-dish
                dinners for his guests, transforming the royal summer
                seat into an international resort, and introducing
                British palates to cutting-edge French cuisine. France
                had sparked a culinary revolution in Britain, where new
                institutions, including dining clubs and restaurants,
                were meeting the lifestyles and tastes of the rising
                middle classes. By the time Hunt and Hazlitt had sat
                down to The Round Table, the Parisian high style of
                dining had swept over London.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>While some scholars of late have wanted to downplay
                the influence of the French Revolution on the rise of
                the restaurant as a public forum for discretionary
                dining, there is little doubt that, in its modern
                instantiation, the restaurant is a result of
                revolution. The political events of the 1790s released
                the best French chefs from aristocratic patronage into
                the open market of Paris, where they set up as
                restaurateurs in abandoned hotels or in the arcade of
                the Palais-Royal. With the aristocrats having escaped
                to other cities in Europe, these talented culinary
                professionals found themselves catering to a new
                bourgeois clientele, the <em>nouveaux riches</em>.
                Whereas Addison and Steele had mingled with wits,
                scribblers, politicians, and other members of the
                growing bourgeoisie (financiers, bankers, lawyers) over
                stimulating cups of coffee in the coffeehouses that
                spread from Paris in the 1680s, the birth of the
                restaurant following the French revolution was a
                phenomenon distinct from the coffeehouse culture that
                helped shape intellectual life of Enlightenment Europe.
                The key difference between the coffeehouse, where
                information and conversation were exchanged
                (contributing to the formation of the so-called public
                sphere), and the restaurant of the Romantic period, was
                that the former did not feature food as its primary
                concern. While refreshments and pastries had been
                served in caf&eacute;s, and even more substantial
                victuals in some of the British coffeehouses,
                conversation political and cultural, not food, was the
                focus of attention. This all changed once the
                restaurant spurred by talented French chefs encouraged
                the application of aesthetic principles to the culinary
                arts.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In the culture of gastronomy that soon spread to
                England, food was taken seriously as an object of
                appreciation, offering an occasion for aesthetic
                judgment and the exercise of the higher mental
                faculties, much like other forms of art. Grimod de la
                Reyni&egrave;re thus spoke of syrups
                "consid&eacute;r&eacute;s philosophiquement," just as
                his pseudonymous British imitator Launcelot Sturgeon
                wrote "On Mustard, Philosophically Considered." In
                explaining the purpose of the Round Table, Hunt takes
                up the same tradition when he observes that</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  the most trifling matters may sometimes be not only
                  the commencement, but the causes, of the gravest
                  discussions. The fall of an apple from a tree
                  suggested the doctrine of attraction; and the same
                  apple, for aught we know, served up in a dumpling,
                  may have assisted the philosopher in his notions of
                  heat; for who has not witnessed similar causes and
                  effects at a dinner table? For my part, a piece of
                  mutton has supplied me with arguments, as well as
                  chops, for a fortnight; I have seen a hare or a
                  cod's-head giving hints to a friend for his next
                  essay; and have known the most solemn reflections
                  rise, with a pair of claws, out of a pigeon pie.
                  (2:11)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>There is a world of difference between the
                prototypical apple, appealing to Eve from the forbidden
                tree of knowledge, or knocking Sir Isaac Newton on the
                head with the theory of gravity and other weighty
                matters, and that same apple cooked and "served up in a
                dumpling." From the raw to the cooked is the path
                civilization is supposed to have taken, and Norbert
                Elias has left us a helpful road map of that
                "civilizing process" in Europe. Whereas the biblical
                apple has produced a world of theological exegesis, as
                sizable as the scientific commentary on Newton's law of
                attraction, Hunt finds&mdash;and this is not all
                facetious&mdash;that the roasted hare or stewed cod's
                head can also provoke critical reflection.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Hunt could write philosophically about mutton, hare,
                or cod's head in much the same manner as his friend,
                Charles Lamb, who was originally supposed to have taken
                part in the literary enterprise of the Round Table.
                Lamb's praise of pig is familiar to lovers of
                literature, but his delightful discernment of fish,
                though more obscure, contains the same tenor of
                self-conscious insight about food as an aesthetic
                object of judgment. There are numerous distinctions, he
                suggests, between the golden haddock and a magisterial
                fish such as the turbot: "it hath not that moist mellow
                oleaginous gliding smooth descent from the tongue to
                the palate, thence to the stomach &amp;c. as your
                Brighton Turbot hath, which I take to be the most
                friendly and familiar flavor of any that swims"
                (<i>Letters</i> 3: 253). The turbot may be a fine fish
                for John Bull, but it lacks the heightened sensibility
                Lamb associates with cod's head: "nor has it on the
                other hand that fine falling off flakiness, that
                obsequious peeling off (as it were like a sea onion)
                which endears your cods head &amp; shoulders to some
                appetites, that manly firmness combined with a sort of
                womanish coming-in-pieces which the same cods head
                &amp; shoulders hath" (<i>Letters</i> 3: 253). Lamb's
                fictional Elia was a "true son of Epicurus," a literary
                pose in which to approach the world as a "judicious
                epicure" (<i>Works</i> 1:124). While his devotion to
                crackling, derived from suckling pig, has been
                memorialized in the gastronomical ejaculations of Elia,
                Lamb himself was capable of choosing his friends for
                their gastronomical acumen: "I like you for liking
                hare. I esteem you for disrelishing minced veal. Liking
                is too cold a word, I love you for your noble
                attachment to the fat unctuous juices of deers flesh
                &amp; the green unspeakable of turtle" (<i>Letters</i>
                3: 254). If Hazlitt describes the concept of gusto in
                relation to the fine arts, Lamb brings it to life in
                everyday matters with no small dash of culinary
                expertise.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>It may be odd to consider that the British Romantic
                essayists, along with their literary peers, have yet to
                be read within the gastronomical genre that flourished
                in London from the 1820s. It was only one month after
                his trip to Paris with his sister Mary that Lamb
                published his best-known essay, "A Dissertation Upon
                Roast Pig" (1822). In a letter of September of that
                year to Barron Field, with whom he shared more than one
                fried eel pie, Lamb recognized the degree to which a
                trip to France will leave its mark on one's literal and
                literary palate: "I &amp; sister are just returned from
                Paris!! We have eaten frogs. It has been such a treat!
                You know our monotonous general Tenor. Frogs are the
                nicest little delicate things&mdash;rabbity-flavoured.
                Imagine a Lilliputian rabbit! They fricassee them; but
                in my mind, drest seethed, plain, with parsley and
                butter, would have been the decision of Apicius"
                (<i>Letters</i> 3:253). Lamb admired the work of the
                Roman chef Apicius, whose sixteenth-century annotator,
                Gabriel Hummelberger (Humelbergius) staged a comeback
                in 1829 as "Dick Humelbergius Secundus." Humelbergius's
                <i>Apician Morsels; or Tales of the Table, Kitchen and
                Larder</i> has been attributed to the Gothic novelist
                William Beckford (though I myself suspect the hand of
                Richard Chenevix, reviewer for the <i>Edinburgh
                Review</i>), and it announces "a New and Improved Code
                of Eatics," with "Select Epicurean Precepts," and
                "Nutritive Maxims, Reflections, Anecdotes . . .
                illustrating the Veritable Science of the Mouth." In
                addition to original essays on various aspects of
                cookery and good-living, Humelbergius takes his
                "Nutritive Varieties" (without attribution) from
                Grimod, along with other treatments of meals,
                invitations, and <i>bonne ch&egrave;re</i>.<a href=
                "#2"><sup>2</sup></a>
                If he were not in fact its author, Lamb owned a copy of
                <i>Essays, Moral, Philosophical and Stomachical on the
                Important Science of Good Living</i> (1822) by one
                "Launcelot Sturgeon," which also plagiarizes Grimod de
                la Reyni&egrave;re. For these Romantic writers, "The
                Cook, the Author, and the Bookseller" formed a
                venerable gastronomical trio.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The preceding paragraphs have tried to suggest some
                of the myriad ways in which the early
                nineteenth-century culture of gastronomy influenced
                artistic production of the Romantic period. At a time
                when aesthetics reflected the transition from
                abstracted taste to gusto, the idea of
                disinterestedness gave way to an imperative to show
                <i>interest</i> in all matters gastronomical. The
                French connoisseur Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin could
                thus claim, in his 1826 <i>Physiologie du
                Go&ucirc;t</i>, that a lack of interest in food
                (formerly the poor cousin of the arts) was evidence not
                of aesthetic disinterestedness but of&nbsp; "culpable
                indifference" (198). Lest scholars of Romanticism be
                accused of such indifference, this special issue of
                <i>Romantic Circles Praxis</i> assembles original work
                by authors from different disciplines who have been
                influential in defining the culture (and cultural
                limitations) of nineteenth-century gastronomy.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Carolyn Korsmeyer, author of <i>Making Sense of
                Taste: Food and Philosophy</i> (1999) and <i>The Taste
                Culture Reader: Experiencing Food and Drink</i> (2005),
                opens the volume with a philosophical consideration of
                "Tastes and Pleasures." She considers how, "even as
                gastronomers advance their case for both the aesthetic
                and artistic standing of cuisine, philosophers continue
                to exclude taste from the aesthetic senses and cuisine
                from the arts." She provides a careful analysis of 1)
                the nature of the sense of taste and its alleged
                limitations by way of contemporary science and the work
                of Brillat-Savarin; and 2) the arguments for and
                against the status of the pleasure received through
                this sense (and its cousin smell) to qualify as
                aesthetic pleasure or value. The question driving the
                essay is whether or not, given the recent emphasis
                across the disciplines on the body, or somatic part of
                subjectivity, we have reached a perspective from which
                we might legitimately obfuscate, even obliterate, the
                longstanding distinction between gustatory and
                aesthetic taste pleasures so central to Western
                philosophical tradition.</p>

              <li>
                <p>In "Economies of Excess in Brillat-Savarin, Balzac,
                and Baudelaire," Joshua Wilner, author of <i>Feeding on
                Infinity: Readings in the Romantic Rhetoric of
                Internalization</i> (2000), examines the legacy of
                gastronomical writing in the work of Honor&eacute; de
                Balzac and Charles Baudelaire. He shows how these
                nineteenth-century French authors polemically engaged
                the Romantic Gourmand, Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin,
                on his culpable indifference toward wine, a focal point
                in food connoisseurship today. Together, Balzac's
                supplementary commentary on Brillat-Savarin's
                <i>Physiologie du go&ucirc;t</i> and Baudelaire's 1850
                essay "Du Vin et du haschisch compares comme moyens de
                multpilier l'individualit&eacute;" comprise a
                counter-discourse of gastronomy that tips moderation
                into excess and sobriety into sublimity.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Swerving from theory to praxis, Michael Garval,
                author of "Grimod de la Reyni&egrave;re's <i>Almanach
                des gourmands</i>: Exploring the Gastronomic New World
                of Postrevolutionary France" (2001) and&nbsp; "Grimod's
                Gastronomic Vision: The Frontispieces for the
                <i>Almanach des Gourmands</i>" (2004) as well as
                translator of Grimod's <i>Almanach des gourmands</i>
                and <i>Manuel des Amphitryons</i> (2005), introduces us
                now to "Alexis Soyer and the Rise of the Celebrity
                Chef." Whereas gastronomers beginning with Grimod and
                Brillat-Savarin established their reputations as Men of
                Taste based on the analogy between culinary and textual
                consumption&mdash;the p&acirc;t&eacute; posed in place
                of the poem, the pen in place of the knife for these
                Romantic geniuses of the gullet&mdash;culinary artists
                had less experience navigating the divide between the
                fine and practical arts. Here we see how the French
                &eacute;migr&eacute; chef, Alexis Soyer, with a
                penchant for dressing like a dandy, modeling himself on
                Romantic celebrity figures such as Lord Byron and
                Napoleon, rose to fame as a high-cultural icon in a
                series of publications from the mid-nineteenth century.
                Garval provides an analysis of Soyer's role in
                Victorian fiction, as well as his own
                self-representation through text and almost three-dozen
                images, that reveals the many ways in which this
                enterprising celebrity-chef challenged the cultural and
                philosophical prejudices discussed by Korsmeyer from
                the ground up.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Far from attempting an exhaustive survey of Romantic
                Gastronomy, this special issue of <i>Romantic Circles
                Praxis</i> aims to suggest how attention to this topic
                may help us begin to reevaluate many longstanding
                assumptions about the nature of pleasure and its
                relations to the arts and sciences in British and
                French culture of the early nineteenth century. If it
                accomplishes little more than revealing the range of
                and quality of scholarship that has already been
                devoted to the topic, whetting the appetite of readers
                for further research, it will contribute toward this
                broader objective. In the current configuration of
                Romantic studies, a number of critical concerns meet at
                the nexus of nineteenth-century gastronomy. These
                include, but are hardly limited to, the dietary
                politics of Romantic writers, including the discourse
                of vegetarianism and colonial food products; questions
                of gender related to domestic economy, food
                preparation, and the professionalization of the
                culinary arts; and the literary-critical principles of
                gastronomy as a genre on the margins of
                nineteenth-century prose intersecting with the novel,
                antiquarian and miscellaneous writings, historical
                fiction, and the anthology. Above all, Romantic
                Gastronomy lends itself to praxis, "call it the
                Romanticism of the restaurant-bookstores, which
                increasingly surrounds us" (Bloom xiv). It is my belief
                that an exploration of this unique brand of aesthetics,
                with a preference for the outr&eacute; and modes of
                expression often verging on the pornographic, may offer
                a promising road not (hitherto) taken for Romantic
                studies.</p>
