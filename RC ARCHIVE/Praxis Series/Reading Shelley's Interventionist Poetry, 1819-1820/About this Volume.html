    <p>A note on the cover: The images in the cover montage are derived from other Websites. The calvary officer with raised sword, poised above a member of the crowd at St. Peter's Field on the day of the infamous Peterloo Massacre, is extracted from a larger rendering of the massacre available at the <a href="http://www.chadderton-hs.freeuk.com/">Chadderton Historical Society</a> Website on their excellent <a href="http://www.chadderton-hs.freeuk.com/page9-ploo.htm">Peterloo Massacre</a> page. The images underneath the former consist of three renderings of Caroline of Brunswick, reputedly by Issac Cruikshank, previously available at a site devoted to the promotion of the Brighton and Hove regions of England. Finally, in the bottom right quadrant of the background is an image of a reform banner, by George Cruikshank, taken from Romantic Circles's own electronic editon of William Hone's <i><a href="/editions/hone/index.html">The Political House that Jack Built</a></i>, edited by Kyle Grimes.</p>

    <h3>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series<a name="series"> </a></h3>
    <p>The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship. The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> was formerly known as <b>Romantic Praxis: Theory and Criticism</b>. The name was changed in November 1999.</p>
