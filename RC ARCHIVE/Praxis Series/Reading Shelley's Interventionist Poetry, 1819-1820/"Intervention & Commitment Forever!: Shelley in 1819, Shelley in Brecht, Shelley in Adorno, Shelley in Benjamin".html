    <p>Shelley in 1819&#8212;not to mention England in 1819&#8212;generates extraordinary legacies for artistic and critical history. Among them has been the question of what constitutes the phenomenon we call <i>interventionist</i>, <i>committed</i>, <i>politically engaged</i> art and criticism. A number of approaches to Shelley's 1819 have emphasized the distance between apparently activist poems--<i>The Mask of Anarchy</i>, for example&#8212;and what is deemed Shelley's High Style: presumably aestheticist, representationalist poetry of the "lyric I."<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some recent analysts of the grounds and processes of engagement find that the <i>Mask</i> and kindred poems successfully, even courageously forego canonical lyric privilege, building or gesturing towards real-world community. Others assess Shelley's interventionism as good-faith (or even bad-faith) failure; they contend that the activist poetry ultimately reveals a baleful formalism and lack of immediate practical consequence that unites it with Shelley's more evidently idealist art. Much of interest has been said on both sides and in between, but it's worth noting that, for understandable reasons, a good deal of this criticism proceeds implicitly or explicitly from Marxian-derived premises that have had great impact on nineteenth- and twentieth-century notions of "commitment." And probably because of yet again-renewed attention across the Humanities, during the last several years, to Walter Benjamin and Theodor Adorno, these Shelley-interpretations have frequently been in dialogue with, or dependent on, Frankfurt School Critical Theory.</p>

    <div style="margin: 6px; font-family: arial; font-size: 14px"><p>Kaufman's subtle, dialectical negotiations of "retrojection" and radical genealogy are just right for this complex topic, a form of literary history that brilliantly illuminates the importance of the Shelley-Brecht "line."</p></div>
    </div>
    <p>The retrojection (the analogizing, arguably anachronistic application to Shelley) of Marxian, Marxian-inflected, and Frankfurt rubric has, with a few exceptions, proceeded without awareness of a remarkably direct literary trajectory that runs in the opposite direction: <i>from</i> Shelley right <i>to</i> the charged debates of the Frankfurt School and artists alongside it. In a further twist, one of the other great figures of twentieth-century commitment, Jean-Paul Sartre, writes his 1947 manifesto of <i>engagement</i> in the immediate aftermath of 1930s and '40s Critical Theory and adjacent artistic constellations. By 1962 it will fall, as if in historical spiral, to an older Adorno to re-represent his and others' positions when he belatedly answers Sartre's "Qu'est-ce que la litt&#233;rature?" In its German original, "Commitment" (as the relevant Adorno essay is known in English) bears as its title precisely the term for Sartre's doctrine itself, since the same word&#8212;<i>engagement</i>&#8212;is historically used in German (brought over from French, a few centuries ago) to designate the phenomenon at issue. If space permitted, there'd be a complicated story to tell about Shelley's place in Sartre's literary politics, though Shelley has only the briefest of cameos in "Qu'est-ce que la litt&#233;rature?" (Sartre actually had been prone to worrying, in his earlier correspondence and notebooks, that Shelley had a greatness, and more troublingly, a handsomeness, that had been denied to Jean-Paul.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>) But on to the Germans...</p>

    <div style="margin: 6px; font-family: arial; font-size: 14px"><p>In <i>Shelley's Satire</i> the comparison is based on recognizing that both Shelley and Brecht are <i>satirists</i>, who thus share certain rhetorical stances, weapons, and assumptions. It was Walter Benjamin who argued that Brecht was a satirist in the (satiric) tradition of Marx himself ("Brecht's Threepenny Novel," <i>Reflections</i> 202).</p>
    <p>Of course the two writers are ultimately separated by the immense gulf of a century of crucial historical difference. Dialectical historical readings of both must take place across this inevtiable divide. With that said, "Skepticism toward Shelleyan hope and idealized 'freedom' in general is a useful antidote for some tempting historical oversimplifications of <i>our</i> present. By the same token, Brecht can help us to appreciate what is truly strange, characteristically Romantic in Shelley's satire: its admixture of represented violence and hope" (<i>Shelley's Satire</i> 104).</p></div>
    </div>
    <p>A few critics have briefly discussed Brecht's interest in Shelley. Steven Jones's illuminating <i>Shelley's Satire</i> expands this body of commentary, not only by offering nuanced interpretation of Brecht's recourse to <i>The Mask of Anarchy</i> for his 1947 satire "Der anachronistische Zug oder Freiheit und Democracy," but also by remarking the importance of Brecht's 1938 translation of, and essay on, Shelley's <i>Mask</i> (103-105)<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>. In a footnote, Jones gestures toward the significance of a crux somewhat beyond the limits of his own study, though happily consonant with it (183-84 n.24). This crux has otherwise been virtually ignored by historians of literature, poetics, and critical theory. Jones notices that one of Benjamin's posthumously-published, extremely influential Baudelaire essays (written in 1938) presents a one-stanza quotation and two-sentence analysis of&#8212;along with a gnomic reference to&#8212;an apparently unpublished Brecht translation of lines from Shelley's rollicking, "Satanic," anti-Wordsworthian satire <i>Peter Bell the Third</i><a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Jones also observes that <i>Peter Bell the Third</i>'s famous line about Hell being "a city much like London" reappears in Brecht's 1941 poem "Nachdenkend &#252;ber die H&#246;lle" ["On Thinking About Hell"].<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a> In fact, these materials are part of a larger cache, which plays a fascinating role in both Modernist art and Critical Theory.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>In 1936, Brecht, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Wili Bredel become the editors of the new, Moscow-based journal <i>Das Wort</i> [<i>The Word</i>]. <i>Das Wort</i> is established, by leftist exiles from Nazi Germany, as a Popular Front, Communist-led "anti-fascist literary journal"; it publishes texts by everyone from Thomas, Heinrich, and Klaus Mann, to Langston Hughes, Hemingway, Anna Seghers, Luk&#225;cs, Benjamin, C&#233;sar Vallejo, and others. In June 1937, <i>Das Wort</i> publishes <i>The Mask of Anarchy</i>'s final 55 stanzas as translated by the Expressionist poet, playwright, novelist and critic, Alfred Wolfenstein, who had fled Germany for Prague in 1934, and who would soon, upon the Wehrmacht's entry into Czechoslovakia, flee to France until it too would be occupied by Hitler.<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> Back in 1922, the publisher Paul Cassirer&#8212;Ernst Cassirer's cousin&#8212;had published a slim, gorgeous edition of Wolfenstein's Shelley translations: <i>Dichtungen</i> [<i>Poems</i>] of Shelley. (Wolfenstein had also written a translation-treatment of Shelley's play <i>The Cenci</i> for a 1924 Berlin theatrical production.) The <i>Dichtungen</i> had featured excerpts from <i>Adonais</i>, <i>Hellas</i>, and <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>; the entirety of various shorter works (such as "Alastor," "Ode to the West Wind," and "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty"); and a number of still shorter lyrics, including "England in 1819." Though <i>Dichtungen</i> hadn't included the <i>Mask</i>, Wolfenstein, in the <i>Dichtungen</i>'s Afterword, quoted liberally from it.</p>

    <div style="margin: 6px; font-family: arial; font-size: 14px"><p>Again one thinks of Benjamin's cabbalistic angel of history, a useful figurative analog to Shelley's shapes of light and a salutary counterweight to Arnoldian reductionist "angels" (<a href="/praxis/interventionist/kipperman/kipperman.html#par#5">cf. Kipperman</a>.) As Kaufman argues here (and has continued to expand <a href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/reviews/wolfson.html">elsewhere</a>), Benjamin's infamous "magic" and Shelley's infamous idealism are both capable of being re-evaluated under a different construction of the aesthetic.</p></div>
    </div>
    <p>Indeed, Wolfenstein's Afterword to Shelley's <i>Dichtungen</i> is quite an undertaking: he insists on the radical unity of Shelley's work, the ways that the seemingly idealist and activist modes inhere within each other. He specifically transvalues&#8212;or bounces off Swinburne's transvaluation&#8212;of the Arnoldian "Shelley the ineffectual angel," conceding that Shelley <i>was</i> angelic, provided one remembers the terrifying nature of angelic presence. Bringing together <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>, the <i>Defence of Poetry</i>, the <i>Mask</i>, various H&#246;lderlin poems, and a string of allusions highly resonant for a Left German tradition that tended to think in terms of Promethean assaults on the heavens (from Goethe's work, to Marx's and Engels's lines about the Parisian Communards having "stormed heaven itself"), Wolfenstein maintains that Shelley's "idealism" is best understood as poetry's fierce judgment of a world built on oppression and suffering (Nachwort 87-94).<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>In January 1938, six months after publishing Wolfenstein's <i>Mask</i> translations, <i>Das Wort</i> publishes a lengthy essay on Shelley by Walter Haenisch. Haenisch had left Berlin for Moscow in 1931, to work on the <i>Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe</i>, the multi-language Collected Works of Marx and Engels. Haenisch's article on Shelley, less literary and more overtly focussed on particulars of socio-historical context than Wolfenstein's 1922 Afterword, nonetheless shares affinities with it, above all, concerning the unity of Shelley's work. Haenisch treats many of the same poems as Wolfenstein, and, like him, stresses the significance of Shelley's having been primarily a <i>lyric</i> poet&#8212;a crucial factor, Haenisch indicates, in Marx's and Engels's championing of Shelley. After discussing various poems in relation to their socio-political contexts, Haenisch suggests that an <i>oeuvre</i> encompassing both <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> and the <i>Mask</i> is at one with the project undertaken in <i>Das Kapital</i>. (Such an idealist-materialist coalition, incidentally, develops a parallel history on the Western side of the Atlantic in the same era, and one of its guiding lights is the Shelleyan [and, as Russell A. Berman has recently shown, the very steeped-in-German-philosophy] radical scholar-activist W.E.B. Du Bois. Du Bois's Shelleyanism is consciously taken up or shared by a range of figures across Left and African-American culture, extending all the way to veteran Popular Front individuals like Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, and the labor organizer Ella Reeve "Mother" Bloor, committed Shelleyans all.<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a>)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>So in 1937 and early 1938, Brecht and Benjamin are reading this Shelley-discourse in a journal they're both associated with and for which Brecht, in fact, serves as a principal editor. In June 1938, Benjamin joins Brecht in Svendborg, Denmark, where the two work together for several months, sharing ideas and manuscripts. In July, Brecht writes and gives to Benjamin a group of essays intended for <i>Das Wort</i>; there is substantial evidence that Brecht talks through the essays with Benjamin as (or just after) he drafts them.<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a> Some of these essays, which take issue with Luk&#225;csian realism and defend the critical value of experimental art, have been familiar to Anglo-American readers since 1977, when they appeared in <i>Aesthetics and Politics</i>.<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a> Brecht went ahead and submitted the essays to <i>Das Wort</i>, which never published them.<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a> But in addition to fears about rocking the Orthodox boat, the other editors of <i>Das Wort</i> may also have declined to publish Brecht's essays in order to protect Brecht himself. If so, they had good reason; which is to say, this story's materials get grimmer: a few months after <i>Das Wort</i> had published Walter Haenisch's January 1938 Shelley essay, Haenisch became one among legions falsely accused, amidst the general insanity in Moscow, of "Trotskyite" and/or "Social-Fascist" espionage. Haenisch was denounced and executed as a "people's enemy."<a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

    <p>The most telling absence in Brecht's translation of the <i>Mask</i> are the most blatantly "idealist" passages in Shelley, the lines on the allegorical Hope and the symbolist Shape, from what is arguably the crux of Shelley's original poem.<br/>
    --- --- ---<br/><b>Kaufman's response to the response</b>:<br/>
    A full consideration of adjacent Brecht texts, not possible here because of reasons of space, would establish that the omission of the <i>Mask</i>'s dream-frame and its more "idealist" vocabulary expresses Brecht's immediately tactical rather than final approach to the question of poetry's "idealism." This is a matter on which Brecht himself will provide extraordinarily interesting evidence when he offers an unexpectedly positive reception, in the immediate aftermath of his reencounter with Shelley, of what is undoubtedly a go-for-broke case of lyric "idealism": Wordsworthian lyric aura. In Brecht's own eyes, his own more-than-a-century-later situation certainly separates him from certain aspects of Shelley's style, and perhaps above all from aspects of Shelley's diction; but Brecht elsewhere readily concedes that he has his own, necessary poetic "idealism," and that the dream-frame or dream-vision in general is far from anathema to his conception of a committed, engaged, and/or interventionist aesthetic.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>One of these unpublished Brecht essays of July 1938&#8212;which unfortunately isn't included in <i>Aesthetics and Politics</i>,<a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a> and which has never appeared in translation&#8212;is "Weite und Vielfalt der realistischen Schreibweise" ["Range and Diversity of the Realist Literary Mode"] (<i>Werke</i> 22.1: 423-434 and 22.2: 1035-1037nn.).<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a> The essay's central exhibit is Brecht's quotation, translation, and analysis of 25 stanzas from Shelley's <i>Mask</i>. (The crackling translation's almost absolute literalness departs intriguingly from Wolfenstein's <i>Das Wort</i> translation of the <i>Mask</i> the previous year.<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a>) The "great revolutionary English poet P.B. <i>Shelley</i>," Brecht claims while beginning his translation-commentary, demonstrates how a vital fusion of aesthetic experiment, speculative imagination, and song may lead to, rather than away from, critical mimesis of the real (the latter being virtually synonymous, throughout "Weite und Vielfalt," with commitment) (<i>Werke</i> 22.1: 424-425, 430, 432-433; emphasis in original: "den grossen revolution&#228;ren englischen Dichter P.B. <i>Shelley</i>").<a href="#16"> </a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>At the same time that he translates and analyzes the <i>Mask</i>, Brecht also translates nine stanzas from Part III of <i>Peter Bell the Third</i>, which apparently remain unpublished throughout Brecht's lifetime.<a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a> Brecht immediately gives his <i>Mask</i> essay-translation and the <i>Peter Bell</i> translation to Benjamin; Benjamin copies out the <i>Peter Bell</i> stanzas, preserving them in the pages we know as the <i>Passagen-Werk</i> or <i>Arcades Project</i>.<a href="#17"><sup>17</sup></a> As already mentioned, Benjamin also quotes, and briefly comments on, <i>Peter Bell</i>'s "Hell is a city much like London" stanza in his "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire"&#8212;an essay whose manuscript Brecht in turn reads and copies out portions of for the fragments <i>he's</i> writing on Baudelaire.<a href="#18"><sup>18</sup></a> The Brecht-Benjamin interchange, amounting almost to collaboration, is so intertwined that it's hard to tell the order of influence among these July and August 1938 writings. Limits of space allow me to say here only that a shared set of subsequently-celebrated images and ideas appears in Brecht's Shelley essay, Benjamin's Baudelaire essay, and then Brecht's Baudelaire meditations and later poetry.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>More remarkable still is an extended passage on Shelley and Baudelaire in the <i>Passagen-Werk</i>; based on Brecht's translation of the nine <i>Peter Bell</i> stanzas, it's clearly the fuller version of the super-compressed but better-known comparison of Shelley and the French poet that Benjamin offers in "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire." In the <i>Passagen-Werk</i> entry "Zur Bilderflucht in der Allegorie" ["On image-flight in allegory"], Benjamin more extensively develops the comparison of Shelley and Baudelaire. The remarks gesture toward a sense of how the two poets' particular approaches to allegory illuminate the mode's modern fate in general:</p>
    <blockquote>
    The incisive effect [of <i>Peter Bell</i>] depends... on the fact that Shelley's <i>grasp</i> [<i>Griff</i>] of allegory makes itself felt. It is this grasp that is missing in Baudelaire. This grasp, which makes palpable the distance of the modern poet [Baudelaire] from allegory, is precisely what enables allegory [in Shelley] to incorporate into itself the most immediate realities...&#8212;Shelley rules over the allegory, Baudelaire is ruled by it. (<i>Arcades</i> 370, translation slightly emended; emphasis in original translation ["<i>grasp</i>"]); <i>Das Passagen-Werk</i> I: 468 [<i>Gesammelte Schriften</i> vol. V.1: 468] (emphasis in original ["<i>Griff</i>"]) <a href="#"> </a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Benjamin says a good deal more, but his point isn't to proclaim Shelley the greater poet. He implies instead that a turn in modernity and the history of aesthetic "aura" has made Shelley's critical allegoresis unavailable to Baudelaire. Baudelaire is too distanced from&#8212;from what? Benjamin's answer is that Baudelaire feels himself too distant from auratic distance itself; the auratic distance linked to lyric poetry and aesthetic autonomy is, to put it differently, what generates the allegoresis that Shelley can still undertake. The rest of Benjamin's analysis is well known: Baudelaire's intermittently critical triumph will be to make lyric poetry sing&#8212;severely and intensely&#8212;its own apparent impossibility in the age of art's mechanical or technical reproducibility.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>While this is not the place for full-scale treatment of allegory's crisis in Baudelaire (and Benjamin's ideas about allegory's career in modern poetics thereafter), a few words are in order. <i>Allegory</i> is of course the charged term whose modern reprioritization over <i>symbol</i> stems in no small measure from Benjamin's 1928 study of the German play of lamentation, the <i>Trauerspiel</i>.<a href="#19"><sup>19</sup></a> For Benjamin, allegory's initial point of departure is that it represents the broken, ruptured truth of attempts at prematurely "symbolic" reconciliation. Hence allegory signifies its own necessarily non-identical&#8212;thus potentially critical and constructionist&#8212;character. Suffice to say here that the <i>Passagen-Werk</i> section about Shelley, Baudelaire, and allegory is one of the key instances where Benjamin articulates his formal theory (of allegory's proto-critical and constructionist nature) together with an historical instance of a lyric poet whom Benjamin and his circle definitely regard as progressive and committed: whom they regard, indeed, as <i>den grossen revolution&#228;ren Dichter</i>.<a href="#20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The 1938 matrix of Shelley, Baudelaire, and allegory generates two trajectories that presently concern us: towards the later art of Brecht, and the philosophical aesthetics of Adorno. Brecht, already having brooded over the poetic kindling, finds it reignited when, in his already-strange Los Angeles exile, he belatedly learns (in 1941) of Benjamin's suicide at the Spanish border. The news contributes importantly to the devastating <i>Hollywoodelegien</i> [<i>Hollywood Elegies</i>] and texts bound chronologically, thematically, and formally to them (some of which are gathered in the <i>Werke</i>'s <i>Gedichte im Exil</i> section). It's rarely been noticed that, among these texts, not only "Nachdenkend &#252;ber die H&#246;lle" ["On Thinking About Hell"] is indebted to the figure that that poem calls "mein Bruder Shelley." In fact, the larger groupings of related poems and drafts&#8212;which include three texts explicitly focussed on Benjamin's suicide&#8212;are saturated with themes, directly-translated quotations, paraphrases, and images from Shelley: especially from <i>Peter Bell</i> and the <i>Mask</i>, but from the <i>Defence of Poetry</i> and other texts as well.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Just as significant, in these poems, are Brecht's very complex treatments of tonal register, his stereoscopically-introduced-and-mutually-dissolving images, and a syntax of deceptive ease and elegance whose unreeling builds rather than releases tension.<a href="#21"><sup>21</sup></a> All of which, Brecht signals time and again, come in no small part from that Romantic source, Brecht's "Bruder Shelley," who seemed to have found political militance inseparable from lyric impulse and aesthetic autonomy. It is not overshooting the mark to say that Brecht's almost too-terrible decision&#8212;to write wartime elegy that could be taken for bitter satire, and vice versa&#8212;should count as powerful, and intriguingly <i>late Modernist</i>, evidence for the acute readings various critics have offered of <i>Peter Bell the Third</i>'s historical originality: its relentless insistence on thinking modern lyric and satiric impulse together, and on thinking both in relation to modern poetry's ways of taking history's measure.<a href="#22"><sup>22</sup></a> It seems barely necessary to add that Brecht's efforts reinvent, <i>via Shelley</i>, exactly the critical possibility Benjamin had seen as only fitfully available&#8212;almost against itself, certainly less definitively than <i>in Shelley</i>, and perhaps, Benjamin had thought, for what had been its historical endgame&#8212;in Baudelaire.</p>

    <div style="margin: 6px; font-family: arial; font-size: 14px"><p>"Shelley-infused" usefully expresses a certain kind of intertextuality in literary history that goes beyond "influence"--how (in the culinary sense of infused oils) something of the material "essence" of one poet's work can be captured and transmitted through another's work even in the absence of obvious allusion.</p></div>
    </div>
    <p>Brecht gives the Shelley-infused poems to Hanns Eisler, who works with the <i>Hollywoodelegien</i> and who then, one Los Angeles night in October 1942, sits down at the piano and premieres these impossible <i>lieder</i> for an audience consisting of Brecht, Hans Winge, and Herbert Marcuse. Brecht only ups the ante by testily noting Eisler's distressing tendency, when Eisler "speaks about, [though] not when he composes" the settings, to drop the elegies' significance down a rhetorical or formal-stylistic notch (<i>Bertolt Brecht Journals</i> 257-258).<a href="#23"><sup>23</sup></a> That's a fantastic micro-dispute to consider, since Eisler, far from undertaking a wholesale genre-stripping or programmatic levelling of still-too-high and auratic elegiac verse, instead so virtuosically runs Schubertian and Schumannesque <i>lieder</i>, French <i>chanson</i>, and Sch&#246;nbergian twelve-tone composition in and out of one another, that it is hard to miss the settings' recognizably Modernist <i>tour de force</i> of newly-achieved form and voice. It's as if the (proto-post-Modern) "levelling" holistically occurs in what Brecht hears as Eisler's irritatingly interpretive-judgmental comments, so that the work itself can then move on to enact its real, critical desideratum: Modernist virtuosity in the exploration, coordination, and imaginative synthesis of extremely diverse literary-musical materials and dauntingly various stylistic currents. Brecht acknowledges as much when he rather bluntly insists, against Eisler's alleged murmuring about the poems' mere occasionality or jottedness, on the <i>Hollywoodelegien</i>'s compressed monumentality and <i>gravitas</i>: "these are full-scale poems" and "in fact the compositions are probably really important as music too" (<i>Bertolt Brecht Journals</i> 238).<a href="#24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>On the page and in Eisler's settings, the poems exert a profound influence, across at least three continents, on late Modernist poetry and, to a lesser degree, music composition. Indeed, with their complicated reception-histories, the <i>Hollywoodelegien</i> and the poems immediately connected to them testify to the unexpectedly continued, vibrant existence <i>of</i> late Modernism, well into the era commonly called post-Modern (and in which Modernism is framed as canonical or reactionary object of critique).<a href="#25"><sup>25</sup></a> The very fact of the elegies' Modernist aesthetic and declaredly critical-Romantic lineage, which for Brecht seems indissolubly linked to the poems' unblinking view of commitment's unexpected paths in art and life, would appear substantially to reconfigure recent periodizations and style-characterizations of post-Modernism and its much maligned antecedent.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>That is, Brecht's late enterprise entails the non-parodic revivification of an ostensibly pass&#233;, auratic, "lyric-aesthetic" poetics, a revivification Brecht in part accomplishes by returning to the Shelleyan-Baudelairean imperative that lyric critically reimagine itself. Though not exactly hermetic, Brecht's negative-sideways, backward-forward path towards post-auratic aura effectively identifies lyric vocation with&#8212;or as fuel for&#8212;Marx's old "ruthless critique of everything existing," which in its turn casts a cold eye upon lyric's critico-political pretensions. Brecht's structuring of this fruitful and constitutive tension between aura and protopolitical critique amounts, astonishingly enough (since it's after all <i>Brecht</i> that we're talking about), to a reconjuration of Left Enlightenment aesthetics from elegy ash. Recognition of such a project in his later poetry should begin to unsettle long-standard accounts of how Brecht (or Benjamin, for that matter) alternately models an exchange-value Left cynicism, and a mechanical-reproductionist, exhibition-value "Avant-Gardist anti-aesthetic" (both of which, in solidarity with radically-intended post-Modernist art and theory, oppose themselves to a more auratic, Romantically-derived Modernism).<a href="#26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Meanwhile, Benjamin's reflections on Shelley, Baudelaire and allegory will serve as one of several seeds for Adorno's attempts, after Benjamin's death, critically to preserve and reanimate his friend's work, and to reassess earlier disagreements (including Adorno's and Benjamin's disagreement over the quality of Brecht's Shelley translations themselves).<a href="#27"><sup>27</sup></a> In a gestural shorthand, sometimes explicitly and more often by implication, Adorno writes the <i>Shelley-Bild</i> into and underneath a key series of texts: "Lyric Poetry and Society," "Commitment," "Parataxis," <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>.<a href="#28"><sup>28</sup></a> He effectively coordinates Brecht's and Benjamin's Shelley with a range of resonance and <i>correspondance</i> that includes Benjaminian angelicism, storm-images for allegory, and projection of "critical" lyric. This Shelley participates in what may be Adorno's own most enduring legacy, the attempt to uncover and work out a crucial distinction between <i>aesthetic</i> and aesthetici<i>zation</i>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Impelled by Benjamin's thinking about allegory, Adorno finds an anti-essentialist, anti-aestheti<i>cist</i> constructivism at the heart of Immanuel Kant's aesthetics and the Kantian Critical Philosophy as a whole, which, Adorno suggests, remains surprisingly central to Marxian dialectics and kindred efforts in critical thought. Underlying Adorno's Kantian account is the aesthetic's <i>quasi</i>-conceptual and thus <i>quasi</i>-social quality. The aesthetic (with lyric traditionally at its apex), while looking like conceptual-objective, "useful," content-determined thought or activity, <i>only</i> "looks like" them, only mimes them at the level of form. Aesthetic thought-experience in some way precedes conceptual-objective, content-and-use-oriented thought; in that sense, the aesthetic is "formal" because, rather than being determined by, it <i>provides the form for</i> conceptual, "objective" thought or cognition. Aesthetic thought-experience remains "free" (at least, relative to more properly conceptual thought) from pre-existent concepts or cognitive rules. In the Kantian lexicon, this makes the aesthetic a site of "reflective" rather than "determinant" judgment. The aesthetic, then, serves as mold or frame for the construction of "cognition in general," as Kant puts it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The aesthetic serves also as formal and imaginative engine for new, experimental (because previously non-existent) concepts. With its quasi-conceptual and quasi-social character ("a mist, a light, an image"; "all...empty air" [<i>Mask</i> 2.103, 121]), the aesthetic can provide a prerequisite of critical thought by offering formal means for developing new (not even necessarily utopian) concepts. Such concepts may bring to light presently-obscured aspects of substantive social reality (aspects of society not already determined by society's own conceptual view of itself). The operative notion is that thought determined by society&#8212;by society's own concepts of itself: status-quo, reigning concepts of society&#8212;can never give a satisfactory picture of that society. This finally resolves into a fundamental strain of Adorno's aesthetics, to which Shelley contributes far more than an undersong, and that can be expressed as follows: Lyric experiment helps construct and make available the intellectual-emotional apparatus for accessing, and to that extent helps make available the social material of, "the new" ("the new" here being understood ultimately as the not-yet-grasped features of the mode of production and, in fact, of all that is emergent in the social). This constructivist theory and practice sees that experiment in lyric&#8212;lyric <i>as</i> experiment&#8212;helps make new areas of the modern fitfully available <i>to</i> perception in the first place. Constructivism by itself guarantees neither progressive subjectivity nor commitment to emancipatory politics. But this construction of perceptual or cognitive capability is prerequisite to such subjectivity, critical thought, and commitment.<a href="#29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>There's one last, decidedly formal piece to this constructivist puzzle of Shelleyan commitment. Adorno hints that that piece is called "Keats." But it'll have to wait for the panel on "Keats's Interventionist Odes of 1819."<a href="#30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p class="indent"><a name="*"> </a>*For their responses to earlier versions of this essay and/or assistance with translations, I am indebted to Adam Casdin, Norma Cole, Geoffrey Galt Harpham, Stephen Hinton, Robert Hullot-Kentor, Tamara Levitz, and Arthur Strum. Any mistakes are the author's own.<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="1"> </a>1.&#160;&#160;See Shelley, <i>The Mask of Anarchy</i> 301-310.<br/><br/>
    Shelley wrote the <i>Mask</i> in response to the infamous "Peterloo" or "Manchester Massacre" of 16 August 1819, in which a mass meeting of some 60,000 people--demanding parliamentary and social reform--was attacked by armed militia and cavalry. Peterloo subsequently became a rallying cry for parliamentary-reform movements, as well as for Britain's nascent labor movement.<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="2"> </a>2.&#160;&#160;For the more youthful, anxiously self-conscious meditations on Shelley, see Sartre, <i>Lettres au Castor et &#224; quelques autres</i> I: 14, available in English in <i>Witness to My Life</i> 7-8; and Sartre, <i>Carnets de la dr&#244;le de guerre</i> 270, in English in <i>War Diaries</i> 74. <i>War Diaries</i> translates the now-superseded 1983 French edition of Satre's "Phoney-War" <i>Carnets</i>, which had not included--as the 1995 French edition would--the September-October 1939 entries. Hence the discrepancy in the subtitle-dates of <i>Carnets de la dr&#244;le guerre</i> and <i>War Diaries</i>.<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="3"> </a>3.&#160;&#160;See too Jones's "Shelley's Satire of Succession and Brecht's Anatomy of Regression: `The Mask of Anarchy' and Der anachronistische Zug oder Freiheit und Democracy." As Jones indicates, some earlier English-language critics had also made valuable contributions towards charting the Brecht-Shelley relationship; cf., e. g., S. S. Prawer 92-96 and Richard Cronin 39-42.<br/><br/>
    See also Bertolt Brecht, "Der anachronistische Zug oder Freiheit und Democracy," in <i>Gesammelte Werke</i> 4: 943-949; the text is translated as "The Anachronistic Procession or Freedom and Democracy" in <i>Poems</i> 409-414. In the later and more comprehensive German edition--the Bertolt Brecht <i>Werke: Grosse kommentierte Berliner und Frankfurter Ausgabe</i>--the poem appears under the title "Freiheit und Democracy" 15: 183-188. Unless otherwise indicated, all further references to Brecht's German texts are to the <i>Werke: Grosse kommentierte</i> edition and are cited by volume and page. All translations of Brecht, unless making specific reference to Willett's and Manheim's <i>Poems</i> or unless otherwise noted, are my own.<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="4"> </a>4.&#160;&#160;See "Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire" in Benjamin, <i>Charles Baudelaire: Ein Lyriker im Zeitalter des Hochkapitalismus</i> 63 n.49 (vol. I.2, 562 n.51of <i>Gesammelte Schriften</i>). In English, see "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire" in <i>Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High Capitalism</i> 59 n.48. For the Benjamin-Adorno disagreements over "Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire" see my n.27 below.<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="5"> </a>5.&#160;Shelley, <i>Peter Bell the Third</i>, "Part Third: Hell," 330, l.147; Brecht <i>Werke</i> 15 [<i>Gedichte</i> 5]: 46 and <i>Poems</i> 367. In the Brecht <i>Werke</i>, the poem is known by its first words, "Nachdenkend, wie ich h&#246;re," whereas in the older <i>Gesammelte Werke</i> (4 [<i>Gedichte</i>]: 830), it is formally titled "Nachdenkend &#252;ber die H&#246;lle," by which title it is still often discussed in the critical literature, even where the later, <i>Werke</i> text, is cited.<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="6"> </a>6.&#160;Wolfenstein's translation of the <i>Mask</i> stanzas is the first text in the "&#220;bersetzungen" ["Translations"] section of <i>Das Wort'</i>s June, 1937 issue. The translated <i>Mask</i> excerpt is titled "Sie Sind Wenige--Ihr Seid Viel!" ["They are Few--You are Many!"]; an introductory note tells <i>Das Wort</i> readers that the stanzas come from the last part of Shelley's <i>Mask</i>, and that they have been translated by Wolfenstein.<br/><br/>
    The German title (and text) translates but reverses the <i>Mask</i>'s celebrated, twice-repeated line addressing English workers (a line Shelley simultaneously intends as description, incantation, and exhortation/inspiration): "Ye are many--they are few." (In Shelley's text, these words appear at l.155 and again in the poem's final line [l. 372]). Wolfenstein apparently changes Shelley's word order in an attempt to preserve, in German, what he perceives as the essence of the <i>Mask</i>'s rhyme-scheme, syntax, and overall rhythm. The reversal may also reflect Wolfenstein's and <i>Das Wort</i>'s political judgment about the importance of ending--that is, ending first the bold-faced, all-capitalized, exclamatory title given to the <i>Mask</i>-excerpt; then, the repeated phrase within the translated stanzas; finally, the translated text as a whole--with the "many," rather than the ruling class's "few."<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="7"> </a>7.&#160;&#160;The <i>Vermischte Schriften</i>, along with the poems, short stories, novels, and plays collected in the other volumes of Wolfenstein's <i>Werke</i>, reveal Wolfenstein's writings to have been thoroughly saturated by his readings in, and responses to, Shelley. For a valuable discussion of how Shelley infuses Wolfenstein's attempts to couple, or put into dialogue, an experimental poetics and a committed Left politics, see Siebenhaar. See too Fischer and Brown.<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="8"> </a>8.&#160;&#160;On Du Bois's passionate Shelleyanism, see the brief published comments of Herbert Aptheker (once Du Bois's younger colleague and close friend, and eventually, editor of the 40-plus volumes of Du Bois's collected writings) 204. (Aptheker has indicated, in correspondence and conversation with the present author, that the above-cited commentary on Du Bois and Shelley represents "only the tip of the iceberg" of Du Bois's recurrent recourse to Shelley.) See also Du Bois's stress on the exemplary status of the second-generation English Romantic poets: "... Byron, Shelley, and Keats, lord, gentleman and cockney, all were social revolutionists." [Du Bois here paraphrases, and adds his distinct emphasis to, a formulation in the book he is reviewing, Annette T. Rubinstein's Marxian-humanist <i>The Great Tradition in English Literature</i>.] On Du Bois's initial attractions to, and ultimately radical interpretations of, German philosophical idealism, see Russell A. Berman's important "Du Bois and Wagner."<br/><br/>

    <p class="indent"><a name="9"> </a>9.&#160;&#160;Until the publication of Brecht's <i>Arbeitsjournal</i>, the best-known evidence was probably the June-August 1938 section of "Gespr&#228;che mit Brecht" in Benjamin, <i>Versuche &#252;ber Brecht</i> 117-135; "Conversations with Brecht" in Benjamin, <i>Understanding Brecht</i> 105-121.

    <p class="indent"><a name="10"> </a>10.&#160;&#160;The editors of <i>Aesthetics and Politics</i>, and other commentators, have asserted that Brecht was only a figurehead for, or, at most, nominally involved in editing, <i>Das Wort</i>. See, e. g., <i>Aesthetics and Politics</i> 62. Brecht's journals and letters, as well as some of Benjamin's recollections (and Benjamin's own contributions to <i>Das Wort</i>) show this to be an inadequate overall analysis. In fact, Brecht's attitudes towards his participation in <i>Das Wort</i> ranged from frustration, cynicism, and disgust, to cautious enthusiasm, to energetic determination to shape the journal more towards his liking (including through active solicitation of manuscripts from writers around the world).<br/><br/>
    See Brecht's correspondence about <i>Das Wort</i> in the Brecht <i>Werke</i> 28 [<i>Briefe</i> 1]: 562 and 569, and 29 [<i>Briefe</i> 2]: 9, 13, 19, 20, 21, 25-26, 36, 38, 64, 77, 81, 83-84, 101, 106-107, 126, and 147-148. (Most of these letters can be found in the English translation of an earlier edition of Brecht's letters, <i>Brecht Briefe</i>, see <i>Bertolt Brecht Letters</i> 163, 235, 239, 240, 246, 247, 248, 256, 259, 260, 271, 276, 279, 289, 290, 295, 315, 607, 610, and 611.)<br/><br/>

    <p class="indent"><a name="15"> </a>15.&#160;&#160;Brecht is of course often described, by others and himself, as the Left's <i>plumpes Denken</i> ["crude thinking," "crude thought," "vulgar thought"] poet, over against Left writers like Wolfenstein who exhibit a penchant for visionary, sometimes arcane or delicate, Symbolist esotericism. It therefore seems entirely natural that Brecht chooses to render Shelley's lines far more literally than had Wolfenstein. Yet, paradoxically, it is Wolfenstein's translation that yields the familiarly Popular Front verse-cadence of ringing hammerbeat, along with a rhetorical thematics that quickly thins to weak abstraction. Meanwhile, Brecht's scrupulously literal, generally unrhymed translation somehow manages--no doubt due to Brecht's terrific feel for other poets' language, and, more specifically, his obvious sympathy with the <i>Mask</i>--to convey Shelley's startling ways of simultaneously condensing and exfoliating image, phrase, and line. Brecht, that is, powerfully grasps and identifies with Shelley's manner of marrying rhythmic propulsion to textural density, whereby through syntax, cadence, diction, and tone, an intense forward movement and stingingly precise denotation coexist with an imagistic counter-impulse that, with understated elegance, deftly builds back into the poem a cumulatively thickening self-reflection. The inspired and brilliant literalism of Brecht's translation--Brecht's ability to see (and then to render into an impressive construction of energy, concretion, and transparency) the <i>Mask</i>'s interanimation of the material and the ideational, of grit and philosophically-oriented intellection--results in stanzas notably more literary and poetic than Wolfenstein's.<br/><br/>
    For Benjamin's implicit, and Adorno's and Elizabeth Hauptmann's explicit, assessments of Brecht's Shelley translations (as well as Brecht's later, possibly ambivalent attitude towards the translations), see my n.27 below.<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="16"> </a>16.&#160;&#160;<i>Werke</i> 14 [<i>Gedichte</i> 4]: 404-405, 662n. Brecht worked on both the <i>Mask</i> and <i>Peter Bell</i> translations with his close collaborator Margarete Steffin; see <i>Werke</i> 14: 662-663nn., and 22.2: 1035-1036nn.<br/><br/>
    The <i>Werke</i> presents Brecht's <i>Peter Bell</i> translation as part of a larger text titled "H&#246;lle" ["Hell"], <i>Werke</i> 14: 404-409, 662-663nn. "H&#246;lle" begins with the nine <i>Peter Bell</i> stanzas, and then segues directly into the 25 <i>Mask of Anarchy</i> stanzas translated--and otherwise appearing only--in "Weite und Vielfalt." The textual history provided in the <i>Werke'</i>s notes leads one to deduce that publication of the <i>Peter Bell</i> translation occurred only in (and then after) 1972, when the translation appeared in Benjamin's posthumously-organized-and-published <i>Passagen-Werk</i>; see my n.17 below.<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="17"> </a>17.&#160;&#160;Brecht's translated <i>Peter Bell</i> stanzas appear in <i>Das Passagen-Werk</i> 1: 563-564 [also found in Benjamin, <i>Gesammelte Schriften</i> 1: 563-564]; in English, see Benjamin, <i>The Arcades Project</i> 449-450.<br/><br/>
    The sequence of this sharing of ideas and manuscripts, and copying out of translations, can be reconstructed by coordinating Brecht's "Arbeitsjournal" entries for the period in question, along with the June-August 1938 sections of "Gespr&#228;che mit Brecht" in Benjamin's <i>Versuche &#252;ber Brecht</i> 128-135 ["Conversations with Brecht" in <i>Understanding Brecht</i> 114-121], as well as Benjamin's correspondence (particularly with Adorno; see my n.27 below).

    <p class="indent"><a name="20"> </a>20.&#160;&#160;It is almost impossible to resist juxtaposing Benjamin's insistence on Shelley's powerful <i>grasp</i> of allegory (and Benjamin's consequent insistence on Shelley's artistic grasp of <i>reality</i>) with F.R. Leavis's notorious claim, made only two years earlier, that Shelley had had a "weak grasp upon the actual." Leavis's indictment arises amidst his specific dismissal of <i>Ode to the West Wind</i>: the poem epitomizes what Leavis deems Shelley's unfortunate manner of being so "'essentially lyrical'" that, as a poet, Shelley can have "little to do with thinking." For Leavis, Shelley's poetry "induces--depends for its success on inducing--a kind of attention that doesn't bring the critical intelligence into play" (206-08). For two of the most thorough and impressive rebuttals of Leavis's argument, see Wasserman and Keach.<br/><br/>
    Leavis's judgment, based as it is on Shelley's lyricism (as Leavis sees it, on Shelley's exaggerated, excessively emotion-oriented lyricism) might for that reason seem removed from Benjamin's attention to <i>Peter Bell the Third</i>'s biting satire. Yet the surrounding coordinates of Benjamin's discussion--from the Wolfenstein and <i>Das Wort</i> preludes, to the Baudelaire and Brecht variations, to the central motif of allegory itself--make clear that back of Benjamin's interest in <i>Peter Bell</i> lies exactly this problematic jointure: on one side, an ethereal or seemingly obscure lyric poetics convinced of the need for <i>via-negativa</i> coaxing of reality into provisionally apprehendable form; on the other, a righteous truth-telling that aims to call (with equal recourse to clear observation, active intellection, and socio-linguistic precision) a degraded present by its proper name. Productively to motivate the oscillation or shifting combination of the two sides is the whole point of Benjamin's theory of allegory, whose <i>raison d'etre</i> is, in a phrase, to gain a grasp upon the actual.<br/></p>
    <p class="indent"><a name="21"> </a>21.&#160;&#160;Some, but by no means all of these poems (not to mention the drafts printed in the <i>Werke</i> notes) have been published in the English <i>Poems</i>. See the poems gathered under the titles <i>Hollywoodelegien</i> and <i>Gedichte im Exil</i>, <i>Werke</i> 12 [<i>Gedichte</i> 2]: 115-125; in <i>Poems</i>, see <i>Hollywood Elegies</i> 380-381 and the texts in the section "American Poems 1941-1947." See too "An Walter Benjamin, der sich auf der Flucht vor Hitler Entleibte," "Die Verlustliste," "Nachdenkend, wie ich h&#246;re" ["Nachdenkend &#252;ber die H&#246;lle"], and "Zum Freitod des Fl&#252;chtlings W.B.," <i>Werke</i> 15 [<i>Gedichte</i> 5]: 41, 43, 46, 48; in <i>Poems</i>, see "On Thinking About Hell" and "On the Suicide of the Refugee W.B.," 367, 363.<br/><br/>
    See also the <i>Werke'</i>s reprinting of the remarkable 1942 typescript draft that Brecht had provisionally titled "Die H&#246;lle" (which is distinct from the <i>Werke</i> text combining the <i>Mask</i> and <i>Peter Bell</i> translations and titled "H&#246;lle," discussed in my n.16 above); this "Die H&#246;lle" typescript is clearly a preliminary stage of the <i>Hollywoodelegien</i>. This 1942 "Die H&#246;lle" typescript, moreover, unmistakably arises from the Shelley-matrix, reworking, in fact, the same ideas and even words about "mein Bruder Shelley" (and the figuration of London and Los Angeles as competing versions of Hell) that appear in the 1941 "Nachdenkend &#252;ber die H&#246;lle." Both "Nachdenkend &#252;ber die H&#246;lle" and the "Die H&#246;lle" typescript should be traced, of course, back to the Summer 1938 translations, analyses, and discussions of Shelley, particularly to the <i>Peter Bell</i> translation. See <i>Werke</i> 12: 399-400nn. (The 1942 "Die H&#246;lle" typescript may well have emerged from what would have been a previous, manuscript sketch--evidently not possessed by the Brecht Archive, nor elsewhere known--that would have served as the basis for "Nachdenkend &#252;ber die H&#246;lle," the <i>Hollywoodelegien</i>, and related poems.)<br/><br/>
    For a more brutal sense of what is at stake in these overlapping materials, contexts, and drafts, where--with Shelley so often providing the stated melody or haunting undersong--Brecht undertakes to write alternately despairing and enraged elegy, see Brecht's seven stark, ultimately-discarded lines from the first sketch of "Die Verlustliste" ["The Casualty List"]. Those lines include: "Wo ist Benjamin, der Kritiker?/...Benjamin ist an der spanischen Grenze begraben./...Ich fahre entlang den Bomberwerften von Los Angeles" ["Where is Benjamin, the critic?/...Benjamin is buried at the Spanish border./...I drive along the bomber-hangars of Los Angeles"]. <i>Werke</i> 15: 338-339nn.<br/></p>

    Eisler's 1942 comments on the Brecht poems may not have been as judgmental as Brecht had initially believed, nor, in any case, do they appear to have represented Eisler's final opinion on the texts: Eisler subsequently observed that the <i>Hollywoodelegien</i> were his favorite works among all Brecht's poetry.

With the Brecht volumes in particular, it happens that a significant number of the early 1940s poems from and around the "Shelley-Baudelaire-critical lyric" matrix become readily available in German only in the '50s and '60s, and in some cases are not translated until the '60s and '70s.<br/></p>

    <p class="indent"><a name="27"> </a>27.&#160;&#160;In his 1 February 1939 letter to Benjamin about "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire," Adorno questions the fidelity to Shelley of the Brecht <i>Peter Bell</i> translation that Benjamin's essay quotes; Adorno wonders whether such "directness and bluntness" ["Direktheit und H&#228;rte"] can really be found in the original. See Adorno and Benjamin, <i>Briefwechsel 1928-1940,</i> 397; Adorno and Benjamin, <i>The Complete Correspondence, 1928-1940,</i> 304. An editors' note in <i>Complete Correspondence</i>, though not indicating that the rest of Brecht's <i>Peter Bell</i> translation appears in the <i>Passagen-Werk</i>, does provide Shelley's stanza, and comments that "Brecht's translation does follow the English of Shelley's original very closely" (308 n.32).<br/><br/>
    Interestingly, Adorno's initial doubts concerning the translation's fidelity or quality are later echoed by Brecht's close collaborator and editor Elisabeth Hauptmann, who observes too that Brecht himself had seriously doubted the <i>Peter Bell</i> and <i>Mask</i> translations' merit; see the Brecht <i>Werke</i> 14: 662-663nn. There is no corroborating evidence, from Brecht or others, that Brecht ever actually shared Hauptmann's view or held the one she attributes to him; Brecht's 1954 publication of the <i>Mask</i> translation-essay (in the journal <i>Versuche</i>) would seem to count as contrary evidence.<br/><br/>
    Adorno for his part may subsequently have changed his mind--at least somewhat--about the <i>Peter Bell</i> translations, which he would have continued to read, preserved as they were in the Benjamin texts that Adorno helped to edit after Benjamin's death. Significantly, the first line of those <i>Peter Bell</i> stanzas reappears in one of Adorno's most important discussions of modern poetics, "Parataxis" (1963). As if at once conceding and contesting the same old point, Adorno (here constellating Shelley, Baudelaire, and H&#246;lderlin) quite laudatorily gives the first line from those <i>Peter Bell</i> stanzas: but he presents the first half of Shelley's line in German, the second half in English! "Wie H&#246;lderlins Wahlverwandtem Shelley die H&#246;lle eine Stadt ist, much like London..." ["Just as for H&#246;lderlin's kindred spirit Shelley Hell is a city `much like London...'"]. See "Parataxis. Zur sp&#228;ten Lyrik H&#246;lderlins," <i>Noten zur Literatur</i> 3: 174 [<i>Gesammelte Schriften</i> 11: 462], "Parataxis: On H&#246;lderlin's Late Poetry," <i>Notes to Literature</i> 2: 122.<br/><br/>
    For several years, Benjamin had gone back and forth with Adorno (who usually also represented Horkheimer in these colloquies) about Benjamin's Baudelaire texts and related writings. In 1935, Benjamin had submitted a draft of "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire" to the Institut f&#252;r Sozialforschung's [Institute of Social Research's] house organ, the <i>Zeitschrift f&#252;r Sozialforschung</i> [<i>Journal of Social Research</i>]. At that point, Benjamin was conceiving "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire" as the second part of a streamlined, three-part version of the <i>Passagen-Werk</i> that would be called <i>Paris, the Capital of the Nineteenth Century</i>. In Fall 1938, Benjamin submitted a revised version of the essay, which quoted and briefly discussed the translated <i>Peter Bell</i> stanza. For the relevant exchanges about these essays, see <i>Briefwechsel</i> 138 ff., 364 ff., and 388 ff.; <i>Complete Correspondence</i>, 104 ff., 280 ff., and 298 ff. (Some of these letters are included in <i>Aesthetics and Politics</i>'s section on the Adorno-Benjamin debates.)<br/><br/>
    Though Adorno and Horkheimer had published Benjamin essays about which they had serious reservations--most famously, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"--they did not, even after further Adorno-Benjamin correspondence (in November 1938), publish the revised "Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire." In early 1939 they did, however, publish Benjamin's "&#220;ber einige Motive bei Baudelaire" ["On Some Motifs in Baudelaire"], which Benjamin had intended as the "thesis" of <i>Paris, the Capital of the Nineteenth Century</i>. "&#220;ber einige Motive bei Baudelaire" can be found in Benjamin's <i>Illuminationen</i> 201-245, in <i>Charles Baudelaire: Ein Lyriker im Zeitalter des Hochkapitalismus</i> 111-164, and <i>Gesammelte Schriften</i> I.2: 605-653.
