<p align="left">This Praxis volume began as two modern stagings of the 19th century play <i>Obi; or Three-Finger'd Jack</i>. The first staging was at the Playwright's Theater in Boston, on July 18, 2000. It included, besides staged portions of the play, papers read by Charles Rzepka, Peter Buckley, Jeffrey Cox and Debbie Lee. These papers formed the backbone of this Praxis volume. The second production was at Arizona State University, at the year 2000 Conference of the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism (NASSR). It included the papers mentioned above and also the essay by Robert Hoskins included in this volume. Video excerpts of the Boston production are included as well, linked to plain text versions of the <i>Obi</i> melodrama and <i>Obi</i> pantomime. A scholarly edition of the <i>Obi</i> pantomime is forthcoming from Romantic Circles, edited by Jeffrey N. Cox.</p>

<h3><a name="series"> </a>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</h3>
<p align="left">The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship. The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> was formerly known as <b>Romantic Praxis: Theory and Criticism</b>. The name was changed in November 1999.</p>
