    </div>
    <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; margin-right: 5px">This volume of <i>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</i> includes an editor's introduction by Robert Miles and essays by Fred Botting, Diane Long Hoeveler, Sophie Thomas, Dale Townshend, and Angela Wright.</p>
    <p>This collection of essays explores the relationship between Romantic Gothicism and the rise of the visual technologies centred on commercial exploitation of&#160;the magic lantern. Although grounded in the technological innovations of the Romantic and early Victorian periods &#8211; and reactions to them &#8211; the essays in the collection anticipate modern attitudes towards visuality, developing the link between the rise of&#160;literary Gothic and subsequent visual technologies.&#160;</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center">About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left">The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>
