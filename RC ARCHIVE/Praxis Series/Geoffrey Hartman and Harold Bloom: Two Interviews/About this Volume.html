    <h3 align="center">About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</h3>
    <p align="left">The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and most exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>
