              <li>
                <p><strong>Marc Redfield</strong>: Geoffrey, thank you
                for this occasion. I'd like to pick up on the present
                occasion and suggest that our conversation be centered
                on Wordsworth and then maybe also on poetry and
                religion and the present moment or modernity.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>Geoffrey Hartman</strong>: Okay.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Partly following out on your
                talk at the conference and partly thinking about, let's
                say, the function of criticism and poetry at the
                present time. So let me ask you an opening question,
                which is about Wordsworth. You have written about so
                many authors and periods and topics, but Wordsworth has
                always been, particularly since 1964, your special
                author, if that's fair.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Actually . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Maybe not.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Earlier. [Laughs.]</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Earlier, yes. [Both laugh.]</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Earlier, because <em>The
                Unmediated Vision</em> had its first chapter on
                Wordsworth.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Okay. And the others were Rilke
                and Hopkins and Val&eacute;ry. And you continued to
                write about these figures, but . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: I've continued to write on
                Hopkins . . . not on Rilke . . . but also on
                Val&eacute;ry. I wrote on Rilke later only in view of a
                comment on Paul Celan. I mean, he figures, but not in a
                sustained way.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: You've written about the
                Wordsworthian sense of place that you acquired as a
                child refugee . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Right.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: . . . in England, and your most
                recent writing up through today continues to draw
                strength from Wordsworth and to return to him, so I was
                wondering if you would be willing to try to sort of say
                something in an interview format about your own sense
                of the importance of Wordsworth for us today. I know
                that's an enormous question, but that might start us in
                a direction.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Well, you know, you have to
                presuppose that poetry is of importance. [Chuckles.]
                And then, that Wordsworth is of importance. I mean that
                it is true if there were no Wordsworth, Milton still
                would be important, Spenser, Shakespeare, and, you
                know, continental poetry, and so on. Poetry would not
                go away . . . But having said that, Wordsworth does
                stand there permanently to my mind, and I think that's
                a general consensus; we've recognized that there is a
                divide between the old and the new: symbolism, old
                style, new style, however you would describe it.
                Wordsworth is an innovator and one should talk about
                exactly why he is the beginning of modern poetry. It
                doesn't matter if we say modern or modernist. We still
                don't know the decisive elements that went into that
                change from an older style of symbolism and writing
                poetry to the new style&mdash;the new style being a new
                type of visionariness but also a certain intermingling
                of prosaicness or a diminished fear of the difference
                between prose and poetry. Should poetry come closer to
                prose, that might be a strength rather than a weakness.
                So, I think this development, which may not be the
                first thing people think about, has something to do
                with the history of prose, at least in England. Because
                in England there was previously, before Wordsworth, a
                considerable division between poetic style and prose
                style; and Wordsworth, as you know, revolted against a
                special language for poetry, wanted to do away with
                "poetic diction."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>So, one would have to make an excursus into prose
                and prose rhythms and into the whole question of the
                transformation of meter, which finally goes into free
                style or <em>vers libre.</em> That is only the
                technical level. These technical matters are important,
                even if we cannot make a one-to-one relation between
                technical and thematic or form and content. But the
                main thing that makes one think of Wordsworth as
                originator is the way he handles paranormal or intense,
                quasi-mystical feelings for the natural world ("the
                incumbent mystery of sense and soul") as an everyday
                kind of ecstasy. I don't quite know how to put it and
                so I usually cite Freud's Psychopathology of Everyday
                Life. This aspect of Wordsworth was clear enough yet
                not valued at the beginning, but now we have no great
                problem with it. Behind it, of course, is a crucial
                reflection on the depth of everyday life. As well as
                the role of nature in everyday life as a nourishing
                environment, and how it affects what we are
                increasingly calling the ecology of mind. That is, not
                just the relation between open spaces or rural nature
                and mental space, but a necessary symbiosis of nature
                and mind or nature and the imagination. One learns to
                understand the poet's fear that nature in the future
                may not sustain a characteristically English
                culture&mdash;will not sustain the imagination it has
                fostered. And if nature does not sustain the
                imagination, then the mind will desert nature or the
                imagination will. The result is fatal to the ecosystem
                of both nature and mind. There is a growing dependency
                on increasingly coarser stimuli abetted by urbanization
                (a process the poet analyses in his 1800 Preface to
                <em>Lyrical Ballads),</em> the crowding of people in
                cities, the hurry, the helter-skelter, the
                proliferation of news and sensational
                writing,&mdash;matters that, later on, Walter Benjamin
                also observed and expressed in more direct
                socioeconomic terms. Benjamin added the insight that
                modernity did not augment perception and sensation by
                the addition of new media but the contrary of that,
                that the media actually impoverish our capacity to feel
                directly and for "the meanest flower."</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: The shock experience . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Yes, Wordsworth emphasizes the
                shock experience of the City, but as a negative. Even
                when poets like Baudelaire don't talk about shock, that
                shock enters their poetry. Wordsworth does talk about
                it, especially in his description of London in <em>The
                Prelude</em>, but it is interesting that for him the
                shock came first in youth, from nature itself, and in
                that context was positive, tonic. And he stays with
                that, and holds onto that, because the later, urban
                shock is more intractable, does not contribute to
                maturation, or else he just doesn't know how to deal
                with it. Of course, anyone serious about urban studies
                would say "Wordsworth is
                <em>arri&egrave;r&eacute;</em>, he gets it backwards;
                cities can be developed as a wonderful habitat, we just
                have to get used to, use them as a creative field of
                stimuli rather than succumbing to trauma and sensory
                flooding."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Still, would it be fair to say
                that you've seen and read in Wordsworth a poet whose
                particular power speaks to. . . well I was thinking of
                two things as you were speaking, they are, of course,
                themes in your writing: the impending ecological
                disaster, and then secondly the degree of violence
                which has gotten attached to religion and to
                expressions of religious fervor in the very
                contemporary world.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: He knew about the violence, and
                he knew it from England's history itself. He became a
                very strong supporter of the <em>via media</em>, yet
                was not overly concerned with religion. He may have
                been close, early on, to the spirit of Methodism, and
                did not fear "enthusiasm" the way that Locke and other
                enlightened thinkers feared religious mania of every
                kind. Chiefly, though, he was concerned that if your
                thoughts turned too much towards otherworldliness and
                became trapped in compensatory religious structures of
                the imagination, then your sensibility would move away
                from nature even more, and closer to apocalyptic
                fancies. And <em>that</em> violence, leading to the
                loss of the natural world as what should suffice, as
                poetry's true nourishment, he wanted to avoid at all
                costs. That is one reason why he doesn't, like Blake,
                erect a counter-visionary structure in his poetry. He
                doesn't try to replace one vision by another but subtly
                transforms, "naturalizes" an older symbolic mode
                entirely.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: I'd like to pursue that along a
                particular track, and it's a bit self-interested
                because I've been trying to write about the "war on
                terror" in relation to certain Romantic sources, if you
                can believe it . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: You gave a lecture on that at
                Yale I could not attend.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Yes, and in (I think) 1947,
                Jean Paulhan wrote a book that's pretty much forgotten
                except in French departments called <em>Les fleurs de
                Tarbes, ou la Terreur dans les lettres</em>, and it had
                the sort of counterintuitive thesis that modern
                literature, we would say romantic as opposed to classic
                literature, craves terror in a sense because it craves
                transparency.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Craves?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Desires.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Desires . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: . . . is attracted to terror,
                to the Revolution, because it desires immediacy, or to
                pick up the great title . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Okay, that's . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: . . . "unmediated vision."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: I must admit to an early
                admiration (craving?) for unmediatedness. It may be
                that the terror experienced by the poet, also as the
                Terror that beset a phase in the internecine struggle
                of the revolutionary factions in France, has something
                fanatical and ideological in common with our
                contemporary experience. I am not sure, though, that
                this murderousness in the name of religion (also of
                "enlightenment" or self-empowerment when we think of
                Wordsworth's critique of Godwinianism in <em>The
                Borderers</em>) arises out of a desire for the
                unmediated. Yet as a wish to throw off all hypocrisy,
                repression, convention, arbitrary
                mind-shackles&mdash;in short "second nature"&mdash;it
                tends that way and may indulge in fantasies of a
                violent purgation. The French Revolution joins up with,
                becomes, a political religion. Wordsworth was, for a
                time, an enthusiast of the revolution; his
                understanding of it was not far from that of Carlyle,
                who later on saw it, despite its militant secularism,
                as a religious phenomenon&mdash;a religious phenomenon
                in the political realm. The wild post-Revolutionary
                speculations, Wordsworth wrote in <em>The Prelude</em>,
                tried to separate future from past absolutely. They
                separated, as by a gulf, the man who would be, the man
                of a new order&mdash;I'm paraphrasing&mdash;from the
                man of the past. Eventually that led the poet to
                return, in reaction, to continuities with his own
                tradition; even to define the poet generically as one
                who would be saved from the wound of such discontinuity
                by memories returning of his early intercourse with a
                beauty "old as creation." Even the early fearful
                experiences bound him, as he now saw, to his habitat.
                He turned from certain abstract immediacies and came to
                honor the concrete, embedded qualities of a religion
                apparently formed by spirit of place, by local and
                national traditions. There is, we might say, a return
                from globalism to localism. But still, being a complex
                if unconventional thinker, Wordsworth had a notion of
                natural religion that was pedagogical. Nature was a
                great pedagogue, and any social engineering, any
                mechanical scheme of education, could not replace the
                accidented and multifaceted influences that, he
                claimed, made him a poet. In <em>The Prelude</em> he
                describes, for instance, how Nature liberated him from,
                well, I call it a "spot syndrome," from fixating
                localizations. Their localization has a mythic, even
                theophanic strength; but that does not cancel the
                psychological drama of having to progress from their
                haunting to the concept of Nature itself, nature as
                Nature, something much larger. Wordsworth's
                <em>Prelude</em> becomes our first significant poem
                centering on developmental psychology. He couldn't
                simply go back to local virtue, or local attachment.
                "Local attachment" at the end of the eighteenth century
                was a dialectical response&mdash;well, even if not
                dialectical, it was a reactive response to the growing
                cosmopolitanism of the Enlightenment. All these are the
                complicated movements which factor into what we call
                "Wordsworth."</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Yes. And perhaps, to just
                pursue this one step longer and then we'll turn to
                something else, Paulhan defines "terror in letters" as
                the desire to extirpate the flowers of rhetoric, right,
                and to achieve an unmediated vision, and Wordsworth's
                relation's highly complex . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Yes, yes, it is . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: . . . the achieving of a
                plainer style.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Exactly . . . Paulhan would be
                relevant to Wordsworth and his distrust of rhetorical
                "glitter." Yet in <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> he didn't
                want to extirpate, really, the flowers or colors of
                rhetoric. He wanted to give them genuine roots, wanted
                them to proceed from the popular imagination, and, as
                it were, emerge from the soil, from a heart, or
                homeland. So Yeats too asks us to ground myth in the
                earth The result is, as in many of the <em>Lyrical
                Ballads</em>, a minimalism of incident and style; and
                when the poet does use flowers of rhetoric, they are
                very closely, almost pedantically, but still quite
                powerfully attached to the particular person or story.
                In the "Idiot Boy," even though it is night, the idiot
                boy thinks the moon is the sun which shines so cold,
                and the owls hooting are the cocks crowing. So the
                metafelicity of this, the distortion, the
                coloration&mdash;what one could call strong, crazy
                metaphors&mdash; is sunk into the specific instance.
                Otherwise he is a minimalist, as in the Lucy poems.
                There, when you compare "Strange fits of passion" to "A
                slumber did my spirit seal," you see how much he
                elides, or rather condenses in the latter. But there is
                no sense of wishing to extirpate figures, only dead
                metaphors. Live metaphors, however rare, are the stuff
                of poetry. When in "The Ruined Cottage" the baker's
                cart goes by Margaret's house, because she has no
                money, so why stop there, she says, "that wagon doesn't
                care for me." She doesn't say "the baker doesn't." She
                transfers it to the wagon, "That wagon doesn't care for
                me."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: It's the more powerful because
                it's a sense of a process.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Yes, you feel the poetic
                process, the metaphoric transfer or displacement . . .
                The animation of what is inert, of the mute, insensate
                thing, is part of that, and is justified by Margaret's
                passion, even as she remains movingly shy of cursing,
                or anger, or attributing blame directly.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: I suppose I'm trying to connect
                this to Wordsworth's resistance to apocalypse as you
                have taught us to see.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: If apocalypse is also . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: . . . as a resistance to
                terror.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Yes. Well, that's a jump, yet
                it's relevant. Apocalypse is always associated with
                violent images of purgation, and with a rhetorical
                violence too, about which Wordsworth may be too
                squeamish. So I think that is right, your perception is
                to the point. Wordsworth's purgation of poetic diction
                is not terroristic in Paulhan's sense. His plain style
                bypasses (to Blake's disgust) the "terrors" of a
                theomanic imagination for the deeper, daily, subtle
                profoundnesses of a mind seeking what will suffice.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: And then let me ask you a
                question that goes in a slightly different direction;
                again, I have half my eye on the contemporary world
                that we are living and suffering in. One aspect of
                globalization, of course, is the global spread of
                English. And in our little local part of the world,
                what that means is a great deal of stress put on
                foreign language departments, near catastrophe for
                German departments in many universities . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Also for French at the
                moment.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: For French, yes. So here, just
                to sound a little perverse about it, is a problem that
                Wordsworth can't help us with as it were. One would
                want to, of course, instead urge that people read Rilke
                or Val&eacute;ry in the original. The serious question
                I would like to ask you is for any reflections on
                comparative Romanticism and the future you see for
                comparative study in the world today.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: I can't give you even a
                moderately simple answer that would suggest a clear
                corrective or resolution for the paradox that even as
                we become multicultural we neglect the basis of every
                culture, its language. Our globalism becomes ever more
                abstract and our actual knowledge ever more parochial.
                That is why I prefer not to limit your concern to
                Romanticism. Of course, one should go back to
                Romanticism and extrapolate from it because there is so
                much of it that involves theory of language. I don't
                mean just Rousseau's theory of language but also the
                more concrete, empirical reflections of Humboldt in
                Germany. We should learn, I think, to pay attention to,
                to study as an ensemble, language theory,
                interpretation theory, and the creative literature that
                arises at a time that introduces via Goethe the concept
                of world literature, without any thought of abandoning
                the study of the particular national literatures. Then
                you also have to go back in time and study the
                dialectic of global and local: the way a language
                renews itself, is renewed by writers trying to revive
                its fossilized metaphors or retrieve its supposed
                original vigor. The short answer is that unless we
                cultivate a greater respect for the way language is an
                indefeasible part of thought rather than its
                utilitarian shell, we won't progress but will regress
                in this media age.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>It would be pedantic of me to offer a pr&eacute;cis
                of the differing literary histories and philosophies of
                language in major European countries, the ones I know
                about (France, Germany, England), but Comp. Lit.
                scholars are acquainted with how productive and erudite
                European stylistics was in the hands of a Spitzer or
                Auerbach, who knew the evolution of the relevant
                vernaculars and could closely relate them to their
                developing literatures&mdash;interactive yet
                distinctive for each nationality. So one can extract
                some very important lessons concerning the way that
                language fertilizes itself and exerts great influence
                on a historical thesaurus but also on the imagination.
                How language is intrinsic to the development of a
                literary imagination. It's not that you have an
                imagination and then you strive to find a language for
                it, somehow create new words. It is a much more
                intricate process. So I would go in that direction, but
                the modern instance is made more difficult because
                language is proliferating unequally: in certain areas
                very, very fast, and in some areas hardly at all. Just
                think of the popular craze for acronyms and
                abbreviations now exacerbated by e-mail and text
                messaging. Multiple sources from print and speech flow
                into the river, the flood of language and junk speech.
                The growth of the optical deceives us, makes us believe
                (a willing deception on our part) that we can
                understand all this as if&mdash;to return to your
                concern&mdash;it were transparent, as if it could be
                understood immediately. But that immediacy overlooks
                the linguistic and interpretive moment and is, in
                reality, more mediated than ever. Whether our knowledge
                of language is expanding or contracting&mdash;and there
                is a lot of inventiveness around&mdash;it doesn't
                settle or sift incrementally. The new or idiosyncratic
                is soon consumed. It does not seem to build up, as in
                Shakespeare, to a creative synthesis of popular and
                higher genres. There does seem to be an important
                current, however, an incipient canon of popular music
                that may already be contributing to the thesaurus of
                speech, rhythm, poetry. So, I'm not saying that the
                contemporary situation is arid, rather that it is
                confusing, and has led to an unfortunate neglect of a
                vast heritage as well as a disincentive. There is a
                distinct lack of interest in the deeper study of
                poetry, and generally of the way traditions have always
                refigured themselves.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: I suppose it goes back to a
                theme that we were discussing in the panels today. Just
                the double-edged nature of mediation, technical
                mediation; although,</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Yes, technological mediation .
                . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: on the one hand, the technical
                flowerings of creativity, and on the other hand,
                standardization.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: It is very interesting, this
                encroaching standardization. Auerbach mentions it in
                the last chapter of <em>Mimesis,</em> one of the Comp.
                Lit. Bibles, as both eulogy and elegy for a
                many-splendored historicism. I.A. Richards too should
                be mentioned&mdash;Ogden and Richards worked together
                on The System of Basic English. Ogden, actually, wrote
                a book around 1930, called something like <em>Against
                Babel</em> or <em>Debabelization</em>
                [chuckles]&mdash;and that was a tirade against French
                and German etc., against bothering to be multilingual.
                Their position was "it is better for education and
                world peace to have a language which can be adopted
                universally, so let's work on basic English." Another
                side of that was the short-lived utopian idea of a
                universal Esperanto. What one is afraid of is that
                language will now, on the one hand, spin out of control
                in various ways, and on the other standardize and
                impoverish itself.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Yes, well in particular of
                course from the point of view of the people who teach
                languages other than English . . . I don't know . .
                .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: The case has to be made that
                everyone should have more than one language. Now, that
                kind of bilingualism is necessary, not primarily as an
                epistemic or even economic tool, but because you cannot
                understand and really own your language unless you have
                also another language. That is the minimum principle to
                be adopted, and I wouldn't care what language it is,
                whether an African-American pairing or a
                Spanish-American, or English-Latin. But you should try
                to master two languages; and, if possible, two
                languages with either a significant written canon or a
                recorded oral tradition, and&mdash;you were talking
                about comparative literature&mdash;you would acquire
                some capability of comparing them. That is, to test the
                limits of translatability, and as you get to the limits
                of translatability, you also see how and perhaps why
                cultures are different. . . Disaster awaits if you
                underestimate the depth relation of a culture to its
                language, as we see in American foreign policy, its
                ignorant adventurism.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Right. Let me close the
                interview with a couple of questions about poetry, just
                to bring us full circle. There was a very striking
                moment, at least for me, in an interview that Harold
                Bloom gave around 1985, I think it was Imre Salusinszky
                . . . if I got the name right . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Yes, he published an interview
                with Frye, who else, myself, Bloom, Gayatri Spivak
                perhaps, and . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Maybe Edward Said, I don't
                remember . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Yeah, I think Said was there
                too . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Well, anyway, at a certain
                point in the interview, I think that it is this
                interview, Bloom confessed to having completely changed
                his mind about Blake. He commented that when he was
                young he would have said he put Blake on the highest
                level, and Pope lower, considerably lower, and now he
                would do it the other way around. So, that's the case
                in which a critic has changed his mind about something
                very large given the history of this particular
                critic's writing. I wonder whether you've had any
                experience that's analogous in which a writer who once
                meant a great deal to you maybe now means less, for
                reasons that would be interesting.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: No, and I don't think that
                reflects favorably on me [laughs], the fact that I have
                to say no. It may be that I don't go out on as many
                limbs as Bloom does. And I know it was quite a
                reversal, because Bloom and I were in very close daily
                contact for a long time. And I saw, even wrote about
                the change in his attitude about Blake, but that is
                another subject. [Pause.] I really don't think I have
                ever reversed myself, because even when I fall away
                from a poet such as Rilke, I still enjoy that poet.
                Bloom has to adopt something wholeheartedly and then
                reject it. I mean he takes it into his bosom, and then
                he divorces. I think a certain love/hate remains; he's
                a very passionate person in that respect. I seem to be
                more cautious, I fall for a poet easily enough but have
                to work hard to justify what I feel, to prove that
                poet's worth to myself. Bloom, however, has a capacity
                of intuition when it comes to poetry that is absolutely
                remarkable, while I have to woo a poet, and do it from
                the outside. I look at the style and say, "Now this is
                interesting . . . " and very gradually, you know, I get
                used to it, attain a certain intimate confidence, but
                it takes time. Now, in the case of Wordsworth, it had
                something to do with my displacement into another
                language. And with Wordsworth and English nature
                hitting me at the same time. Not that I was in the Lake
                District, I was in another place, in Bucks, but it was
                a typical English rural nature that hadn't changed all
                that much when I found myself there in '39. So, I got a
                start like this. But even with Wordsworth, I stayed a
                long time pondering features of style Bloom would have
                probably have considered trivial&mdash;the repetitions,
                and so on. I don't think they should be disregarded,
                but Bloom is not particularly interested in diction, or
                stylistic norms and deviations, unless they tell his
                ear about a deviant borrowing from precursors. When he
                comes to a poet like Hopkins, he kind of throws the
                diction away, and flies immediately to the poetical
                ideology, as it were. I have a very close relationship
                to Wordsworth, but&mdash;how should I put it&mdash;I
                don't incorporate the poet that I read, or anything
                that I read, in the way that Bloom does.</p>

                <p><strong>MR</strong>: In the 50s and 60s, you wrote
                about contemporary American poetry . . .</p>

                <p><strong>GH</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>MR</strong>: Do you still read contemporary
                American poetry?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>GH</strong>: I still do, but it is not as
                intense. I decided early on that I was going to do
                poetry reviewing, because that's how I would get into
                contemporary American and English poetry&mdash;through,
                you know, the pressure. I need a lot of pressure. My
                aim was to be a poet, so at that time I read poetry to
                get on as a poet. To inspire and feed me. To encourage
                me. And this reviewing of poetry was really my way of
                getting deeper into the poetry. I was also piquing my
                intellect, because each poet is a little world, a
                heterocosm, so that was the challenge. I made some
                discoveries, or I thought I made them, like A. D. Hope,
                the Australian poet. I was sent his book together with
                about 30 others by the <em>Kenyon Review</em>, and I
                said to myself, "This is a great poet. How come no one
                knows about him?" Of course, while they didn't know
                about him in America, he was already famous in
                Australia, so I wrote this review under the illusion
                that I was a discoverer of a new poet, that's how
                na&iuml;ve I was. I had no big background. Whereas
                Bloom, as he told me, from very early on read and read
                and poetry simply fell into him. He memorized Yeats
                completely. He didn't say he memorized every other poet
                too, but he knows, he knows a tremendous amount by
                heart. Empson was another who knew the canon by heart,
                big swatches of it. I envy their capacious memory, or
                should I say heart: their non-mechanical learning by
                heart. That is lost to so many of us.</p>
