                <p><strong>Laura Quinney</strong>: Ok, so it's November
                27<sup>th</sup>, in New Haven. We're at Harold's house,
                and my name is Laura Quinney. This is an interview with
                Harold Bloom about his latest book <em>Jesus and
                Yahweh</em>. Tell me what the epigraph was to have
                been.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>Harold Bloom</strong>: Well there was
                originally a double epigraph. One is still there
                because it explains the subtitle, <em>The Names
                Divine</em>, and that is the second of the two
                quatrains of the concluding "To the Accuser who is the
                God of this World" of the final version of Blake's
                little emblem book "For the Sexes: The Gates of
                Paradise," that is to say:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Though thou art Worshipd by the Names Divine<br />
                  Of Jesus and Jehovah thou art still<br />
                  The Son of Morn in weary Nights decline<br />
                  The lost Travellers Dream under the Hill&mdash;</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>but originally I had wanted to have with it a very
                great sentence, spoken by an actual governor of Texas
                back I think in the early 1930s who rejoiced in the
                name of Ma Ferguson. And when this lady was inaugurated
                as governor of Texas, she announced that so long as she
                was governor, no state-supported school, from junior
                high up through the University of Texas at Austin would
                be allowed to teach any foreign language whatsoever,
                and her reason for this she expressed in one very great
                sentence: "If English was good enough for Jesus then I
                suppose it should be good enough for us."</p>

                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: [Laughs.] Thank you. I wanted
                to ask you in particular about what it means to be a
                Jewish Gnostic.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Ah.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: In your book, in the opening
                paragraphs on "The Jewish Sages on God," you write:
                "The God of the Gnostics is called the Stranger or
                Alien God, and has exiled himself from our cosmos,
                perhaps forever. I do <em>not</em> regard Yahweh in
                that way" [p. 193, Quinney's emphasis]. And yet you
                describe yourself as a Gnostic.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Well, I am partly relying upon
                my great mentor Gerhard or Gershom Scholem, who in many
                conversations with me, primarily in Jerusalem, but also
                in Boston, New York City, and here at this table in New
                Haven, would frequently say to me that the great
                disaster of Kabbalah was its Neoplatonic scheme or myth
                of emanation&mdash;the sephirot&mdash;and that he
                greatly preferred what he called the Gnostic kabbalah
                of the early Merkavah mystics, which he thought had
                been renewed by Moses Cordovero, who was the teacher of
                Isaac Luria, and then by Isaac Luria in which Ein Soph,
                the Kabbalistic name of the infinite one, or
                Yahweh&mdash;whose name you're not supposed to use, but
                I am now&mdash;Ein Soph creates the universe by
                contracting and withdrawing inside himself, or as I
                say, going back to the original Hebrew of the Zimzum,
                which means to sharply draw in or take in your
                breath&mdash;it is that act which at once creates and
                ruins worlds, according to Cordovero and Luria, and
                those who came after them. But Gnosticism: Scholem was
                convinced and Moshe Idel, to whom I am much closer in
                every way&mdash;he is a close personal
                friend&mdash;Moshe Idel on this agrees with Scholem
                though frequently they don't: Idel says that
                fundamentally he thinks that what someone like Hans
                Jonas and other scholars after him have called
                Gnosticism is actually a kind of parody or echo of a
                kind of archaic Judaism which we don't have any more,
                though you can find curious versions of it in the
                different books of Enoch and other apocryphal
                literature. Even when I was a little boy, the Talmudic
                rabbi who fascinated me was the one denounced by all
                the others in the Pirke Abboth or Sayings of the
                Fathers, the rabbi Elisha Ben Abuyah, whom the others
                called Akah, meaning the stranger or the alien, and who
                is reported to have ascended into heaven in a mystical
                trance and there beheld not one God but two gods,
                sitting on thrones facing each other, one being Yahweh,
                and the other being Metatron, the angel of the divine
                presence who simply was the transmogrified human being
                Enoch after he is carried off by Yahweh to the heavens
                without the necessity of first dying. There are all
                kinds of complex traditions, some of them going back a
                long, long way, even though we have no texts of what
                could be called an original Jewish Gnosis. As I
                understand Gnosticism,&mdash;and it seems to me in this
                I am highly consonant with my hero Ralph Waldo Emerson,
                as I am with Valentinus of Alexandria or Basilides of
                Alexandria, or with Luria or Cordovero, let alone that
                splendid fellow Nathan of Gaza, who wrote the treatise
                on the dragons and was the spokesperson or prophet for
                the false Messiah Sabbatai Zevi,&mdash;Gnosticism
                essentially comes down to a few convictions. One is
                that the best and oldest part of every one of us, even
                if we don't have immediate access to it, or easy access
                to it, is part and parcel of God. (I want a very small
                sliver, dear.) Another is that the creation and the
                fall are not two separate events, but one and the same
                event with all of the unfortunate (that's fine dear)
                the unfortunate pragmatic (thank you
                dear)&mdash;pragmatic consequences of this (mmm . . .
                it's full of liquor; mmm, it's yummy . . . ).</p>

                <p><strong>Daniel Flesch:</strong> Is this yours,
                Mom?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>William Flesch</strong>: Shhh . . .</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: I suppose the remaining basic
                conviction of Gnosticism is that there is, besides the
                divinity to which it is so hard to have access, it is
                very deep in the rock of the self. There is also an
                exiled component of the true God, who is not Yahweh but
                presumably the Anthropos, the original man/God of the
                hermeticists. Except, who knows? Akiba&mdash;Akiba who
                was after all the normative rabbi, the founder of what
                we call normative Judaism in the second century of the
                common era, Akiba specifically said that his favorite
                name for God was <em>ish</em>, which is man.
                So&mdash;in any case I suppose the final tenet of
                Gnosticism is that there is an exiled component of the
                Godhead, but it's not in this world, which is governed
                by the archons and governed by Blake's Nobodaddy as it
                were, and that far off beyond our solar system, in the
                cosmological outer spaces there is the&mdash;aren't you

                <p><strong>HB</strong>: No. No no no no no. He
                is&mdash;he was for me the surprise of my book. As I
                say at one point he usurped this book. Indeed he wasn't
                supposed to be there at all in the first place.
                Originally the title of the book was <em>Jesus and
                Christ</em>, since I regard the two of them as totally
                separate figures, but I found that as I got into it, it
                didn't make any sense to me unless I really talked
                about Yahweh, and I think the really original part of
                the book is the second half, on Yahweh, which actually
                goes so far as to apply Lurianic Kabbalah to the whole
                question of the origin of Yahweh. You will remember
                that in Kierkegaard Nebuchadnezzar, after he had been
                changed back from a beast in the field to a man, says
                of Yahweh, "Nobody knows who <em>his</em> father was,
                or who taught him the secret of his strength" [quoted
                from Quidam in <em>Stages on Life's Way</em>] and I
                speculate in a perfectly Kabbalistic way, I say&mdash;I
                speculate that a perfectly&mdash;aren't you going to
                eat it&mdash;?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: Yes I'm going to try it.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: In a perfectly, I think,
                Kabbalistic way that Yahweh may have come into
                existence by this act of Zimzum, this act of
                contraction or withdrawal, which means that he
                diminished himself in order to get started. Which I
                find fascinatingly parallel to Walt Whitman, in which I
                again follow Scholem: who used to say in conversations
                with me, that in a secular world somehow Whitman by
                some miracle without knowing anything about Kabbalah
                had in effect reinvented his own Kabbalah, and I think
                that is true. Whitman throughout <em>Song of
                Myself</em> and elsewhere is always saying that he is
                expanding, that he is getting to contain more and more
                multitudes, that his sense of self is steadily
                increasing. But in fact he too is always contracting
                and withdrawing. He is endlessly elusive and evasive,
                and the worlds that he creates and ruins also seem to
                come from some process of self-withdrawal.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: This may lead to my next
                question, which is something that puzzles me about the
                book. And that is that in some sense I was not sure why
                you think of the Yahweh of the Hebrew Bible as a true
                description of a Deity, rather than as a . . . ?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Well, there are
                Yahwehs&mdash;just as I say there are seven versions at
                least of Jesus or Jesus Christ, or Jesus and Jesus
                Christ, in the Greek New Testament, there are
                innumerable versions of God in Tanakh, the Hebrew
                Bible, but the one who interests me and always has and
                always will, is the original one, the first Straha,
                traditionally called J or the Yahwist, probably written
                as early as the reign of Solomon, 3,000 years ago, in
                which most certainly he is as I say a stern imp, up to
                a lot of mischief, something of a trickster
                God&mdash;human all too human: he's always walking
                around on the ground; he isn't flying up in the
                air&mdash;he's walking around on the ground in order to
                make personal, you know, sort of on the job inspections
                of how things are going. He closes the door of the
                ark&mdash;of Noah's ark with his own hands; he even
                more memorably buries Moses in an unmarked grave, with
                his own hands; he is very fond of picnics; thus at
                Mamre he sits beneath the terapim trees because he
                always likes to be in the shade rather than the sun,
                thus he walks we are told in Eden in the cool of the
                day, at Mamre, with two of the Elohim who are his
                angels he sits beneath the terapim trees, and he has a
                sumptuous rather full-scale luncheon prepared by
                Sarah&mdash;roast veal and whey and freshly baked
                sort-of cakes. And how is one to put it&mdash;he on
                Sinai, on the side of Sinai, he sits there and shares a
                meal with 73 elders of Israel. They stare at him and he
                stares at them and that's it. He doesn't say a word and
                they don't say a word, but there he is. And according
                to Kabbalistic tradition, from the Merkavah thing on,
                he's enormous, he is I say the King Kong of deities, he
                is of enormous size.</p>

                Cleopatra, Iago&mdash;they are all more real than you
                are, whoever you are, and yes, they are fictions, but
                if they're fictions, what are we? Since they are
                livelier than we are, exceed us in energy and in
                dynamism, as Yahweh does also. It seems to me
                that&mdash;I mean he may just be not at all an
                attractive version of what Mr. Stevens wanted to call
                the supreme fiction, but he is . . . he's quite a
                fiction, he's very persuasive and as I keep saying in
                the book I wish he would go away. I don't like him. I
                don't feel anybody can like him. His famous definition
                when Moses asks him his name&mdash;his famous
                self-definition is ehyeh asher ehyeh, translated by
                William Tyndale as "I am that I am" and that's kept in
                the Authorized Version of the English Bible. The Hebrew
                "ehyeh asher ehyeh" actually means "I will be, I will
                be;" "I will be <em>that</em> I will be," or to make it
                into better English "I will be present wherever and
                whenever I choose to be present," but I say throughout
                the book that also means "And I will be absent wherever
                and whenever I choose to be absent." And he is very
                distinguished by his absences, it seems to me. But if
                he is just a literary character&mdash;well first of all
                I don't recognize any distinction between literary and
                human characters; I mean I'm notorious for that, and
                why not be notorious for that&mdash;it seems to me that
                the sacred Bloomstaff, as I call him, is at least as
                real as old Bloom&mdash;Sir John Falstaff, of course.
                But not even kidding, I mean what can you say about the
                Yahweh of the J writer? He is endlessly memorable, he
                is endlessly unreliable. [Pause.] But he gets inside
                you. I repeat I would like him to go away, but he
                doesn't seem to go away.</p>

                him now is what our Uncle Siggy Freud called "reality
                testing" and the Reality Principle. Freud says that
                reality testing means that you have to "make friends

                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Yeah, he is . . . [Pause.] I
                think I remark somewhere in the book, with a certain
                amiable&mdash;I wouldn't say <em>irony</em>, but a kind
                of zest, that God had breathing trouble and this
                trouble created the world. And I think I remark
                something like, "Try to hold in your breath for as long
                as possible, and then just before you can't stand it
                any more, try to think something into creation, try to
                will or think something, and see what happens." Which
                always makes me think of Kafka's very grand remark to
                Max Brod, where he says, "We are one of God's thoughts
                when he was having a bad day." It seems to me he has
                mostly bad days. But since I don't think there's any
                distinction whatsoever between sacred and secular
                texts, there's only great writing and bad writing (or
                good writing in between I suppose or fair writing) then
                it's natural to speak of&mdash;in fact, remember what
                Blake says; he says religion is just choosing forms of
                worship from poetic tales, and then he adds&mdash;this
                is <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> &mdash;
                "Thus men forgot that all Deities reside in the human
                breast." But that doesn't mean that they don't reside
                there. And of course, this is now a very tricky
                business, because I'm not sure anybody&mdash;you're not
                supposed to believe in Yahweh anyway if you are a
                normative Jew, you're supposed to have Emunah, you are
                supposed to trust in the covenant with him, but he's
                never kept the Covenant himself, and I get awfully
                weary of the Hebrew prophets who are always denouncing
                the people of Israel for violating their covenant with
                Yahweh when Yahweh hadn't kept his for a moment, and
                always seems to be hard at work destroying his chosen
                people. He seems to resent sometimes, precisely because
                he had such trouble bringing them into existence I
                suppose and they are after all according to that story
                the original people that he brought into
                existence&mdash;</p>

                <p><strong>HB</strong>: I don't like him. I repeat I
                wish he would go away. But somehow he doesn't. I don't
                think I have any nostalgia for him. I wouldn't dream of
                praying to him, but then I'm an Emersonian, and Emerson
                in "Self-Reliance" says quite wonderfully, "As men's
                prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds
                a disease of the intellect." Now Christianity has
                creeds; Judaism doesn't. Islam has creeds; Judaism
                doesn't. There are now one and a half billion so-called
                Christians in the world and one and a half billion
                so-called Moslems in the world&mdash;those who have
                submitted: which is what it means, Islam means
                "submission." There are perhaps fourteen million Jews
                still left, so obviously it's a thousand to one. The
                fight got settled a long time ago, but on the other
                hand there are even more Hindus. Nobody knows how many
                people there are in India&mdash;they don't practice
                birth control there, unlike the Chinese who so
                rigorously try to keep their population from getting
                completely out of hand; there may well be more Indians
                now than there are Chinese&mdash;in any case, if you
                add up all the Indians, excluding the Pakistanis or the
                Moslem Kashmiris, if you add up all the Hindus and
                other modes of religion in India which are not Moslem
                or Christian, and you add in all the Taoists,
                Buddhists, and Confuciusts, not only of China but of
                the rest of Asia, and the Buddhists and Shintoists of
                Japan, there are more non . . . what are we to call
                them? Ultimately at the moment it seems to me that with
                great crusader Bush leading us there is a kind of
                religious war being fought between the Moslem world and
                the Christian world, just as there is obviously a
                religious war being fought between the state of Israel
                and the Moslem world, which is why Israel is sitting on
                top of that vast mound of atomic and hydrogen bombs in
                Dimona, but in the long run I suppose the religious
                future may well lie with the East.</p>

                disappointed with? He is, he's bad news, he has always
                been bad news. No, I'm not disappointed; I find him
                very fascinating, very interesting. As I say, he's even
                more interesting than King Lear, and to some extent at
                least&mdash;well, Mark's Jesus and Hamlet run almost
                neck and neck in interest. Each of them has incredible
                mood swings, as Sir Frank points out, following me in
                that part of his review. No I'm... [Pause.] Look, I've
                been teaching how to read for 51 years now. I've been
                writing and publishing criticism for 51 years. It seems
                to me that what I've written in this book is really
                just an extension of the book <em><a name="Anxiety" id=
                "Anxiety"></a> The Anxiety of Influence</em>, which in
                its first form was written back in the summer of 1967
                when I was 37, and actually contained a rather savage
                chapter on the Gospel of John, which I detached and
                later published separately, and now in revised form
                have put it into this book, so it's a pretty direct
                line from one to the other. I was rather amused,
                though, to see my old student Jonathan Rosen, in the
                review that appeared in today's <em>Sunday Times Book
                Review</em>, saying that: Well after all what
                difference does it make that Wallace Stevens strongly
                misread Shelley in order to produce characteristic
                Stevens, what matters is religious truth, and, you
                know, it is the truth or falsehood in regard to one
                another of, say, Christianity and Judaism or of Islam
                that matters. That may be Jonathan Rosen, but that
                isn't me, and that isn't in the book that he's
                reviewing. Not that I'm ungrateful for his review,
                which you know certainly shows a warm heart, and
                reminds me of a wonderful pun I once&mdash;quoting from
                the Hebrew&mdash;of an almost Lewis Carrollian or
                Joyceyan dimension, that I threw into an outrageous
                public lecture here on the relation between the
                so-called two covenants or two testaments. I also liked
                the joke, which I'd seen before but hadn't seen for a
                long time. It's an old Yiddish remark, that the
                Christians stole our watch 2,000 years ago, and are
                still telling us what time it is. I like that. It's
                almost as good as my favorite Yiddish proverb, as I
                translate it: "Sleep faster, we need the pillows."</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Well, it seems to me no more or
                no less vital or of concern to you as my close friend
                or to me, as my relation to King Lear. I would have
                great difficulty in saying what my relation to King
                Lear is. I agree with Charles Lamb: you shouldn't even
                go and see somebody try and act the part, because it's
                unactable. What can you do with a figure who actually
                stares up at the sky and cries out, "You heavens, you
                should take my side because you too are old." That's so
                marvelous and I can't imagine an actor enunciate it.
                And I've never seen a Lear that worked. I think that
                trying to play Lear would be rather like having a drama
                in which somebody played Yahweh. Inconceivable.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>

                not sure I can imagine you using it about Lear. You
                speak of your "waning skepticism" about Yahweh.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Well, I have waning skepticism
                about Lear also. I mean the difference is that I get
                fonder and fonder of Lear, irascible old creature as he
                is. Waning skepticism.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: Yes, that's interesting. It's a
                good surprising phrase. You expect the reverse.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: I drag it in at the end of the
                book because I got very bored by Sam Harris. You know
                pragmatically there's no difference between Sam Harris
                urging an end to faith; I would say fine, Judaism isn't
                faith anyway. That's Pauline Pistis, the substance of
                things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. No,
                the only question is whether you trust Yahweh or you
                don't, and obviously you shouldn't and can't and
                couldn't and won't, because he's bad news, as I keep
                saying. He's as good an explanation for why everything
                goes wrong all the time as we could want. And he's had
                a terrible effect upon the world. Because in a somewhat
                altered and perhaps even more aggressive form, he is
                the Allah, which is a variant in Arabic on Elohim, of
                the Koran, of the Recitation, and he utterly disappears
                in Christianity, where God the father is just kind of
                an unfortunate, weak imitation of Yahweh. [Pause.]
                Surely it comes back to Leibniz, doesn't it? Which is
                then picked up by the horrible Heidegger. Why should
                anything be, anyway, rather than not be? Since Yahweh
                puns on ehyeh, which is the ancient Hebrew verb for
                being. I don't know. In the end I suppose if I have to
                vote and go with any one, I go with Hamlet, who is a
                nihilist as I read him. I think Shakespeare's
                ultimately is nihilistic, not Christian, not even
                Hermetist, just nihilistic, but I don't know that
                pragmatically there's any difference between Yahwism
                and nihilism. You know: is this a difference that makes
                a difference? to invoke William James's, you know,
                quite Emersonian definition of American pragmatism. It
                doesn't seem to me that it is a difference that makes a
                difference.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: No, there's no faith to be had

                trust him. I don't trust him. He's not worthy of trust.

                Holocaust as&mdash;I take it that that for you is
                emblematic.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Oh sure. Oh sure, I mean
                Yeshua, if he was crucified, was one of hundreds of
                thousands of Jews who were being crucified by the
                Romans in those days. And the biggest single holocaust
                of Jews took place after Rabbi Akiba proclaimed Simon
                bar Kosba, Simon bar Kochba or son of the star and said
                he was the Messiah, ben Joseph, that is to say, not the
                Messiah ben David but the Messiah ben Joseph, the
                warrior who comes first. And that led all of the Jews
                in the world into a terrific rebellion against Hadrian,
                and millions of Jews were eventually slaughtered and
                Akiba tortured to death at the age of 95; Bar Kochba
                went down heroically, taking legions of Romans with
                him. At one point in the book I have a sentence that
                Jeanne, my wife, reading it, said "Harold, it shouldn't
                be there; it will get you into trouble." But I'm glad
                it's there, because you know the great phrase about
                Yahweh in the Psalms and elsewhere is that Yahweh is a
                man of war, and I think his most memorable single
                appearance, and I talk about it, in the Bible, in
                Tanakh, is in the Book of Joshua, where at one point
                Joshua&mdash;you know it is after the death of Moses
                and Joshua is in command of the Israelites and they
                conquered Canaan, and before a crucial battle near
                Jericho he notices an armed warrior. He doesn't
                recognize him, and he boldly goes up to him, and he
                says, "Are you one of us or one of them." And the
                fellow replies, "The ground upon which you stand is
                holy. Take off your sandals." At which Joshua takes off
                his sandals and abases himself because he recognizes
                that it is Yahweh a man of war come to fight in the
                battle of Jericho, which he does, as he also fights,
                you know, with the tribes that came to the battle in
                the first Hebrew poem that we have, the song of Deborah
                and Barak in Judges 5. So I have this sentence in the
                book: "If Yahweh is a man of war, then Allah is a
                suicide bomber." I think they are all bad news, Judaism
                and Christianity and Islam. But I wanted to make clear
                in the book that there is no such thing as a
                Judeo-Christian tradition. That is absolutely
                ridiculous. And fascinatingly enough there are two
                things that I've said throughout my life when I've
                addressed Jewish audiences, say at the Jewish
                Theological Seminary or such places, and they always
                get furious at me. But they're both true. One is that
                nowhere in the whole of the Tanakh does it say that a
                whole people can make themselves holy through study of
                texts. That's a purely Platonic idea, and comes out of
                Plato's Laws. That simply shows how thoroughly
                Platonized the rabbis of the second century were. The
                other one, which I say in this book and it has already
                given some offense, is that in fact not only is
                Judaism, which is a product of the second century of
                the common era&mdash;and it's worked out by people like
                you know Akiba and his friends and opponents like
                Ishmael and Tarphon and the others, is a younger
                religion than Christianity is. Christianity in some
                form exists in the first century of the common era.
                What we now call Judaism comes along in the second
                century of the common era. Christianity is actually the
                older religion, though it infuriates Jews when you say
                that to them.</p>

                category&mdash;you know any time you want to say that
                some text is more sacred than another then you've made
                a political statement, and I don't like political
                statements. It is utterly insane that by vote of the
                United States Congress, the Church of Scientology has a
                tax exempt status. That means that <em>Dianetics</em>,
                by L. Ron Hubbard, which I challenge anybody to try to
                read, is a sacred text, by vote of Congress. And of
                course what it is is very ninth rate science fiction.
                Though it now has distinguished believers like, I

                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Well, the alternative is to
                entertain all of these fictions. Remembering what Uncle
                Wallace taught us, which is that the final belief he
                says is to believe in a fiction, with the nicer aspects
                of belief, that knowing that what you believe in is not
                true. It's just imaginatively much more interesting to
                be a Gnostic rather than an agnostic, to be fascinated
                by Yahweh rather than indifferent to him. Walt Whitman
                liked to say that the United States are in themselves
                the greatest poem. Alas they're not, but it's a nice
                idea. Yahweh is a great poem. [Pause.] I don't think
                Jesus Christ is a great poem. [Pause.] I never quite
                make up my mind about Allah, though I'm fascinated by
                the fact that the Koran is the only book I've ever read
                in which every single phrase is spoken by God himself.
                It is the voice of Allah that you hear from the
                beginning to the end, supposedly by mediation of the
                angel Gabriel, being dictated to Mohammed, who however
                doesn't write it down because supposedly he's an
                illiterate, which baffles me, because he's a successful
                merchant, and how could you have been a successful
                merchant if you were illiterate, and couldn't read or
                write? But supposedly he memorizes it and then he
                dictates it&mdash;a very suspicious process of course,
                but then no more suspicious than the formation of
                Tanakh or the Greek New Testament. I don't say it in
                this book, because I had said it in the book just
                before, called <em>Where Shall Wisdom be Found</em>, in
                the chapter there that reprints with a few
                modifications a commentary that I'd written on the
                Gnostic or quasi-Gnostic Gospel of Thomas,&mdash;I ask
                every New Testament theologian I've known in this life
                the same question; I've asked the great Pelikan this
                question, at which he had just shrugged his shoulders
                and walked off smiling amiably: How is it that we don't
                have an Aramaic Gospel? Why is there no Nazarene
                Gospel? Even though we know that no one who wrote
                anything that is now in the New Testament had ever seen
                the historical Jesus, had ever heard him say a word,
                nevertheless, for any of this to make even an iota of
                sense, that person did not go around speaking
                Koin&eacute;, speaking demotic Greek. He went around
                speaking Aramaic. Aramaic and demotic Greek are totally
                different languages. The nuances of thought, expression
                and spirituality of one are not readily translatable
                into the other. How could you believe that you were
                hearing the <em>ipsa verba</em>, the actual words of
                the incarnate God, and not write them down and preserve
                them? And what makes me even more suspicious is, you
                will notice, as though they throw it in to show the
                authenticity of this inauthentic schmaltz, all through
                the Gospels suddenly you're thrown a phrase or two in
                Aramaic, including, you know, the last words spoken
                from the Cross. Why? And where's the rest of it?</p>

                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: You say in the book when you
                come to the question of why Christianity has been
                appealing, I believe you say, it's the promise of the
                resurrection.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Well, even more simply now
                though: I was on Charlie Rose some weeks ago, and
                Charlie, I suppose playing straight man&mdash;a hard
                role for Charlie to play&mdash;said: To what do you
                attribute the fact that you've just spoken of, Harold,
                that there are a billion and a half Moslems in the
                world and a billion and a half Christians and only
                fourteen million Jews, how do you explain the enormous
                appeal of these religions? I said: Well on the one
                hand, in both Islam and Christianity, you're getting a
                great deal in exchange for very little. All you have to
                do in Christianity is say, "I accept that Jesus of
                Nazareth was also Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the
                anointed one or Messiah," and as a result you have life
                eternal. And all you have to do in Islam, as they say,
                which is what it means, is submit just to the statement
                that Mohammed, who is certainly not divine and doesn't
                pretend to be divine is nevertheless the seal of the
                prophets, the final kind of a prophet and all you have
                to do is submit to the will of Allah, and in return you
                get Paradise. And of course there's also the fact, as I
                said on Charlie Rose, that Christianity triumphed not
                just because of that but because Constantine the Great
                looked over what was available to him, including
                Mithraism and so on, and said, "The right way to hold
                the Empire together, the right state religion is
                Christianity." So he swung the sword of Constantine,
                and out went all the heretical versions of Christianity
                also, including the Gnostics and we got the Church, the
                Roman Catholic Church indeed. And then Mohammed, as the
                Koran makes clear, and all the texts after
                it&mdash;Mohammed is definitely a man of war and kept
                defeating the Arabian Jews and he defeated the various
                Arabian pagans, and after his death his Califs went on
                and on and on magnificently (ah yes, beautiful wife)
                magnificently went on conquering. So both Islam and
                Christianity triumphed by the sword, and of course then
                started engaging with one another&mdash;in the
                Crusades, in Spain, in North Africa, and at the moment,
                whether we like it or not, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and
                God knows where next.</p>

                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: I take it that you find the
                Hebrew Bible not only aesthetically deeper than the New
                Testament, but also that you find it&mdash;how shall I
                say it&mdash;spiritually deeper?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: The only thing in the New
                Testament that seems to me spiritually valuable is the
                general epistle of James, undoubtedly written by a
                disciple of James, that is to say Jacob the brother of
                Jesus, by tradition anyway the brother. And that is
                precisely what Martin Luther wanted thrown out of the
                Bible&mdash;he called it an "epistle of
                straw"&mdash;because it said specifically that faith is
                not enough, that only works matter, and it ferociously,
                like the prophet Amos and the first Isaiah, cries out
                against those who oppress the poor. I'm not sure how
                much spirituality really interests me in the Gospel of
                Mark. The Gospel of Mark&mdash;and a couple of early
                reviewers, in places like <em>Kirkus</em> and (what's
                that other one?) <em>Publisher's Weekly</em>, got very
                angry with me about this&mdash;and they both picked
                this up and a couple of reviewers I've seen
                since&mdash;where I say that in many ways the author of
                the Gospel of Mark reminds me of Edgar Allan Poe, in
                that he writes very very badly on a sentence by
                sentence basis, and yet he's got a spooky kind of
                universalizing imagination. You know, he dreams
                universal nightmares, and it's very hard to get them
                out of your head.</p>

                Both bad writers on the sentence level.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Yeah. Oh yeah. Dreiser is
                endlessly fascinating in that regard. <em>Sister
                Carrie</em> breaks my heart, and <em>An American
                Tragedy</em> hurts so much I hate rereading it. But on
                a sentence by sentence basis they're impossibly drab
                and dreadful. And it's quite true,
                <em>Frankenstein</em> and <em>The Last Man,</em> as
                prose are very badly written, but they work, they work.
                And the Gospel of Mark I think is very badly written,
                by an amateur writer, evidently a Jew in Rome, writing
                at about the time, you know, word is reaching him that
                the temple is being destroyed and the city is being
                burned, and&mdash;it is very compelling. And then of
                course I hate the Gospel of John because as I say
                candidly in the book it hates me so I hate it. It keeps
                saying that the Jews are all the children of Satan. Now
                that's very interesting, in the whole of the Hebrew
                Bible, except for one brief, rather muted reference, I
                think in the prophet Zachariah, who's late, the only
                place where Satan enters is not as a fellow named
                Satan, a personage named Satan, but as the ha-Satana,
                the accuser, the prosecuting attorney, at the beginning
                of the Book of Job. But in the Greek New Testament, the
                only character who matters besides Jesus Christ is
                Satan, who is onstage almost non-stop. It's a
                Satan-haunted piece of work.</p>

                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: Oh, speaking of being haunted,
                there's a beautiful passage at the end of the book,
                where you say "I very much want to dismiss Yahweh as
                the ancient Gnostics did, finding in him a mere
                demiurge who had botched the creation . . . . But I
                wake up these days, sometime between midnight and two
                A.M., because of nightmares [of] Yahweh" (p. 236).</p>

                beautifully groomed beard and hair, and flashing a
                cigar at me. But Uncle Siggy&mdash;If asked what Yahweh
                looks like, I wouldn't think of Blake's Nobodaddy, I
                would think of Uncle Siggy.</p>

                [Laughs.] How uninteresting it is to be an atheist. I
                mean, you can't make literature out of that.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: Well, I thought when I read the
                book: I've always described myself as an atheist, but
                maybe it's dishonest, maybe I should say I'm a Gnostic.
                I'm angry with God. Perhaps that's Gnosticism.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Yeah, I think if you argue with
                God, or you're angry at God, if you have a grudge
                against him, then that's much more fun than just saying
                he's not there at all.</p>

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Well, remember we live in the
                United States of America, under the reign of W. the
                Great, who is on record as saying that Jesus Christ is
                his favorite philosopher, and is sitting there in Camp
                David at this moment, telling his intimates that he's
                on a mission from God to install democracy in Iraq, and
                will not cease, you know, till he either leaves office
                or has done it. And I believe him, I think he is that
                crazy. He is an authentic crusader, unlike his Papa,
                who knew when to come home. And this is Jesus Christ
                CEO, you know this is the American Jesus of the
                Christian right. It's very interesting. There is no
                Yahweh in the United States. I mean God the Father is
                just about gone. There is of course the BVM, or as I
                like to call her, thinking of her manifestation in the
                Houston Astrodome, visiting the refugees there, the
                BBB, the Blessed Barbara Bush. That's our deity, or one
                of our deities. My wife is particularly fond of the
                Blessed Barbara Bush. I guess I like her too. She is
                very good value. It's fascinating that we have an
                American Jesus, and he's always been an American, not a
                Jew at all, but the Christian right has now so
                compromised him, that when Hispanics come pouring into
                this country from south of the border or the Caribbean
                or further down, like so many African-Americans and
                like so many increasingly poor whites in the South or
                even in the Midwest, they're turning to Pentecostalism,
                which is the fastest growing religious movement in the
                United States, which has nothing to do with Jesus
                really, or Jesus Christ. It's all about the Holy
                Spirit, which is pouring down upon them and they're all
                shouting and jumping with him. I'm not so sure that in
                the end this will not be a Pentecostal nation. In which
                case it's true pre-Scripture will turn out to have been
                <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em>.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: Where does the idea of the Holy
                Spirit come from?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>: Ah. On the basis of almost no
                New Testament evidence&mdash;a dove or
                two&mdash;Christian theology manufactured, needing a
                third person for the trinity, along with God the
                father, to finish Yahweh and Jesus Christ the
                theological God&mdash;they needed another entity, so
                they gave us the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost. But he
                never really took root in European or Middle-Eastern
                Christianity, or in East European and Russian
                Christianity. It's here in the United States that
                Pentecostalism really took off, and it's burgeoning,
                you know, every day. The largest single Pentecostal
                unit is the Assemblies of God, and they just sort of
                surge on in number all the time. There are independent
                Pentecostal groups all over the country. I've got some
                former students in Atlanta, who shall be
                nameless&mdash;charming people&mdash;who are literary
                critics, teachers of literature by profession, and they
                are ferocious Pentecostalists. They&mdash;I attended
                one such service in Atlanta, and there they were all
                whooping it up and shouting when the Spirit hits them
                indeed and crying out in strange tongues and defying
                the laws of gravity, and it's all wonderful stuff. I'm
                not being ironic. So it <em>was</em> his mother.</p>

                the question is, why do you think you're&mdash;what is
                it that&mdash;why are you haunted, what keeps bringing
                you back?</p>

                <p><strong>HB</strong>: I read the Hebrew Bible. I
                brood about it. It's a very strong text. Whether you
                read it in the original, or you read William Tyndale
                and Miles Coverdale, who between them write about
                eighty-five to ninety percent of what you find in the
                authorized version, and who are, with Shakespeare and
                Chaucer the four great writers of the English language
                as far as I can tell. Tyndale writes prose, Coverdale
                does Psalms and battle hymns and so on. Both terrific
                writers. And as I say, with Shakespeare and Chaucer,
                the most powerful writers.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>LQ</strong>: But you read the texts because
                you're already haunted.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><strong>HB</strong>; Well, Laura, you reread
                <em>King Lear</em> and <em>Hamlet</em> because you are
                already haunted, and then you get more haunted by
                reading them. They are infinite. They go on forever, in
                the same way the war song of Deborah and Barak or the
                great chant in the Second Isaiah about the suffering
                servant, palpably meant to be the people of Israel,
                which becomes however in the Christian interpretation
                the suffering Christ&mdash;</p>

              <li>
