    </div>
    <p>This volume of <i>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</i> includes an editor's introduction by <a href="#lussier">Mark Lussier</a>, essays by <a href="#economides">Louise Economides</a>, <a href="#morton">Timothy Morton</a>, <a href="#rudy">John Rudy</a>, <a href="#mccort">Dennis McCort</a>, and a poem by <a href="#dubie">Norman Dubie</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">The genesis of this collection began with seemingly simple questions the editor asked of himself (and occasionally others), and the works appearing in this volume represent answers offered by insightful and engaged colleagues: "What's going on with Buddhism during the Romantic period? Can and should academic and spiritual practices be unified and interrelated, thereby helping heal an artificially conditioned alienation common within the increasingly corporate academy?" Each one of the essays in this volume argues in different yet interrelated ways for a shared view in Buddhism and Romanticism of forms of suffering created by the self and of the freedom from suffering found in self-annihilation. Emptiness resides in plenitude and solitude, the problematic path for Buddhists and Romanticists alike.</p>

    <h3 align="center">About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</h3>
    <p align="left">The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>
