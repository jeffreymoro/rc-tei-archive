    <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; margin-right: 5px">This volume of <i>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</i> includes an editor's introduction by <a href="#wood">Gillen D'Arcy Wood</a>, essays by <a href="#fuhrmann">Christina Fuhrmann</a>, <a href="#hoeveler">Diane Long Hoeveler</a>, <a href="#jones">J. Jennifer Jones</a>, <a href="#quillin">Jessica K. Quillin</a>, and <a href="#williams">Anne Williams</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">Demonstrating the widescale influence of opera upon the cultural field of the Romantic period, the essays collected in "Opera and Romanticism" aim to redress the critical neglect to which this form has been previously subjected. A lush interchange between opera and both literature and drama is examined in the essays of Christina Fuhrmann, Diane Hoeveler, and Anne Williams. Further, in the essays of J. Jennifer Jones and Jessica Quillin, we see that Romantic opera did not leave behind its Italian roots, but rather remained complexly connected to its predecessor in ways that can be seen in some of the most canonical writers of the time. By reclaiming the suppressed history of opera in this period, Gillen D'Arcy Wood's volume illustrates that opera is what he calls "a vital flashpoint of aesthetic and political interests in the long Romantic age."</p>

    <h3 align="center">About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</h3>
    <p align="left">The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>
