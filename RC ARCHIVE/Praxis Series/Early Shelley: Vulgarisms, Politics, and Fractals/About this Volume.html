<h3>About this hypertext</h3>
This hypertext volume of essays had its inception at a session on the Early Shelley held at MLA in December 1996. The text is encoded in HTML, with some extensions for HTML 2.0, including a limited use of tables and frames. It will work best with Netscape 2.0 or a comparable browser; earlier browsers may not display everything properly. Although the essays are arranged "linearly" so that following the Introduction are the pieces by Reiman, Keach, Morton, and then the response by Brigham, they can, of course, be accessed through links on the Contents page in whatever order you choose. Because you may enter and exit these files along multiple paths, you may have to use the back-arrow button on your browser to return to your starting point. The full text of the volume, like all hypertexts in the Romantic Circles Praxis Series, is <a href="/search/node/">fully searchable</a>. I am grateful to Noel Giffin for allowing us to use the image of the fractal reproduced on the cover page and, especially, to Melissa J. Sites for her careful work in marking up the essays for this volume.
<h3>About the contributors</h3>
<p>The contributors to this volume are among those doing the most exciting work in Shelley studies today:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/praxis/earlyshelley/brigham/brigham.html" name="lbrigbio" id="lbrigbio">Linda Brigham</a> is Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, Manhattan. Her essay "<i>Prometheus Unbound</i> and the Postmodern Politicial Dilemma," which appears in <i>Shelley: Poet and Legislator</i>, edited by Betty T. Bennett and Stuart Curran, is one of the most outstanding pieces in an excellent volume, a standard of excellence maintained in her recent essay on <i>The Cenci</i>, which can be found in <i>Texas Studies in Language and Literature's</i> special issue on "Romantic Drama." Her manuscript-in-progress, tentatively titled "Defying Gravity: Wordsworth, Shelley, and Structures of Individuation," articulates Lacanian psychoanalysis against the work of Deleuze and Guattari to explore distincutions between a Wordsworthian and Shelleyan approach to Romantic language.</p>
<p><a href="/praxis/earlyshelley/fraistat/shelleyintro.html" name="nfraibio" id="nfraibio">Neil Fraistat</a> is Professor of English at the University of Maryland. Beyond his duties as a General Editor of <i>Romantic Circles</i>, he has just completed co-editing with Donald H. Reiman the first volume of <i>The Complete Poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley</i>, which will be published by Johns Hopkins University Press in 1998. Fraistat is also editing with Reiman the Norton Critical Edition of <i>Shelley's Poetry and Prose</i>, and with Elizabeth B. Loizeaux, a collection of essays to be published by the University of Wisconsin Press, entitled <i>Reimagining Textuality</i>. His online editions of Percy Shelley's <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/1dwcover.html"><i>The Devil's Walk</i></a>, co-edited with Reiman, and <a href="/editions/shelley/medusa/mforum.html"><i>The Medusa of Leonardo Da Vinci</i></a>&#160; can be found on <i>Romantic Circles</i>.</p>
<p><a href="/praxis/earlyshelley/keach/keach.html" name="wkeacbio" id="wkeacbio">William Keach</a>, Professor of English at Brown University, is one of our finest readers of Romanticism, in general, and Percy Shelley, in particular. No one has done more sophisticated thinking about the intersections among Shelley's language, style, and politics. His book <i>Shelley's Style</i> remains one of the most important and often cited studies of Shelley in past 15 years and his current manuscript-in-progress on the language and politics of Romanticism is eagerly awaited. Keach has recently completed an edition of Coleridge's poetry for Penguin Press.</p>
<p><a href="/praxis/earlyshelley/morton/morton.html" name="tmortbio" id="tmortbio">Timothy Morton</a> is Assistant Professor of English at the University of Colorado. He is the author of <i>Shelley and Taste: The Body and the Natural World</i>, one of the best and most provocative studies of Shelley in recent years. Among his essays are pieces on literary and cultural representations of the spice trade in the long 18th Century (the subject of a book at which he is now at work), to appear in <i>Essays and Studies</i>, and an article on the representation of sugar in Southey's works, which appears in <i>Romanticism and Colonialism</i>, a collection of essay edited by Peter Kitson and Tim Fulford for Cambridge University Press.</p>
<p><a href="/praxis/earlyshelley/reiman/reiman.html" name="dreimbio" id="dreimbio">Donald H. Reiman</a>, of <i>Shelley and His Circle</i> and the University of Delaware, is recognized as one of the finest Shelley scholars of the 20th Century. He is a General Editor of <i>Romantic Circles</i>, and beyond his co-editing of <i>The Complete Poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley</i>, he is also at work on the next two volumes of <i>Shelley and His Circle</i> and on the second edition of the Norton Critical Shelley. His most recent book is an edition of Percy Shelley's Fair Copy Manuscripts that he co-edited with Michael O'Neill for Garland's <i>Manuscripts of the Younger Romantics</i> series.</p>
