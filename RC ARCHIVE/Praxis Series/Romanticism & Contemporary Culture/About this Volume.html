<h3><a name="series"> </a>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</h3>
<p>The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship. The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> was formerly known as <b>Romantic Praxis: Theory and Criticism</b>. The name was changed in November 1999.</p>

<p><b><a name="mcgann"> </a>Jerome McGann</b>, whose continuing work on the Internet is <a href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/features/features/mcgann/">currently featured at Romantic Circles</a>, first became notorious for publication of <i>The Romantic Ideology</i> in 1983, which famously questions the ideological investments of literary criticism. McGann has long been a talented interpreter of the ideologies informing textual dissemination based on the material conditions of reproduction. He shows definitively, in his new book <i>Radiant Textuality</i>, how the historical conditions of production and consumption have affected reception history. McGann has been well placed to make sense of "the famous proverb that . . . define[s] the coming of the digital age . . . : The Medium is the Message."<br/><a href="/praxis/contemporary/mcgann/mcgann.html">[go to essay]</a></p>
