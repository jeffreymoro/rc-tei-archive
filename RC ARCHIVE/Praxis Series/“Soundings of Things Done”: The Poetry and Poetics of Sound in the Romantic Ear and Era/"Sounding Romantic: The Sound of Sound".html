    <p>That's a noble writer, Wallace Stevens, riding round at last to the subject signaled but delayed in his iconic essay, "The Noble Rider and the Sound of Words."<a href="#1">[1]</a> But, we hear you murmur, <em>Sounding</em> Romantic? or in line with the 2006 MLA Convention call, <em>sound</em> in Romantic poetry and poetics? Either way, it seems counter-intuitive: words, especially poetic ones, affront the new Romantics with unwanted trading in "poetic diction" (Wordsworth and Coleridge, anyway, though Keats rather liked camping it up), or a too parodyable mimetics ("Oh woe is me! oh misery!"). But still, these are technical transactions; whatever the gambit, poetry is words, and words work in the sounding. We might even endorse Stevens's radical constitutiveness: "A poet's words are of things that do not exist without the words" (32). No things but in words. &nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Reading poetry, we sound the words, out loud, or in the head. It is through a path of sound that Coleridge drives his theory of poetry. He opens a lecture of 1818 on the art by observing, with a preliminary near pun, that "Man communicates by <em>art</em>iculation of Sounds, and paramountly by the memory in the Ear&mdash;Nature by the impression of Surfaces and Bounds on the Eye."<a href="#2">[2]</a> In the auditorium of Coleridge's lecture, even the visual work of Nature seems conscripted, in so far as the ear catches the rhyme of <em>Bounds</em> to <em>Sounds</em>. But what of reading, sound evoked by an impression on the eye? Reading poetry, too, is a sounding, Coleridge proposed just the year before in <em>Biographia Literaria,</em> with a Stevens-prone simile for audition: a reader is carried forward "like the path of sound through the air" (chapter 14).<a href="#3">[3]</a> More than a simile, this is a transformational trope: poetry is this very imagination of words as a path of sound through the air. Yet in Romantic airs, its path often courses into a waning or absent sound: that prized metaphysics of silence, deep within, way beyond the material or any mere phenomenological instance. And the old paradox is that sound takes us there, pitches its tenor.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <li>
    <p>In the Romance of silence, Romantic poets are always tuned to what T. S. Eliot calls an "auditory imagination" ("the feeling for syllable and rhythm, penetrating far below the conscious levels of thought and feeling, invigorating every word").<a href="#4">[4]</a> Coleridge's verse in <em>The Eolian Harp</em> sounds out a lilting course into silence, "Where the breeze warbles and the mute still Air / Is Music slumbering on its instrument" (31-32). He feels his syllables beautifully to this end: <em>Where</em> (whispering across <em>warbles)</em> echoes in <em>Air,</em> and within, <em>mute</em> is poised for reverberation into <em>Music</em> and <em>instrument.</em> This is all tuned to an extended figure in which music is not music, but its cessation, a suspense both of motion and sound finely compounded in <em>still,</em> and underscored by the arrest of pentameter into spondees: "the <strong>mute still Air</strong>." Coleridge has an ear for such limits, of sound suspended: the rapture of being "Silent with swimming sense" in <em>This Lime-Tree Bower, My Prison</em> (39), or the gothic turns: that "strange / And extreme silentness" that vexes meditation and nearly freezes the meter in <em>Frost at Midnight</em> (9-10); the "moonlight steeped in silentness" in the Mariner's return to an alien home harbor (<em>The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere</em> [1798] 505). On hissing s's, sound subsides into spectral dreamscape.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The iconic Wordsworthian poet is a famously silent type: mute above the Boy of Winander's grave, or tracing "wreathes of smoke / Sent up, in silence, from among the trees" (<em>Lines, written a few miles above Tintern Abbey</em> 18-19), with a metric stress on the faintly audible sympathies of <em>wreathes</em> and <em>trees, from among,</em> and the wisp of all the s-words. This poet is soon cherishing "an eye made quiet" (48). Elsewhere he contemplates "the silence and the calm / Of mute insensate things" ("Three years she grew" 17-18) that also claims "the silent Tomb" ("Surprized by joy"). All these pauses of deep silence verge on a poetics of eternity that makes "our noisy years seem moments in the being / Of the eternal Silence" (<em>Ode: Intimations of Immortality</em> 154-55), the world for "ears" indicted in the subvocal of "noisy (y)<em>ears."</em> In her bodily decrepitude Dorothy Wordsworth will sigh of the "robe of quiet [that] overspreads / The living lake and verdant field" (<em>Lines Written . . . April 6th</em> 9-10), as if this were a burial shroud for a life in sound, too, now stilled.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Keats's luxurious reveling in language, a physiology it often seems, makes all the more potent his moments of epiphanic negation. If reading Chapman's Homer has him feel he's "heard CHAPMAN speak out loud and bold," silence is the reciprocal homage. Hence the listening reader as kin to Cortez "star[ing] at the Pacific, . . . / Silent on a peak in Darien" (<em>On First Looking into Chapman's Homer)</em>&mdash;a conclusion "equally powerful and quiet," marveled Leigh Hunt as he introduced Keats to readers of <em>The Examiner</em> (1 December 1816). In another scene of reading Keats hails an urn as a "still unravished bride of quietness" (among the puns in <em>still</em> is <em>unsounding)</em> and a bearer "of silence and slow time" (<em>Ode on a Grecian Urn</em> 2), the time of reading slowed by the shift of pentameter into spondee. He is soon tuning his words to "unheard melodies" over and against, and "more endear'd" (11-13) to the ear than a merely unyielding "silent form" (44).<a href="#5">[5]</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>So, too, Shelley's apostrophe to Mont Blanc's "Silence" hails a carte blanche, a blank upon which "the human mind's imaginings" flurry into verbal production. The very name, by punning historical revision, puts a claim on the erasure that so agonized Milton's lament, "a universal blanc / Of nature's works to me expunged and razed" (3.48-49; thus <em>blank</em> in the 1667 text). Shelley's title by Franco-phonics says "my blank; my blank verse."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>As these conflicted poetics of silence suggest, none of the metaphysics, none of the epistemics, none of this would matter, materialize to consciousness, but for the paths of sound. "Speak si[l]ence with thy glimmering eyes," Blake invokes the Evening Star (<em>To the Evening Star)</em>, with an audible sigh of "<em>si</em>lence" in "<em>eyes</em>." Well before Simon and Garfunkel sang "the vision that was planted in my brain / Still remains / Within the sound of silence," Romantic poets were there, and tacitly theorizing the contradiction.<a href="#6">[6]</a></p>

    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Not the least of the agents is the word <em>sound</em>, not only the occasion of our convocation, but a meta-trope for poetry in the ear, whether heard or silently audited, more endear'd. It's a meta-trope, too, because <em>sound</em> is homophone, variously drawn out from different etymologies, which come together (by chance or choice) from a prodigal polyglot past. There's the Latin <em>sonare:</em> the very word is like a bell for poets, the fount of <em>son</em>net ("little sound") and per<em>son</em>a ("sounding through"). Petitioning for, and sometimes crowding into the same literal space, and open for punning (<em>O Pun!</em> to honor Charles Lamb), there are Old English tributes of <em>sound</em> (test the depths); <em>sound</em> from a different source for <em>healthy</em> (sane), and with a slight shift, as in <em>sound asleep</em>, whole, entire; and the waters (more etymology yet) in Milton's poetry of Creation, "Sounds and Seas" (<em>PL</em> 7.399)&mdash;poignantly sounding <em>sees</em>, what the blind poet does no more. All these <em>sounds</em> play as synchronic kin, the accident of phonemic confluence that condenses new senses. My audit of "sounding Romantic" in what follows is keyed to the sound of <em>sound</em>, figuring not just a pre-verbal pulse of apprehension and expression, or a counter-verbal metaphysics, but the pleasurable satisfactions realized by the language in poetry.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">A primer of this recreation, playing on poetic infrastructure, is Southey's <em>jeu d'esprit</em>, "The Cataract of Lodore," a poem shaped, phonically and metrically, into a cascade of sounds that not only coincide with lexical sense but drive it as a primary expressive force:</p>
    <blockquote>Turning and twisting,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around and around<br />
    With endless rebound!<br />
    Smiting and fighting,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sight to delight in;<br />
    Confounding, astounding,<br />
    Dizzying and deafening the ear with its sound. (64-70)</blockquote>
    <p align="left">Alliteration, assonance, rhymes terminal and medial, all rebound in lines that seem</p>
    <blockquote>. . . never ending, but always descending,<br />
    Sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending,<br />
    All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar,<br />
    And this way the Water comes down at Lodore. (118-21)</blockquote>
    And this way, too, "The Cataract of Lodore" comes down to the name from the rush of sound with which it rhymes more than once&mdash;"All at once and all <strong>o'er</strong>, with a mighty <strong>uproar</strong>." With different theological or epistemological pressure, this might be a landscape of hell or an intractable Mont Blanc. Part of Southey's delight is just such suggestion and negation&mdash;underwritten by the displacement of epic or odic pentameter by jaunty tetrameters. Half echoed is the "wilde uproar" of Milton's Pandemonium and chaos,<a href="#7">[7]</a> converted to delight. Against Milton, too, the poetics of <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> is so changeable and interchangeable (all at once) that the last line arrives as an arbitrary end for soundings that, once in motion, seem endlessly variable, always descending, this very word a relay-rhyme that contains and undoes <em>ending</em>.</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">As Southey's political enemy Byron knows, sound can pack a polemical punch. The very hero of <em>Don Juan</em> refuses a continental chime of <em>Juan</em> with <em>want</em> ("I want a hero") to insist on English matchmaking with <em>new one.</em> Anti-hero <em>Southey</em> is brought to rhyme with <em>mouthey,</em> one of many with whom Byron settles scores in sounding the name. English national hero, Napoleon's vanquisher at Waterloo, Wellington, gets a French twist at the outset of Canto IX, rung and wrung on Byron's disgust of war glory:</p>
    <blockquote>Oh Wellington! (Or 'Vilainton', for Fame<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds the heroic syllables both ways.<br />
    France could not even conquer your great name,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But punned it down to this facetious phrase&mdash;<br />
    Beating or beaten she will laugh the same.)<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have obtained great pensions and much praise;<br />
    Glory like yours should any dare gainsay,<br />
    Humanity would rise and thunder 'Nay!'</blockquote>
    In the French story, <em>Wellington</em> is punned down to <em>Vilainton</em> (villain-style), and the protest <em>Nay</em>, without even sounding the syllables another way, says <em>Ney</em>: Napoleon's field marshal, executed into nothingness after the Bourbon restoration. On his manuscript Byron wrote <em>Vilain ton</em> as two words, to sharpen the pun; and he scrawled an equivocation about <em>Ney</em> or <em>Nay:</em> 'Query, <em>- Ney? -</em> Printer's Devil,' a footnote that was put into print.<a href="#8">[8]</a></li>
    <li>
    <p>Though Waterloo may seem far afield from the War in Heaven, our close-listening (one form of close-reading) is, by multiple Romantic routes, a heritage of <em>Paradise Lost,</em> full of sounds, not the least the sound of its extraordinary verse. This is poetry in love (too much in love, Milton could worry) with its material pitch and tone&mdash;sounds, for better or worse, for sin or salvation. Johnson complained famously at the end of <em>Life of Milton</em> that blank verse&mdash;blank of rhyme punctuation for the ear "as a distinct system of sounds"&mdash;was "<em>verse only to the eye</em>."<a href="#9">[9]</a> But to blind Milton, blank verse was first and always a poetry of sound, sounded in the head<em>,</em> aloud to a secretary, and never seen, by him anyway, on the page. His was "a voice whose sound was like the sea," said Wordsworth (<em>London 1802)</em>&mdash;the alpha-theorist of <em>The Power of Sound</em>&mdash;with an undersound in "like the <em>see"</em> that plays back to Milton's "Sounds and Sees<em>."</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">In all these punning measures the word <em>sound</em> keys a poetic differential from words as information. Though the line of difference can be anyone's call, <em>sound</em> is the poetic trade. "Quite an epicure in sound," was Wordsworth's lifelong impression of Coleridge, and he was among the beneficiaries.<a href="#10">[10]</a> Having listened (over the course of two weeks in the dead of winter, January 1807) to Wordsworth reading <em>The Prelude</em>, Coleridge finds himself at the close "Absorb'd, yet hanging still upon the sound," with <em>still</em> (again) catching <em>quiet</em>, <em>stasis</em>, and a <em>duration</em> of sound in the air (<em>To a Gentleman</em> 111). In this blank verse, Coleridge lets <em>sound</em> find a rhyme (with metrical stress) at <em>found</em> in his last line: "And when I rose, I found myself in prayer" (112).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The paths to these soundless raptures are often love-affairs with sound, leading to the very word:</p>
    <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, its strings<br />
    Boldlier swept, the long sequacious notes<br />
    Over delicious surges sink and rise,<br />
    Such a soft floating witchery of sound.<br />
    <div align="right">(<em>The Eolian Harp</em>17-20)</div>
    </blockquote>
    Such witchery is the sounds, the vibration of sequa<em>ci</em>ous / deli<em>ci</em>ou<em>s</em> <em>s</em>urges (undertoning <em>urges</em>) / <em>s</em>u<em>ch</em> a <em>s</em>o<em>ft</em> <em>f</em>loa<em>t</em>ing wit<em>ch</em>ery of <em>s</em>ound.<a href="#11">[11]</a> The word <em>sound</em> then vibrates in a phrase about itself: "Melodies <em>round</em> honey-dropping flowers" (23), enriched by the dropping of the <em>round</em> sound into the fl<em>ow</em>ers. Even <em>boldlier</em>, a strangely arresting sound in so rare a word, seems half-created to herald this insurgence.</li>
    <li>
    <p>No wonder then that the hymn Coleridge boldly added in 1817, to "the one Life, within us and abroad" (26 <em>ff)</em>, is so intricate with its sound, <em>Life</em> heard again in the relays of <em>light</em>: "A light in Sound, a sound-like power in Light" (28). Allegorizing poetic presence, Coleridge not only suggests that sound, like light, is a powerline through the air; he's also working with the chiasmus of <em>sound</em> as a phonological paradigm. Even the sound of the simile-word <em>like</em> echoes <em>light</em> as it sends the sound of <em>sound</em> into <em>power.</em> It's the first pulse of the line, the imperative that shimmers <em>A light</em> into <em>Alight</em>.<a href="#12">[12]</a>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Coleridge was a reflective theorist as well as effective poet of these events, of meaning generated by the happy accidents of words in sounds:</p>
    <blockquote>N.B.&mdash;In my intended Essay in defence of Punning&mdash;(Apology for Paronomasy, alias Punning) to defend those turns of words,
    <blockquote>che l'onda chiara<br />
    E l'ombra non men cara,</blockquote>
    In certain styles of writing, by proving that Language itself is formed upon associations of this kind . . . that words are not mere symbols of things &amp; thought, but themselves things&mdash;<br />
    <div align="right">(<em>Notebooks</em> 3: 3762)<a href="#13">[13]</a></div>
    </blockquote>
    Associations are accidents of sound, in which words as things gain unsuspected power. When the poetry of <em>This Lime-Tree Bower</em> concludes that "No Sound is dissonant which tells of Life" (76), Coleridge arrays the line so that the assertion by negation carries an echo of itself in Soun(<em>d is</em> <em>Disson</em>)ant.</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">In telling of the unlife of the Arctic, Coleridge's Ancient Mariner is haunted by sounds so alien that even the word <em>sound</em> becomes phantasmic:</p>
    <blockquote>The Ice was here, the Ice was there,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ice was all around:<br />
    It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd&mdash;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like noises in a swound!<br />
    <div align="right">(<em>The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere</em> 57-60)</div>
    </blockquote>
    In this ice-sounding, noise similizes the assault: <em>swound</em> is a ghost of <em>sound,</em> a rhyme-word that lurks in the aural field without precipitating. And (we may well wonder in reflex) what the hell is that <em>swound</em> flaunted for reference? It sounds like a nonce-compound of <em>wound</em> (coiled), <em>wound</em> (injury), and <em>sound&mdash;</em>another of those Coleridge inventions, exquisitely desynonymized from near kin for this moment only. OED tells us that <em>swound</em> is a word from long, long ago, the age of oral poetry. For his retro-ballad of 1798, Coleridge recalls <em>swound</em> as a forgotten sound, an archaeology unearthed: it's <em>swoon</em> old-form (same etymology),<a href="#14">[14]</a> and (even better!) a variant of <em>sound. Like noises in a swound</em> is not after anything so mundane as mimesis. It is etymology, as if Coleridge were auditing Pope's tidy couplet, "'Tis not enough no Harshness gives Offence, / The <em>Sound</em> must seem an <em>Eccho</em> to the <em>Sense"</em> (<em>Essay on Criticism</em> 364-65), to estrange the lesson, and propose the reverse: the genesis of <em>sense</em> from <em>sound</em> or as sound. However one speaks it, the stress of <em>Swound</em> hits the ear as a wounded <em>sound.</em></li>
    <li>
    <p>Coleridge must have been remembering this terrific sublimity of sound when he recalled, a decade on, a storm on the lake of Ratzeburg, in sentences so exquisitely tuned to phonics as to suggest an event still in the writer's ear:</p>
    <blockquote>there was a storm of wind; during the whole night, such were the thunders and howlings of the breaking ice, that they have left a conviction on my mind, that there are Sounds more sublime than any Sight <em>can</em> be, more absolutely suspending the power of comparison, and more utterly absorbing the mind's self-consciousness of it's total attention to the object working upon it. (Rooke, ed. 2: 257)<a href="#15">[15]</a></blockquote>
    And here, Coleridge may be remembering Burke on the "sublime passion" of "sounds":
    <blockquote>The noise of vast cataracts, raging storms, thunder, or artillery, awakes a great and aweful sensation in the mind . . . and by the sole strength of the sound, so amazes and confounds the imagination, that in this staggering, and hurry of the mind, the best established tempers can scarcely forbear being borne down.<a href="#16">[16]<br />
    <br /></a></blockquote>
    Burke awakes awful sensation in his sounds: the alliterations, the swelling of <em>sound</em> in <em>confounds</em> and <em>down,</em> the strange reverse-birth in <em>forbear being borne down,</em> the line made slow and heavy by these very sounds.</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Across the poignant course of his sublime <em>Rime,</em> Coleridge writes the verse of sound in a chord of antithetical returns. This is the Mariner's delusionally beatific swoon, the revival of the dead crew, rendered and remembered with a vibration in the sound of sounds:</p>
    <blockquote>Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from their bodies pass'd.<br />
    <br />
    Around, around, flew each sweet sound,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then darted to the sun;<br />
    Slowly the sounds came back again . . . (341-45)</blockquote>
    <p align="left">This is a symphony of <em>sounds</em>, exhaled through the vowels and the slide of <em>s</em>'s in <em>rose slowly through</em> (with a phonotext-effect in <em>rose lowly</em>) to issue up and out from <em>mouths</em> that seem formed for <em>sounds</em> and resound in the rhyme with <em>Around, around</em> and the slow return of its own <em>sounds.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Coleridge may seem spendthrift of such effects, in the register of Keats's urging poets to be "misers of sound and syllable" (<em>Incipit altera Sonneta)</em>. For his sonnet-sonics, Keats did not spend the word <em>sound</em> until his tenth line, and waited for its return until its last: "She will be bound with garlands of her own"&mdash;that is, Poesy, among her weavings, <em>sound</em> unchained from rhyme-scheming to echo in this liberal <em>bound</em>. In a haunted dream-epic Keats wonders of sound without syllable, the sensation without sense:</p>
    <blockquote>Or thou might'st better listen to the wind<br />
    Whose language is to thee a barren noise,<br />
    Though it blows <u>legend-laden</u> through the trees . . .<br />
    <div align="right">(<em>The Fall of Hyperion</em> 3.4-6)</div>
    </blockquote>
    &mdash;verse he copies in a letter, underlining the compound, eager to share it with one of his most attentive readers (Richard Woodhouse) "on account of" its "fine sound." As if caught up in the sweep, Keats may have transcribed the line with two <em>though</em>s: "Though it blows legend-laden though the trees." Editors usually follow Hyder Rollins in supplying a dropped <em>r</em> for the second one, to get <em>th[r]ough</em>;<a href="#17">[17]</a> but Keats often writes a shorthand emphatic downstroke that implies two letters, and I think here he may have liked the fine-sounding of <em>Though</em> / <em>blows</em> / <em>though</em> enough to let it ride.</li>
    <li>
    <p>In the Keats phonotext of 1819, the fine sound of <em>legend-laden</em> echoes the <em>leaf-fring'd</em> <em>legend</em> that "haunts about" the Grecian Urn, to tease with a latent sound effect (<em>Ode</em> 5). There is some evidence, moreover (Andy Elfenbein tells me) that <em>legend</em> was sounded in Keats's day with a first long <em>e</em>; if so, <em>leaf</em> gets an echo, along with a pun on <em>legion'd&mdash;</em>a word Keats sounds in fantasy in <em>The Eve of St. Agnes,</em> where "legion'd fairies pac'd the coverlet" of Madeline's quiet sleep (xix). On the Urn site, Keats manages, with fine visual poetics, to bring an unsounded "ring" within the <em>fring'd legend</em>, as if the sound were ready for audition.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>It's a fine sound that plays, too, in Autumn "on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep" (<em>To Autumn</em> 16), a suspense of motion and music&mdash;as if in this poppy-drowse, all sound sleeps in heavy ease. Keats's deft slide in these registers reminds us how <em>sound</em> may multiply, variously, in chords of sense: as tone, as character, as depth, as resonance. It is Keats's irrevocably sound sleep of death that prompts Shelley to imagine <em>Echo</em> pining away "Into a shadow of all sounds:&mdash;a drear / Murmur" (<em>Adonais</em> 134-35), a trace of waning sight (shadow) that gains this phonic effect. On another pulse, the "sound of life" heralded in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> draws aural sensation into recognition, the world-enkindling "seldom-heard mysterious sound" learned from the artist who wrought a guitar into a vibrant instrument (<em>With a Guitar, to Jane</em> 75). "Sounds as well as thoughts have relations, both between each other and towards that which they represent, and a perception of the order of those relations has always been found connected with a perception of the order and relation of thoughts," Shelley proposed in his <em>Defence of Poetry</em> (<em>SPP</em> 514)&mdash;the same paragraph that insists on "the vanity of translation," and seems, even, to offer a demonstration in the relation of <em>Sounds</em> and <em>found</em>.<a href="#18">[18]</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">No one broods more over sound, caressing words as things (so the poet put it in a note to that sound-haunted ballad, <em>The Thorn</em>) than the iconically-ironically named Words-worth. In his own audit, he identifies a habit that feels diachronic:</p>
    <blockquote>Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound<br />
    To breathe an elevated mood, by form<br />
    Or image unprofaned: and I would stand<br />
    Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are<br />
    The ghostly language of the ancient earth . . .<br />
    <div align="right">(<em>The Prelude</em> <em>1805</em> 2.324-28)</div>
    </blockquote>
    "The 'power in sound' is the severe music of the signifier or of an inward echoing that is both intensely human and ghostly," says Geoffrey Hartman, hearing in these lines an even more radically pressured "relation between textuality and referentiality": the way this poet's words respond to a priority of sound that beckons as "a potentially endless descent," saved only by an impulse to textualize the sounds, install them, measure them in poetry.<a href="#19">[19]</a></li>
    <li>
    <p>For Wordsworth this impulse is an element of style, an argument that words matter for the sounding: among the "reasons why repetition and apparent tautology are frequent beauties of the highest kind" is "the interest which the mind attaches to words, not only as symbols of the passion but as <em>things</em>, <em>active and efficient</em>."<a href="#20">[20]</a> And so the luxury of words as sound&mdash;whether in "the sound like thunder" that is not thunder but the motion of eternity ("It is a beauteous Evening" 8); or the "sounds / Of undistinguishable motion" (<em>Prelude</em> 1805: 1.331-32) that are not eternity, but the reflux upon an imagination still haunted by boyhood thefts (how rare to put the sound of <em>undistinguishable</em> to work in blank verse); or the luxuriously echoing redundancy of "h<em>ear</em>d the <em>murmur</em> and the <em>murmur</em>ing sound" in the nut-tree grove (<em>Nutting</em> 37) that underscores epicurean boyish foreplay in the key of Eve's call from mirror-romance to Adam by a sound of "murmuring waters" (<em>Paradise Lost</em> 4.453).</p>

    <p align="left">What a world of winter gets generated by, and surrounds, a recollection of a whole pack of bellowing boys, as their ice-skates hiss and fly along the sounding board of the lake:</p>

    Confederate, imitative of the chace,<br />
    And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn,<br />

    Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud,<br />
    The leafless trees, and every icy crag<br />
    Tinkled like iron, while the distant hills<br />
    Into the tumult sent an alien sound . . .<br />

    </blockquote>
    No wonder Coleridge put this verse into <em>The Friend</em> after his own account of the thunderous sounds of icebreaking on the Lake (2: 259).<a href="#21">[21]</a> Half-rhyming <em>aloud</em> and <em>sound</em>, with both echoing <em>loud</em> and <em>resounding</em> in the train, Wordsworth fills the verse with sound everywhere and alien&mdash;a weird auditorium that he amplified in 1836 by replacing the merely space-filling <em>Meanwhile</em> with <em>Smitten,</em> to echo in the relay from <em>din</em> to <em>precipices.</em> Even in the auditorium of 1805, the relay of <em>sent</em> is already sounding in <em>distant,</em> in <em>tumult sent,</em> and the hiss of <em>sint</em> across the line of "hill(<em>s</em> / <em>Int)</em>o."</li>

    <p align="left">As Wordsworth's verse shows in more than a few traces, sound is a memory, an imprint poetry strives to capture:</p>
    <blockquote>My eyes are dim with childish tears,<br />
    My heart is idly stirr'd,<br />
    For the same sound is in my ears,<br />
    Which in those days I heard. (<em>The Fountain</em> 29-32)</blockquote>
    <p align="left">It is sound that stirs the heart to recover what was heard, and it is sound, too, that recovers, finds lost <em>years</em> in m(<em>y ears), idly</em> stirring inside "ch<em>(ildi)</em>sh." For Wordsworth it is often sound that stirs and flows feeling from past to present:</p>
    <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot paint<br />
    What then I was. The sounding cataract<br />
    Haunted me like a passion . . . (<em>Tintern Abbey</em> 76-77)</blockquote>
    <p align="left">Reciprocally, an adult reads back from sight to sound:</p>
    <blockquote>The gentleness of heaven is on the Sea:<br />
    Listen! the mighty Being is awake,<br />
    And doth with his eternal motion make<br />
    A sound like thunder&mdash;everlastingly.<br />
    <div align="right">("It is a beauteous Evening" 4-8)</div>
    </blockquote>
    The manuscript shows no final period<a href="#22">[22]</a>&mdash;a mimesis of <em>everlastingly</em> not only in sense but as a pervasive sound sweeping up the phonics of "the Sea: / Listen . . . / hi(s e)ternal . . . thunder&mdash;everlastingly." Hearing is believing.</li>
    <li>
    <p>It is Shakespeare's <em>Lear</em> that Keats says is in his ear at the seashore in April 1817, the occasion for a sonnet that advances <em>sound</em> is a formal rhyme. It is all immediated by Edgar's fiction for his blind father, "Hark, do you hear the sea"?&mdash;a solicitation that falters metrically when Gloucester completes the line "No, truly" (4.6.4), a foot short and in a weak rhyme with <em>sea</em>. Writing about writer's block to fellow-poet J. H. Reynolds, Keats reverses this to his hearing of the sea and a communication to his correspondent (Reynolds). He recreates Shakespeare's sea-scene into a sound stage (with absent Reynolds doubling blind Gloucester):</p>
    <blockquote>. . . the passage in Lear&mdash;"Do you not hear the sea?"&mdash;has haunted me intensely.
    <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Sea.<br />
    It keeps eternal Whisperings around<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desolate shores, and with its mighty swell<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gluts twice ten thousand Caverns; till the spell<br />
    of Hecate leaves them their old shadowy sound.<br />
    often 'tis in such gentle temper found<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scarcely will the very smallest shell<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be moved for days from whence it sometime fell<br />
    When last the winds of Heaven were unbound. . . . <a href="#23">[23]</a></blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>How nice of Keats, comments Christopher Ricks, to interpolate the coercive pressure of <em>not</em><a href="#24">[24]</a> and, with a poet's ear, add the tenth syllable to Shakespeare's line. We see him working sound through it all: <em>Sea</em> / Inten<em>sely</em> / <em>To the Sea</em>&mdash;right into the first rhyme, with <em>Sea</em> itself in the subtle current of sound in "keep(<em>s E</em>)ternal." The whispering is also of the portmanteau <em>Seaternal</em>, an undertow of Wordsworth's "hi(s e)ternal" ("beauteous Evening" 7). In Keats's sea-listening, the shadowy sound of <em>sound</em> in "Whispering<em>s</em> ar<em>ound</em>" (<em>surround</em> / <em>sound</em>) washes into the echo-chamber of those ten thousand Caverns, rippling the <em>s</em>'s across <em>desolate shores . . . spell . . . shadowy . . . scarcely . . . sometime . . . last</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>This is a meditation of sound in the deepest measure, but as Keats and especially Wordsworth know, sounds haunt, in synonymy, sometimes in accidental collusion, with the verb <em>sound.</em> Hence, Wordsworth's present participle <em>sounding</em> as searching, sonic information when sight is of no avail:</p>
    <blockquote>Three sleepless nights I passed in sounding on,<br />
    Through words and things, a dim and perilous way . . .
    <div align="right">(<i>The Borderers</i>, 4.98-99)</div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the blind chamber, "passe<em>d in</em>" intimates <em>din</em> before its sounding, then is echoed eerily in <em>dim,</em> a slide of sound that one is tempted to audit as the terrain of "perilous (s)way." Wordsworth gives the Solitary similar lines to follow:</p>
    <blockquote>By pain of heart&mdash;now checked&mdash;and now impelled&mdash;<br />
    The intellectual power, through words and things,<br />
    Went sounding on, a dim and perilous way!<br />
    And from those transports, and these toils abstruse,<br />
    Some trace am I enabled to retain<br />
    Of time, else lost;&mdash;existing unto me<br />
    Only by records in myself not found.
    <div align="right">(<i>The Excursion</i>, <i>Book III</i> 699-705)</div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the memory of this trace is Wordsworth's Note to <em>The Thorn</em> on the mind's adhesion "to words . . . as <em>things,</em> active and efficient, which are of themselves part of the passion." Sound recovers what sense negates.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Coleridge was arrested by this sense of <em>sounding</em>, and made it a self-description at the end of <em>Biographia Literaria</em> Chapter 4: "I earnestly solicit the good wishes and friendly patience of my readers, while I thus go 'sounding on my dim and perilous way.'" Recollecting his first acquaintance with Coleridge, Hazlitt endorsed the transfer:</p>
    <blockquote>I accompanied him six miles on the road. It was a fine morning in the middle of winter, and he talked the whole way. The scholar in Chaucer is described as going<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounding on his way.<br />
    So Coleridge went on his. In digressing, in dilating, in passing from subject to subject, he appeared to me to float in air, to slide on ice.<a href="#25">[25]</a></blockquote>
    <p>The sound of Coleridge himself seems the path through air, or in its winter climate, the hiss of sliding from subject to subject, sliding on ice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The sound of <em>sounding</em> as prescient deep knowing is nowhere more audible for Wordsworth than in a strange recollection of death by water. In <em>The Prelude</em> he recalls a boyhood sensing of such an event:</p>
    <blockquote>Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross<br />
    One of those open fields, which shaped like ears,<br />
    Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake.
    <div align="right">(<i>1805</i> 5.457-58)&nbsp;</div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The simile is not chance, however, for the event, as the poet now knows, was all about a sounding of information, of random seeking turned to succeeding:</p>
    <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The succeeding day&mdash;<br />
    Those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale&mdash;<br />
    Went there a company, and in their boat<br />
    Sounded with grappling-irons and long poles:<br />
    At length the dead man, 'mid that beauteous scene<br />
    Of trees and hills and water, bolt upright<br />
    Rose with his ghastly face. . .&nbsp;. (5.466-72)</blockquote>
    <p>The <em>telling</em> that is the intuition, and the discovery worked through that half-punning homonym, <em>sounded,</em> are the verbal actions that bring this scene to sight. Called into the verse by a seemingly random, now motivated simile ("like ears"), sound is already in the air, and in retrospect texturing the verse from <em>boat</em> to <em>beauteous</em> to <em>bolt upright.</em> The revelation at hand is even more audible in "soun<em>ded</em>"&mdash;a <em>dead</em> homonym, with a Miltonic formation.<a href="#26">[26]</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Such sounding without sight, dim and perilous for the haunted, can seem to a sighted poet who can't paint what then he was, a fantasy of perfect harmony:</p>
    <blockquote>Thus lived he by Loch-Leven's side<br />
    Still sounding with the sounding tide,<br />
    <div align="right"><i>&nbsp;</i>(<i>The Blind Highland Boy</i> 91-92)</div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The sounding is in the world, past and present, and in the boy himself, in whom all sounds echo, and still sound in Wordsworth's reservoir for the poetry of sound.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>This is a poet forever seduced by the sound of <em>sound&mdash;</em></p>
    <blockquote>O listen! for the Vale profound<br />
    Is overflowing with the sound.</blockquote>
    <p>The poetry is an event of overflow, from the vocative <em>O listen</em> as a phonics for <em>O-verflowing,</em> to the drama of enjambment&mdash;"the Vale profound / Is overflowing with the sound"&mdash;to the way the rhyme of <em>profound</em> into <em>sound</em> arrives on the metrics that pace the overflow. It is a sound that listeners recall as the poet's own. "Christopher North" (John Wilson) remembers him "pacing in his poetical way . . . and pouring out poetry in that glorious recitative of his, till the vale was overflowing with the sound."<a href="#27">[27]</a> Bearing this sound in memory, Dorothy Wordsworth can even catch the lines as her own:</p>
    <blockquote>There is something inexpressibly soothing to me in the sound of those two Lines
    <blockquote>Oh listen! for the Vale profound<br />
    Is overflowing with the sound&mdash;</blockquote>
    I often catch myself repeating them in disconnection with any thought, or even I may say, recollection of the Poem.<a href="#28">[28]</a></blockquote>
    <p>The iambics of "O <strong>lis</strong>ten! <strong>for</strong> the <strong>vale</strong> pro<strong>found</strong> is" pulse in "I <strong>of</strong>ten <strong>catch</strong> my <strong>self</strong> rep<strong>eat</strong>ing." The sounds are not a memory but a sensation that seems ever renewable&mdash;and hence in her letter she replaces her brother's period with a dash that implies prolonged audition. The poem that follows <em>The Solitary Reaper</em> in the 1807 <em>Poems</em>, <em>Stepping Westward,</em> re-echoes <em>sound</em> (as Adam Potkay notes). The title is from a local greeting to the foot-travelers, "What you are stepping Westward?", that Wordsworth liked, in a stepping of regular meter, for its "sound / Of something without place or bound" (13-14).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Shelley takes this scene of boundless audition to the Alps, and replays it with a sense of poetry aspiring, not to tame, but to run wild with antiphony and metrical disorder:</p>
    <blockquote>Thy caverns echoing to the Arve's commotion<br />
    A loud, lone sound no other sound can tame;<br />
    Thou art pervaded with that ceaseless motion<br />
    Thou art the path of that unresting sound&mdash;<br />
    Dizzy Ravine! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <div align="right">(<i>Mont Blanc</i> 30-34)</div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"Like the path of sound through the air" is Coleridge's simile for the retrograde motions of reading. If Shelley's <em>Defence</em> contends that poetry is not poetry without a striving for "a certain uniform and harmonious recurrence of sound" (<em>SPP</em> 514), the case is pitched to crisis here, with the poetry wresting the path of sound into a primary commotion of mind.<a href="#29">[29]</a> The sound-streaming tribute of his poetry is its anagrammatic churning of <em>caverns</em> / <em>Arve's</em> / <em>art pervaded</em> / <em>art</em> / <em>Ravine.</em> While <em>sound</em> achieves an end-rhyme at line 40, "the clear universe of things around," the formal chord is already belated in the train of the triple chord of <em>sound</em> in the commotion of 30-34 about the phenomenon itself. Even the expansive pun of <em>surround</em> in "thing<em>s</em> <em>around"</em> figures what is already in motion. Is this, too, what Keats heard, in tune with Wordsworth, in those "whisperings around" at seaside?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>For Shelley, unresting sound is the mode of the verse, discharging the very words and their inventory of letters from the end of the first stanza and into the dramatic turn to the apostrophe in the next:</p>
    <blockquote>Where waterfalls around it leap for ever,<br />
    Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river<br />
    Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br />
    Thus thou, Ravine of Arve&mdash;dark, deep Ravine&mdash; (9-12)<a href="#30">[30]</a></blockquote>
    Shelley makes his claim for the sounds of poetry as its very sense, and with echoes everywhere of Milton (<em>Paradise Lost</em>), of Wordsworth (<em>Tintern Abbey</em>), of Coleridge (<em>Kubla Khan</em>), and not the least his own harvest:
    <blockquote>Now lending splendour, where from secret springs<br />
    The source of human thought its tribute brings<br />
    Of waters, with a sound but half its own (1-6)</blockquote>
    In the phonic roll of gerunds, sweeping up the very ontology of <em>things</em>, Shelley springs the poem's first rhyme, <em>springs</em>, then turns it to the poem's first couplet-rhyme, <em>secret springs</em> / <em>tribute brings</em>&mdash;the last punning on the very poetics (tributary stream; gift). Thus <em>sound</em> is set to echo in <em>its own</em> (<em>its sone</em>), half in the transformations of the echo-relay. In love with sound, Shelley releases <em>sound</em> to such a pitch as imply that the secrets behind sounds are only blanks, not <em>Mont Blanc</em>. As he is at pains to say in and through <em>Mont Blanc,</em> poetry is called to a sound-source that is but half owned. It is half owned not because sound out there is radically untamable and unnamable, but because the sound of poetry is an audition that is always a sounding of another's words with tributes of one's own.</p></li>

Arden Reed [Cornell Univ. Press, 1984] 206-7).</p>
