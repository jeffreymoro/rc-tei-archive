            <li><p>As a teacher of Romantic poetry for 35 years, I have become impressed 
              not with how hard it is to teach, say, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; 
              but how easy it is. And this I have found disturbing because it implies 
              that on some level the poem is already known; it has not brought its 
              reader to and beyond the horizon of the familiar, which as I see it 
              is one of the main indicators of poetic success. When I ask students 
              to deform a poem after we have discussed it in class, they re-make their 
              understanding of a familiar code of reading in a &quot;sweet struggle&quot; 
              of engagement that honors the poem as an innately resilient and active 
              principle of mind.</p></li>
            <li><p>What in this poem (and by implication many Romantic poems and, for 
              that matter, many poems) makes it seem, in Jerome McGann's word, pre-read 
              and thus not read, as poetry, at all? First, Keats's &quot;Ode&quot; 
              has an enlightenment structure: many questions are asked, in stanzas 
              I and IV, that assume, rhetorically, the presence&#151;available to 
              the speaker or not&#151;of answers. The urn as unravished bride proleptically 
              contains its ravishment as a natural outcome in the ritual of weddings 
              that parallels the consummation of questions asked. And even if stated 
              in a kind of elegiac or tragic negative, other elements are structured 
              around narratives of completion: lover meeting and kissing, trees leafing, 
              ritual sacrifice being performed, citizens leaving and then returning 
              to their town. The poem spins out a series of irreversible narratives 
              of fulfillment. This is precisely analogous to and encouraging of the 
              preferred ritual of reading poems, particularly in school and university 
              classes: the relentless search for the poem's meaning. (Jack Stillinger's 
              recent book on multiple readings of &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot; 
              simply demonstrates that in that poem the ritual can be varied in an 
              astonishing number of ways.) Historicism hasn't particularly changed 
              matters: it simply provides a ready source of answers and, while heightening 
              the resonance of words, images, and voices in poems, it reinforces the 
              enlightenment paradigm.</p></li>
            <li><p>Questions and answers typically presume a questioner who, in the &quot;Ode 
              on a Grecian Urn,&quot; is the speaker propelling the poem passionately 
              through a series of probings and meditations and finally conclusive 
              praise. We readers become interested in him, as a kind of familiar anchor 
              of reading lyric: the fate of the speaker (the concern of Abrams and 
              Bloom in their immensely influential studies of the &quot;internalized 
              quest romance&quot; of Romantic poems) as the major category of meaning 
              and as the crucial thread that further, through consciousness, binds 
              the enlightenment narrative and rhetoric together. And finally we congratulate 
              this speaker's probings as exemplary of the <em>work</em> of enlightenment 
              which again corresponds to the ideal of reading poetry as work.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pre-reading, in this case, occurs in the presence of a poem that triggers 
              a preferred ideological habit of mind; the gratification we get is the 
              purely secondary one of fulfilling the habit. As McGann and Lisa Samuels 
              say, speaking more generally about encounters with instances of traditional 
              poetics: &quot;the rhetorical power of a work of art will ultimately 
              work against itself, dulling our sense of its own freshness&quot; (<em>Radiant 
              Textuality</em>, p. 108). And in the language of Blake and Clare, &quot;poetry 
              fetter'd fetters the human race.&quot; Deformation is a general term 
              for breaking fetters of reading, coming both from sources internal to 
              the poem and internal to the mind of the reader. It is a form not of 
              pre- but of <em>re</em>-reading, a <em>nostos</em> of a more aggressive 
              and wily and yet, oddly, more leisurely and &quot;lazy&quot; or unwarranted 
              return to the poem. In teaching the &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn,&quot; 
              I offer techniques of radical disruption and defamiliarization (a term, 
              along with &quot;deformation&quot; itself, coming from the Russian formalists), 
              of risking the powerful idea that forms are not sacrosanct, that nonsense 
              in poetry is at least as important as meaning, that poems may &quot;contain&quot; 
              nothing, may refuse the domain of and trajectory towards answers altogether. 
              The result is not the abandonment of critical enterprise but a nearly 
              mystical resurgence of conscious power in the presence of a poem, a 
              surge in thinking and excitement. As the poem appears in/as unfamiliar 
              juxtapositions that I have &quot;made,&quot; it occurs to me that those 
              juxtapositions, startlingly, are &quot;there,&quot; part of the poem 
              itself. Amazement accompanies my thinking. Adorno: &quot;the only true 
              thoughts are those which do not grasp their own meaning.&quot; (<em>Minima 
              Moralia</em>)</p></li>
            <li><p>When I deform a poem, I bring to it a highly selective consciousness 
              and intervene materially in its existence, just as Keats does in encountering 
              the Grecian Urn. Think of his decisions and, so to speak, his self-selected 
              regulatory practice! 
              <blockquote>1) he addresses the object; apostrophe is a decision, not 
                something demanded by the urn<br />
                2) he asks it questions <br />
                3) he looks not at the urn as a pot or at its use, nor at the act 
                or nature of looking at it, but at the pictures painted on it <br />
                4) he looks at the pictures strictly as instants of narratives <br />
                5) he attempts at the end to generalize its significance and value 
                <br />
                6) he reveals nothing about himself openly, but the fact of apostrophe 
                and the indicators of various emotional and perspectival registers 
                show that his experience of the urn is a major part of what he wants 
                to say on its behalf.</blockquote>
              He has deformed the urn in the sense that he hasn't talked about it, 
              for example, as clay (<em>Greek Anthology</em>) or as ash (Thomas Browne); 
              he has left out some things in order to emphasize others. The urn is 
              not an object; it is deformed in that it is only its illustrations, 
              its meanings. One thing is certain: for the speaker this encounter with 
              the urn is full of surprise, and what he has seen has &quot;overtaken&quot; 
              his mind. His experience bears little indication of pre-reading (a fact 
              that our growing knowledge of cultural, literary, and artistic sources 
              can only underscore).</p></li>
            <li><p>How different is his practice of selection from, say, deciding to 
              read the poem last line to first? from re-writing the poem as only the 
              sequence of the last word in each line? of reading only its nouns, or 
              its verbs, or its adjectives? of re-writing the poem in the shape of 
              an urn? or in the shape of the ash it may have contained now floating 
              free to earth? or reducing each line to its first two and its last two 
              words leaving out the &quot;stuff&quot; in the middle? or&#151;perhaps 
              most radically (in the manner of Jackson Mac Low)&#151;discovering in 
              sequence, as my student Alex did, the words the beginning letters of 
              which spell out O-d-e-o-n-a-G-r-e-c-i-a-n-u-r-n:<br />
              <blockquote> 
                <table width="75%" border="0">
                  <tr> 
                    <td><strong>Ode</strong></td>
                    <td>Our Deities Escaped</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr> 
                    <td><strong>on a</strong></td>
                    <td>On A</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr> 
                    <td><strong>Grecian</strong></td>
                    <td>Cold Emptied River In Arcady&#151;Gods Never,</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr> 
                    <td><strong>Urn</strong></td>
                    <td>Never Remain Unravish'd</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              </blockquote>
            
            All these examples came from the minds of my students who had been practicing 
            deformation for several weeks and who now felt comfortable with the playful 
            aggressiveness deformation usually requires, sensing that such outrageous 
            acts in fact belong to the strangeness of language, image, enchantment, 
            and consciousness that is the occasion of poetry.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>To say that deformation is simply another name for selection minimizes 
              the radical scale of its intervention. Describing the experience, my 
              student Andrew wrote:<br />
              <blockquote>I slowly crushed the piece into different shapes. I broke 
                it down and built it up again. I RETURN, RETURN, DELETE, DELETE, DELETED. 
                Up and down the words skipped, lines jumping and leaping all over 
                the computer screen trampoline.</blockquote>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Notice here how material the poem has become. . .or is he talking 
              about the urn itself? If the ekphrasis that is Keats's &quot;Ode&quot; 
              assumes a distance between art object and poem, this deformation emphasizes 
              the visionary tendency of both media to veer empathically towards each 
              other. (Traditional readings would keep them mutually uncontaminated.) 
              The reader furthermore has identified &quot;interpretation&quot; with 
              megalomaniacal destruction and re-creation: crush one urn/poem in order 
              to create a second one in words (his poem re-written as a hieroglyph, 
              a concrete poem in the shape of a Grecian Urn). But magically, the reader's 
              initial choice and &quot;regulatory&quot; act&#151;I will re-form this 
              poem in the shape (&quot;O Attic shape!&quot;) of an urn&#151;gives 
              way to the acrobatics of the poem's words and lines independent of his 
              controlling hand, eye, and mind. This is &quot;thought that does not 
              grasp its own meaning.&quot; The reader actively performs the poem which, 
              no longer an object and a container of meanings, performs back.</p></li>
            <li><p>Deforming poems thus produces a condition of reading that underscores 
              the principle of experimental poetics, insisting that the making of 
              a work of art requires both a regulatory practice (e.g. read the poem 
              from last line to first, re-write the poem in the shape of an urn, re-write 
              the poem diastically) and an openness to &quot;chance,&quot; or experience. 
              This confluence acknowledges a poem as at once under the control of 
              the conscious ego and recording materials beyond its control and creates 
              the poetic narrative of a mind expanding beyond the limits of the familiar 
              and the known. Such a reading practice enacts the process of defamiliarization, 
              a freeing of idiom from convention.</p></li>
            <li><p>The urn never provides answers to the questions, it never &quot;yields&quot; 
              to the ravishing ardor of the speaker. The deformation helps us wonder: 
              does the apostrophic act represent a strange fantasy about art's salvific 
              power?&#151;that it could answer our needs? In one of the most unusual 
              readings of the &quot;Ode&quot; proposed, Dorothy Van Ghent, viewing 
              the &quot;sequence&quot; of the Odes as a Keatsian journey archetype, 
              claimed that the &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; signified a failed 
              quest of the hero because of his expectation that an &quot;answer&quot; 
              to his questions about the sources of life (Who? What? from whence?) 
              would appear with a finality from beyond experience and imagination. 
              The deformation suggests that within the goal-driven heat of the speaker 
              resides an &quot;answer&quot; in the form of the non-controlling intervention 
              described by the student. (An answer given, monumentally, from eternity 
              is itself a fantasy of control, as is the assumption that meaning, or 
              meanings, reside permanently in a poem independent of the reader's interventions.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Watch what happens when Ruscha deforms the poem by listing only the 
              last words of each line (last five lines of stanza V):<br />
              <blockquote>waste<br />
                woe<br />
                say'st<br />
                all<br />
                know.</blockquote>
              or (from stanza II):<br />
              <blockquote>shed<br />
                adieu<br />
                unwearied<br />
                new<br />
                love?</blockquote>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Each is a version of the renovative paradigm of visionary poetics&#151;far 
              from either the consoling vision of an all-knowing but enigmatic urn 
              or the ironic and skeptical vision of incomplete but theoretically possible 
              knowledge. In these deformations one observes a sketch of the comic 
              drama of hope, fulfillment, and abundance, sprung from waste and isolation, 
              that characterizes visionary poetics; the important point is that the 
              sketch resides within Keats's Ode. At the same time this renovative 
              trajectory is juxtaposed, say, with what happens when the poem is read 
              from back to front: a movement towards the silence of unanswered questions.</p></li>
            
           <li><p>These two very different kinds of deformations shift attention from 
              a linear, &quot;penetrating&quot; narrative leading to possession, through 
              knowledge, of the object's value, a hidden depth of value, towards a 
              non-subject-object-oriented set of what might be called spatial harmonics 
              of words, the &quot;unheard melodies&quot; of the poem. Traditional 
              readings of Keats's poetry (even up to the present day) assume a speaker 
              of normative consciousness, a person testing the &quot;limits&quot; 
              of visionary apprehension, an assumption encouraged by Keats's decasyllabic 
              line (associated with speech conducted from the perspective of the social 
              world). Deformation reminds one that persons speaking to urns, nightingales, 
              seasons, and ancient goddesses are not in a state of ordinary consciousness&#151;they 
              do not have their feet on the ground. In fact, their words may not even 
              belong to them: a poem like Keats's &quot;Ode&quot; may be a stream 
              or field of unheard melodies or harmonics that impose on or complement 
              one another in unexpected ways. If, for example, you read the poem backwards 
              and arrive, now late in the poem, at the line &quot;What leaf-fring'd 
              legend haunts about thy shape / Of deities or mortals, or of both?&quot; 
              you get:<br />
              <blockquote>What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape<br />
                A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:</blockquote>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>The &quot;legend,&quot; strangely split from its crucial prepositional 
              modifier, is associated with non-verbal nature, with silence and quietness. 
              Legend as story haunts but does not reveal itself; legend as explanation 
              for symbols on a map does not explain. Reading backwards, the &quot;shape&quot; 
              itself remains mysterious. Indeed, the questions that open the stanza 
              vanish like water in sand; or rather, they vanish in the anticipation 
              of the answers they might produce, but they become vivid as &quot;pure&quot; 
              questioning, in their detail, the shape of the stanza: they fill out 
              the image of a questioning consciousness that haunts the space of the 
              poem. Deformation makes one realize how fragile the monumentalizing 
              and epistemologically optimistic trajectory of the &quot;original&quot; 
              poem is and how precarious is the voice of normative consciousness (a 
              point revealed in the following short-line deformation of part of the 
              last stanza, short lines typically being associated with a transformed, 
              disembodied or de-materialized consciousness:<br />
              <blockquote>Thou, silent form,<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost tease us<br />
                Out of thought as doth<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternity.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold Pastoral!)</blockquote>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Deformation often speaks against monumentalism and certainty in poetry; 
              it makes one see that the overwhelming drive for the oracular truth 
              (as Beauty) found outside the precinct of experience but blessing it 
              is a rescue fantasy. Students find such discoveries, that is, they find 
              the opposite experience of deformative intervention, exhilarating, even 
              if deformation often presents poetry more akin to perceptions of the 
              greater world realities of entropy and oblivion.</p></li>
              
              <li><p>Consider Adam's deformation, a re-writing of the poem as ASH, big 
              lines of poetry floating free from the top of the page to the bottom, 
              as if he had emptied the urn of its ritualized contents of death. But 
              what is the substance of ash?&#151;practically nothing, the way words 
              are just signs, not meanings, more non-sense than meaning in poetry! 
              Meaning exists but as an epiphenomenon, accompanying the reading, accumulating, 
              like ash itself as a residue of meaning, haunting the shape of the poem. 
              </p></li>
            <li><p>The shape: in Ovid's phrase, a poem is an <em>imago vocis</em>, an image 
              of the voice. All poems are, in some sense, concrete: meaning-centered 
              reading practices (whether focussed on internal relations or historical 
              ones) typically &quot;pass by&quot; the actual sight in search of the 
              signified, like a train speeding through a tunnel. If you see the &quot;Ode&quot; 
              as ash, as an urn itself, as a short-lined poem (the &quot;stuff&quot; 
              of the middle removed), as prose, as a poem with one word per line, 
              you have created a set of commentaries on the visual impact of the original 
              and can no longer assume Keats's choices of line-length and stanza as 
              simply the default position, the transparent container of the poem.</p></li>
            <li><p>Reading the &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; this way raises the question: 
              do poems &quot;contain&quot;? or are they surfaces? spatial arrangements? 
              Deformation produces the (all too infrequent) condition of re-reading. 
              To deform a poem is to create a second version of it, the first already 
              known, if only in a &quot;pre-read&quot; way. Reading the poem from 
              poem's close to poem's opening, we are haunted by what has become the 
              leaf-fring'd legend, or dream, of the original. As we read, we picture 
              it in glimpses; we recognize it, but strangely. At the same time we 
              are not reading naively: we have already read the poem, and the consciousness 
              of that poem produces, surprisingly, a spatial image of it as we see 
              it reworked, or in Keats's word, &quot;overwrought.&quot; The overwrought 
              (in the emotional sense) search for meaning reduces the poem's space, 
              the poem as an inhabitant of the cosmos (a &quot;real thing,&quot; as 
              Keats would say), to a mere line, with meaning &quot;contained&quot; 
              within the poem.</p></li>
            <li><p>When she wrote her &quot;diastic&quot; deformation based on the line 
              &quot;Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty&quot; (pick a word from the poem 
              beginning with &quot;B,&quot; then a word with &quot;e&quot; as a second 
              letter, another with &quot;a&quot; as the third, and so on), Lisa showed 
              that one harmonic of the &quot;Ode&quot; is &quot;Truth, [is] thus, 
              never near.&quot; Or, as Jessica wrote after rearranging the poem so 
              that all rhyming lines were together, &quot;the thing [urn] is gone, 
              and now there is a poem which is slowly growing incomprehensible&quot; 
              (anti-enlightenment trajectory). In both instances not knowing as a 
              condition of the experience of the poem attests, I believe, to the proximity 
              of poetry to death and the invitation it makes to the mind of the reader 
              to expand outward to touch that which is incomprehensible to us; the 
              poem becomes a kind of underworld image into which the reader descends 
              and travels and observes. In Lisa's poem the world becomes populated 
              with divine as well as human life, and the words, as in Keats's famous 
              line, seem to come from afar; her poem, in fact, may be unpacking the 
              famous aphorism:<br />
              <blockquote>Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty<br />
                Beauty is sweeter struggle.<br />
                Truth, thus, never near.<br />
                Though beneath the bride of youth,<br />
                Deities breathing beauty<br />
                Shape leaf-fring'd truth.</blockquote>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Truth still is relevant to us, but not because we are &quot;winning 
              near the goal,&quot; but because we envision a cosmos which values it. 
              The gods shape it, even in its incomprehensible (to us) form, &quot;leaf-fring'd.&quot; 
              (We might call &quot;divine&quot; the presence of Lisa's poem within 
              Keats's.) Focus, instead, on the sweeter struggle that is beauty, active, 
              engaging, even sexual, and notice that &quot;shape&quot; has been transformed 
              from noun (object) to verb (action). What sweeter struggle could we 
              have than to read this deformation kaleidoscopically with Keats's version? 
              In terms of contemporary experimental poetics (from Mallarme onwards) 
              &quot;truth&quot; belongs to a &quot;constellation,&quot; a set of correspondences 
              in the cosmos; at the same time it is a signifier in the river of language 
              that is the &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn,&quot; beyond the power of any 
              human ego to control it. One begins to realize that Keats, too, was 
              trying to write a poem about letting go of control but that in this 
              poem he may have been committed to a different, enlightenment rhetoric 
              of control. Harmonically, however, a more expansive poem resonates&#151;one 
              not beholden to the &quot;fetters&quot; of subjectivity, of conventional 
              syntax and punctuation, of voice, and even of objects as repositories 
              of truth. The motto of the Ode's harmonics might be in Keats's sonnet 
              on what the thrush said:<br />
              <blockquote>O fret not after knowledge&#151;I have none<br />
                And yet the Evening listens&#151;He who saddens<br />
                At thought of Idleness cannot be idle<br />
                And he's awake who thinks himself asleep.</blockquote>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>This &quot;thought of Idleness&quot; brings to mind another outrageous 
              idea about deformation in Keats's &quot;Ode&quot;&#151;that Keats himself 
              may have written his own deformation of the &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn,&quot; 
              calling it an &quot;Ode on Indolence,&quot; the subject of which confirms 
              a surprising, counter-intuitive consensus in my class about the act 
              of deformation itself as &quot;leisurely,&quot; even &quot;lazy.&quot; 
              Somehow, as vigorous, aggressive, even industrious and productive as 
              deformation appears, it feels beyond the pale of the work ethic that 
              furrows the brows of scholars and students alike and yet limits both 
              vision and engagement. In that later poem, which Keats &quot;enjoyed&quot; 
              writing more than any other in his &quot;1819 temper,&quot; the speaker 
              alludes to an urn in describing a visitation of three figures:<br />
              <blockquote>They pass'd, like figures on a marble urn<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shifted round to see the other 
                side;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came 
                again; as when the urn once more<br />
                Is shifted round, the first seen shades return;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were strange to me, as may 
                betide<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With vases, 
                to one deep in Phidian lore.</blockquote>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Readers tend to see this poem as &quot;imperfect,&quot; &quot;weak,&quot; 
              &quot;immature,&quot; compared to the &quot;great&quot; monumental Odes, 
              but &quot;Indolence&quot; supports my class's view of the deformed version 
              of the &quot;Grecian Urn&quot;: it proposes a different poetics, strategizes 
              against the enlightenment ardor for knowledge and possession and fulfillment 
              of the ego: &quot;Vanish, ye Phantoms! From my idle spright, / Into 
              the clouds, and never more return!&quot; It disregards &quot;depth&quot; 
              and celebrates surfaces: &quot;My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o'er 
              / With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams: . . .&quot; 
              It invites repetition, remarking that an urn is shifted round more than 
              once so that sights on it &quot;return.&quot; The famous textual history 
              of the poem&#151;the uncertainty about the sequence of stanzas&#151;suggests 
              that the poem has no inevitable trajectory but exists in space. (Imagine 
              deforming the poem as a circle of stanzas!) It notes not the familiarity 
              but the &quot;strange&quot;ness of vision and asserts the figures' life 
              independent from the wishes of viewer or maker. And finally it promotes 
              the condition of readerly indolence and implies praise for that habit 
              of mind. Going further, it values what Bataille finds definitive in 
              poetry, its excess of expenditure, its inherent wastefulness. (See Marjorie 
              Levinson for a more elaborate working out of this issue.) In both of 
              his Odes Keats attempts to promote the Urn as object beyond its use-value. 
              Yet my students seemed to accept a course in &quot;lazy&quot; (not use- 
              or meaning-oriented) reading, not as trivial but as a form of serious 
              play. In a course on Romantic poetry, another group of students were 
              surprised to discover, upon reading the &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; 
              backwards that that poem was not about &quot;accepting tragic reality&quot; 
              but about vision in a drugged state (Hemlock, a draught of vintage) 
              and that drugs and oblivion might be what poetry is really about (the 
              true, the blushful Hippocrene), ending as it does with a drowsy numbness; 
              ditto for <em>Kubla Khan</em>bwhen shifted round from back to front. 
              I believe my students discovered that their pleasure in and their acute 
              consciousness of the &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; increased with 
              the riskiness of the playful interventions. Where were they at such 
              moments? Feet clearly not on the ground, clearly not hearing &quot;the 
              voice of busy common-sense,&quot; they nonetheless were affirmed, gathering 
              the meaning of things more or less in a dreamy state, as was the poem 
              passing before their eyes. How much more do we really want to accomplish 
              with a student reading a poem?</p></li>
