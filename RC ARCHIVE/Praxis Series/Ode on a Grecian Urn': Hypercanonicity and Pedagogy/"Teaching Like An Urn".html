            <li><p>During my senior year in college, my best friend was interviewed for 
              a Mellon Fellowship. It was the mid-eighties, and we were Comparative 
              Literature concentrators, drunk with French post-structuralism and hungry 
              for the next big wave in high theory. During my friend's interview, 
              a Famous Harvard English Professor asked her, &quot;How would you begin 
              to teach Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' to first-year undergraduates?&quot; 
              My friend launched upon a lengthy disquisition surveying the various 
              approaches that she might take to expose the poem's aporias, to tease 
              out its unresolved ironies and to confront its deceptive use of prosopopoiea. 
              The Famous Harvard Professor listened patiently. When my friend concluded 
              her rigorous and sophisticated response, she expectantly asked Famous 
              Harvard Professor what she thought of such an approach, and whether 
              that was the answer she was looking for. Famous Harvard Professor replied, 
              &quot;Well, all I really hoped you would say was that you would begin 
              by reading the poem aloud.&quot;</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I share this anecdote for several reasons, not the least important 
              of which is that it calls us back to remember the sheer musical beauty 
              of Keats's language, the luscious sensuousness of Keats's words. This 
              is something of which every class needs to be reminded (and of which 
              most students, whose experience of poetry is silent and textual, are 
              likely to be ignorant). But it also reminds us that students frequently 
              think that literary analysis requires taking a &quot;simple&quot; question 
              and returning a &quot;complex&quot; answer. They imagine (and often 
              with good reason) that such &quot;complexity&quot; is &quot;what we 
              want&quot; as teachers. I would argue, however, that many good teachers 
              are not so much concerned with answers, really, but with questions. 
              For me, and especially with first-year students, encouraging the act 
              of questioning and helping students to formulate meaningful questions 
              are my primary pedagogical objectives. This is especially true when 
              we work with a hypercanonical text, such as &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn.&quot; 
              Such texts, in general, are hypercanonical precisely because they are 
              resistant to any definitive final interpretive answers. This text, in 
              particular, is famously resistant. But it is also a poem that is all 
              about how the questions, rather than the answers, are the most important 
              part of our encounter with an aesthetic object.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The rhetorical act of questioning, and the pedagogical strategy of 
              privileging questions over answers, inform how I teach the ode, largely 
              because of the context in which I teach it. I regularly teach the poem 
              to first-year students in my university's required World Literature 
              survey. It is a course that isn't built to achieve any level of &quot;depth,&quot; 
              and which serves a student population with little background in literary 
              history or theory and a good deal of resistance to being forced to study 
              literature at all&#151;and poetry in particular. We usually have only 
              one class session to discuss the poem (in a four class sequence on European 
              Romanticism). Because most of the students at my university are there 
              to get degrees in the sciences or the health professions, they do not 
              feel terribly eager or empowered to study literature. Many talk about 
              reading poetry as if it were something written in a secret code to which 
              no one ever bothered to give them the key. The students are also generally 
              hard-working and ambitious for high grades. Thus, in the literature 
              classroom, they want to be told what a text means and what they have 
              to know about it so that they can transcribe that information on their 
              test and get an A. They want answers, but that is only because they 
              have been taught that having the answers is what matters most for their 
              GPA. My purpose in teaching the poem, then, is to begin to readjust 
              their intellectual value system to see the equal importance of questions 
              and questioning. &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; is a perfect text 
              for such an objective.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I don't delude myself that my methods are original or theoretically 
              sophisticated, and I guess, to a certain extent, they are &quot;new 
              critical.&quot; I try to have students pay attention to textual details 
              and read the poem closely. Because of the structure of the course in 
              which I teach the poem, I don't teach the poem with much historical 
              or biographical context. While I assign students to read the biographical 
              blurb introducing Keats in the <em>Norton Anthology of World Literature</em>, 
              I tend not to make too much of it. To the extent, however, that I don't 
              attempt to resolve the ambiguous questions that the poem poses, I could 
              say that I resist new critical techniques and tendencies. I don't ever 
              untangle the ambiguities the poem sets forth for the students, and I 
              use the poem metapoetically, as a way of teaching about reading poetry 
              and responding to art in general. As such, albeit in an unsophisticated 
              way, I draw from the deconstructive methods that I learned in my own 
              college classes.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>If there is any critic who has influenced my understanding of the 
              poem, and best helped me to teach it to my first-year students, it is 
              Susan Wolfson. In <em>The Questioning Presence: Wordsworth, Keats, and 
              the Interrogative Mode in Romantic Poetry</em>, Wolfson identifies the 
              interrogative mode as an essential dimension of Keats's style and describes 
              Keats's contribution to &quot;the fundamentally interrogative character 
              of the major poems of Romanticism. These poems are critically implicated 
              in perceptions that provoke inquiry, experiences that elude or thwart 
              stable organization, events that challenge previous certainties and 
              require new terms of interpretation&quot; (18). Reading Romantic poems, 
              then, is a way to help students reframe their experience of poetry in 
              particular, and knowledge in general.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>When I teach the poem in the third week of the semester, I am primarily 
              concerned with how the questions we pose to our students, and the ways 
              in which we help students to pose their own questions, may be more important 
              than the kinds of answers we might try to teach them about literary 
              theory or literary history. If I can teach them to feel comfortable 
              and confident asking questions on their own, then there's a greater 
              likelihood that they will continue to read poetry, and take pleasure 
              in reading poetry, even if it means, to quote Keats's famous letter, 
              &quot;being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable 
              reaching after fact &amp; reason&quot; (43).</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I usually start the class, then, by having the students read the poem 
              aloud (mindful of the advice of Famous Harvard English Professor). Then 
              I ask, much to their surprise, if they notice anything unique about 
              the poem's punctuation, and whether there is any punctuation mark that 
              seems to recur. There's usually silence because they imagine that my 
              simple question must be a trap, as it is far easier than the typical 
              &quot;English teacher&quot; question. But then a brave soul will state 
              the obvious. This allows me to remind them that in a lyric poem, an 
              author has to deal with more limited space (or &quot;length requirements&quot;) 
              and thus needs to choose every word and even every mark of punctuation 
              with great care.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>But then I ask the students why Keats would have so many question 
              marks in the poem. I ask them what his questions are about. I ask them 
              whether the questions seem to have anything in common. I ask them, finally, 
              to whom Keats is asking all of these questions, and, what that might 
              mean for his actually getting any answers. I then ask perhaps the most 
              troubling question, which is, why ask questions when you know you cannot, 
              at least at a literal level, get an answer? Why bother? What's the point? 
              (This last question is the one that non-English majors always seem to 
              ask about the study of literature). I am careful in this whole process 
              never to answer my own questions or to acknowledge any of the students' 
              responses as &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect.&quot; Whether the 
              class notices this, and how soon they notice, varies from semester to 
              semester.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>However, students catch on pretty quickly that the speaker in the 
              poem mirrors their own quandary in approaching &quot;remote&quot; and 
              &quot;difficult&quot; works of art. Once they can identify with the 
              speaker, they can also use his questions to help think through their 
              own. As Wolfson describes, &quot;over the course of the ode, Keats turns 
              the activity of his verse into a dilemma for the reader fully analogous 
              to the speaker's dilemma of interpretation before the urn. By the conclusion 
              of the ode, in fact, we may have the uneasy feeling not only that these 
              dilemmas have converged but that they may even have reversed, for Keats's 
              speaker abandons us with an ambiguously toned 'that is all' just before 
              becoming as silent as the urn itself&quot; (319-20).</p></li>
            
            <li><p>By emphasizing the interrogative over the declarative in the course 
              of our reading the poem slowly and carefully together in class, by the 
              time we get to the famous final lines, the students feel comfortable 
              really probing the &quot;answer&quot; that it purports to give. If class 
              has gone well, the students are now suspicious of the &quot;answer&quot; 
              of the last lines, which, as Wolfson notes, &quot;has the sound of wisdom, 
              but its import is very much qualified by its emergence from a context 
              in which what we know and how we know are subjects of questioning rather 
              than the substance of answers. The more one teases this summary assurance, 
              the more one hears a tone that unsettles its performance of meaning&quot; 
              (327). By the end of class, I hope that I have helped students to better 
              &quot;hear&quot; that unsettling tone, and no longer reach so irritably 
              after facts and reason.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>To be sure, any number of other Romantic poems might demonstrate the 
              interrogative quality of poetry and help model the vital, creative, 
              intellectual importance of questioning. Blake's &quot;The Lamb&quot; 
              and &quot;The Tyger&quot; come immediately to mind. But in so far as 
              Keats's ode asks questions specifically about a work of art, and in 
              so far as Keats is using those questions to get at even greater mysteries 
              like eternity and truth and beauty (ideas about which there are a lot 
              of answers but no final ones), the ode is a very good teaching text. 
              This is not because of the answers that it gives, but, again, for modeling 
              the importance and the urgency of the act of persistent questioning. 
              Wolfson sums this up quite eloquently, linking this feature with Keats's 
              musicality: &quot;The urn befriends its readers the way Keats's rhyme 
              does&#151;by encouraging our imaginative activity in a perpetual fixing 
              and unfixing of what we think we know. We come to value its artistry 
              not so much by what it yields to thought as by what it does to thought, 
              provoking questions and refusing to confirm any sure points and resting 
              places for our reasonings&quot; (325-6). The poem demonstrates for students 
              a point I go on to stress during the remainder of the semester: that 
              literature, and especially poetry, is really a way to try to ask questions 
              about things that there may, ultimately, be no answers for.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>By teaching the poem early in the semester, I hope to help the students 
              to become better questioners, and thus help shape their ability and 
              openness to reading a diverse variety of &quot;strange&quot; texts from 
              a variety of &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;remote&quot; cultures, texts 
              about which they are unlikely to find definitive answers but will enjoy 
              much more if they are comfortable and confident asking questions. In 
              the end, my teaching of &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; is motivated 
              by a refusal to give answers, and a desire to teach the value of unanswered 
              questions. I aspire to teach like the urn itself, forcing questions 
              but never dispensing final answers. I work to frustrate students into 
              challenging the conventions of questioning that operate toward the teleology 
              of the answer. The ode is a perfect text for those purposes, and what's 
              more, it ultimately allows me to make transparent to my students my 
              motives in being so &quot;mysterious.&quot; As Wolfson writes, &quot;The 
              play of questions with which the ode begins culminates in a linguistic 
              limit that is both a parody of critical processes and a cunning expansion 
              of mystery beyond the bourn of words&quot; (327-8).</p></li>
            
            <li><p>By the way, my friend didn't win that Mellon Fellowship. I think, 
              however, that like me, she must have learned some good lessons from 
              the interview, as today she is a tenured professor at a major public 
              research university, and has just been awarded a university-level prize 
              for excellence in teaching.</p></li>
