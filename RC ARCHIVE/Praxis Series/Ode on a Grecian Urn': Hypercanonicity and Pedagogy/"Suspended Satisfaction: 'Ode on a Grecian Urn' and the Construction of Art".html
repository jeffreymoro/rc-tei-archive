            <li>Those of us who teach early nineteenth-century British literature 
              to undergraduates have much to ponder as we approach Keats's "Ode on 
              a Grecian Urn." How much should we emphasize close reading and usher 
              our students into the presence of the well-wrought urn, whether in a 
              consecrating or deconstructive spirit? How much should we take up a 
              variety of other contexts, such as the genres of the ode or the romantic 
              lyric, the reflection on romantic Hellenism, the place of Keats in a 
              museum-going public, the poet's reflections on the distinctiveness of 
              aesthetic value, or the place of the ode within his highly self-conscious 
              poetic career? Ideally, one should be able to invite students into the 
              poem as a carefully wrought artifact while also making it clear that 
              writing poetry that demands such close reading represents a literary 
              strategy of interest in its own right. To that end, in recent years 
              I have taught Keats in a course on the literature and culture of the 
              Regency period, alongside such authors as Byron, Austen, Scott, Hazlitt, 
              Cobbett, and Clare. By the time students read Keats, they are already 
              aware that the period sustained a wide array of literary practices, 
              each performing a specific strategy in relation to the performance of 
              social rank, the display of cultural capital, and the construction of 
              emergent reading audiences. Thus while students are drawn into Keats's 
              aesthetic, so congruent it seems with their own, they remain at least 
              dimly aware that it emanates from his specific social position as an 
              aspiring "cockney" poet.<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>To emphasize the cultural overtones of Keats's characteristic themes, 
              on a day preceding our discussion of the ode I assign a portion of Colin 
              Campbell's <i>The Romantic Ethic and the Spirit of Modern Consumerism</i>. 
              Campbell argues that modern consumerism creates a distinctive form of 
              desire: the day-dream, in which one imagines a plausible future pleasure 
              that would arise from purchasing or consuming a particular commodity. 
              Such a day-dream is not satisfied by the commodity itself, which can 
              never quite match the imagined pleasure it is meant to bring. The consumer 
              thus perpetually longs for something beyond the reach of any real satisfaction. 
              But Campbell goes on to argue that the result is not frustration, but 
              rather a pleasure one takes in day-dreaming itself; the deferral of 
              satisfaction makes possible a hedonistic delight one takes in a purely 
              imagined satisfaction. Furthermore, day-dreaming alters the status of 
              commodities; rather than fulfilling a prior longing, "many of the cultural 
              products offered for sale in modern societies are in fact consumed because 
              they serve as aids to the construction of day-dreams" (92). Such commodities 
              differ little from advertising images, films, novels, or other representations; 
              all encourage the consumer to construct and constantly revise an "'as-if' 
              world" to inhabit" (93).<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>Campbell's theory of consumerism provides a useful framework for our 
              discussion of the theme of dreaming in portions of <i>Endymion</i>, 
              the catalog of artifacts in "Sleep and Poetry," the central problems 
              of "The Eve of St. Agnes," the suburban setting for the odes, and Keats's 
              position more generally as a partially educated Londoner aspiring to 
              a position of literary prominence. The close match between Campbell's 
              argument and Keats's characteristic themes enables students to locate 
              Keats's poetry within a world of consumption and desire familiar to 
              them and to recognize the serious social concerns embedded in Keatsian 
              lyricism. This approach gains special force when we begin our discussion 
              of "The Eve of St. Agnes," whose themes take on a vivid new dimension 
              in light of Campbell's argument. Why do the couple never eat from the 
              table of dainties? Why should Madeline prefer her dream over consummation? 
              What exactly happens to the lovers in the key moment when Porphyro invades 
              her dream? Why does the poem represent its own ornate literariness in 
              the gorgeous aesthetic displays it describes, as if to suggest that 
              it resembles the ornate window before which Madeline prays? Is it to 
              be consumed as an object of pleasure, or simply viewed adoringly, in 
              its iconic splendor, transforming the reader into a ravished spectator? 
              What is poetry's status in a world shaped in part by the pleasure of 
              anticipation?<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>Such a discussion prepares students for the "Ode on a Grecian Urn," 
              where Keats takes up similar questions, apparently suggesting that unheard 
              music and unconsummated desire is preferable. Here he embraces what 
              Campbell calls day-dreaming, finding pleasure in the endless moment 
              of imagined satisfaction rather than in satisfaction itself. But in 
              that case, the urn becomes a magnificent provocation, an exemplary representation, 
              which takes us beyond any possible satisfaction into a virtual space 
              of erotic plenitude beyond the body, suspending its use value entirely 
              in favor of the viewer's construction of an imagined bliss.<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>But the opening stanza immediately complicates this reading. The poem 
              suspends knowledge as well: Who are these men and gods? Where are they? 
              What does their depicted activity signify? The questions never find 
              an answer; the problem of significance is suspended as ruthlessly as 
              the demand for erotic satisfaction. The poem thus introduces another 
              thematic, at once parallel to consumer desire and distinct from it: 
              the suspension of particular meaning, historical reference, or mythic 
              import. The urn can defer satisfaction precisely because it emerges 
              from an aesthetic domain without specific content. It solicits, but 
              does not answer, our inquiries; it excites us to knowledge, but withholds 
              what it promises. An exemplary teacher of Negative Capability (a concept 
              one can hardly resist teaching in conjunction with this poem), the urn 
              is also the incarnation of Art, of aesthetic value determined not by 
              its social location but by its power to dissolve all such determinations.<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>In the second and third stanzas, the poem draws attention to this 
              aspect of the urn by drawing attention to the frozen temporality of 
              its images. Here the structure of consumer desire is not only provoked 
              by the urn but also depicted in its own images of suspended animation: 
              the figures on its surface desire without consummation, much as one 
              listens to its soft pipes though one cannot hear them. This link between 
              erotic suspension and the plastic arts changes both. For one thing, 
              this parallel transforms the temporal stasis of the image into an allegory 
              of deferred satisfaction; the aesthetic category of the image begins 
              to represent not so much a specific aesthetic mode among others but 
              a form of desire that prefers anticipation to consummation. Here art 
              has become an allegory for daydreaming. Yet for this very reason, the 
              urn is not simply a commodity among others, for by waiving all answers 
              regarding its significance, it also waives its claim to satisfy our 
              desire. Rather than offering itself up for sale, only to be replaced 
              by another commodity, the urn interrupts the logic of economic exchange 
              and represents the structure of commodity desire itself, imaging Campbell's 
              argument, as it were, in the youth who forever draws near the goal. 
              It is as if the urn stands in for that absent object for which the consumer 
              ever seeks and which must remain absent for desire to renew itself, 
              and does so precisely because it empties itself out and, like the youth's 
              goal, remains forever out of reach. As a result, the urn pushes beyond 
              the logic of consumer desire: where the consumer can at least hope for 
              an imagined consummation from a given commodity, the urn makes that 
              satisfaction impossible and emphasizes the paradoxical bliss one takes 
              in an anticipation that is never fulfilled. The purest form of consumer 
              desire takes one beyond the commodity into the aesthetic artifact per 
              se, from exchange or consummation into Art.<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>But how does Art escape the logic of the commodity? Here it is useful 
              to tell students that Keats was probably inspired to write this poem 
              after visiting the British Museum and seeing Greek artifacts there. 
              While the urn is an object among others, an artifact with its own material 
              and cultural history, it does not address the viewer in the same way 
              as an object in a shop window. The context of the museum suspends it 
              from commodity exchange, just as the immense temporal distance between 
              it and the viewer takes it forever outside the context of everyday use. 
              The passage of time&#8212;not to mention the overvaluation of all things 
              Greek&#8212;has consecrated this object. It seems that the artifact, 
              simply by enduring so long, has managed to suspend its ordinary relation 
              to "slow time" and has gained the power to address us on behalf of eternity 
              itself; it has become a sublime object, that elusive thing desiring 
              subjects seek but necessarily fail to grasp. Thus the poem articulates 
              what one might call the ideology of the museum, seeing the latter not 
              as a specific cultural institution but as the repository of objects 
              of transcendental value. As an institution, the museum separates objects 
              we are to regard as culturally significant from the everyday objects 
              outside its walls; its task is to open up a space of permanent significance, 
              to cut objects off from their ordinary historical location and give 
              them a place within a story or schema of absolute value. The poem participates 
              in this task in its final two stanzas, where it first emphasizes the 
              urn's evacuation of a presumed historical community, depicted as an 
              abandoned village, and then places it in that zone of eternal significance, 
              causing it to address the community of all the mortal generations who 
              can receive its message.<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>The final stanza's reference to the wasting of generations brings 
              us back to the problem of embodiment, previously broached in the lines 
              on erotic consummation. The urn can embody suspended satisfaction precisely 
              because, as an artifact, it can endure much longer than human bodies 
              can. Its privilege derives from its power to suspend desire more radically 
              than any desiring subject can ever do. It is radically other to any 
              human being, any generation, any historical moment, and, as the first 
              stanza suggests, to any particular knowledge. Thus the notorious final 
              lines tell us that truth is found in whatever suspends knowledge: the 
              urn's message is its power to tease us out of thought. These final lines 
              constitute a critique and manifesto in the same gesture, showing that 
              the urn has no wisdom to offer and yet celebrating its austere sublimity. 
              The urn survives through time to tell us nothing at all, yet the absence 
              of any message is more enduring than any historically located insight. 
              The urn speaks not for a lived eternity, for a subject who has entered 
              into bliss, but rather for a technique of suspending temporal succession; 
              the eternity we find there is only one we attribute to it, one we posit 
              in order to countenance our own place in a sequence of dying generations. 
              If the urn is thus the product of an aesthetic sleight of hand, it does 
              not promise refuge from time except in our own power to project eternity 
              onto it and then hear its message reflected back into our own historical 
              present. In that way, Art makes eternity available to the dying generations 
              through their power to take pleasure in a longing whose fulfillment 
              is itself.<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>In the remaining days of our discussion of Keats, as we take up the 
              later odes, <i>Lamia</i>, <i>The Fall of Hyperion</i>, and "To Autumn," 
              the students and I have many opportunities to complicate this reading 
              of the poem. I have found that even when I try to push beyond the above 
              reading, students remember mostly what I have outlined above, and thus 
              that it is better to complicate the poem retrospectively, when they 
              can see Keats apparently reconsidering the stance he takes there. In 
              recent years, students have been especially interested in rethinking 
              the ode once they encounter the ravaged face of Moneta or read of the 
              speaker's horror at having to endure the temporal stasis of the fallen 
              Saturn. By finding new levels to this poem in retrospect, primarily 
              by seeing in it anticipations of Keats's later and apparently more de-idealizing 
              insights, students see the ode less as a finished text than one in a 
              series of complex statements that approach certain themes in differing 
              ways. When they see how often Keats inverts the poem, opens it back 
              up, or plunders it, they begin to grasp it as part of the difficult 
              process of cultural reading that we share with him. Rather than a well-wrought 
              urn or an equally well-wrought deconstruction of any such figure, the 
              poem thus becomes an open-ended text, at once subverting and reinforcing 
              its hypercanonic status through the mobility of its claims. </li>
