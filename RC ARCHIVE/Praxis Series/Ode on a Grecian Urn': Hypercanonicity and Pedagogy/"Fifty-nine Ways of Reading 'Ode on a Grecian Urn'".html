            <li><p>Even without seeing a list of contributors to this collection of essays 
              I think I can safely claim to have been acquainted with &quot;Ode on 
              a Grecian Urn&quot; longer than any of the others. I first read the 
              poem in high school in the 1940s just after World War II. I reread it 
              many more times between 1949 and 1958 in surveys, period courses, and 
              seminars as an English major at the University of Texas, an M.A. student 
              at Northwestern, and a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard. Then I taught it 
              at least once every semester&#151;except when I was away on sabbatical 
              leave&#151;for the next four and a half decades at the University of 
              Illinois, most recently in a large undergraduate survey of British literature 
              since the 1780s and a graduate seminar on the topic &quot;The New Romanticism&quot; 
              (the &quot;old&quot; being constituted by Keats and the five other currently 
              canonical male poets of the period, the &quot;new&quot; consisting of 
              those six plus a like number of more recently canonized women poets). 
              I can report from this, first, that in all those years I have never 
              seen students not get interested in Keats and his most famous ode&#151;they 
              walk and drive around listening to rock music or talking on cell phones 
              and then, in class, become very serious about the difference between 
              heard and unheard melodies, about the condition of eternal spring, and 
              about the lovers never being able to kiss&#151;and, second, that I myself 
              have never tired of the experiences of reading and teaching the poem. 
              On the contrary, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; continues to be rich 
              and moving every time I read it&#151;which ought to be remarkable, considering 
              that I have known the 50-line text (really, the several different 50-line 
              texts that are recoverable) word by word, mark by mark, for so many 
              decades.</p></li>
            <li><p>Teachers of my generation (and of the preceding and immediately following 
              generations) were taught to read poetry according to the principles 
              of the New Criticism, the powerful movement initiated in the 1920s by 
              I. A. Richards and practiced influentially in the 1930s and 1940s by 
              William Empson and F. R. Leavis among others in Britain and by Cleanth 
              Brooks, John Crowe Ransom, and Alan Tate among others in the U.S. The 
              New Critics were combating both the long established &quot;biographical&quot; 
              method of criticism, which involved investigating and relating the facts 
              of authors' lives while paying hardly any attention to the works the 
              authors wrote, and a mindless kind of &quot;appreciation&quot; where 
              works were admired, in general terms, for their wisdom, brilliance, 
              emotional power (<em>King Lear</em> was &quot;very moving&quot;!) but 
              were not actually read for either their content or the artistic strategies 
              by which that content was conveyed or, as was frequently the case, subverted. 
              The New Critics advocated a process of &quot;close reading&quot; (sometimes 
              called &quot;slow reading&quot;), examining a text one line, one phrase, 
              even one word at a time. They were interested not in authors' &quot;messages&quot; 
              but in the representation of dramatic (fictionalized) speakers in particular 
              circumstances, and above all in structures of irony, paradox, ambiguity, 
              and contradiction. (If some of this sounds like the approach of the 
              more recent Deconstruction, that is simply because Deconstructionists, 
              too, learned their tactics from the New Critics.) Keats especially, 
              because of the prevalence of paradox and contradiction in his texts, 
              was a frequent subject of New Critical analysis. &quot;Ode on a Grecian 
              Urn&quot; is an exemplary text in Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren's 
              extremely influential textbook, <em>Understanding Poetry</em> (1938), 
              where it is presented with a dozen questions beginning &quot;In what 
              sense is the urn a 'sylvan historian' (line 3)?&quot; and concluding 
              &quot;Are the last two lines a teasing utterance or not? What is their 
              truth? Do the preceding 48 lines serve to define it?&quot; (474-76). 
              As the subject of a famous essay, &quot;Keats's Sylvan Historian: History 
              without Footnotes,&quot; in Brooks's<em> The Well Wrought Urn</em> a 
              decade later, it has a central place among case studies assembled to 
              demonstrate that &quot;the language of poetry is the language of paradox&quot; 
              (3).</p></li>
            <li><p>We taught, in the good old days of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s&#151;in 
              courses like my department's English 101, &quot;Introduction to Poetry&quot; 
              (required of all English majors)&#151;by posing Brooks-and-Warren-like 
              questions about specific details in the texts. My routine study questions 
              for Keats's odes, which still strike me as fundamentally sound, were 
              a simple triad of (1) What does the speaker want? (what is the speaker's 
              problem?); (2) What contrasts, tensions, ironies, etc. oppose the speaker's 
              desire? (a question about the poem's structure); and (3) Is the opposition 
              resolved? (a question about closure). For class discussion of &quot;Ode 
              on a Grecian Urn,&quot; I devised numerous specific questions, such 
              as Who is speaking? Who or what is being addressed? What is odd about 
              an &quot;unravish'd bride&quot;? What do &quot;unravish'd bride&quot; 
              and &quot;foster-child&quot; have in common? In what sense can &quot;quietness&quot; 
              be a husband, or &quot;silence and slow time&quot; foster parents? Beginning 
              in line 5 the poem's syntax itself poses Brooks-and-Warren-like questions 
              that can stimulate class discussion&#151;&quot;What leaf-fring'd legend 
              . . . ?&quot;&#151;and six or seven more questions are asked before 
              the end of the first stanza. The complications multiply with the introduction 
              of several impossible situations in the images of stanzas 2 and 3. In 
              stanza 4 the speaker adds still further questions (&quot;Who are these 
              coming to the sacrifice? . . . What little town . . . ?&quot;). And 
              the poem concludes with the urn's (or someone's) totally incomprehensible 
              &quot;message&quot; of the last two lines, &quot;Beauty is truth&quot; 
              and so on.</p></li>
            <li><p>The poem thus provides very rich materials for class discussion&#151;I 
              could on any occasion easily devise fifty or a hundred questions based 
              on details of the 50-line text&#151;and for several decades my (and 
              I assume many other teachers') standard procedure was to introduce a 
              selection of such questions, get various frequently bright answers from 
              the students, and consider the merits of the answers and their tendencies 
              to nudge toward larger generalizations concerning tone, attitude, thematic 
              meaning, and so on. But I'm sorry to have to report that we operated 
              in a scheme where there were right and wrong answers to the questions. 
              The commonest activity of class discussion in those days was a sequence 
              of wrong answers 1, 2, and 3 (volunteered by three well-meaning students) 
              corrected by right answer 4 (delivered by the teacher). Granted that 
              New Criticism was a matter of an individual reader huddling together 
              with an individual text, doing the line-by-line, word-at-a-time slow 
              reading, when it came to class discussion&#151;Ph.D. professor in the 
              front of the room, face to face with freshman and sophomores who had 
              hardly any experience of life or literature or even much knowledge of 
              the English language&#151;some individual readers were thought to be 
              superior to some others.</p></li>
            <li><p>Confident that I was perfectly justified in correcting students' wrong 
              responses, for several decades I cheerfully carried on the inculcation 
              of an interpretation of Keats's major poems, &quot;Grecian Urn&quot; 
              among them, in which, to put it in the barest possible terms, the theme 
              was skepticism concerning visionary imagination, the various characters 
              (Madeline in &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes,&quot; Lycius in &quot;Lamia,&quot; 
              the knight in &quot;La Belle Dame,&quot; the speakers in the odes) were 
              hoodwinked dreamers, and the basic idea was that, as it is stated in 
              the final stanza of &quot;Ode to a Nightingale,&quot; the imagination 
              &quot;cannot cheat so well / As she is fam'd to do.&quot; I regularly 
              drew a &quot;Keats Map&quot; on the board in my classes, consisting 
              of a horizontal line dividing an ideal world above the line (heaven, 
              immortality, the supernatural, timelessness, etc.) from an actual world 
              below (earth, mortality, the natural, time, etc.), and had the students 
              position various elements of the poems above and below the line&#151;Madeline's 
              dream in her bedroom above the line, for example, Porphyro, physical 
              love, the rest of the castle, and the storm outside below the line; 
              La Belle Dame's magical grot above the line, the knight's cold hillside 
              of reality below; the Nightingale's forest above, and &quot;here,&quot; 
              the world of &quot;hungry generations,&quot; below; and so on (for elaboration, 
              see Stillinger, <em>John Keats: Complete Poems</em> xvi-xxii and <em>Reading</em> 
              107-13). </p></li>
            <li><p>&quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; fit the scheme perfectly, with the 
              initial perfection of the permanence depicted in the world of Tempe 
              or the dales of Arcady above the line and the speaker's real world of 
              process, change, passion, and death below (complicated, as the poem 
              develops, by the speaker's gradual realization, especially evident in 
              the negatives at the end of stanza 4, that the ideal permanence is itself 
              a kind of death, in sharp contrast to the life of &quot;breathing human 
              passion&quot; in the actual world that the speaker earlier wished to 
              escape). In this way my class &quot;discussion&quot; inevitably turned 
              into lecture. I had the truth about Keats's poems, and the students 
              didn't seem to mind taking it in. Accepting my reading was much easier 
              than doing their own interpreting; it saved time and effort in the long 
              run, and the students too believed that the professor's reading was 
              likely to be the correct one.</p></li>
            <li><p>These were, as I said, the good old days, now superseded by much improved 
              ways of understanding poetry. For one thing, the New Critical &quot;slow 
              reading,&quot; once so radical in its approach (because, in focusing 
              on &quot;the text itself,&quot; it barred from consideration not only 
              history and biography but every other extrinsic source including the 
              dictionary meanings of words in the text), became everybody's ordinary 
              way of approaching a text. For another, the coming-of-age of Literary 
              Theory (here capitalized to give it thematic status like a float in 
              a Fourth of July parade) in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s opened up many 
              more possibilities than had hitherto been thought of for the kinds of 
              meaning that a reader could be aware of in a literary text. Of the twenty 
              or so serious theories that attracted interest (and enthusiastic adherents) 
              in those decades, I'll single out four that I think have had the most 
              influence on our reading of &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;: <br>
              <br>
              (1) <em>Deconstruction</em>&#151;taking a view that literary works are 
              disorganized, illogical, incoherent, essentially indeterminate, and 
              employing a methodology of analyzing works to find mistakes, inconsistencies, 
              gaps, and contradictions&#151;could, as a theory, have been based solely 
              on &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn,&quot; because Keats himself had already 
              written into his text those very incongruities and discordances that 
              Deconstruction was established to expose. The poem has in fact been 
              deconstructing itself for more than 180 years, but for many readers 
              it took 1970s theorizing to make it permissible to say so in class. 
              We now understand, even with the most admired poems, that some conflicts 
              are <em>not</em> resolved into agreement, that some closures are not 
              really achieved, and that readers who demand agreement and closure must 
              supply them interpretively, compensating for lacks in the actual texts 
              themselves.<br>
              <br>
              (2) <em>New Historicism</em> is an approach based on the idea of literature 
              as a social activity involving not only authors but publishers, editors, 
              printers, booksellers, purchasers, readers, reviewers, critics, teachers, 
              students, and a great deal of nonliterary historical context, including 
              the political and social ideas of everybody involved, local and national 
              and international events, and so on and on. In its political emphasis, 
              New Historicism began as a delicate outgrowth of the Marxist criticism 
              that had some influence in the 1920s and 1930s and then was revived 
              in the 1960s. Politics have always been central in the writings of Blake, 
              Byron, and Percy Shelley among the Romantics and, in a different way 
              (because of their progress from youthful radicalism to middle-aged conservatism), 
              in the writings of Wordsworth and Coleridge. But what, we used to ask, 
              can there possibly be of political interest in &quot;Ode on a Grecian 
              Urn,&quot; where a speaker is confronting an old Greek vase with pictures 
              depicting lovers, piper, trees, a sacrificial procession, and musing 
              on vague abstractions about Beauty and Truth? As it turns out, critics 
              beginning in the 1980s have discovered plenty of political concerns 
              in the poem. Keats's centering the poem in Greek life and culture made 
              a point about the ancient origins of the modern revolutionary spirit, 
              for example, and publishing it in <em>Annals of the Fine Arts</em> constituted 
              an attack on the art establishment of the time (see, among others, Kelley 
              221-32; Roe, <em>John Keats</em> 85-87; Magnuson 167-210; Cox 165, 185-86; 
              and O'Rourke 75-77).<br>
              <br>
              (3) <em>Feminism</em>, which has been enabling readers to see so many 
              imbalances that formerly were invisible, allows one not only to ponder 
              the sexual politics of &quot;unravish'd bride&quot; and the &quot;maidens 
              loth&quot; struggling to escape in stanza 1, as well as the gender of 
              the sacrificial animal in stanza 4, but also to consider more clearly 
              the critical suggestion that Keats chose to write about an urn because 
              its curved shape resembled that of a woman (Patterson 211-12, 218). 
              Margaret Homans, to mention one of the most helpful critics in this 
              context, does not cite the ode but provides excellent background commentary 
              in her comprehensive account of Keats's relationships with women (both 
              those he knew and those he imagined as readers). Daniel Watkins gives 
              an extended analysis of patriarchal morality in the poem (104-20, 206-11).<br>
              <br>
              (4) <em>Reader-Response Criticism</em> (sometimes called Reception Theory) 
              has been making it increasingly reasonable&#151;in books and articles, 
              in the classroom, and in social activity more generally&#151;to accept 
              the diversity of individual responses to complex poetic texts. The title 
              of the present essay, which for the occasion could more accurately have 
              been phrased &quot;<em>Teaching</em> Fifty-nine Ways of Reading 'Ode 
              on a Grecian Urn,'&quot; takes off from my 1999 book on multiple ways 
              of interpreting &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes,&quot; which in a central 
              chapter (accompanied by a list in an appendix) presents fifty-nine different 
              interpretations of Keats's narrative, some of them in direct conflict 
              with some of the others, and maintains that all fifty-nine are legitimate 
              readings and none of them is &quot;wrong&quot; (<em>Reading</em> 35-77, 
              147-49). In my preface I announce an ideal of &quot;interpretive democracy,&quot; 
              and in a chapter on how we individually process the profusion of stimuli 
              received from Keats's lines I advocate a practice of &quot;no-fault 
              reading&quot; whereby, again, responses cannot be right or wrong, merely 
              more or less interesting (ix, 89-96).</p></li>
            <li><p>I have been teaching undergraduates on these principles for a dozen 
              or more years, ever since I became interested in the idea of &quot;multiples&quot; 
              in the basic components of a literary transaction&#151;multiple authorship 
              of works that we usually assume to have been written by a solitary genius; 
              multiple textual versions of famous works in the canon; and, what is 
              most relevant to the present occasion, multiple interpretations of those 
              works everywhere one turns in the critical literature (by the most sophisticated 
              of readers) and the classroom (by some of the most na&iuml;ve). In general 
              students have responded favorably to my approach, several over the years 
              even remarking&#151;after the exams were finished and the grades turned 
              in&#151;that the idea of no-fault reading had changed their lives! Friends, 
              colleagues, and reviewers have been similarly approving, though not 
              exactly in the same extravagant language.</p></li>
            <li><p>The chief question that arises (from colleagues and reviewers, if 
              not from students) is how one teaches a complex poem in a scheme where 
              there are no wrong answers concerning the points being raised. In <em>Reading 
              &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot;</em> I quote Alvin Kernan's contemptuous 
              depiction of no-fault readers as a group of savages &quot;who have a 
              great deal of difficulty piecing out the broken signs on the printed 
              page&quot; (<em>Reading</em> 91; Kernan 144). I counter this with numerous 
              situations where multiple responses&#151;contradictory and even &quot;wrong&quot; 
              assertions among them&#151;enhance the richness and complexity of the 
              reading experience (<em>Reading</em> 89-96). The text of &quot;Ode on 
              a Grecian Urn&quot; provides conflicting stimuli in practically every 
              line&#151;&quot;Fair youth . . . thou canst not leave / Thy song . . 
              . Bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss . . . She cannot fade . . 
              . thou hast not thy bliss . . . And, little town, thy streets for evermore 
              / Will silent be&quot; and so on. With lines like these, the responses 
              <em>have</em> to be multiple and contradictory.</p></li>
            <li><p>Keats's well-known ideal of poetic disinterestedness&#151;&quot;Negative 
              Capability,&quot; he called it, &quot;when man is capable of being in 
              uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after 
              fact &amp; reason&quot; (Keats's <em>Letters</em> 1:193)&#151;can be 
              usefully applied to the author-text-reader transaction in &quot;Ode 
              on a Grecian Urn.&quot; We have in the first place a negatively capable 
              author/speaker who asks a great many questions about activities depicted 
              on the urn, gets no answers to his questions (unless &quot;Beauty is 
              truth&quot; is supposed to be one), but remains content in his situation 
              of uncertainties, mysteries, doubts. We know he is content simply because 
              the final lines, while lacking the logic that would enable clear paraphrase, 
              have an unmistakable <em>air</em> of resolution about them&#151;the 
              message is from &quot;a friend to man&quot; and its wisdom is &quot;all 
              ye need to know.&quot; We have in the second place a negatively capable 
              text, in the sense that it is an epitomizing texture of uncertainties, 
              mysteries, doubts&#151;possibly the best example of comparable length 
              in all of English poetry. And in the third place, with the help of reader-response 
              thinking we can say that we have negatively capable readers as well, 
              who, like the author/speaker, similarly don't know the answers to the 
              questions but are satisfied without knowing, accepting at the end a 
              kind of contented irresolution. In recent years, in trying to position 
              the poet himself on the Keats Map, I have imagined Keats standing outside 
              &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; looking on with his readers and wondering, 
              with each successive reading, how the various conflicts will get resolved, 
              with the possibility (for Keats and the readers alike) that they will 
              be resolved a different way each time. This is not a bad premise on 
              which to conduct class discussion of the poem. It certainly beats fifty 
              minutes of interpretive dicta from the front of the class.</p></li>
