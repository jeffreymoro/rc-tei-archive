    <h3><a name="hypertext"> </a>About this Volume</h3>
    <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; margin-right: 5px">This volume of <i>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</i> includes an editor's introduction by <a href="#steinman">Lisa M. Steinman</a>, essays by <a href="#altieri">Charles Altieri</a>, <a href="#kaufman">Robert Kaufman</a>, and <a href="#stauder">Ellen Keck Stauder</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">In this volume, three divergent critics&#8212;representing Romanticism, contemporary poetry, and more formal concerns, such as prosody and rhythm&#8212;present analyses of five contemporary poets viewed in relationship to several different strains of Romantic practice or theory.</p>
    <p align="left">Charles Altieri reflects on Wordsworth, Arnold, Williams and the contemporary poetry of Lyn Hejinian and Leslie Scalapino. Robert Kaufman discusses the problematics and uses of Romantic difficulty from Kant through Benjamin, Adorno and the Frankfurt School, to the work of Barbara Guest and Michael Palmer. Finally, Ellen Stauder explores how Mark Doty, through his use of description and affect, construes and reconstructs the poetry of Keats. All three essays make creative conjectures as to what Romanticism looks like to actively producing poets right now, as well as what constitutes the most compelling contemporary poetic practices.</p>
    <p align="left">Romantic poetry, these essays show, has in one way or another set the agenda for contemporary poetics, bequeathing multiple, and somewhat conflicting, legacies to twentieth-(and twenty-first-)century poetry. These essays show that the often disharmonious conversation in which they are engaged is Romanticism&#8217;s chief legacy to contemporary poetics.</p>

    <h3><a name="series"> </a>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</h3>
    <p align="left">The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship. The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> was formerly known as <b>Romantic Praxis: Theory and Criticism</b>. The name was changed in November 1999.</p>
