                  Whilst he was at Paris, Bolivar's favourite and
                  principal occupation was the study of those branches
                  of science which belong to the formation of the
                  warrior and the statesman . . . Humboldt and Bompland
                  were his intimate friends, and accompanied him in his
                  travels in France: nor did he think he had learned
                  enough until he had traversed England, Italy, and a
                  part of Germany . . . He went back to America, where
                  he arrived at the very moment when his
                  fellow-countrymen, who were wearied with the
                  oppression of the Spanish government, had determined
                  to unfurl the standard of independence . . . but he
                  disapproved of the system adopted by the Congress of
                  Venezuela, and refused to join Don Lopez Mendez in
                  his mission to England, which was connected with the
                  interests of the new government. Bol&iacute;var even
                  declined any connexion with it, though he continued a
                  staunch friend of his country's liberties. ("Sketch"

                <p>"Sketch of the Political Career of Sim&oacute;n
                Bol&iacute;var" is among the opening pieces of the
                January 1823 issue of the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>,
                which, as Nanora Sweet has argued, served to foster
                Anglo-Hispanic ties (Sweet 143). Within the first
                paragraphs, the anonymous author endeavors to establish
                the image of Bol&iacute;var as a cosmopolitan gentleman
                who had completed his education with the European grand
                tour. The assertions that follow this initial
                description, however, are puzzling to anyone familiar
                with Bol&iacute;var's life. He in fact was with
                L&oacute;pez M&eacute;ndez "in his mission to England";
                Jos&eacute; Blanco White, who corrected the proofs for
                the <i>New Monthly</i> article, knew this not only
                because of his friendship with Andr&eacute;s Bello, who
                had accompanied <i>el general</i> to London, but also
                because he met Bol&iacute;var there. Andr&eacute; Pons
                notes that "Blanco White personally met Bol&iacute;var
                in the summer of 1810 when Bol&iacute;var was appointed
                by the Junta in Caracas to a diplomatic mission with
                Andr&eacute;s Bello and L&oacute;pez M&eacute;ndez"
                (Pons 508).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Why did Blanco White not correct this historical
                error in the "Sketch"? If it was an oversight, he
                caught it in "Noticia biogr&aacute;fica de D&oacute;n
                Sim&oacute;n de Bol&iacute;var," his version of the
                <i>New Monthly</i> piece that opened the first issue of
                <i>Variedades</i>, and which was published in January
                1823 as well. Blanco suppressed the erroneous passage
                for his Latin American readers, to whom
                Bol&iacute;var's London visit would have been familiar.
                That the author of the <i>Monthly</i> article would
                want to make British readers think that Bol&iacute;var
                had not accompanied L&oacute;pez M&eacute;ndez and that
                Blanco would go along with this impression point to the
                careful manipulation of Bol&iacute;var's image in the
                early 1820s: a victorious general and statesman who had
                liberated a continent from "the oppression of the
                Spanish government" through his own efforts. A public
                acknowledgement of how much British assistance he
                received would have been, as Blanco astutely added in
                the conclusion of the "Noticia biogr&aacute;fica,"
                contrary to Britain's political interests. "Aunque los
                enlaces pol&iacute;ticos de la Gran Breta&ntilde;a . .
                . requer&iacute;an la neutralidad que su gobierno ha
                guardado, los Republicanos de la Am&eacute;rica
                Espa&ntilde;ola no cumplir&iacute;an con los deberes de
                la gratitud si no mirasen a la Inglaterra como origen,
                en parte, de la libertad que empiezan a gozar" ["Though
                the political ties of Great Britain . . . required it
                to be neutral, the Republicans of Spanish America would
                not fulfill their debt of gratitude if they did not
                regard England as an origin, in part, of the liberty
                they begin to enjoy" ] (Blanco 12).<a href=
                "#1">[1]</a>
                Blanco also intuits that the idea that Sim&oacute;n
                Bol&iacute;var, who embodied the gestas of independence
                and the liberation of South America, was ever in the
                position of a supplicant to a European power like
                Britain, would have been repellent to the new
                republics.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Notwithstanding Blanco's dexterous editorial
                diplomacy, his remarkable statement&mdash;that England
                be considered an origin of Latin American
                independence&mdash;posits a challenge to scholars
                interested in transatlantic Romanticism.<a href=
                "#2">[2]</a>
                William Keach's "thinking transatlantically about
                romanticism" (33), which pervades current critical
                discourse, is caught in an impasse: the transatlantic
                journeys are assumed to be between Britain and its
                English speaking contacts in the American hemisphere.
                This monolingual notion of the transatlantic cannot
                explain Blanco White's assertion. Nor, in fact, do
                other models of British Atlantic culture that include
                the Caribbean in their formulations.<a href=
                "#3">[3]</a>
                With the exception of Mary Louise Pratt and Eugenia
                Rold&aacute;n Vera, the Spanish American nexus that
                connected London, Kingston, and even Dublin with Spain,
                the Caribbean, South America, and Africa has been
                largely overlooked. Pratt, whose work on Humboldt has
                reintroduced Latin America as a locus for Romanticism,
                devotes a chapter to Andr&eacute;s Bello and Domingo
                Faustino Sarmiento, two major nineteenth century
                writers in Latin America, but it has not had the same
                critical impact as her work on Humboldt.<a href=
                "#4">[4]</a>
                Eugenia Rold&aacute;n Vera's work has shown the
                intricate connections between Rudolph Ackermann's
                bilingual press and the newly formed republics in the
                Americas; he published Blanco White's
                <em>Variedades</em> as well as 100 titles, including a
                translation of Scott's <i>Ivanhoe</i> and Jos&eacute;
                Joaqu&iacute;n de Mora's <i>Meditaciones
                Po&eacute;ticas</i>, a series of poems to accompany
                William Blake's engravings to Blair's <i>The
                Grave</i>.<a href=
                "#5">[5]</a>
                This body of work, however, has not received the
                attention that it merits from transatlantic
                scholars.</p>

                <p>To invoke the Americas, the Caribbean, and the
                Atlantic, and ignore the crucial presence of
                Hispano-Americans, whom Romantic authors themselves
                acknowledged, is an act of critical oversight that
                becomes less and less viable. Implicitly, this
                oversight condones what Kirsten Silva Gruesz calls the
                "imperial conflation of America with the United States
                . . . America [is] a name which [the U.S] has
                appropriated synechdocically unto itself" (10).
                However, the cultural history Gruesz maps for the
                United States, one in which intercultural exchanges
                cross linguistic borders, has earlier origins than
                those she claims for Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Heredia's
                "Ni&aacute;gara" (1824) and William Cullen Bryant's
                translation of Heredia in 1827. As Nigel Leask and more
                recently Robert Aguirre have shown, Humboldt's
                incursion into the Americas generated an avid interest
                in Mexican and Peruvian artifacts. Aguirre writes that
                "in the wake of Alexander von Humboldt's journeys,
                which made Latin America an object of intense scrutiny
                after 300 years of Spanish domination, the British
                quest for and representation of pre-Columbian antiquity
                became a crucial cultural arm of the larger political
                strategy historians call 'informal imperialism'" (xv).
                He focuses on William Bullock's <i>Residence and
                Travels in Mexico</i> (1824) and his collecting, which
                forms the basis of the British Museum's permanent
                collection of Mexican art (Aguirre 26-33).</p>

                <p>As central as Humboldt's travels are when thinking
                about the European construction of Latin America, it
                must be remembered that two other pressing concerns
                made the Americas extremely real to the British public
                during the Romantic period&mdash;Napoleon and the slave
                trade. James Mill argued in "Emancipation of Spanish
                America" (1809) that South America was a "barrier . . .
                to resist the torrent whose pressure we must continue
                to dread" (230), a sentiment later echoed in other
                journals. "The Continent of America alone can save us
                from the gigantic power of Bonaparte" declares the
                November issue of <i>The Statesman</i> (Miranda
                23:103).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Debbie Lee has most recently elaborated the
                connection between Britain and the slave trade, one
                that through commodities, maps, images, literature,
                discourse, and disease made itself felt in the
                metropolis and "shaped the Romantic imagination" (6).
                What has not been considered is how British discourse
                about the slave trade was linked in the British
                imagination with the independence of Latin America. A
                transatlantic reading of Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var's
                "Carta de Jamaica" ("Jamaica Letter"), written during
                his exile&nbsp; in Kingston in 1815, shows that he
                draws on the discursive connection between abolition
                and independence that Mill and others had made familiar
                to the British public in order to make his case for
                continued British support of the Latin American
                enterprise.<a href=
                "#6">[6]</a>&nbsp;
                Like <em>El Espa&ntilde;ol</em>, the <i>New Monthly
                Magazine</i>, and <i>Variedades</i>, the "Jamaica
                Letter" aims to create a textual alliance between
                Britain and Latin America. Though it has long been
                considered a foundational document of Latin American
                thought, the letter's intended audience is clearly the
                British public, metonymically represented by its
                addressee, Henry Cullen. Bol&iacute;var's language
                expresses anxiety about slave uprisings even as it uses
                the language of abolition as a critique of empire to
                gain sympathy for the Latin American cause, an anxiety
                with which British audiences, and especially British
                Creoles in Kingston, could clearly identify. This
                reading also reasserts the importance of Kingston as a
                locale that connects the Anglophone and Hispanophone
                transatlantic.<a href=
                "#7">[7]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The letter's publication history also supports the
                need to reconsider it within a transatlantic context,
                rather than the more nationalistic readings that it has
                hitherto received. As Pedro Grases, a renowned
                Bol&iacute;var scholar, has shown, the first known
                manuscript of the letter is in English. It was
                published in <i>The Jamaica Quarterly and Literary
                Gazette</i> in 1818 and again in 1825 under the title
                "General Bolivar's Letter to a Friend, on the Subject
                of South American Independence. (Translated from the
                Spanish.)" (706). The manuscript in Spanish was not
                published until 1833, after Bol&iacute;var's death in
                1830. Like the "Sketch" in the <i>New Monthly</i> and
                the "Noticia Biogr&aacute;fica," the "Carta de Jamaica"
                has a double life. This article will briefly address
                the ways in which Bol&iacute;var's self-fashioning in
                the "Jamaica Letter" and other writings during his
                exile in Kingston in 1815 shapes the image of
                Bol&iacute;var for the British public. My reading
                suggests that Romanticism in the Caribbean and the
                Americas has a multilingual dimension, and invites
                readers to rethink the "movements of time, plot, and
                history" (Bakhtin 84) in the transatlantic that more
                traditional readings exclude.</p>
    
                <p><b>II. Kingston Circa 1815</b></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>For British sailors, travelers, and planters like
                Olaudah Equiano, Lady Maria Nugent, and Monk Lewis
                experiencing the city of Kingston became <i>de
                rigeur</i> when in Jamaica. Lewis, who arrived during
                the John-Canoe celebrations at Christmas in 1816, gives
                a lively account of the city, declaring that he "never
                saw so many people [both black and white] who appeared
                to be so unaffectedly happy" (40). Equiano's
                experience, on the other hand, points to Kingston's
                role as a major slave-trading port. Having been denied
                his wages by a captain Baker, he goes from magistrate
                to magistrate seeking redress, "and there were nine,
                but they refused to do anything for me, and said my
                oath could not be admitted against a white man . . .
                Such oppressions as these made me seek for a vessel to
                get out of the island as fast as I could" (218).
                Trevord Burnard notes that during the eighteenth and
                early nineteenth centuries, Kingston "remained the
                principal port of entry of slaves until the abolition
                of the trade in 1808 . . . [from 1700] to 1808, 830,000
                slaves were imported into Jamaica" (234). Merchants
                also supplied slaves to the Spanish American
                colonies&mdash;the illicit trade in goods and slaves
                provided needed bullion for traders, who in turn used
                it for loans to sugar planters (Burnard 237). Burnard
                continues "Having gone to the Caribbean to make their
                fortunes, some wealthy West Indians returned to Britain
                and made new careers as London merchants, continuing to
                deal with their brethren back in the tropics"
                (232)&mdash; dealings that Jane Austen dramatized in
                <i>Mansfield Park</i> through the figure of Sir Thomas
                Bertram. Kingston, as a city of empire, seemed distant
                and marginal, but as Edward Said has pointed out,"Far
                from being nothing much 'out there,' British colonial
                possessions in the Antilles [West Indies] and
                Leeward&nbsp; islands were during Jane Austen's time a
                crucial setting for Anglo-French colonial competition"
                (90).</p>

              <li>
                <p>Said, however, does not mention that Spain also was
                part of this contest and does not posit Kingston as a
                site of resistance. The Ashanti Queen Nanny, who
                defeated the British in the Jamaican Maroon Wars during
                the 1720s and 1730s, played on the imperial rivalry
                between Spain and Britain. The British feared a plan by
                slaves to "hand over the island [of Jamaica] to Spain
                when they had taken it over, on the condition that the
                Spanish guarantee their freedom" (qtd. in Linebaugh and
                Rediker 195). Resistance was also expressed in the
                domestic sphere: Toussaint L'Ouverture's revolution
                encouraged enslaved Afro-Caribbeans in Kingston to "not
                do anything but listen" to the tabletalk of whites.
                Lady Nugent records in her journal: "The splendour of
                the black chiefs of St. Domingo, their superior
                strength, their firmness of character [. . .] are the
                common topics at dinner; and the blackies [sic] in
                attendance seem so much interested, that they hardly
                change a plate, or do anything but listen. How very
                imprudent, and what must it all lead to!" (198). The
                latent implications of a revolution in
                Jamaica&mdash;one that domestics could conceive around
                her own dinner table as they ignored the dishes that
                needed to be retrieved&mdash;do not escape Lady Nugent.
                As Lucille Mathurin Mair notes, "Domestic slaves in
                particular, many of whom were women. . . listened
                carefully to the discussions of their masters and
                mistresses: planters spoke quite frequently about
                slavery in their homes, at the dinner tables . . .
                confident that blacks were too unintelligent to
                understand the conversation of whites" (991).</p>

                <p>If the slave trade connected the Anglo-Hispanic
                world in Kingston, the city also served as a strategic
                location for the wars of Spanish American Independence
                because of its geographical proximity to Venezuela, and
                its financial, political, and military connections to
                London. In 1806, when Francisco de Miranda had tried to
                invade Venezuela while the British attempted to take
                Buenos Aires, Kingston was a purveyor of supplies, and
                perhaps more importantly, the communications hub for
                news about Miranda's operations. London papers relied
                on their Kingston counterparts to report what was
                happening in South America and the Caribbean. A report
                from <em>The Times</em> is typical: "The Jamaican
                papers state, that Miranda's squadron touched at Jacmel
                of the 10th of April and sailed again on the 6th for
                Caraccas, joined by the Echo Schooner at Jamaica. The
                avowed object of the expedition (says the royal Gazett)
                is to revolutionize the south american Colonyes [sic]"
                (Miranda 23: 157).<a href=

                When Bol&iacute;var arrived in Kingston after the
                disastrous loss of Cartagena to the Spanish at the end
                of 1814, the Latin America-Kingston-London news circuit
                was thus well established.</p>

              <li>
                <p>From Kingston Bol&iacute;var launched a public
                relations campaign to raise British support for more
                money and troops, directing his efforts towards
                individuals and the press. On May 1815, Bol&iacute;var
                wrote to Sir Richard Wellesley, who had been an
                Ambassador to the Central Junta in Spain in 1809 and
                Secretary of Foreign Affairs until 1812: "Me he salido
                a dar la alarma al mundo, a implorar auxilios, a
                anunciar a la Gran Breta&ntilde;a y a la humanidad
                toda, que una parte de su especie va a fenecer, y que
                la m&aacute;s bella mitad de la tierra ser&aacute;
                desolada" [ "I have come to sound the alarm, to ask for
                assistance, to tell Great Britain and the world that
                part of its species will die, and that the most
                beautiful half of the earth will be desolate"] ("A Sir
                Ricardo"). He also wrote to the Duke of Manchester, who
                was then Governor of Jamaica. Besides those in
                governmental positions, Bol&iacute;var had contacts
                among the merchant class in Jamaica, which is not
                surprising given the fact that Kingston and South
                America carried on trade in defiance of prohibitions
                from the Spanish Crown. Maxwell Hyslop, who acted as an
                agent for plantation proprietors, is one of the persons
                to whom Bol&iacute;var wrote for money.<a href=
                "#9">[9]</a>
                "Suplico a Ud. que se sirva suministrar el dinero que
                Ud pueda . . . en la inteligencia de que, en llegando a
                Cartagena, le pagar&eacute; a Ud. la suma total" [ "I
                humbly ask that you provide whatever money you can . .
                . with the knowledge that I will pay you the total sum
                upon my arrival in Cartagena"] ("Al Se&ntilde;or Don
                Maxwell").</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Besides contacting government figures and merchants,
                Bol&iacute;var also wrote pieces for the <i>Jamaica
                Gazette</i>, which were reprinted in the Times; these
                were calculated to appease and appeal to a British
                audience. He had a difficult task ahead. On the one
                hand, the British were elated and exhausted after
                Wellington's triumph over Napoleon at Waterloo; the
                benefits of British intervention in South America would
                not seem as urgent to Britain after the Napoleonic
                menace had been removed. In a letter to the <i>Royal
                Gazette</i>'s Editor published on September 23, 1815,
                Bol&iacute;var explains his view of "internal
                differences" between Royalists and those in the
                Independence army. The letter's temporal proximity to
                the better known Jamaica Letter shows Bol&iacute;var's
                struggle to rewrite the rationale for British
                participation and intervention in Latin America. He
                places Latin America in a historical continuum,
                beginning with Athens and concluding with "the United
                States of North America": "What free nation, ancient or
                modern, is there, which has not suffered by disunion?
                Can there be a history more turbulent than that of
                Athens?&nbsp; . . . Civil wars, more violent than those
                of England? Dissensions, more dangerous than those in
                North America?" ("To the Editor"). Bol&iacute;var sees
                the internecine struggles in Latin America as a
                "thermometer of liberty," and not as a symptom of an
                instability that threatens to give victory to the
                Spanish, which is the concern of his detractors. He
                also notes that the United States had "a foreign Power"
                support its bid for independence, whereas "we were
                abandoned by the whole world" ("To The Editor"). His
                disappointment after months of lobbying is palpable:
                "We have no other weapons to resist our enemies but our
                arms, our breasts, our horses, and our pikes. The weak
                require to struggle long, in order to conquer. The
                strong give, as at Waterloo, one battle, and an Empire
                disappears!" (Bolivar "To the Editor"). Yet
                Bol&iacute;var ends with a brave front despite these
                reverses, acknowledging the desperate situation in
                which "The South-Americans" find themselves, "a despair
                which has almost always led to victory" ("To the
                Editor").</p>
    
                <p><b>III. The "Jamaica Letter"</b></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>If the "Letter to the Editor of the <i>Royal
                Gazette</i>" presents a defiant Bol&iacute;var
                struggling to write Latin America into the narrative of
                world and British history, the "Jamaica Letter,"
                written around the same time (September 6, 1815), shows
                a Bol&iacute;var who confidently draws upon authors
                such as Alexander Von Humboldt, William Robertson,
                Abb&eacute; Raynal, Montesquieu, and Blanco White to
                seek the "auspicios de una naci&oacute;n liberal que
                nos preste su protecci&oacute;n" ["auspices of a
                liberal nation that would lend us its protection"]
                ("Carta" 84). While other scholars have focused on the
                letter's relationship to Enlightenment thought, I focus
                on Bol&iacute;var's doubling strategies within the
                letter given his consciousness of a transatlantic
                audience, and that the perception of his persona in
                London was crucial to the success of the Wars of
                Independence. <a href=
                "#10">[10]</a>
                The letter's double life in Spanish and English creates
                a mirroring effect between Latin America and Britain in
                order to cement a textual alliance. Bol&iacute;var also
                uses the discourses of slavery and empire to deflect
                another "doubling" that he is at pains to conceal from
                his British audience: the actions of Afro-Venezuelans
                who, like the Independence army, fight against their
                criollo masters to get the freedom the latter are
                demanding from Spain. This was a special concern to the
                British, who were in the midst of abolitionist
                campaigns, and for Bol&iacute;var's financiers in
                Kingston and London, whose profits from slavery would
                be jeopardized if enslaved Afro-Jamaicans took up arms
                like their Venezuelan counterparts.<a href=
                "#11">[11]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The letter's composition in two languages is
                extraordinary&mdash;its historical equivalent would be
                a 1776 translation of the Declaration of Independence
                into Spanish for circulation in Florida, New Orleans,
                and Latin America. After Bol&iacute;var wrote the
                letter in Spanish, General John Robertson, an
                Anglo-Canadian officer in the British Army who had
                served as secretary of the governor of Curazao, drafted
                the English translation, and Bol&iacute;var then
                corrected it, marking his corrections on the English
                manuscript in French (Grases 706).<a href=
                "#12">[12]</a>
                Yet the Declaration, as an official, public, statement
                carries with it the weight of the letter of the law. By
                contrast, a letter is dialogical in nature and depends
                on the addressee to complete its signification. As
                Lacan concludes with regards to Poe's purloined letter:
                "the sender . . . receives from the receiver his own
                message in reverse form" (52-3). The letter's
                signification points to several reversals. First there
                is the reversal of language in Bol&iacute;var's answer.
                Bol&iacute;var assumes the rhetorical stance of
                answering questions that he receives from Henry Cullen,
                and although Cullen's letter is presumably in English,
                Bol&iacute;var answers in Spanish. The second reversal
                is the Jamaica Letter's translation from Spanish to
                English; Bol&iacute;var reverses his own text by
                authorizing Robertson's translation into English.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The mirroring of English and Spanish in the letter
                stands for a complex rewriting of Anglo-Hispanic
                historiography, in which Spanish Americans emerge as
                accomplices of Britain, rather than as their
                traditional antagonists. In his <i>Days of Obligation:
                An Argument With My Mexican Father</i>, Richard
                Rodr&iacute;guez, the renowned Latino essayist,
                suggests that the emblematic episode of Anglo-Hispanic
                history is the sinking of the Spanish Armada. He
                summons this cultural icon as paradigmatic of
                Latino-Anglo American relations:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  According to the <em>Dallas Morning News</em>, a gang
                  of "Anglos" and a gang of Hispanics shed real blood
                  in a nonfictional cafeteria, in imitation of a
                  sixteenth century sea battle the students have never
                  heard of. Who could have guessed that a European
                  rivalry would play itself out several hundred years
                  after Philip's Armada was sunk by Elizabeth's navie?
                  And here? Yet Americans comically (because
                  unknowingly) assume proxy roles within a
                  centuries-old quarrel of tongues. (110)

              <li>
                <p>While Rodr&iacute;guez is right to point out that
                the narrative of imperial Spain and its rival England
                frames the Latino and Anglo students fighting in a
                cafeteria &agrave; la West Side Story, he overlooks how
                translation&mdash;mirroring rather than
                confrontation&mdash;was one of the strategies Latin
                Americans used to resist Spain's imperial narrative and
                author their own. Like other translations that invert
                colonial relations&mdash;for example, Richard Madden's
                translation of the autobiography of Cuban slave Juan
                Manzano&mdash;the "Jamaica Letter" problematizes the
                assumption that European rivalries replay themselves
                obsessively in the theatre of the Americas.</p>

                <p>Rather than recapitulating the bitter history of
                England and Spain, Bol&iacute;var presents himself as
                Cullen's ally by quoting and answering Cullen's
                questions on the character of the "New World." Indeed,
                Cullen's letter serves to organize Bol&iacute;var's
                exposition. Bol&iacute;var assumes the role of the
                addressee returning the sender's message in "reverse
                form"; the message that Bol&iacute;var returns is a
                narrative of empire and oppression. Prompted by Cullen,
                who writes, "For the last three centuries, the Spanish
                have been committing barbarities in Columbus'
                hemisphere" (56), Bol&iacute;var invokes Las Casas, who
                "denunci&oacute; ante su gobierno y
                contempor&aacute;neos los actos m&aacute;s horrorosos
                de un frenes&iacute; sanguinario" [ "denounced before
                his government and contemporaries the most horrendous
                acts of a bloodthirsty frenzy"] (56). The
                bloodthirstiness of the Spanish is "insaciable" (58),
                and the implied cannibalism and/or vampirism of the
                Spanish transposes the valuation of the European as
                "civilized" and the Native as "savage." As Tzvetan
                T&oacute;dorov has observed, Las Casas is the first
                European to make this transvaluation. Las Casas
                "show[s] the relativity of the notion of 'barbarism' .
                . . each of us is the other's barbarian" (190).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Las Casas's denunciation of abuse and torture
                against Native Americans becomes the basis of the case
                against Spain, and this seems to be the accepted reason
                as to why Bol&iacute;var chooses him to open his case
                to the British. <span class=

                Antonio Ben&iacute;tez Rojo has noted that "las ideas
                de Las Casas cobraron particular importancia en las
                primeras d&eacute;cadas del siglo XIX, cuando la gran
                mayor&iacute;a de las colonias espa&ntilde;olas de
                Am&eacute;rica se rebelaba para conseguir la
                independencia" [ "Las Casas's ideas became particularly
                important during the first decades of the nineteenth
                century, when the great majority of American colonies
                rebelled to obtain their independence"] (112). When
                read in a transatlantic context, however,
                Bol&iacute;var's billing of himself as a second Las
                Casas raises important questions about the
                contradictions regarding slavery at the heart of the
                independence movement, and the way in which
                Bol&iacute;var wants to control how the British public
                read reports of his revolution, one that, for all its
                rhetoric against slavery, will not result in the actual
                liberation of slaves, and in fact conceals actual slave
                uprisings against Bol&iacute;var and the Independence
                army. While Bol&iacute;var writes from Kingston, slaves
                in Venezuela and Latin America have not been liberated,
                and Britain&mdash;still profiting from slavery&mdash;is
                providing financing for the Wars of Independence.
                Invoking the comparison to Las Casas allows
                Bol&iacute;var to communicate to his British audience
                that he vehemently opposes Spain without having to
                declare a position on slavery.</span></p>

                <p><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">This double
                signification is possible because of Las Casas's
                contested status in Britain as an icon for
                abolitionists. Thomas Clarkson opens his Essay on the
                Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species narrating Las
                Casas's activities against slavery; Clarkson places his
                work in relation to that of "the pious Bishop of
                Chiapa" (Preface). In the midst of the brutal scene of
                the conquest, he is the man to "make a publick
                remonstrance before the celebrated emperor Charles the
                fifth, declaring, that heaven would one day call him to
                an account of those cruelties which he then had it in
                his power to prevent" (Preface). The abolitionists'
                identification with him partially explains Las Casas's
                deus ex machina role in Williams's Peru, where he
                appears as "the pitying angel" who opposes the priest
                Valverde's cruelty and brutality (3.97). In <em>The
                West Indies</em>, which James Montgomery wrote to
                commemorate the abolition of the slave trade in 1808,
                he calls Wilberforce "The new Las Casas of a ruin'd
                race" (4.136); Las Casas "raised his voice against a
                sea of blood / Whose chilling waves recoiled while he
                foretold / His country's ruin by avenging gold"
                (1.120-2). At the same time, abolitionists fiercely
                defend him against the charge that William Robertson
                imputes in his <i>History of America</i>: "While [Las
                Casas] contended earnestly for the liberty of the
                people born in one quarter of the globe, he laboured to
                enslave the inhabitants of another region; and in the
                warmth of his zeal to save the Americans from the yoke,
                pronounced it to be lawful and expedient to impose one
                heavier still upon the Africans" (Robertson
                1:319).</span></p>

              <li>
                <p><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">Robertson is not
                being entirely fair to Las Casas, though. In the early
                period of the conquest Las Casas did recommend that "if
                necessary, white and black slaves can be brought from
                Castille to keep herds and build sugar mills, and wash
                gold" and suggested that each Spanish migrant should be
                allowed to take 20 black slaves (qtd. in Traboulay 50).
                Todorov points out that "Las Casas did not have the
                same attitude towards Indians and Blacks: he consents
                that the latter, and not the former, be reduced to
                slavery. We must remember that the enslavement of
                blacks is an acknowledged phenomenon at the time,
                whereas that of the Indians is beginning before his
                eyes" (170). Las Casas's attitude changes from 1516 to
                1546, for as Traboulay puts it, "The matter of
                providing Black slaves took a different turn than Las
                Casas had intended. The contract to provide 4,000
                slaves was given to one of King Charles' friends,
                Governor Bresa, who then sold the license to Genoese
                merchants" (52). In other words, the Las Casas of 1514
                sees the ramifications of Native American slavery but
                cannot foresee the enslaving of Africans becoming as
                systematized, inhumane, and genocidal as what he is
                witnessing in the New World. By 1546, the trade and
                exploitation of enslaved Africans leads him to write,
                "He [Las Casas] always considered the Blacks as
                unjustly and tyranically reduced to slavery, for the
                same reasons applied to them and to the Indians" (qtd.
                in Todorov 170).</span></p>

                <p><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">Peter Blanchard
                has attributed "the origins of the language of the
                independence era" to the Enlightenment and notes that
                the "particular analogy [of] slavery" creeps into the
                language of "those fighting for freedom" (500). Yet
                slavery as a metaphor for the condition of Latin
                Americans in the Jamaica Letter is a result of
                Bol&iacute;var's unstated but analogous relationship to
                Las Casas, and his knowledge of the British
                abolitionist debate. While Bol&iacute;var has to gain
                support for his cause, he cannot afford to alienate
                those of his supporters who are profiting from slavery,
                which included the Baring family and banking house
                (Williams 171). Bol&iacute;var describes the colonial
                relationship between Spain and the Americas as a
                relationship between an abusive master and his slave.
                Speaking to Cullen of Spain's attempt to suppress the
                Independence army, he writes "Ya hemos sido libres y
                nuestros enemigos pretenden de nuevo esclavizarnos" [
                "We have been free, and our enemies pretend to enslave
                us again"] ("Carta" 63). Under Spanish rule, Latin
                Americans have lived "en un grado m&aacute;s bajo de la
                servidumbre, y por lo mismo con m&aacute;s dificultad
                para elevarnos al goce de la libertad" [ "in a state
                lower than servitude, and because of this, with greater
                difficulty to lift ourselves to the enjoyment of
                liberty"] ("Carta" 70). Following Montesquieu, he
                speculates that it is harder for "naciones esclavas" [
                "enslaved nations"] to become free than it is to
                "subyugar un[a] libre" [ "to subdue a free one"]
                ("Carta" 76). The metaphor is calculated to engender
                pathos: the degradation that accompanies slavery
                highlights the righteousness of the patriots' cause,
                since no free man would ever want to be enslaved.
                Resistance against the Spanish is fierce because men
                "han perecido por no ser esclavos" ["have died so as
                not to be slaves"] (Carta 58). But the metaphor also
                points to Bol&iacute;var's attitudes towards slavery.
                To Bol&iacute;var and his audience, enslavement is the
                most degraded state of being, and renders it "difficult
                to enjoy liberty." One can see how this argument could
                be used by both abolitionists and planters.</span></p>

              <li>
                <p><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">When
                Bol&iacute;var actually refers to slavery, he imagines
                slaves as incapable of becoming free in the sense that
                would be acceptable to a European audience, "la
                [libertad] que se alcanza infaliblemente, en la
                sociedades civiles, cuando ellas est&aacute;n fundadas
                sobre las bases de la justicia, la libertad y la
                igualdad" [ "the [freedom] reached infallibly in civil
                societies, when they are founded on the basis of
                justice, liberty, and equality"] ("Carta" 76).
                Surveying the likelihood of success for the
                independence army, Bol&iacute;var paints the geography
                of the continent from Mexico to Peru. The only country
                where he doubts independence can be achieved is Peru
                because it "encierra dos enemigos de todo
                r&eacute;gimen justo y liberal: oro y esclavos. El
                primero lo corrompe todo; el segundo est&aacute;
                corrompido por si mismo" [ "[Peru] encloses two enemies
                of any just and liberal government: gold and slaves.
                The first corrupts everything; the second corrupts
                himself"] ("Carta" 80). The self-corrupting slave "rara
                vez alcanza a apreciar la sana libertad: se enfurece en
                los tumultos o se enfurece en las cadenas" ["rarely
                appreciates healthy liberty: he rages in revolt or
                rages in chains"] ( "Carta" 81). Bol&iacute;var's claim
                that slaves are incapable of "appreciat[ing] healthy
                liberty" echoes Coleridge's pronouncement that slaves
                were "unprepared for freedom" (Richardson 11). It also
                anticipates the resistance of planters just before the
                abolition of slavery in 1834, captured in Mrs.
                Carmichael's <i>Domestic Manners and Social Condition
                of the White, Coloured, and Negro Population of the
                West Indies</i>. Intended as evidence for Parliament
                and an apologia for planters, she writes from her
                experience as a planter's wife: "I could enumerate
                numerous facts, all tending to prove that many negroes
                are utterly unfit for rights of civilized men" (2:

                <p><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">The rhetoric of
                Kingston's planters has found its way into
                Bol&iacute;var's prose here, for after all, British
                slaves, like those in Spanish America, were also
                treated as "members of the family of his master." The
                idleness of slaves in the midst of abundance is a
                favorite theme of Mrs. Carmichael's, who informs her
                readers that "The slave may be perfectly idle, and yet
                he is supported. The British labourer strains every
                nerve to live. The slave is provided for without
                anxiety on his part" (1:180) and that "Indeed one had
                only to walk about the states in the vicinity of
                Kingstown . . . and see how cheerful the slaves were,
                to be convinced that the idea of slavery as bondage,
                was the last thought that ever entered their minds" (1:
                244).&nbsp; But Bol&iacute;var knew this portrait did
                not correspond to reality any more than those painted
                by the Kingston planters. Manuel Piar, one of his
                generals, was a mulatto who "proclaimed to the
                inhabitants of Margarita Island in 1814 that to him
                'death was more worthy than slavery'" (qtd. in
                Blanchard 501).<a href=
                "#14">[14]</a>
                While Piar fought for the Independence army, there were
                enslaved Venezuelans who chose to throw in their lot
                with the Royalists, a far cry from the filial fantasy
                the Bol&iacute;var depicted in the pages of the

                are two Afro-Venezuelans whose opposition to
                Bol&iacute;var and the independence army have earned
                them the excoriation of Bolivarian scholars for almost
                two hundred years; yet what has not been sufficiently
                considered in Bolivarian historiography is the fact
                that they were enslaved men siding with the Royalists
                in the hope of earning their freedom, and, given the
                uprisings throughout the Caribbean, freedom for slaves
                at large. As Blanchard records, the Spanish crown
                offered slaves their freedom if they sided with the
                Royalist army, an action which is reminiscent of
                British strategy in the American Revolution; the
                Independence army had to make accommodations if it was
                not to lose the large number of men to the Crown:
                "Needing soldiers for their armies and trying to
                prevent slaves from supporting the royalist cause,
                revolutionary leaders in all parts of the continent
                granted slaves the freedom that they wanted" (Blanchard
                501). But the delay in granting slaves their freedom
                cost the revolutionaries troops. Bol&iacute;var did not
                grant freedom to slaves serving in his army until 1816;
                prior to that, Miranda had done so in 1812, and the war
                had been going on for two years by then. Jos&eacute;
                Ramos Gu&eacute;dez notes that Miranda's "measure did
                not consolidate the Independence army's efforts to
                destroy the Spanish forces that in a short time
                frustrated the republican cause. Furthermore, many
                slaves obtained their liberty by fighting for both
                sides, or by fleeing their place of work to maroon
                communities, where they obtained protection and food"

                Monthly</i> "Sketch" features Puy, a recruiter and
                commander for the Spanish, though it is silent on
                P&iacute;o, who in fact tried to kill Bol&iacute;var
                while they were in Kingston in 1815: "The execrable
                Puy, who was far more bloodthirsty than any of his
                comrades" goes to "organize their [the slaves']
                irregular bands" accompanied by "Palomo, a negro, who
                was a notorious thief and a murderer" ("Sketch" 8).
                After Puy assumed command of this "irregular band" and
                they entered Barinas, he had five hundred inhabitants
                executed "fearing that its inhabitants would rise en
                masse against him" (8). The "Sketch" continues:
                "Exasperated by the infamous conduct of his
                adversaries, Bolivar assumed a character totally
                foreign to his generous principles and habits, and
                ordered eight hundred Royalists to be shot" (8). The
                organized slaves are presented as "irregular" in
                contrast with a well-organized army, and of course
                "bloodthirsty"&mdash;as "bloodthirsty" as the Spanish
                whom Las Casas denounced. In writing about Haiti, Bryan
                Edwards, as Alan Richardson indicates, "depicts
                massacres of white colonists in racist and
                blood-curdling terms: 'Upwards of one hundred thousand

                planters, like so many famished tygers thirsting for
                human blood'" (11). The <i>New Monthly</i> writer
                clearly evokes "the Spectre of Domingo" and Toussaint's
                revolt in his description of Puy, a connection
                clarified in Jos&eacute; Blanco White's version of the
                "Sketch." We learn in the Spanish version that Puy is
                "uno de los gefes negros" [ "one of the Black chiefs"];
                Blanco also suspects the Spanish of starting "la
                violencia de una guerra civil" ["the violence of a
                civil war"] by arming slaves (5). Bol&iacute;var's
                extreme response was not only a lesson to Spain, but
                sent a clear message to Puy and his men, and any slave
                who would join the Royalists or try to rise up against
                the independence cause. As late as 1828 "Bol&iacute;var
                was indifferent to the fate of those enslaved . . . it
                must have stemmed from his fear of a 'race' or 'color'
                war, which had developed in Haiti and other Caribbean
                islands" (Ramos Gu&eacute;dez 14). That the English
                article does not contain Puy's status as a "Black
                chief" again shows to what lengths Bol&iacute;var's
                image, and by extension, Latin America's, is being
                manipulated across the Atlantic.</span></p>

                <p><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">P&iacute;o, the
                Afro-Venezuelan who tried to kill Bol&iacute;var, is
                absent from the <i>New Monthly</i> and
                <i>Variedades</i> biographies of Bol&iacute;var
                altogether, even though the trial had been reported in
                the <i>Royal Gazette</i> during December 1815.
                P&iacute;o was Bol&iacute;var's slave and traveled with
                him to Jamaica. Not surprisingly, there are two
                versions of the story as to why P&iacute;o tried to
                kill his master, but instead killed Felix Amestoy, a
                friend of the general's whom he mistook for
                Bol&iacute;var. The first story is the one the <i>Royal
                Gazette</i> reports. The coroner's inquest determined
                "That the deceased came to his death of a wound,
                supposed to be received from a negro man named Peo, the
                property of General S. Bolivar, with a sharp pointed
                knife, which entered his left side . . . and which
                wound was a cause of his death" ("A Coroner's"). The
                statement taken says that "The negro was offered two
                thousand dollars by some Spaniards" and "agreeably to
                his murderous contract" accepted the money ("A
                Coroner's"). P&iacute;o was sent to Kingston's
                Slave-Court, where he was identified again as "the
                property of Simon Bol&iacute;var, Esq." According to
                witnesses Felix Amestoy had arrived the night
                Bol&iacute;var was to be murdered, and was lying in the
                General's hammock when a black man came in and stabbed
                him. Antonio Paez, Bol&iacute;var's aide de camp, heard
                Amestoy exclaim "Paez, Paez, this negro is murdering
                me" ("A Special"). Bernardo Castillo, another witness
                who heard Amestoy, tried to get out "but could not, as
                his servant had locked his room" ("A Special"). This
                detail shows that Pio could not have been acting on his
                own; however, he alone was convicted for the murder:
                "The Court then pronounced the sentence of death" and
                called for "his head to be afterwards severed from his
                body, stuck on a pole, and Placed in Spring-Path" ("A
                Special").</span></p>

                who became Bol&iacute;var's aide de camp after 1817,
                gives a very different account, which he presumably
                heard from Bol&iacute;var himself:</span></p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <span class="MsoEndnoteReference">In Kingston,
                  Jamaica, an Italian Jew corrupted the fidelity of
                  Pito [P&iacute;o], the servant of Paez, his ADC, and
                  who had formerly been his own slave and received his
                  freedom from him (B). This boy had for some time
                  meditated his infernal design. His first intention
                  was to execute it by means of poison. In this he was
                  providentially frustrated every time he made the
                  attempt by some unforeseen accident. Finally he
                  resolved at the instigation of his employer to stab
                  the general. (38)</span>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">In this later
                version of the story, Bol&iacute;var denies his
                ownership of P&iacute;o, a denial that is in line with
                Bol&iacute;var's public familial vision of slaves'
                lives. A contented slave would not have reason to try
                to murder his or her master; and Bol&iacute;var clearly
                wants it known that he was a good master, one who his
                slaves would not want to murder. The second notable
                alteration is the person who pays P&iacute;o for the
                murder: from two Spaniards to "an Italian Jew." Why
                would an Italian Jew have any reason to have
                Bol&iacute;var killed? The outrageousness of the
                suggestion signals, as Stephen Greenblat argues,
                "power, whose quintessential sign is the ability to
                impose one's fictions on the world: the more outrageous
                the fiction, the more impressive the manifestation of
                power" (13). The effect is to isolate P&iacute;o from
                the historical context of slaves who like Puy and
                himself, thought that the Spanish offered better
                chances of liberty than Bol&iacute;var. He adds a touch
                of the gothic through the detail of the poison, which
                was a terror of whites wherever they had slaves. Monk
                Lewis gives a detailed account on "the deadliest
                poisons used by the negroes" (207), and whites
                connected Obeah with poisoning. Robert Dunbar, a
                British Creole poet in Kingston, records "I myself was
                present at the trial of three Negroes for Obeah. An
                Obeah-man and two accomplices were clearly convicted of
                a design to administer poisonous drugs to a lady of the
                island" (129). Fears of Obeah and poisoning were
                connected to the larger fear of a slave revolution
                (Richardson 10-9), which I would suggest explains the
                alteration of the story to incorporate poison. As late
                1828, Afro-Venezuelans were taking up arms against
                their masters; though it was a "free" republic, slavery
                was not abolished until 1830 (Ramos Gu&eacute;dez
                14).</span></p>

                <p><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">The two versions
                of P&iacute;o and Puy's stories betray the anxiety of
                Europeans and white Creoles following Bol&iacute;var's
                career. If freedom is the ultimate goal of Latin
                Americans, what is to stop the fire of revolution from
                spreading to Jamaica and the other British possessions
                in the Caribbean? What is to stop the reversal of
                master and slave? Bol&iacute;var employs rhetorical,
                affective, and political comparisons between enslaved
                Spanish Americans and actual slaves in Kingston and
                throughout the American hemisphere to give his argument
                urgency. Yet his transatlantic doublings as a new Las
                Casas, as a general who never crossed swords with a
                "Black chief," and as the victim of the perfidy of an
                ungrateful former slave allow him to separate any
                connection between rising against this metaphorical
                enslavement and Afrocaribbeans taking up arms, and to
                emerge as the Bol&iacute;var that a British audience
                could embrace. His crossings of the Atlantic and then
                the South American continent&mdash;from Venezuela to
                Per&uacute;, Bolivia and back over the Andes on
                horseback&mdash; were truly Napoleonic in scope, and
                earned him an admirer in Byron, who immortalized
                Bol&iacute;var in what has to be one of the most
                remarkable rhymes of the English language. In the "Age
                of Bronze," Byron links his sympathies with the Greek
                struggle to the American one: "On Andes' and on Athos'
                peaks unfurled, / The self-same standard streams o'er
                either world: / The Spartan knows himself once more a
                Greek, / Young Freedom plumes the crest of each
                cacique" ("Age of Bronze" l. 275-279).<a href=
                "#17">[17]</a>&nbsp;
                The transatlantic imaginary that connects Latin
                America, Kingston, and London reveals that on the path
                to those peaks of freedom, one might find displayed on
                a pike the head of a slave who also wanted to climb
                them.</span></p>

            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="2"></a>2</sup> The intense
            involvement of the British in Latin American independence
            is reflected in George Canning's statement regarding the
            event: "The deed is done, the nail is driven, Spanish
            America is free; and if we do not mismanage our affairs
            sadly, she is <i>English</i>" (Galeano 173).</p>

            available critical concepts illuminate different aspects of
            the Americas-Africa-Europe triad, but are mostly predicated
            on an Anglo-American outlook. Concepts like Paul Gilroy's
            "Black Atlantic," focuses on the Anglophone African
            diaspora; Joseph Roach's circum-atlantic gestures towards
            Latin America, but does not engage it; the "transatlantic"
            implies the U.S. and Britain or Europe; Srinivas
            Aravamudan's "tropicopolitan" gestures to the Francophone
            world, but conflates Asia and the Americas; &nbsp;Mary
            Louise Pratt's "transculturation" is a more inclusive term,
            but one that neglects the AfroCaribbean or Afroamerican
            experience in relation to the Hispanophone world. Most
            recently, Kaplan and Gerassi-Navarro note that "the Spanish
            empire and early Spanish American republics have not
            figured as centrally into these new transnational

            Miranda, the general, diplomat, and ceaseless agitator for
            the Latin American cause, preceded Bol&iacute;var in
            London, and laid the groundwork for the latter's dealings
            with Britain. Miranda had fought as a general in the French
            Revolution, and upon Napoleon's expulsion of him from
            France, he sought asylum in London, where he began a
            campaign for British support of Latin American
            independence, including audiences with William Pitt, and
            William Wilberforce. For a discussion of the activities of
            Miranda and other Latin Americans in Britain, see Casa de
            Bello, vol. 1 and 2; Almeida 197-209; Racine 141-208. For a

            where Miranda figures as the stepfather of James Miranda

            received." On July 7, the <i>Times</i> continues "The
            arrival of the Jamaica Mail puts it beyond all doubt that

            garnered more than &pound;1.1 million a year in the
            Caribbean alone . . . An economist described the slave
            trade as 'basic and fundamental principle of all the rest,
            like the mainspring of the machine which sets every
            cogwheel in motion.' Banks proliferated in Liverpool,
