                <p>America&rsquo;s well-known quest for national
                literature began, as Benjamin Spencer relates, with the
                new republic's search for a surrogate British identity,
                making the great problem of American literature a
                problem of ontology&mdash;that is, a problem of being,
                as Poe observes, "a literary colony of Great Britain"
                (Poe 1044). For some nineteenth-century American
                thinkers, the unavoidable consequence of their colonial
                relationship with Britain was derivative literature: it
                was a question of whether American literature exists or
                could ever be established. D. H. Lawrence continued to
                marvel in 1923 how American writers seemed desperate to
                produce "true American" writing (Lawrence, foreword).
                Lawrence may also have been right to point out
                America&rsquo;s obsession with "slough[ing] the old
                European consciousness completely" (58): this process
                of "sloughing" and the concern over the literary
                development of a nationalist text has been a
                long-standing subject of critical literary discussions.
                For early twentieth-century scholars who wrote about
                nationalism in American literature, their story of
                literary nationalism featured American&rsquo;s ultimate
                flowering. Van Wyck Brooks&rsquo;s <em>America&rsquo;s
                Coming of Age</em> (1915), V. L. Parrington&rsquo;s
                <em>Main Currents in American Thought</em> (1927-30),
                F. O. Matthiessen&rsquo;s <em>American Renaissance</em>
                (1941), Robert E. Spiller&rsquo;s <em>Literary History
                of the United States</em> (1953) variously addressed
                and established the prevailing narrative in which
                American romantic literature finished its "sloughing"
                and achieved a uniqueness that distinguished it from
                the writings of Europe. Spiller&rsquo;s account of
                American literary history, in particular, deserves
                notice as the American dilemma was resolved in the
                development of an "indigenous" strain of
                nineteenth-century American romanticism (Spiller 344,
                345). More recently, Robert Weisbuch in <em>Atlantic
                Double-Cross</em> (1986) revisits arguments like
                Spiller&rsquo;s and finds a persistent insecurity in
                the heart of the American romantic writer who struggles
                to redefine the British text. While this particular
                perspective tells an important story of the imaginative
                and psychological process of writing, another
                complicated story of American nationalism emerges from
                a discrete, contextual study of magazine literature. In
                this essay I&rsquo;d like to offer one more way of
                thinking about antebellum literary nationalism and
                America&rsquo;s obsession with "sloughing" by examining
                nationalism in John Louis O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s
                <em>Democratic Review</em>, one of the most prestigious
                and influential magazine of the period.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>By shifting the issue of nationalism from writers
                and anxieties of aesthetic independence to national
                anxieties about American readers and ideological
                dependency, I hope to show how the <em>Democratic
                Review</em> introduced a particular brand of democratic
                personality and aesthetics which was reinforced by the
                literature printed in its pages. Antebellum
                nationalism, as it surfaced in Jacksonian rhetoric of
                the 1830s and early 1840s, acknowledged the aesthetic
                problem of originality and dependency, but it also
                turned to a separate, though related, critical concern:
                the popularity of British books and its effect on
                American readers. A material study of creative works in
                the <em>Democratic Review</em> alongside the writings
                of its editor O&rsquo;Sullivan reveal a nationalist
                strategy that focused on combating British literary
                power over American readers. The popularity of British
                literature was less an issue of national pride than one
                of political influence. For O&rsquo;Sullivan, national
                literature doubly counteracted British influence: by
                visualizing a morally distinct American identity
                determined by affective ties amongst its people and by
                fashioning a British Tory identity dramatically opposed
                to the American Democrat&rsquo;s. This essay explores
                O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s vital contribution to
                Jacksonian nationalism and, specifically, the
                importance of the misanthropic Tory figure to the
                nationalist imaginary in the <em>Democratic
                Review</em>. In writing articles as well as publishing
                works by authors as diverse as Hawthorne and Paulding,
                O&rsquo;Sullivan assembled literary support for a
                political strain of American literary nationalism that
                needed to imagine Britain as the moral and sympathetic
                antithesis to the United States.</p>
    
                <h4>I. Transatlantic readers and American
                nationalism</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Despite the political transition from colony to
                republic, Anglo-American readers of the early Republic,
                especially in its Northeastern communities, were
                famously known for preferring the literature of their
                former colonizer. Although Robert Weisbuch explains
                this preference in terms of America&rsquo;s Bloomian
                transatlantic anxiety, a prolific and dominant British
                publishing industry serving a transatlantic audience of
                American and British readers no doubt exacerbated such
                psychological connections. Clarence Gohdes remarks that
                "publishers in the United States found more profit in
                pirating the books of well-established English writers
                than in gambling upon the success of new American
                authors and paying them royalty to boot" (Gohdes,
                <em>American Literature</em>, 15). In the absence of
                international copyright laws, Michael T. Gilmore
                asserts that "[a]bout three-quarters of the books
                published in the United States before 1820 were of
                English origin" (Gilmore 547). Even in 1850, the
                pirating of British literature&mdash;conducted by
                American as well as British booksellers&mdash;continued
                to out-print American ones; one contemporary report,
                pointing to America&rsquo;s great love of British books
                and journals, claims "about ten times as many copies
                [of British fiction] are sold in the United States as
                in Great Britain" (Zinke 574).<a href=

                Hence, the <em>Athenaeum</em>&rsquo;s insightful and
                portentous twist on Sydney Smith&rsquo;s 1820 sally
                "Who reads an American book?" seemed to merit the
                revised question: "Who reads an American book <em>in
                America</em>?" ("Literature of the Nineteenth Century"
                9, my italics).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The answer to the question posed by the
                <em>Athenaeum</em> in 1835 was, in reality, thornier
                than Smith&rsquo;s pat response that Britain produced
                superior talents.<a href=

                When Fisher Ames forecasted in 1801 that "[l]iterary
                curiosity will become one of the new appetites of the
                nation" ("American Literature" 442), he little knew how
                strong that reading appetite would become or how their
                appetite for British literature would affect
                middle-class readers of British-American society before
                and after the Revolution.<a href=
                "#3">[3]</a>
                The taste for British literature was encouraged on at
                least two levels. First, as William Spengemann notes,
                "British books made up the bulk of every colonial
                library. Throughout the colonial period, the great
                majority of books offered for sale in American cities
                were written by Englishmen, and Americans constituted a
                large part of the readership for the periodical
                literature that has been called &lsquo;the most
                important missionary of British culture&rsquo; abroad"
                ("American Writers" 219). In addition, eighteenth and
                early nineteenth-century Anglo-Americans faced
                entrepreneuring English booksellers, armed with finer
                printers and established literary trade, who targeted
                and nurtured an American market for British books.
                James Raven's well-documented study of the
                transatlantic book trade points to an early colonial
                and post-colonial reliance on English printers and
                booksellers.<a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>For William Ellery Channing, this robust
                transatlantic book market seemed to be the source of
                America&rsquo;s identity problem. Before Emerson's
                "American Scholar" speech of 1837, William Ellery
                Channing, Emerson&rsquo;s mentor and friend, declared
                in an oration delivered in Philadelphia in October of
                1823, that American readers unknowingly allowed
                themselves to be captivated by British
                literature&mdash;their fascination resulting in a mass
                behavior of consumption which Timothy Flint derisively
                called "Anglo-mania" (Flint 512).<a href=
                "#5">[5]</a>
                Though often overshadowed in academic criticism by his
                more famous student, Channing delivered a speech that
                was as critical as Emerson&rsquo;s in his trenchant
                censure of American writers and his assessment of the
                habits of American readers. Like Emerson, Channing was,
                as Richard Gravil discerns, a "disciple of Wordsworth
                and Coleridge," who also studied the works of Godwin,
                Price, Locke, and Blair (Gravil 41). While a great
                admirer of liberal British thinkers and their writings,
                Channing worried about the general negative effect of
                Anglo-mania to America&rsquo;s emergent national
                identity. The Anglophilic reading public, Channing
                noticed, were undisciplined consumers whose practice
                fueled Britain&rsquo;s colonization of America&rsquo;s
                imagination.<a href=
                "#6">[6]</a>
                Popular zeal for English books pointed to the reading
                public&rsquo;s continual internalization of English
                culture. Only national literature could bring American
                readers up to a level of ideological awareness so that
                they could "counteract and [. . .] use wisely the
                literature [they] import" (Channing 89). In addition to
                Anglomania, Channing raised a concomitant problem of
                the ideology disseminated by British literature. "We
                boast of our political institutions," he revealed, "and
                receive our chief teachings, books, impressions, from
                the school of monarchy" (Channing 83). Because
                literature acted as a cultural vehicle of the political
                system which it inhabits, it was doubly dangerous for
                Americans of a democracy to read books from a
                monarchy&mdash;texts that would "bear [. . .] the
                traces of this inward degradation" (Channing 91).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Channing&rsquo;s seminal speech on political
                ideology hidden in British literature prepared the
                ground for nationalist arguments in the ensuing decades
                of the 1830s and 1840s; Democrats like John Louis
                O'Sullivan asserted that nationalist literature would
                not only help distinguish the literary culture of the
                United States from England&rsquo;s but also would
                strengthen America&rsquo;s foundational democratic
                principles. Of course anti-British American patriotism
                frequently inhabited newspapers and journals before
                1837, but O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s nationalism as
                articulated in the <em>Democratic Review</em> defined
                an emergent political position that made his
                nationalist agenda distinct from previous nationalisms:
                he attempted to characterize American nationality by
                its moral difference to British monarchy and by its
                political adherence to Jacksonian Democratic political
                values. This nationalism, which helped shape
                Whitman&rsquo;s <em>Democratic Vistas</em> as well as
                the modern rhetoric of American identity, must be
                understood as emerging directly from Jacksonian
                political thought.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Distrusting Whig "internal improvements" projects
                and believing that their programs favored monopolies
                and advanced aristocratic privilege, Jacksonian
                Democrats advocated a reformed government whose
                laissez-faire economic and social principles were
                exemplified by the motto featured on every cover of the
                <em>Democratic Review</em>: "The best government is
                that which governs least." It is precisely these
                Democratic values that framed O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s
                literary nationalism in the <em>Democratic Review</em>.
                O&rsquo;Sullivan and his Democrats promoted not only
                American works but also a populist version of the
                "Democratic" ethos by contrasting its "true principles"
                of laissez-faire egalitarian democracy against what was
                conceived as a monopolist class system of monarchal
                Britain. O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s attack on Britain was
                thus a means of emphasizing the superiority of a
                particular political and economic order of social
                relations. Consequently, in Democratic writings British
                Toryism plays a critical figure through which populists
                might assume the mantle of a more appropriate American
                identity and form of government.</p>
    
                <h4>II. Whigs, Tories, and the Dissolution of
                Democracy</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In August of 1837, Ralph Waldo Emerson delivered
                "The American Scholar" to the Phi Beta Kappa Society of
                Harvard College, chastising his audience for their
                intellectual dependency on British and European
                writers. Approximately two months later in Washington,
                D.C., O&rsquo;Sullivan added a populist layer to the
                already familiar theme of nationalism. O&rsquo;Sullivan
                worked as the literary and political editor of the
                <em>Democratic Review</em> while Samuel Langtree,
                co-owner of the magazine, primarily took care of
                publishing (Miller 11-12); political ideas and the
                aesthetic championed by the magazine are usually
                attributed to O&rsquo;Sullivan. O'Sullivan&rsquo;s
                multiple roles as owner, editor, and writer of fit the
                standard profile of American editors of the time.
                According to Charles Bristed, the editor of an American
                magazine is "owner, part-owner, at least, of the
                establishment. He does nearly all the original writing
                himself [. . .]. As representing and embodying his
                paper, he becomes an important political personage"
                (Bristed 680).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Although O&rsquo;Sullivan is better known as the
                coiner of "manifest destiny" and, among Hawthorne
                scholars, as the editor of <em>Democratic Review</em>
                under whose "glorious reign" a large portion of
                Hawthorne's short stories were printed (Miller 333),
                O&rsquo;Sullivan was an important literary and
                political editor who, through his careful selection of
                topical articles and recruitment of excellent writers,
                built the <em>Democratic Review</em> into an
                influential and prominent journal. The <em>Democratic
                Review</em> rarely reprinted creative works and
                generally printed original material. In addition to
                Hawthorne and Whitman, other contributors during
                O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s editorship between 1837 and
                1845 read as a list of "Who&rsquo;s Who" of antebellum
                American literature, including William Cullen Bryant,
                Edgar Allan Poe, John Green Whittier, Alexander H.
                Everett, Catharine Sedgwick, Benjamin F. Butler, James
                Kirke Paulding, Lydia H. Sigourney, Elizabeth F. Ellet,
                Park Benjamin, William Gilmore Simms, Charles Taber
                Congdon, and James Russell Lowell. While his magazine
                did, on rare occasions, print original works by British
                poets (one by Sir Alfred Tennyson and another by
                Elizabeth Browning), it primarily focused on publishing
                American works.</p>

                <p>Both as a literary and political journal,
                O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s magazine was well received and
                popular amongst the American literati. Noting that the
                "<em>Democratic Review</em> in 1837 had become the most
                successful political magazine in the country," Rufus
                Griswold stressed the review's creative contents and
                emphasized that it "published a better grade of
                material and was read by both parties alike" (Tassin
                142). In 1842, Poe admitted that
                O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s magazine featured the highest
                quality of American literature:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Were it not for its ultraism in politics, we should
                  regard it as the most valuable journal of the day.
                  Its editor is a man of fine matter-of-fact talents,
                  and principal contributors are Brownson, the
                  new-light philosopher, Bancroft, Whittier, Bryant,
                  Hawthorne, and Miss Sedgwick. [. . .] Most highly do
                  we esteem the <em>Democratic Review</em>, and take it
                  all in all, we acknowledge only three as its
                  superiors in any country; namely, <em>Tait&rsquo;s
                  Magazine</em>, <em>Frazer</em>, and
                  <em>Blackwood</em>, and these it will fully equal
                  when it has the advantage of their experience. (Qtd.
                  in Tassin 142)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Interestingly, Poe&rsquo;s own assessment of the
                <em>Democratic Review</em> points to the typical habit
                of American critics in reviewing the quality of
                American works through transatlantic comparisons, a
                practice which inevitably favored British writers and
                writing: here, while Poe flatters the <em>Democratic
                Review</em>, he draws three "superior" British
                exceptions. By 1842, Whitman, already a regular
                contributor, claimed in the New York <em>Aurora</em>
                that the <em>Democratic Review</em> was the "leading
                magazine published this side of the Atlantic" (Widmer
                82).<a href=
                "#7">[7]</a>
                While hailing the magazine, Whitman, like Poe, is
                cautious to emphasize its importance relative to its
                British counterparts on the other "side of the
                Atlantic."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Despite the magazine&rsquo;s importance to
                contemporary writers and despite scholars&rsquo;
                acknowledgement of the magazine&rsquo;s prominent role
                in the nation&rsquo;s political and cultural discursive
                sphere, there have been very few significant studies on
                the <em>Democratic Review</em> in terms of its
                ideological rhetoric or aesthetics. While Spencer
                observes the "democratic implications and emphasis"
                provided in the <em>Democratic Review</em> (133),
                Spencer&rsquo;s reading of the magazine, although more
                in-depth than most scholarly references to the
                magazine, typifies the critical misapprehension of the
                magazine&rsquo;s ideological history and distinct
                nationalist origins. For instance, Spencer notes that
                its "conceptions of literature" arise from the
                expansionist "triumphs" of the 1830s and 40s (133),
                when in actuality the literary mission, announced with
                the magazine&rsquo;s inception, well preceded
                O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s rhetorical turn toward
                "manifest destiny." More modern historian Edward L.
                Widmer in <em>Young America: The Flowering of
                Democracy</em> in New York (1999) mistakenly conflates
                Duyckinck&rsquo;s nationalism through "Young America"
                with O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s nationalist program in
                the <em>Democratic Review</em>.<a href=
                "#8">[8]</a>
                While in 1845 O&rsquo;Sullivan would argue for
                America&rsquo;s "manifest destiny" to challenge British
                imperialism through a vigorous democratic
                expansion<a href=
                "#9">[9]</a>,
                his focus in 1837 was an expansion of democratic
                principles through national literature. And unlike
                Duyckinck, O&rsquo;Sullivan aggressively forwarded a
                nationalist mission which declared the literary as
                inextricably tied with the political.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>During O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s tenure as editor, he
                frequently wrote or published essays that identified
                and reminded readers of the nation&rsquo;s problem of
                forgetting its political distinctiveness from the rest
                of the world. Not only did national literature create
                narratives and mythologies that invoke "one of the
                strongest bonds of common feeling" among the people
                ("American Poetry" 430), such literature emphasized the
                nation&rsquo;s uniqueness and, thus, transnational
                difference. A country such as America whose identity
                was founded on liberal ideology was at risk if its
                reading publics were not taught and reminded of their
                political commitments. In 1839, an anonymous essay
                entitled "The Great Nation of Futurity" appeared in the
                November issue that condemned the cosmopolitan practice
                of America&rsquo;s educated classes who read and
                consumed "foreign" goods. For the writer (most likely
                O&rsquo;Sullivan), the biggest sin fell upon the
                "literati" who failed to appreciate America&rsquo;s
                extraordinary "destiny": "Why cannot our literati
                comprehend the matchless sublimity of our position
                amongst the nations of the world&mdash;our
                destiny&mdash;and cease bending the knee to foreign
                idolatry, false tastes, false doctrines, false
                principles" ("Great Nation of Futurity" 428). What
                distinguishes American "principles" from European
                principles is what significantly differentiates
                American nationality from Europe or England&rsquo;s.
                Unlike Europe, whose nationality is defined by place
                and blood, America&rsquo;s "true nationality" is "not
                of soil" or "ancestry." Instead, its nationality is
                characterized by civic ideology, the political beliefs
                of the American people in "personal enfranchisement,"
                "individual equality," and "political liberty" ("Great
                Nation of Futurity" 429). The "natural fruit" of such a
                nation must be literature that is inspired by these
                principles. But such literature, the writer complained,
                was yet to be written. Articles like "Great Nation of
                Futurity" pointed to a new kind of nationalism
                advocated by the <em>Democratic Review</em>, one that
                moved away from romantic nationalism (which ties blood
                and race with land) toward a more civic understanding
                of one&rsquo;s relationship with the nation. Like
                O&rsquo;Sullivan, who adopted the U.S. as his own, the
                new American citizen no longer needed to be "born" in
                America to be American; he only needed to accept and
                assume the democratic philosophy.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The first issue of O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s magazine
                opens with a similar pedagogically themed article
                entitled "Introduction": the essay not only introduces
                the magazine&rsquo;s political and literary agenda but
                also warned readers of existing "anti-democratic"
                literature from abroad and at home. First, he observes
                the proliferation of a "decided anti-democratic bias"
                in American periodicals and among educated youths
                ("Introduction" 10). Such propaganda, O&rsquo;Sullivan
                argues, needs to be combated directly. Although the
                existing Presidential administration under Van Buren
                was Democratic, O&rsquo;Sullivan worries about the
                disproportionate number of magazines, journals, and
                newspapers which were Whig run or owned: "[T]he
                anti-democratic cause," O&rsquo;Sullivan writes of the
                American Whigs, "possess at least two-thirds of the
                press of the country, and that portion of it which best
                supported by talent and the resources of capital, under
                the commercial patronage of our cities" ("Introduction"
                13).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>O&rsquo;Sullivan, however, reserves the most "potent
                [negative] influence" on American democracy for last,
                the problem of literary consumption. The popularity of
                British works continued to erode American democracy. He
                observes, "We depend almost wholly on Europe, and
                particularly England, to think and write for us, or at
                least to furnish materials and models after which we
                shall mould our own humble attempts [. . .]. Our mind
                is enslaved to the past and present literature of
                England" ("Introduction" 13). Like Channing, who
                worried that British literature carried with it
                political propaganda for monarchy, O&rsquo;Sullivan
                sees a corresponding relationship between the
                popularity of English literature in America and the
                popular view of the British system of government. He
                warns that currently Americans "look upon [English
                literature], as we do upon the political system of the
                country, as something magnificent, venerable, splendid,
                and powerful, and containing a considerable infusion of
                the true principle; yet the one no more suitable to be
                adopted as our own, as a model for slavish imitation
                than the other" ("Introduction" 14). As British
                monarchy is an unsuitable model for American
                government, O&rsquo;Sullivan reasons, so is British
                literature an unsuitable model for American
                literature.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>O&rsquo;Sullivan and his ideological fellows
                strategically point out that those who have falsely
                directed American readers to favor British texts were
                American Whig writers. These Americans were not only
                responsible for favoring British literature over
                American ones, but also for nurturing "antidemocratic"
                thinking and attitudes they acquired from British
                writers. The "Whig party" in America is, according to
                O&rsquo;Sullivan and his cohorts, the "antidemocratic
                opposition" whose tenets are "founded on an
                irreconcileable [sic] hostility to the popular and
                liberal principles" of American democracy
                ("Sober-Thought" 280). In an essay within the same
                issue, a contributor to the <em>Democratic Review</em>
                argues that the American Whig party not only rejects
                democratic values but also appears to be identical "in
                principle" with "the Tories of Great Britain"
                ("European Views" 106). O&rsquo;Sullivan faults these
                "better educated classes" of Whigs for "drink[ing] in
                an anti-democratic habit of feeling and thinking from
                the copious, and it must be confessed delicious,
                fountain of the literature of England; they give the
                same spirit to our own, in which we have little or
                nothing that is truly democratic and American"
                ("Introduction" 14). O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s assertion
                connects Whiggish habits with derivative writing that
                is doubly damaging, revealing a need to liberate
                American literature from British writing style as well
                as British ideological thinking.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Thus what makes O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s complaint
                different from many others before him, including
                Emerson, is the motivation articulated in the passage
                above: while Emerson pointed to the creation of the
                "bookworm" and the loss of genius in ersatz American
                writing ("American Scholar"), O&rsquo;Sullivan observes
                that the deferential custom of Whig writers inhibits
                not only the growth of distinctive or original
                "American" writing, but also the transference of
                "democratic" ideas. In addition,
                O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s nationalist campaign is
                distinctive in its adherence to a particular strain of
                Jacksonian politics and its symbiotic relationship with
                literature. Publishing articles and literature that
                were in line with his nationalist philosophy,
                O&rsquo;Sullivan guided the <em>Democratic Review</em>
                with a unique nationalist program: no other
                contemporary magazine argued for such an interconnected
                relationship between politics and literature nor so
                powerfully reinforced its aesthetic theories in
                editorial statements and essays with forms of creative
                works that supported its national vision. In the
                following sections, I will discuss the critical
                component of O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s aesthetic and its
                manifestation in nationalist literature in his
                magazine.</p>
    
                <h4>III. Democratic Sympathy</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Jacksonian nationalists like O&rsquo;Sullivan
                characterized Democratic Americans with a particular
                sympathetic relationship; but before I explain this
                strain of sympathy and its political incarnation, I
                will relate how their arguments are drawn from theories
                of British moral philosophers such as Adam Smith and
                David Hume. As Kristin Boudreau notes, British moral
                philosophers like Adam Smith and David Hume saw
                sympathy as a conservative "mechanism of social
                control": "By seeing another person&rsquo;s suffering
                through one&rsquo;s own eyes, one might respond
                privately to scenes that would bring different selves
                together in sympathetic union" (Boudreau 6). This union
                does not dissolve differences of class or gender or
                politics, but rather lubricates social relations
                amongst people. Hume argues, "[W]e every day meet with
                persons who are in a situation different from us, and
                who could never converse with us were we to remain
                constantly in that position and point of view" (Hume
                44). While sympathy, according to Hume, provides a
                bridge to "greater social intercourse and familiarity"
                (44), it inevitably builds in the sympathizer "some
                general unalterable standard" of moral taste. This
                awareness of distinction (i.e. those "different from
                us"), Lucinda Cole points out, support rank and social
                order (Hume 44; Cole 109).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Americans also viewed this sympathetic communion as
                a means for providing social stability; but rather than
                reinforcing social hierarchy and relations, sympathy
                became a means for shared political connection and
                later, for Jacksonians, a conductor of nationalism.
                Americans like Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Rush who
                "avidly read Hutchenson, Hume, and Smith" found
                sympathy useful in a similar way, "to provide the
                fundamental bond of political union" or even reason for
                dissolution (Boudreau 7). According to Jay Fliegelman,
                Jefferson&rsquo;s strategic "aestheticized politics of
                pathos" stressed a difference in feeling between
                Americans and their "British brethren"&mdash;a loss of
                consanguinity that logically led to the termination of
                America&rsquo;s relationship with Britain (Fliegelman
                190). For American readers of the following century,
                Elizabeth Barnes explains, "[s]ympathy, as both felt
                emotion and cognitive press, became the mode by which
                familial, social, and even national bonds were
                reinforced; it represented the affective foundation of
                democratic society" (Barnes 25).</p>

                <p>Like the generation of readers before them,
                Americans familiarized themselves directly with
                Hume&rsquo;s and Smith&rsquo;s moral and aesthetic
                discourses, which were still popular in the antebellum
                period amongst middle-class readers. While Hume was
                known more famously in United States as a historian
                whose essays were universally studied by "reading
                people," <a href=

                essays and reviews directly addressing Hume&rsquo;s
                <em>Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals</em> in
                the <em>North American Review</em> (1819),
                <em>Democratic Review</em> (1840), <em>New Englander
                and Yale Review</em> (1843) and <em>The Living Age</em>
                (1846) all suggest that antebellum American readers
                actively revived and engaged with his ideas of moral
                sense and its shaping of individual character.<a href=

                Adam Smith&rsquo;s book <em>Theory of Moral
                Sentiments</em> was better received, its popularity
                reflected in the fact that the first American edition
                of the work was printed as early as 1817 in
                Philadelphia. Evert Duyckinck, an enterprising
                publisher as well as nationalist contributor and
                literary editor to the <em>Democratic Review</em>, also
                reprinted Smith&rsquo;s <em>Theory of Moral
                Sentiments</em> in New York in 1822.</p>

                <p>The 1819 article in the influential <em>North
                American Review</em>, which claimed to be the first to
                "formally examine" Smith&rsquo;s theoretical work on
                moral sentiments (372), highlights critical points
                about Smith&rsquo;s theory of sympathy that shaped the
                thinking and writing of sentiments cultivated by
                Jacksonian nationalists. First, the <em>North
                American</em> reviewer sees the foundation of
                Smith&rsquo;s moral sympathy in social interaction. He
                writes, "The great basis of moral sentiments, according
                to Dr. Smith, is sympathy. Sympathy is that principle
                of our nature, which leads us to enter into the
                feelings, affections and motives of other men. Hence it
                follows, that a being perfectly solitary,&mdash;as
                there would be none with whom he could
                sympathize,&mdash;could have no notions whatever of
                right or wrong, of merit or demerit." (374). Second, an
                individual identifies with others only through feelings
                that he already learned to value. "The sympathies of
                any individual, then," the reviewer argues, "must
                depend very much on the previous constitution of his
                habits and tastes. The ambitious will sympathize with
                the votaries of ambition; the voluptuary with the
                voluptuous; the avaricious with the greedy of gain"

              <li>
                <p>The first point of social interaction would become
                critical for Jacksonian nationalists like
                O&rsquo;Sullivan who read sympathy through a Democratic
                lens: he and other nationalists interpret social
                sympathy as that emotional tie of religio-political
                feeling of brotherhood and equality. The second
                observation would reinforce O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s
                point of political inculcation: if there were no
                "previous constitution" of democratic habits and
                tastes, it can only emerge in the active cultivation of
                democratic sympathies. Believing that one of the
                primary functions of national literature was democratic
                pedagogy, O&rsquo;Sullivan thus turns to sentimental
                literature, one of the most popular genres of the day,
                to become the ideal vehicle of democratic education
                through feeling. While the <em>Democratic Review</em>
                published sentimental poetry and fiction that clearly
                propped the domestic and sometimes drew conservative
                roles for women in sentimental arguments for
                "Republican public mothers" (Baym 70), <a href=

                this essay focuses on elements of Democratic rhetoric
                underlying sentimental language in the magazine&rsquo;s

                <p>Heavily influenced by the theories of
                eighteenth-century moral philosophers such as Hume and
                Smith, who argued for the virtuous nature of intuitive
                human feelings or "moral sentiments," as well as the
                literature of early and late British Romantics like
                Godwin, Wordsworth, and Coleridge, whose narratives
                illustrated the individual&rsquo;s emotional capacity
                to transcend oneself to experience the Other (cf.
                McCarthy 10), O&rsquo;Sullivan and other Jacksonian
                writers in the <em>Democratic Review</em> contend that
                moral sympathy is crucial for nurturing interpersonal
                and, consequently, communal relationships that
                characterize American democracy. The importance of
                moral sentiments lies in the ability of feelings to
                help the individual evaluate moral and political virtue
                (nearly synonymous in the magazine) and to connect
                America&rsquo;s disparate classes and ethnic groups in
                a democratic civic community of feelings. <a href=
                "#13">[13]</a>
                In his "Introduction," O&rsquo;Sullivan lists three
                primary Christian feelings experienced and articulated
                by writers who are "truly democratic and American":
                human sympathy, optimism, and brotherhood. The first
                creed of human sympathy, which he calls the "cause of
                Humanity," is rooted in the Christian belief in the
                "fundamental goodness" of human nature and represents a
                crucial moral basis of the Democratic faithful that
                distinguishes them from elitist Whigs ("Introduction"
                11). The second, optimism, is a variation of the first,
                "a cheerful creed, a creed of high hope and universal
                love, noble and ennobling" ("Introduction" 11).
                Finally, brotherhood reinforces the moral principle of
                human sympathy by evoking a sense of kinship amongst
                community members. Such kinship metaphors were a common
                sentimental strategy in American literature (cf. Barnes
                x). For O&rsquo;Sullivan, however, metaphors of
                "brothers" and "sisters" represent the deep common
                interests of the community, illustrating the feelings
                not only of fellow members of humanity but also of
                citizens of the State. For Democrats, brotherhood
                suggests that each see of their relationship with each
                other as moral and social equals. Consequently social
                sentiments are rendered into powerful ideological
                position-statements, one that associates Christian
                sympathy with Democrats in contrast to the misanthropic
                elitism of "gloomy and selfish" British Tories and
                their American Whig counterparts. As another
                contributor put it, "Democracy is the only creed which
                does justice to man, or that can bind the entire race
                in eternal chains of brotherhood and love" ("Democracy"
                215).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>No doubt reflecting on the power of popular
                sentimental literature by British female authors like
                Felicia Hemans and Maria Edgeworth, O&rsquo;Sullivan
                forwards an American version of sentimental literature
                that carries a more pronounced ideological agenda.
                Although O&rsquo;Sullivan argues that democratic
                principles should be taught and rationally understood,
                he also encourages political inculcation.
                O&rsquo;Sullivan notes in various essays that these
                political beliefs were best supported through common
                "habit[s] of feeling" ("Introduction"
                15)&mdash;ritualized habits that turn political notions
                into a natural and reflexive way of responding and
                thinking. These habits of feeling were nurtured and
                disseminated through sentimental narratives of the home
                and family by male and female writers, who "appeal to
                the <em>reason</em> and <em>conscience</em> and
                <em>heart</em> of man" ("Democracy" 217, my italics;
                see also "American Poetry" 430). Consequently, he hails
                American authors like Catharine Sedgwick as "thoroughly
                <em>American</em> and <em>Democratic</em>"&mdash;model
                writers of national literature who combine domestic
                subjects, sentimental techniques, and Democratic morals
                in their works to inculcate readers to Democratic modes
                of thinking and feeling ("American Women" 130).</p>
    
                <h4>IV. Tragic Toryism</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Whereas Democratic writers are obligated by their
                beliefs and feeling to produce literature that engaged
                with Democratic views of Christian sympathy, human
                progress, and political egalitarianism, American Whig
                and British Tory writers are, according to
                O&rsquo;Sullivan and Jacksonian nationalists,
                influenced by the elitist premise of their political
                organization. Accordingly, literature by Whigs
                illustrate deep "distrust of mankind" and presuppose
                the existence of "original superiority [of one group]
                [. . .] above the great mass of the community in
                intelligence and competence for the duties of
                government" ("Introduction" 14). Tory politics and
                writings reflect the social sins of pride, gloom,
                arrogance, and the rejection of "human sympathy." This
                rejection, more importantly, is depicted as unnatural
                conditioning&mdash;a learned and purposive behavior
                that was the chilling result of Tory indoctrination. As
                one <em>Democratic</em> reviewer asserts, pessimism
                toward life is one tragic effect of "gloomy" Toryism.
                "For what does High-Toryism in England mean, but
                despair of humanity?" the writer asks, "It looks around
                and abroad over the mass of men with no eye of hope, no
                heart of love. It distrusts, it fears, it despises, it
                hates. [. . .] It recognises no equality, no
                brotherhood, and but faint and feeble human sympathy,
                with those wretched ninety-nine. It hardens its heart
                against them, and shuts its ear to the moaning of their
                misery." ("Motherwell" 20-21). In his description of
                Toryism, the author applies key terms that are common
                in the Democratic vocabulary but are absent in the
                language of Toryism: "equality," "brotherhood," and
                "human sympathy" with the masses. Employing a type of
                "aestheticized politics of pathos" that Fliegelman
                describes of Jefferson&rsquo;s Declaration of
                Independence, this author also stages the differences
                between Tory Britons and Democratic Americans in terms
                of separate moral and political sensibility that must
                then inevitably result in the incompatibility of
                British aesthetics with American life.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Many of Hawthorne&rsquo;s short stories suggest a
                variation of this theme: a fascination with (presumably
                Whig) individuals who, like Tories, reject social
                sympathy to become moral and social outcasts in
                American society. F. O. Matthiessen points to a curious
                set of sketches from 1842 and 1843 that appear to show
                Hawthorne&rsquo;s concern with "human nature in the
                mass" (Hawthorne qtd. in Matthiessen 239). While
                Matthiessen lists stories such as "The Intelligence
                Office", the "Christmas Banquet, "The Hall of Fantasy,"
                and "Earth&rsquo;s Holocast," we could easily include
                in this list earlier short stories such as "Lady
                Eleanore&rsquo;s Mantle" which also relate another
                story of a sin against general humanity: misanthropy.
                Hawthorne records his interest in this theme as early
                as 1835 in his notebook. He describes one idea in the
                following paragraph:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The story of a man cold and hard-hearted, and
                  acknowledging no brotherhood with mankind. At his
                  death, they might try to dig him a grave, but, at a
                  little space beneath the ground, strike upon a rock,
                  as if the earth refuse to receive her unnatural son
                  into her bosom. Then they would put him into an old
                  sepulcher [. . .] Then the body would petrify; and he
                  having died in some characteristic act and
                  expression, he would seem, through endless ages of
                  death, to repel society as in life; and none would be
                  buried in that tomb forever. (Hawthorne&rsquo;s Lost
                  Notebook 16)
                </blockquote>

              <li>
                <p>For his sin of sympathetic disengagement, this
                particular misanthrope is cut off from social sympathy
                in death as well as in life. Hawthorne, however, made
                more explicit connections between misanthropy,
                sympathy, and politics in the sketches published in the
                <em>Democratic Review</em>, particularly in his
                descriptions of a misanthropic "moral monster" in "The
                Christmas Banquet" (87). Appearing in the
                <em>Democratic Review</em> in January 1844, "The
                Christmas Banquet" relates a tale of young, wealthy
                Gervayse Hastings, who appears to "possess all that
                other men have [. . .] [but] have really possessed
                nothing, neither joys or griefs" ("Christmas Banquet"
                87). An allegory of a Tory soul, Hastings is
                appropriately cursed with a "cold heart" ("Christmas
                Banquet" 87), unreceptive to the loving touch of wife
                or the "sympathy" of mankind ("Christmas Banquet" 86).
                As the aristocratic Eleanore of Hawthorne&rsquo;s "Lady
                Eleanore&rsquo;s Mantle" who suffers in lonesome misery
                due to a deadly disease brought about by what many in
                the story speculate as her rejection of "human
                sympathies" ("Lady Eleanore" 326; Lee), Gervayse falls
                victim to a similar Tory curse&mdash;the want of social
                feeling. Moreover, Gervayse like Eleanore is good
                looking, young, and (at least figuratively)
                aristocratic. In fact, Gervayse is crowned the
                sovereign of an annual Christmas Banquet ("Christmas
                Banquet" 78), wearing "a wreath of cypress" that
                symbolizes his "wofullest" claim to human misery
                ("Christmas Banquet" 79). Gervayse&rsquo;s connection
                with misery represented in the symbol of monarchy
                suggests Hawthorne&rsquo;s play on
                O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s anti-Tory rhetoric in the
                <em>Democratic Review</em>&mdash;a magazine he referred
                to later in the year as "<em>La Revue
                Anti-Aristocratique</em>" ("Writings of
                Aub&eacute;pine" 545). <a href=

                <p>Although short fiction representing the
                "anti-democratic habit of feeling and thinking" of
                Whigs was less common in the pages of the
                <em>Democratic Review</em> than the depictions of
                industrious, moral, and charitable Democrats, when they
                did appear they sometimes traced the inevitable foreign
                origins of anti-democratic manners and taste to England
                or Europe. Another example of a narrative illustrating
                anti-democratic Americans is James Kirke
                Paulding&rsquo;s "The School of Reform; A Domestic
                Tale," published in March 1838. A frequent contributor
                to the <em>Democratic Review</em> and Secretary of the
                Navy in Van Buren&rsquo;s cabinet, Paulding provides a
                morality tale of a self-indulgent American Frank
                Weatherhead and the eventual reform of his dissipation.
                However, frequent readers of the <em>Democratic
                Review</em> may have seen the story of Weatherhead as
                satire on the American Whig through his Jacksonian
                perspective on Eurocentrism (Paulding 426).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>My interest in this story is Paulding&rsquo;s
                epistemology of Weatherhead&rsquo;s extravagant follies
                and taste, cultivated both by a class lifestyle and by
                his excursions to Europe. In light of
                O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s earlier complaint that Whigs
                "drink in an anti-democratic habit of feeling and
                thinking," Paulding not only illustrates such
                anti-democratic habits but describes how such habits
                are acquired. Weatherhead is "indulged to excess" as a
                child of an upper-class family and does what many
                privileged and ambitious Americans have done when they
                come of age&mdash;travel abroad to further their
                education. Of course, traveling abroad itself is not a
                national sin; nor is it a sin to study European art.
                The sin&mdash;or, at least, Weatherhead&rsquo;s sin for
                Paulding is the absolute rejection or disavowal of
                American art due to his blind preference for European
                works. Paulding writes of Weatherhead, "Having seen all
                the fine pictures and statues of Europe, [Weatherhead]
                valued himself on his taste, and did little but find
                fault with every thing he saw on his return home. In
                short, he was mentally and personally vain, ireful,
                impetuous, extravagant and overbearing" (Paulding
                425).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Ultimately, "Europe" is the site of his dissolute
                and derivative aesthetic as well as political
                education; this point is further emphasized in the
                comparison between Weatherhead and Lord Byron. Paulding
                asks readers to evaluate Weatherhead&rsquo;s
                extravagance alongside the "false taste as well as
                false principles" of the famous English poet&mdash;not
                only to suggest that Weatherhead&rsquo;s arrant social
                taste is analogous to the loose moral principles of
                this British aristocrat, but also to remind readers of
                the connection between aesthetic taste and national
                politics. Other writers like William Gilmore Simms, who
                supported this Jacksonian notion that "one&rsquo;s
                country" and politics shaped both the disposition of
                the writer and the quality of his/her writings, also
                related Bryon&rsquo;s faulty character with British
                nature: "Lord Byron&rsquo;s egotism and
                passion&mdash;his vain pride&mdash;[. . .] declare the
                genuine English character." <a href=
                "#15">[15]</a>
                In pairing "false taste" alongside "false principles,"
                Paulding points the American reader back to the
                familiar argument of Hugh Blair and other early
                nineteenth-century rhetorical theorists who believed
                that "the acquisition of taste, or the development of
                critical judgment" influences the growth of
                intellectual, moral, and civil virtues (Johnson 34).
                But for Paulding and the writers of the <em>Democratic
                Review</em>, taste did not merely direct intellectual,
                moral, and civil virtues. It shaped and was shaped by
                political principles. Good taste, then, for Jacksonian
                Democrats, is like "feeling"; it is an observable
                social phenomenon that belies one&rsquo;s ideological
                commitment to Jacksonian democracy. Ultimately in this
                tale, Weatherhead&rsquo;s journey away from America to
                Europe allegorizes not only his wayward cultural
                preference for European art but also his wayward
                political philosophy, hinting of British Toryism.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Weatherhead appears to be a Democratic caricature of
                an American Whig, representing the majority of ailments
                that O&rsquo;Sullivan complained of in the "better
                classes." He is "vain"; he pays "little or no respect
                to the feelings of others" (Paulding 429); he is
                "extravagant"; and finally, he believes that all
                American art is inferior to that of European art.
                Although the surface narrative relates
                Weatherhead&rsquo;s reform from profligacy to prudence,
                Pauldling&rsquo;s "The School of Reform" carries
                another message. The story is a tale of politics by way
                of aesthetics, demonstrating not only the
                incompatibility of British-style elitism in democratic
                America, but also the aesthetic consequence of foreign
                "taste" and aristocratic connoisseurship on wealthy,
                impressionable young Americans&mdash;the rejection of
                homespun art and writing.</p>
    
                <h4>V. Conclusion</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In defining national literature as Democratic
                popular writings, O&rsquo;Sullivan deliberately
                excludes the works of Whigs. Moreover, nationalist
                writers who sympathized with O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s
                aesthetic populate their tales with American Whigs who,
                as alienated, misanthropic Anglophiles, seem synonymous
                with British Tories. Yet, despite the overwhelming
                depictions of conservative, monarchist Britain, the
                magazine&rsquo;s numerous references indicate both its
                unavoidable fascination with British liberal thinkers
                and writers and its rejection of the political system
                of the "mother-country." The <em>Democratic
                Review</em>&rsquo;s own rhetorical ambivalences and its
                often unacknowledged indebtedness to British thinkers
                reflect a lettered America whose intellectual hybridity
                reveals profound, continual engagement with British
                literary culture. Consequently, the nationalist
                rhetoric within the <em>Democratic Review</em> cannot
                be seen as merely a reactionary response to Britain,
                but rather a discursive consequence of a transatlantic
                public sphere, or what O&rsquo;Sullivan himself calls
                the "universal &lsquo;Republic of Letters&rsquo;"
                ("Literary Properties" 308).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Although O&rsquo;Sullivan, like many of his early
                twentieth-century predecessors, would deny the effect
                of this "sphere" by claiming that "every nation is a
                separate being" ("Literary Properties" 308); the best
                and worst imaginings of Whig and Democratic America
                require the specter of England, for it is this
                projected "alternity," to borrow Paul Giles&rsquo;s
                term, that gives meaning and purpose to
                O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s nationalism. Giles may be
                right to assert that transnational texts in America and
                Britain build "narratives of dislocation and alternity"
                with discursive responses transcending the conceptual
                category of nationalism and single national identities
                (Giles 1). "Transnationalism [. . .]," Giles writes,
                "positions itself at a point of intersection [. . .]
                where the coercive aspects of imagined communities are
                turned back on themselves, reversed or mirrored, so
                that their covert presuppositions and ideological
                inflections become apparent" (Giles 17).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>More productive transatlantic studies of American
                and British writings, then, seek not only to reveal the
                intellectual, commercial, political, or personal
                connections between these two nations, but also to
                illuminate and investigate what Susan Castillo calls
                the "transatlantic dynamic [. . .] an irresistible
                force of attraction and repulsion, absorption and
                distinction" in transnational discourse (Will Kaufman
                and Heidi Macpherson xix). Early Democratic nationalism
                demonstrates this type of "transatlantic dynamic" in a
                rhetoric that reveals double strategies to distract
                readers from what might be the horrific&mdash;but not
                so shocking&mdash;truth, that Americans can be elitist,
                selfish, and gloomy; or that the British might be
                liberal, cheerful, and charitable Christians.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This story of alternity identifies the smoke and
                mirrors itself as a heuristic; it is the visible which
                reveals the hidden. A remarkable example of this
                alternity can be found in Hawthorne&rsquo;s story
                "Howe&rsquo;s Masquerade," also published in the
                <em>Democratic Review</em> in 1838. Hawthorne&rsquo;s
                tale involves the last British royal governor, Sir
                William Howe who holds a lavish masquerade near the
                conclusion of the Revolutionary War. In order to
                distract his audience from the reality of
                Britain&rsquo;s imminent defeat, Howe sets up
                "scare-crows" of George Washington and his officers.
                The procession of "scare-crows" is necessary in the
                narrative for it foreshadows the real spectral
                procession of past royal governors, which inevitably
                exposes their collected celebration to be as phony as
                the straw persons they&rsquo;ve created.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Unlike Howe&rsquo;s scarecrows,
                O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s are English, and the spectral
                procession, which readers observe in the <em>Democratic
                Review</em>, tell of a different type of fa&ccedil;ade.
                The spectral procession in the magazine appears in the
                form of reviews of Byron, Scott, Dickens, Wordsworth
                and Bentham within a four months period in 1842. This
                procession of characters, however, is not of writers
                whose politics support the Democratic imaginary of
                Britain, but of British writers whose liberal views
                actually undermine it. The "great poet" Wordsworth is
                charged for supporting a political cause that is
                inconsistent with the humanitarian spirit that
                generally pervades his poetry; Dickens is hailed for
                illustrating the "idea of human equality"; Bentham is
                lauded for his "benevolent" and liberal principles
                ("The Reception of Mr. Dickens" 317; "Early Life of
                Jeremy Bentham" 546). <a href=
                "#16">[16]</a>
                At such moments, the chimera of alternity fades, and
                the <em>Democratic Review</em>, like Hawthorne&rsquo;s
                narrator in "Howe&rsquo;s Masquerade," calls attention
                to its failed attempt to throw a tinge of Democratic
                romance over the realities of these transnational
                literary scenes. And at such moments, when we are again
                reminded of the intellectual commonality nurtured in
                the outgrowth and exchange of Anglo-American
                Romanticism, we realize, as Richard Gravil shrewdly
                discerns, that "America did share in the genesis of
                Romantic ideology" (Gravil 37).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Yet, American Romantic ideology, as it emerged in
                the <em>Democratic Review</em> through the use of civic
                nationalism and sentiment, fostered the notion that a
                radical split from Britain was not only aesthetically
                desired but also ideologically necessary if its
                literature was to appear as an original, inspired, and
                autochthonic thing. To the problem of the
                ever-threatening and pervasive presence of British
                thought and social values in America, the editor and
                his adherents in the <em>Democratic Review</em> offered
                literature as the solution. As writings in the magazine
                identified the problem of Anglophilic texts and
                justified the need for national literature, the
                <em>Democratic Review</em> proffered itself as an
                edifying instrument, providing the remedy for that
                curious national ailment known as "Anglo-mania."</p>

            have noted, of course, the magazine&rsquo;s connection with
            the Young America nationalist movement in the mid-1840s.
            Edward L. Widmer&rsquo;s <em>Young America</em> (1999)
            claims that the <em>Democratic Review</em> was a vehicle of
            "Young America," a circle of New York writers promoting
            literary nationalism. "Young America" founder Evert
            Duyckinck did not begin to write in the <em>Democratic
            Review</em> until a year after the magazine moved its
            printing office to New York in November of 1840. "Young
            America" contributors included William Gilmore Simms,
            Cornelius Mathews, and William A. Jones. Moreover, while
            noting the Locofoco tenor of the magazine, Widmer does not
            distinguish O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s Locofocoism from the
            goals of Young America. O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s and
            Duyckinck&rsquo;s politics, for instance, were sometimes at
            odds. Duckinck seemed to have little patience for
            Locofoco-type radicalism and O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s
            magazine editorials indicate that it did not support Young
            America&rsquo;s petition for the International Copyright
            Act.</p>

            Hume&rsquo;s writing seemed to gain more attention from
            American reviewers during the 1840s. See "Smith&rsquo;s
            Theory of Moral Sentiments," <em>North American Review</em>
            8 (March 1819): 371-396; "The History and Moral Relations

            historian&rsquo;s argument on Republican motherhood in
            America see Joan R. Gunderson, <em>To Be Useful to the
            World: Women in Revolutionary America, 1740-1790</em> (New
            York: Twayne Publishers, 1996). In addition to
            Smith&rsquo;s notion of moral sentiments, texts in the
            <em>Democratic Review</em> also channeled arguments on
            domesticity that connected domestic roles of women with the
            development of political consciousness and national
            loyalty. Poems in the <em>Democratic Review</em> like the
            anonymously published "Psyche" suffused woman&rsquo;s world
            with republican duty and significance. For the poet of
            "Psyche," the moral and political worth of woman&rsquo;s
            world is grounded in the fact that man&rsquo;s
            "[p]atriotism [. . .] grew" in "home&rsquo;s sweet scenes."

            of O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s pet political projects and the
            Wordsworth article should be considered in light of the
            publication of O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s tract on capital
            punishment a month earlier. A month earlier, the
