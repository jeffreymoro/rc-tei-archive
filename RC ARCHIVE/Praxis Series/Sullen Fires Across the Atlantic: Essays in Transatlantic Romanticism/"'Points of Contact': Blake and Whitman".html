                <p>On September 29, 1890 Whitman enclosed a rough
                sketch of his tomb in a letter to his literary
                executor, Richard Maurice Bucke. An outline of a house
                with a door is surrounded by design specifications:
                "Walt Whitman&rsquo;s burial vault&#8212;on a
                sloping wooded hill&#8212;grey
                granite&mdash;unornamental&#8212;surroundings trees,
                turf, sky, a hill everything crude and natural"
                (<em>The Correspondence</em> 5: 95; sketch reproduced
                bet. 212-213). Whitman based the design on William
                Blake&rsquo;s engraving "Death&rsquo;s Door," which he
                encountered in 1881 when he read Alexander
                Gilchrist&rsquo;s <em>Life of William
                Blake</em>.<a href=

                <p>In "Death&rsquo;s Door," an old, bearded man hunched
                over a crutch steps inside the open doorway of a
                square, stone structure. The wind blows at the old
                man&rsquo;s back, rippling his garment and his beard;
                just inside the door is a rolled mat on a raised
                surface. As this dying physical body enters
                "Death&rsquo;s Door," a vibrant young man surrounded by
                rays of light crouches on top of the stone structure,
                representing the life of the soul.</p>

                <p>Whitman&rsquo;s tomb is a compelling sign of
                connection between Blake and Whitman&mdash;two poets
                who printed and self-published multiple versions of
                poems that engage the imagination and grapple with
                issues of religion, sexuality, and politics. In this
                essay I attempt to illuminate a material point of
                contact between Blake and Whitman&mdash;Whitman&rsquo;s
                tomb&mdash;through a close reading of these
                poets&rsquo; rhetorical points of contact. I also hope
                to reopen a transatlantic dialogue between Blake and
                Whitman through this formalist consideration of
                similarities in their poetic works. In order to
                understand the significance of Blake&rsquo;s presence
                at Whitman&rsquo;s tomb, this essay will explore
                Whitman&rsquo;s responses to Blake in his letters and
                notes, their shared status as prophetic poets, and
                their poetics of revision.</p>
    
                <h4>Swinburne&rsquo;s Idea of Resemblance</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Whitman, who was eight years old when Blake died in
                1827, was probably introduced to Blake&rsquo;s works in
                1868, the year Blake&rsquo;s <em>Songs of Innocence and
                of Experience</em>, <em>Poetical Sketches</em> and
                Algernon Charles Swinburne&rsquo;s book, <em>William
                Blake: A Critical Essay</em>, were published.<a href=
                "#2">[2]</a>
                It is unclear when, or whether, Whitman read these
                books, but we do know that Moncure Conway, who reviewed
                <em>William Blake</em> in the <em>Fortnightly
                Review</em> (February 1868), made Whitman aware that
                Swinburne refers to him in his book. Whitman wrote to
                Conway,</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  I have not yet seen the February
                  Fortnightly&mdash;nor the book William
                  Blake&mdash;but shall procure &amp; read both. I feel
                  prepared in advance to render my cordial and admirant
                  respect to Mr. Swinburne&mdash;and would be glad to
                  have him know that I thank him heartily for the
                  mention which, I understand, he has made of me in the
                  Blake. (Conway, 1: bet. 218-219)<a href=
                  "#3">[3]</a>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Swinburne more than mentions Whitman in <em>William
                Blake</em>: in his estimation, Blake and Whitman are
                uncannily similar. He writes,</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  I can remember one poet only whose work seems to me
                  the same or similar in kind; a poet as vast in aim,
                  as daring in detail, as unlike others, as coherent to
                  himself, as strange without and as sane within. The
                  points of contact and sides of likeness between
                  William Blake and Walt Whitman are so many and so
                  grave, as to afford some ground of reason to those
                  who preach the transition of souls or transfusion of
                  spirits. (300)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Despite Swinburne&rsquo;s enthusiastic and
                flourishing prose style, he goes on to identify these
                "sides of likeness" in extremely broad terms. For
                example, he writes: "The great American is not a more
                passionate preacher of sexual or political freedom than
                the English artist"; "The words of either strike deep
                and run wide and soar high"; and "The divine devotion
                and selfless love which make men martyrs and prophets
                are alike visible and palpable in each" (300-1). These
                proclamations of near identity go on for a few pages,
                and even though for Swinburne there is almost nothing
                that could be said of one poet which could not be said
                of the other, he admits that Whitman&rsquo;s poetry is
                more accessible than Blake&rsquo;s: "Whitman has seldom
                struck a note of thought and speech so just and so
                profound as Blake has now and then touched upon; but
                his work is generally more frank and fresh, smelling of
                sweeter air, and readier to expound or expose its
                message, than this of the &lsquo;Prophetic
                Books&rsquo;" (303).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Whitman&rsquo;s friend, John Swinton, agreed with
                Swinburne and tested his claim: he read Blake&rsquo;s
                poems aloud to friends and actually "passed them off"
                as Whitman&rsquo;s. In a letter to William and Ellen
                O&rsquo;Connor (September 1868), Whitman writes,</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Swinton has lately been posting himself about William
                  Blake, his poems&mdash;has the new London edition of
                  W.B. in two vols. He, Swinton, gives me rather new
                  information in one respect&mdash;says that the formal
                  resemblance between several pieces of Blake, &amp; my
                  pieces, is so marked that he, S, has, with persons
                  that partially know me, passed them off temporarily
                  for mine, &amp; read them aloud as such. He asked me
                  pointedly whether I had not met with Blake&rsquo;s
                  productions in my youth, &amp;c&mdash;said that
                  Swinburne&rsquo;s idea of resemblance &amp;c was not
                  so wild, after all. Quite funny, isn&rsquo;t it?
                  (<em>The Correspondence</em> 2: 48-9)<a href=
                  "#4">[4]</a>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Though Swinton "pointedly" asked whether Whitman had
                previously "met with Blake&rsquo;s productions," the
                absence of an answer here is particularly evasive, but
                not uncommon&mdash;Whitman&rsquo;s sporadic and cursory
                comments about Blake typically refer more to himself,
                and none concerns Blake&rsquo;s poetry specifically.
                William O&rsquo;Connor replied consolingly that
                <em>Leaves of Grass</em> resembles Blake&rsquo;s poetry
                as much as a "complex-melodied Italian opera, sung by
                voices half-human, half-divine" resembles "the
                Gregorian chant, bellowed by bull-necked priests with
                donkey lips" (<em>The Correspondence</em> 2: 49n).
                Whether we read Whitman&rsquo;s question, "Quite funny,
                isn&rsquo;t it?" ironically or not, it is clear that
                Whitman&rsquo;s originality is at stake when people
                take Swinburne&rsquo;s "idea of resemblance" seriously.
                Whitman reveals his uneasiness with attempts to pair
                him and Blake more openly in a short note written
                around the same time Swinburne&rsquo;s <em>William
                Blake</em> was published:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Of William Blake &amp; Walt Whitman. Both are
                  mystics, extatics but the difference between them is
                  this&mdash;and a vast difference it is: Blake&rsquo;s
                  visions grow to be the rule, displace the normal
                  condition, fill the field, spurn the visible,
                  objective life, &amp; seat the subjective spirit on
                  an absolute throne, willful &amp; uncontrolled. But
                  Whitman, though he occasionally prances off, takes
                  flight with an abandon &amp; capriciousness of step
                  or wing, and a rapidity &amp; whirling power, which
                  quite dizzy the reader in his first attempts to
                  follow, always holds the mastery over himself, &amp;,
                  even in his most intoxicated lunges or pirouettes,
                  never once loses control, or even equilibrium. To the
                  pe[rfect] sense, it is evident that he goes off
                  because he permits himself to do so, while ever the
                  director, or direct&rsquo;g principle sits coolly at
                  hand, able to stop the wild teetotum &amp; reduce it
                  to order, at any a moment. In Walt Whitman, escapades
                  of this sort are the exceptions. The main character
                  of his poetry is the normal, the universal, the
                  simple, the eternal platform of the best manly &amp;
                  womanly qualities. (<em>Faint Clews &amp;
                  Indirections</em> 53)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Here, he adopts the thin guise of a reviewer who is
                not Walt Whitman, and lays out the differences between
                Blake and Whitman in the assured diction of a literary
                critic. Though they may appear to be similar kinds of
                poets&mdash;"mystics, extatics"&mdash;he can tell the
                difference: Whitman is in control of his visions while
                Blake is not. Blake&rsquo;s visions lose sight of the
                "normal condition," ignore the "objective life," and
                turn the "subjective spirit" into a tyrant; Whitman,
                however, both authorizes and regulates his flights of
                fancy. Whitman&rsquo;s "escapades" are a dizzying
                dance, a performance balanced by a "direct&rsquo;g
                principle" that is lacking in Blake&rsquo;s visions.
                Whitman-as-reviewer is also in control of Walt
                Whitman&rsquo;s poetic reception: this is what he wants
                the literary world to say about his relation to Blake.
                But we should not forget that Whitman&rsquo;s desire to
                distinguish himself from Blake remained private&mdash;a
                note to, and for, himself.</p>
    
                <h4>Passionate Preachers</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Notwithstanding Whitman&rsquo;s distinctions, the
                prophetic dimension of Blake&rsquo;s and
                Whitman&rsquo;s poetry is perhaps their most familiar
                connection. Twentieth-century American poets Hart Crane
                and Allen Ginsberg first drew my attention to Blake and
                Whitman as prophetic poets: in Crane&rsquo;s <em>The
                Bridge</em>, Whitman is prominently featured in the
                "Cape Hatteras" section, and Blake provides the epigram
                for "The Tunnel" section; Ginsberg references Whitman
                formally, and Blake directly, in <em>Howl</em> when he
                talks about those "who passed through universities with
                radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and
                Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war" (6).
                Ginsberg, of course, mentions Blake and Whitman in
                other poems, including "America," "Sunflower Sutra,"
                and "Poem Rocket," in which he says, "Here I am naked
                without identity / with no more body than the fine
                black tracery of pen mark on soft paper / as star talks
                to star multiple beams of sunlight all the same myriad
                thought / in one fold of the universe where Whitman was
                / and Blake" (24-28).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Prophecy means to speak forth, before, or for, and
                prophetic writing attempts to communicate the divine
                voice through a textual vision. Blake writes in "All
                Religions are One" that the "Poetic Genius is the true
                Man" who is also "every where call&rsquo;d the Spirit
                of Prophecy," and again in his annotations to the
                Bishop of Llandaff&rsquo;s <em>An Apology for the
                Bible</em> that the prophet "utters his opinions both
                of private &amp; public matters."<a href=
                "#5">[5]</a>
                Ian Balfour explains that Blake&rsquo;s view of
                prophecy is similar to that in Protestant discourse of
                the seventeenth century, like Jeremy Taylor&rsquo;s
                <em>The Liberty of Prophesying</em> (1647), in which
                prophecy "has more to do with freedom of expression or
                sheer speaking on behalf of God than with prediction of
                the future" (131).<a href=
                "#6">[6]</a>
                In a similar vein in his Preface to <em>Leaves of
                Grass</em>, Whitman states that "the greatest poet" is
                "a seer" and "every man shall be his own
                priest."<a href=
                "#7">[7]</a>
                Biblical prophecy is especially important to both
                poets&rsquo; works: among numerous examples, Isaiah and
                Ezekiel dine with the poet in Blake&rsquo;s <em>The
                Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>, and "All flesh is
                grass" (Isaiah 40:6) resonates throughout
                Whitman&rsquo;s verse. Blake&rsquo;s mythological
                system is fundamentally biblical and, working on the
                third (1860) edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>,
                Whitman was involved in what he called "The Great
                Construction of the New Bible" (<em>Notebooks</em>
                1:353).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>That only a handful of essays on Blake and Whitman
                have been published (in the early 1980s) attests to the
                notion that their similarities are considered more a
                literary intuition than an avenue for critical
                exploration.<a href=

                However, both Malcolm Cowley and Donald Pease provide
                us with useful terms of comparison. In his
                <em>Introduction to Walt Whitman&rsquo;s Leaves of
                Grass: The First (1855) Edition</em>, Cowley argues
                that Whitman&rsquo;s <em>Song of Myself</em> and
                Blake&rsquo;s illuminated works belong to a larger,
                prophetic canon that includes works ranging from the
                <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em> to Rimbaud&rsquo;s
                <em>Illuminations</em>.<a href=
                "#9">[9]</a>
                Within such a canon, works deeply concerned with
                cultural politics would fall under the aegis of what
                Donald Pease calls "epic prophecies," or visions of
                "what is possible for a nation at a particular time in
                history" ("Blake, Whitman, Crane" 25). Both
                Blake&rsquo;s continental prophecies, especially
                <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion, America,
                Europe</em>, and the unengraved <em>The French
                Revolution</em> can be considered alongside
                Whitman&rsquo;s writings on the Civil War, especially
                <em>Drum-Taps</em> and <em>Specimen Days</em>, the
                Independence Day publication of the 1855 <em>Leaves of
                Grass</em>, and the centennial 1876 <em>Leaves of
                Grass</em>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The national and religious dimensions of
                Blake&rsquo;s poetic prophecy are markedly different
                from Whitman&rsquo;s. Several of Blake&rsquo;s poems
                tell the story of Orc, who represents "Revolution in
                the material world" (Damon 309). Blake&rsquo;s
                <em>America, A Prophecy</em> records the effect of the
                American revolution on Europe: Orc breaks free from his
                chains (Los, his father, bound him to a mountain), war
                enters the world, and he is rebuked as an unholy agent
                of liberty. Here, as well as in the continuation of
                this tale in <em>Europe, A Prophecy</em>, the spiritual
                world is reflected in the material world. Revolution in
                the material world will always lose touch with its
                original meaning and fail, unless it is led by Jesus,
                who, for Blake, was the original spiritual
                revolutionary. Therefore, national liberty can only be
                achieved through a specifically Christian vision.
                According to S. Foster Damon, the final three chapters
                of <em>Jerusalem</em> (which signifies Liberty in
                Blake&rsquo;s mythological schema)&mdash;addressed to
                the Jews, the Deists, and the Christians&mdash;"analyze
                man&rsquo;s progress through Experience until he
                reaches the Truth": the Jewish religion is that of
                "Moral Law" and "the childhood of the human race"; the
                Deist religion is that of "young manhood [which]
                retains the Moral Law, but substitutes Nature for God";
                and the Christian religion is that of
                "maturity&amp;#8212particularly plagued by the errors
                of sex&mdash;the false ideal of chastity" (210).
                Jerusalem is a prophetic vision of the true religion,
                which Man can achieve once he moves through these
                stages, eliminates all these errors, and embraces God
                within himself. In the introductory address in
                <em>Jerusalem</em>, "To the Public," Blake expresses
                the hope that the reader will "be with" him, "wholly
                One in Jesus our Lord" (plate 3).<a href=
                "#10">[10]</a>
                To "be with" Blake, as his reader, is to unite with
                Jesus, become part of the creative and illuminating
                process of the imagination, and ultimately recognize
                the divine and infinite within.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>For Blake, an exclusively Christian vision of
                reunion with God must be adopted in order for humanity
                to be redeemed: the state of the nation depends on the
                spiritual state of its citizens and, ultimately,
                everyone is a citizen of Jerusalem. For Whitman,
                however, God is equal to, and exists in,
                everything:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  I have said that the soul is not more than the
                  body,<br />
                  And I have said that the body is not more than the
                  soul,<br />
                  And nothing, not God, is greater to one than
                  one&rsquo;s-self is<br />
                  (. . . )<br />
                  I hear and behold God in every object, yet I
                  understand God not<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
                  the least,<br />
                  Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful
                  than myself. (<em>Song of Myself</em> 1262-64,
                  1274-75)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Whitman&rsquo;s spiritual vision does not involve
                evolutionary stages of religion that lead to
                Christianity; rather, it includes all religions. In
                "Salut au Monde!" he hears "the Arab muezzin calling
                from the top of the mosque," "the Hebrew reading his
                records and psalms," "the rhythmic myths of the
                Greeks," "the tale of the divine life and bloody death
                of the beautiful God the Christ," and "the Hindoo
                teaching his favorite pupil" (<em>Leaves of Grass by
                Walt Whitman</em> 288). Christ&mdash;Whitman does not
                refer to him as Jesus in <em>Leaves of
                Grass</em>&mdash;represents the ideal of brotherhood,
                of the love of another as one&rsquo;s self, or
                comradeship: "Young man, I think I know you&mdash;I
                think this face of yours is the face of the Christ
                himself, / Dead and divine and brother of all, here
                again he lies" ("A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray
                and Dim," <em>Leaves of Grass</em> <em>by Walt
                Whitman</em> 441).<a href=
                "#11">[11]</a>
                Whitman believes, like Blake, that humans are divine,
                but he also believes that they are equally as divine as
                God and such knowledge requires no mediation.
                Whitman&rsquo;s address to the reader in the Preface to
                <em>Song of Myself</em> is not expressed as a hope, but
                rather as a directive that does not include a specific
                religious reference: he says, "You shall stand by my
                side and look in the mirror with me" (13). Within this
                lateral structure of perception, both author and reader
                are reflected. Indeed, it is this imperative and
                necessary relationship between author and reader that
                Whitman&rsquo;s poem traces: the trajectory of <em>Song
                of Myself</em> moves from "I" to "you"&mdash;from
                "<em>I</em> celebrate myself" to "I stop somewhere
                waiting for <em>you</em>." Whitman&rsquo;s desire for,
                and performative declaration of, reciprocity takes
                place through the text in which we see both I and you.
                The state of the nation, according to Whitman, depends
                as much on the spiritual state of its citizens as it
                does on their citizenship in the human race.</p>
    
                <h4>Revisionary Poetics</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Both Blake and Whitman engaged in the lifelong
                practice of revising their previously printed works.
                The nature of their poetic revision is complex and
                wide-ranging, and we will glimpse only a narrow view of
                it here by focusing on tropes of the practice of
                revision&mdash;contraction and expansion&mdash;in each
                poet&rsquo;s work. Before we look at contraction and
                expansion, we should note that Blake and Whitman
                revised their poems in many different ways. Blake
                rewrote particular stories in several different poems
                and he also produced multiple copies of his poems. Each
                copy of one of his poems is unique: variation among
                them includes plate order, design, and coloration. For
                example, only two of the eight copies of <em>The Book
                of Urizen</em> contain all the plates Blake etched for
                the poem, and in each copy the full-page designs are
                ordered differently. Each poem is, in effect, all the
                different copies of that poem; and each copy represents
                a different way of seeing that necessarily includes
                other versions in its purview. There is considerable
                disagreement among critics about whether variations in
                Blake&rsquo;s works are intentional changes, or
                inherent consequences of his method of production
                (etching, inking, printing, washing in watercolors,
                etc.). In "The Text, the Poem, and the Problem of
                Historical Method," Jerome McGann claims that Blake
                produced unique copies of <em>Jerusalem</em>
                purposefully, unfettered by artistic limitation:
                variations are not "merely accidental, and unimportant
                for the &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; of Blake&rsquo;s work.
                Certainly to Blake they seemed immensely consequential"
                (276). Alternatively, Joseph Viscomi argues that
                variation is a consequence of the way in which Blake
                produced copies of a poem, but it is not a
                consequential part of the poem&rsquo;s meaning: the
                "assumption that variants were intended or perceived by
                Blake as meaningful, produced deliberately to
                destabilize the text and to make every copy of a book a
                separate version, is based on a misunderstanding of
                Blake&rsquo;s mode of book production and its ruling
                paradigm . . . variation&mdash;in the form of states,
                proofs, prints before letters, size and type of paper,
                and so on&mdash;was inherent to the aesthetics and
                economics of conventional print production . . .The
                differences are in emphasis and detail, not in the
                nature of phenomenon" (<em>Blake and the Idea of the
                Book</em> 167, 169).<a href=
                "#12">[12]</a>
                I would argue that McGann&rsquo;s and Viscomi&rsquo;s
                positions are not mutually exclusive: Blake&rsquo;s
                method of production probably resulted in unintentional
                variations, and Blake might have changed, for example,
                the order of plates in a copy of a poem on purpose.
                Both kinds of variation have implications for our
                reading of multiple copies of one of Blake&rsquo;s
                poems.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Whitman&rsquo;s revision of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
                spanned over more than thirty-five years, during which
                he added poems, excised poems, created "clusters,"
                changed titles, and added supplements. For example, the
                1855 version contains twelve untitled poems; the 1856
                version contains thirty-two poems (all with titles);
                the 1860 version contains one hundred and forty-six new
                poems (all grouped into clusters); and the 1881 version
                contains final cluster titles and sequences of poems
                within clusters.<a href=
                "#13">[13]</a>
                Unlike Blake, who did not designate one particular copy
                of a poem for publication, Whitman clearly states his
                preference for the final edition of <em>Leaves of
                Grass</em>. At the beginning of the 1891-2 edition he
                writes, "As there are now several editions of L. of G.,
                different texts and dates, I wish to say that I prefer
                and recommend this present one, complete for future
                printing, if there should be any"; moreover, shortly
                before he died he issued a statement that the 1892
                edition should "absolutely supercede all previous ones"
                (<em>Leaves of Grass</em> <em>by Walt Whitman</em> 148,
                703).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In this last section, we will look at the appearance
                of tropes of revision in scenes of crisis in
                Blake&rsquo;s and Whitman&rsquo;s poems. Both
                Blake&rsquo;s characters and Whitman&rsquo;s subject
                encounter a crisis of perception that threatens their
                expansion. These subjects in Blake&rsquo;s poetry are,
                of course, allegorical or mythic figures enacting a
                story, while in Whitman&rsquo;s poetry the subject is,
                as John Berryman puts it, a voice "for himself [and]
                for others <em>as himself</em>" (246). In Blake&rsquo;s
                story of limited perception in <em>The Book of
                Urizen</em>, characters become what they behold:
                contraction is a result of fallen perception, but such
                a state is actually necessary for imaginative
                expansion. In <em>Song of Myself</em>, the speaker
                overcomes the daybreak&rsquo;s threat to his expansion
                by becoming what he beholds through his vision and his
                voice. In both Blake and Whitman, then, subjects
                overcome (actual or potential) contraction by becoming
                what they behold in order to expand.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>To see how contraction and expansion are figured in
                Blake, it is necessary to first rehearse the creation
                myth of Urizen. <em>The Book of Urizen</em> actually
                describes two creation myths: that of Los (the
                imagination) and that of Urizen ("your reason,"
                limitation, and law). In seven ages, reminiscent of the
                seven days of biblical creation, Los forged and limited
                Urizen into physical form: his spine "writh&rsquo;d in
                torment" and ribs "froze / Over all his nerves of joy"
                in the first Age (9.37, 39-41); a heart shot out veins
                and arteries in the second Age; his "nervous brain shot
                branches / Round the branches of his heart" and formed
                two eyes "fixed in two little caves," or eye-sockets,
                in the third Age (10.11-12, 14); two ears formed in the
                fourth Age; two nostrils "bent down to the deep" in the
                Fifth Age (12.1); a "Tongue / Of thirst &amp; of hunger
                appeard" in the sixth Age (12.8-9); his arms shot out
                to the north and south, and his feet "stampd" the
                "nether Abyss" in the seventh, and final, Age (12.16).
                At the beginning of Chapter V (Plate 12), Los "shrunk"
                in "terrors" from his task (12.20),</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Then he look&rsquo;d back with anxious desire<br />
                  But the space undivided by existence<br />
                  Struck horror into his soul.<br />
                  6. Los wept obscur&rsquo;d with mourning<br />
                  His bosom earthquak&rsquo;d with sighs<br />
                  He saw Urizen deadly black<br />
                  In his chains bound &amp; Pity began<br />
                  7. In anguish dividing &amp; dividing<br />
                  For pity divides the soul<br />
                  In pangs eternity on eternity (12.45-54)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>After lamenting the separation between himself and
                eternity, "the space undivided by existence," Los
                perceived Urizen, bound in chains. Los&rsquo; division
                results both from seeing Urizen as divided from himself
                and from the emotion associated with this realization.
                Los became the division and separation he beheld.
                "Pity" began in Los as emotion and became a "round
                globe of blood / Trembling upon the void" (12.58-59)
                that "branched out into roots" and fibres, and
                eventually became a "female form trembling and pale"
                (16.2, 7).<a href=
                "#14">[14]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Los&rsquo; initial division does not cease: he
                continues "dividing &amp; dividing / For pity divides
                the soul" (13.52-53). In the fallen world of time and
                space, Pity also redeems, or reunites the soul, but
                Pity "cannot reunite unless there has been a previous
                division." (Damon 327). Pity, later called Enitharmon
                (Los&rsquo; emanation, or female counterpart), is
                Blake&rsquo;s Eve figure. Leopold Damrosch notes that
                although she "tantalizes and frustrate[s]" Los later in
                <em>The Book of Urizen</em>, Enitharmon is "considered
                a merciful limit to the fall" (183). In theological
                terms, Eve/Enitharmon secures the eventual embodiment
                of Jesus Christ; the repetition of generation will
                produce God incarnate, through whom humanity might be
                redeemed. Contrary to the denial of resemblance
                inherent in a contracted perception that sees only the
                horror of individuation and limitation, the Divine
                Vision entails an expansive vision through which one
                sees a similitude between the Divine and the human.
                Blake&rsquo;s concept of Christian redemption can be
                understood in terms of perception: reunion is made
                possible through the figure of Jesus, in whom
                Blake&rsquo;s characters see "the Eternal Vision! the
                Divine Similitude!" at the end of <em>Jerusalem</em>
                (34[38].11). In Jesus, one can see both human and
                divine, and for Blake, this is the realization that
                expands our perception to include seeing the divine in
                ourselves.</p>

              <li>
                <p>While the mythic characters in Blake&rsquo;s poems
                contract and expand through perception, Whitman, or a
                version of Whitman, in <em>Song of Myself</em>,
                contracts and expands through touch. Whitman&rsquo;s
                lexicon of expansion is extensive: for example, in
                <em>Song of Myself</em>, he "chant[s] a new chant of
                dilation" (428), he is "Partaker of influx and efflux,"
                (462), and flies as "the fluid and swallowing soul"
                (799). It is also important to note that Whitman, as
                the subject of <em>Song of Myself</em>, is multiple: he
                incorporates "other" voices through and as his own.
                Ronald Beck explains that "At times the speaker seems
                to be a persona named Walt Whitman, at other times the
                voice of all mankind, at other times the voice of the
                mystical unity at the center of all being. Not only
                does the point of view shift, but it is often difficult
                to tell exactly when it shifts, and it is sometimes
                impossible to tell which voice is speaking" (35). The
                speaker in <em>Song of Myself</em> expands into a
                kosmos: "Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs,
                a kosmos, / Disorderly fleshy and sensual" (499-500).
                "Many long dumb" and "forbidden voices" filter out
                through his expansive body, and then, in a moment
                reminiscent of Blake&rsquo;s "Human Form Divine" and
                his assertion that "every Minute Particular is Holy: /
                Embraces are Cominglings: From the Head even to the
                Feet," Whitman proclaims, "Divine I am inside and out,
                and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched from"
                (Jerusalem 69.42-3, <em>Song of Myself</em>
                526).<a href=
                "#15">[15]</a>
                Whitman, as poet of the body and of the soul, figures
                the relationship between self and other in sacramental
                and physical terms. He has "instant conductors" all
                over his body that "seize every object and lead it
                harmlessly" through him; he need only "press" with his
                fingers to be happy (614-16). But this touching, in
                which he "merely stirs," also limits Whitman&rsquo;s
                expansion: "To touch my person to some one else&rsquo;s
                is about as much as I can stand" (617). He continues,
                "Is this then a touch? .... quivering me to a new
                identity," and an intensely visceral and sexual
                description of forced physical contact follows: "On all
                sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs /
                Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip"
                (622-23).<a href=
                "#16">[16]</a>
                His "fellow-senses" are personified as "sentries" who
                were "bribed to swap off with touch, and go and graze
                at the edges" of him (628-9). "Touch" has turned his
                other senses into traitors; he loses his wits and
                admits that he is "the greatest traitor" (637). When
                Whitman&rsquo;s senses leave their posts, "villain
                touch" overwhelms him to the point where he can hardly
                breathe (639). Whitman acquiesces, "You are too much
                for me" (640).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In the middle of Whitman&rsquo;s expansion and
                contraction here, he experiences a crisis of
                perception. Whitman beholds the daybreak, but before he
                can see the sun itself, he sees its rays: "Something I
                cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs, / Seas of
                bright juice suffuse heaven" (557-8). When he sees the
                sunrise, it threatens to annihilate him: "Dazzling and
                tremendous how quick the sunrise would kill me, / If I
                could not now and always send sunrise out of me"
                (562-3). The speaker circumvents the threat of
                potentially fatal contraction by becoming like the sun,
                by becoming what he beholds: "We also ascend dazzling
                and tremendous as the sun," and the daybreak is
                suddenly "calm and cool" (564-5). Then, remarkably, the
                speaker sends the sunrise out of himself through his
                voice: "My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,
                / With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and
                volumes of worlds" (566-7). Whitman becomes what he
                beholds through vision, and then reaches beyond what he
                beholds through his voice, making expansion possible.
                Moreover, Whitman becomes what we behold: a sunrise
                whose rays reach us through his voice.</p>

              <li>
                <p>When Whitman read Gilchrist&rsquo;s <em>Life of
                Blake</em> in 1881, Blake was no longer a potentially
                threatening poetic rival. In a January letter to George
                and Susan Stafford he wrote that Gilchrist&rsquo;s two
                volumes "are queer books, the very finest of printing
                &amp; paper &amp; some odd pictures"; two weeks later
                he wrote, "though they are very queer in the story of
                Blake&rsquo;s life and works, there is a deal that is
                interesting &amp; good to chew on&mdash;then they are
                such beautiful specimens of paper &amp; printing, it is
                a pleasure to read them" (<em>The Correspondence</em>
                3: 206, 208). Gilchrist&rsquo;s book succeeded in
                capturing Whitman&rsquo;s attention through both the
                story of Blake and the reproductions of his
                plates.<a href=
                "#17">[17]</a>
                What finally drew Whitman to Blake was the <em>material
                beauty</em> of the book about Blake. Whitman beheld
                Blake&rsquo;s "Death&rsquo;s Door" in Gilchrist&rsquo;s
                book and decided to use it as a model for his tomb.</p>

            with Walt Whitman," Gilchrist's daughter, Grace, confirms
            that Whitman's burial house is a "design he himself chose
            from Blake's fine engraving of Death's Door" (212).
            Alexander Gilchrist's wife, Anne, is a particularly
            interesting point of contact between Blake and Whitman: she
            finished <em>Life of William Blake, "Pictor ignotus"</em>
            (1863), after her husband died suddenly in 1861; read
            <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1869 and became enamored with
            the poet; published a defense of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
            in an anonymous article entitled, "An Englishwoman's
            Estimate of Walt Whitman" (<em>The Radical</em>, May 1870);
            corresponded with Whitman for six years before moving to
            Philadelphia (with three of her children) in 1876; and,
            from 1876 to 1878, became one of Whitman's dearest
            friends.</p>
    
            <p class="indent">Blake produced several versions of
            "Death's Door"; Gilchrist's <em>Life of William Blake</em>
            includes the version Blake etched for Robert Blair's
            <em>The Grave</em> (1808) in both the 1863 edition (1: 224)
            and the 1880 edition (1: 269). For other versions see
            <em>America</em> 6<em>,</em> <em>The Marriage of Heaven and
            Hell</em> 21, and <em>The Notebook of William Blake</em>

            context of <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> and the
            <em>Grave</em> illustrations: he argues that Blake's
            rejection of conventional commercial practice of engraving
            an image whose copies are identical, or standardized, opens
            up the possibility of reading repetition in his works as a
            "site for a reunification of aesthetic and

            abbreviated, and he adds the phrase, "he became what he
            beheld" (3.29); in <em>Jerusalem</em> the episode itself
            contracts into the repeated phrase, "they became what they
            beheld" (Plates 34-36). This scene also appears in
            <em>Vala, or The Four Zoas</em> (Blake's attempt to
            incorporate his myths into a "single narrative," abandoned

            Blake's practice of revising this episode by contracting it

            <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> 8.10,

            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="16"></a>16</sup> For a
            discussion of this passage which opens up the possibility
            that Whitman's poetry allows for the reader to speak
            prophetically, see Bertolini's argument in "&lsquo;Hinting'
            and &lsquo;Reminding': The Rhetoric of Performative
            Embodiment in <em>Leaves of Grass</em>" that the lyric
            persona tropes "his own thought, affect, and activity
            display[ing] modes of self-relation which are offered to
            the reader for a kind of subjective reinscription" and that
            we might read "Is this then a touch?" as a question
            "uttered with the reader's tongue" (1067, 1071).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="17"></a>17</sup> It
            seems even more likely that Whitman did not read
            Swinburne's <em>William Blake</em> when we consider that
            although Swinburne includes and discusses Blake's
            "pictures" and biography, Whitman does not comment on
            either until he reads Gilchrist's book in 1881. Swinburne
            refers widely to the first edition of Gilchrist's <em>Life
            of William Blake</em> (1863), discusses two engravings from
            Blair's <em>The Grave</em>, "The Reunion of the Soul &amp;
            the Body" and "The Soul hovering over the Body reluctantly
            parting with Life" (56-58), but does not reproduce or
            specifically discuss "Death's Door," and includes nine
            facsimiles: the frontispiece is a reduction of
            <em>Jerusalem</em> 70; the title page is "A design of
            borders selected from those in <em>Jerusalem</em> (plates
            5, 19, &amp;c.) with minor details from <em>The Marriage of
            Heaven and Hell</em> and <em>The Book of Thel</em>";
            <em>The Book of Thel</em> title page (200); <em>The
            Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> title page (204); <em>The
            Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> 8 (208); <em>The Marriage
            of Heaven and Hell</em> 20 (224); <em>Milton</em> 8 (258);
            <em>Jerusalem</em> 81 (276); and a reduction of
            <em>Jerusalem</em> 33 [37]. Whitman briefly mentions Blake
            only once in his published works in <em>Good-Bye My
            Fancy</em> (1891) when he imagines that Blake's "half-mad
            vision&#8212;would have revell'd night or day, and
            beyond stint, in one of our American corn fields!"
