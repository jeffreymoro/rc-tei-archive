                <p>A popular hit in the United States, W.M.
                Thackeray&rsquo;s <em>Vanity Fair</em> is useful for
                underlining how one of the staples of the sentimental
                novel&mdash;the training of the mind and "heart" that
                Thackeray so mercilessly mocks as artificial&mdash;is
                itself implicated in so many mid-nineteenth century
                Americans&rsquo; expression of anxiety over female
                novel-reading. In this context, Becky Sharp&rsquo;s
                "naturalness" and her explicit rejection of books and
                female self-improvement at once invite a
                reconsideration of the naivet&eacute; and simplicity
                critics have often assumed in their discussions of
                American domestic fiction, while at the same time
                drawing attention to the contentious debates over the
                moral status of novels themselves and the kind of
                cultural work they did.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>I have chosen <em>Vanity Fair</em> as an example of
                a popular British reprint during this period because
                Thackeray&rsquo;s cynical manipulation of the
                sentimental genre invites analysis of the
                period&rsquo;s dominant historiography that posits a
                literary landscape dominated by American sentimental
                fiction. <em>Vanity Fair</em>&rsquo;s strong presence
                in the American market invites the dissolution of the
                monochromatic sentimentality that critics still too
                often expect of American women&rsquo;s novels at
                mid-century, while Thackeray&rsquo;s novel&rsquo;s
                popularity in the U.S. provides an opportunity to
                examine what critics, and presumably readers, valued
                about novels and why. In other words, I use Becky Sharp
                to approach the problem of how British reprints alter
                the popular American literary market precisely because
                she is such an overtly anti-sentimental character.
                Becky raises the question of the place of feminine
                individualism in literature, or, as Gillian Brown
                writes, "the alignment of the individualistic self and
                its representations with anti-sentimentalism" (Brown
                136). The traditional identification in American
                literary history of popular literature with a tame,
                feminized domesticity, and of individualism and the
                integrity of self with more "literary," masculine works
                of fiction, is nicely spliced by a figure such as
                Becky. Because she is so self-interested, a reading of
                her in the American context invites an analysis of the
                relation between her authenticity or "naturalness" as
                represented by Thackeray and her status as a popular,
                if reviled, female figure in a wider spectrum of
                reading. In turn, the value of Thackeray&rsquo;s
                narrative being perceived as "true to life" or
                "realistic" by antebellum American critics is placed in
                opposition to the troubled representation of
                authenticity in American sentimental culture.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Put very simply, it is the struggles with natural
                passion and raw impulses, and the training of the mind
                and "heart," that is at the center of much of this
                period&rsquo;s "sentimental" writing, just as the same
                struggle with passions&mdash;in which the battle is
                lost&mdash;predominates the widely read sensation and
                subversive fiction that David Reynolds has identified
                in <em>Beneath the American Renaissance</em>.
                <em>Vanity Fair&rsquo;s</em> explicit rejection of
                female self-improvement in this context invites a
                reconsideration of the naivet&eacute; and simplicity
                critics have often assumed in their discussions of
                American domestic fiction. Indeed, sustaining the
                construct of an enclosed body of "domestic" or
                "sentimental" fiction that comprised the whole of
                American women&rsquo;s reading has long since been
                shown to be untenable. And yet, the idea that popular
                female reading was quite explicitly defined in terms of
                British reprints throughout the 1850s remains
                untested.</p>

                <p>Reprinted in the United States by Harper &amp;
                Brothers in 1848, the first volume of <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> was issued on July 29, with volume two on
                August 19 of the same year. For this first American
                edition, illustrated by the author, one hundred pounds
                was probably paid for proofs. Later that year, Harper
                issued a one-volume edition, which sold for $1 in paper
                and $1.25 in cloth (Dzwonkoski 195). In the absence of
                a copyright agreement with England, under the
                period&rsquo;s "courtesy of the trade" agreements,
                Harper&rsquo;s payment should have secured their sole
                right to publish <em>Vanity Fair</em> in the American
                market. As was frequently the case, this "courtesy" was
                not entirely respected. In fact, even in the relatively
                civilized publishing atmosphere of the late 1840s, it
                did not take long for other editions of <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> to appear, each priced at $1. The first is
                advertised from the Cincinnati firm H.B. Pearson in
                1854, and the other is from the New York publisher,
                Bunnel and Price, available no later than 1854 (Tidball
                7; Vose 124). In addition, the German firm Tauchnitz
                did not adhere to what it regarded as an American
                practical agreement, even though Tauchnitz did publish
                its books in the United States. The three-volume
                Tauchnitz edition of <em>Vanity Fair</em> was
                advertised in the book industry trade paper of the day,
                <em>The Publisher&rsquo;s Circular and Weekly
                Gazette</em> in 1857 at 40 cents a volume, along with
                the works of Dickens and Bront&euml;
                (<em>Publisher&rsquo;s Circular</em> 27).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Harper&rsquo;s right to exclusive publication of
                <em>Vanity Fair</em> was not maintained, and yet
                Harper&rsquo;s market share of the reprint business was
                high and, despite the presence of two or more small
                competitors, it is apparent that Harper itself did a
                brisk business in printing and reprinting <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> throughout the 1850s, including multiple
                printings dated 1848, 1857, and 1860 (<em>Union
                Catalog</em> 512-3). This does <em>not</em> mean that
                Harper only issued the novel in these years. Rather, it
                means Harper issued the novel with a new title page in
                these years, reusing the initial printing&rsquo;s 1848
                title-page plate in subsequent printings for reissue
                through 1857. It is impossible to say, therefore, how
                many times Harper published <em>Vanity Fair</em> during
                these years. <em>Vanity Fair</em> was issued again and
                again by Harper over the course of the 1850s but
                because the general dating practices of the period are
                inconsistent, finding a complete count of either
                various publishers&rsquo; editions or Harper copies of
                <em>Vanity Fair</em> is not possible.</p>

                <p>In the absence of absolute numbers, reconstructing
                <em>Vanity Fair&rsquo;s</em> rank in the marketplace
                argues for a brief analysis of that marketplace during
                this period as well as an assessment of the
                novel&rsquo;s critical and cultural impact in print.
                The novel&rsquo;s sales in the United States arose in
                no small part out of American readers&rsquo; long
                dependence on British fiction, which in turn was in
                part a result of market conditions.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Thackeray, whose fame as a novelist was made on both
                sides of the Atlantic by <em>Vanity Fair</em>, did not
                simply achieve fleeting recognition but became an
                important cultural referent in a nation preoccupied
                with propriety, sincerity, and the moral dangers
                exemplified by Bunyan&rsquo;s and Thackeray&rsquo;s
                <em>Vanity Fair</em>. High rates of literacy in the
                United States compared to England helped to create a
                healthy publishing industry that was largely dependent
                on reprinting British books. As I have argued, this
                fact forms the foundation of debates over the passage
                of an international copyright law, with laborers&rsquo;
                concerns, and concerns about sustaining the industry
                from top to bottom, providing the most consistent and
                compelling reasons for opposing passage of what might
                seem (and certainly seemed to Dickens) to be a just and
                fair law. But Thackeray and Dickens both benefited
                enormously from the reprinting of their books in the
                United States: they were paid for advance sheets,
                rights to serial reproduction, and later their American
                tours were money-making ventures.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As might be expected of such a widely read work,
                <em>Vanity Fair</em> was frequently referenced and
                reviewed, but it was given decidedly mixed notices from
                critics. Not only was the novel noted in short and long
                reviews when first published, it was discussed again
                and again as critics surveyed Thackeray&rsquo;s work as
                a whole during his lecture tours and compared it with
                his subsequent novels, including <em>Pendennis</em>,
                <em>The Virginians</em>, and <em>The Newcomes</em>
                (Flamm 56-9). These often contradictory reviews
                document the novel&rsquo;s visibility and presence in
                the American market, which I will discuss at greater
                length below, and they provide an opening into the
                values and priorities of the era&rsquo;s reviewers.
                While these values are certainly not identical to
                readers&rsquo; values, some correspondence can be
                claimed where dominant themes can be recognized and
                shown to be widely shared. I want to underline two
                points: first, the emphasis on and appreciation of
                "realism" and second, the predominant interest in the
                morality or immorality of Becky Sharp and her perceived
                effect on readers.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>These two points may seem disparate, but they are in
                fact linked by the still somewhat tenuous positioning
                of novels in the culture. Because morality is
                frequently characterized by critics and commentators as
                an intrinsic quality of a text that cannot be separated
                from that text&rsquo;s social effects, these effects
                are perceived as ineffective in the absence of
                "realism." What I mean by this is what must be called
                "literary" standards cannot be separated from moral
                judgment. Given the still-contingent status of novels
                as a legitimate form of culture, their perceived role
                in shaping female morality and decorum, the positive
                social effects of novel reading were linked to certain
                standards of verisimilitude and were not seen to occur
                at all in overwrought, implausible, or absurd
                narratives. Realism, then, was cause for praise, as a
                reviewer notes in an article titled "Novels of the
                Season" in <em>The North American Review</em> (October
                1848):</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Of all the novels on our list, <em>Vanity Fair</em>
                  is the only one in which the author is content to
                  represent actual life. His page swarms with
                  personages whom we recognize at once as genuine. It
                  is also noticeable, that Thackeray alone preserves
                  himself from the illusions of misanthropy or
                  sentimentality, and though dealing with a host of
                  selfish and malicious characters, his book leaves no
                  impression that the world is past praying for.
                  (<em>North Amercan Review</em> 369)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>In this formulation, morality and authenticity are
                central to the literary&mdash;both insofar as the
                entwined registers of its "use" for readers are
                concerned as well as insofar as its more general
                "value" for the culture is concerned. <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> is understood to be more morally and socially
                useful than the other novel under review because it
                accurately represents characters and situations from
                life, presumably making it possible for readers to
                glean useful lessons from the text. As <em>The North
                American Review&rsquo;s</em> critic notes, the realism
                is accomplished without "misanthropy" or
                "sentimentality"&mdash;each a form of "illusion" that
                distorts reality.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The acceptance of Becky Sharp as a literary
                character, and the widespread admiration of her in the
                American press, is based in large part on
                reviewers&rsquo; perceptions of her as a true or
                accurate type; as George Curtis writes in a lengthy
                discussion of <em>Vanity Fair</em> in his 1853 <em>The
                Potiphar Papers</em>, "'to hold a mirror up to
                Nature,&rsquo; is still the most potent method of
                shaming sin and strengthening virtue" (Curtis 12).
                Becky is not only appreciated for being true to a real
                type of scheming female, but more importantly, her
                whole persona is based on a certain kind of raw
                authenticity that is esteemed for its truth value. As
                the writer of <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> "Easy Chair"
                writes: "The 'ideal,' in the sense usually intended by
                the word, is as foolish and unnatural in literature as
                it is in art. The sharp-sighted and pure-minded artists
                have long ago seen that the utmost reach of art is the
                most rigorous obedience to nature."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Linking this laudable "obedience to nature" to
                Becky, he proceeds to defend Thackeray against "many of
                the gentle sex who have hitherto refused allegiance to
                him on the ground that all his women were either fools
                or knaves." As he writes of Becky, underlining her sins
                and bad character as evidence of Thackeray&rsquo;s
                affection for truly virtuous women: "no man could draw
                Becky Sharp so dexterously who did not most exquisitely
                conceive and reverence the opposite of that character"
                (<em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> 840). Referring to
                Thackeray&rsquo;s novel as "the best we have ever seen
                from his pen," the reviewer for <em>The
                Knickerbocker</em> (September 1848) writes a bit more
                equivocally in a six page review:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  One of the best drawn characters is that of REBECCA,
                  the scheming governess; sly, cunning, clever,
                  unprincipled, and a thorough 'woman of the
                  world,&rsquo; in the worst acceptation of the term.
                  Her career forms an admirable lesson, but we cannot
                  even indicate it. (<em>Knickerbocker</em> 249)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Here, <em>The Knickerbocker&rsquo;s</em> critic
                playfully teases the reader with the problem of the
                "admirable lesson" Becky indicates, while the
                <em>Democratic Review</em>, in October 1848, gamely
                embraces her and her wickedness, while noting that the
                story is told "with the most marvelous richness of
                lively detail, elegant phrases and humorous situation.
                . . Clever, keen, pliant little 'Becky.&rsquo; What
                though she is heartless, selfish, designing,
                intriguing; we love her because she is talented,
                energetic,&mdash;and successful" <em>(Democratic
                Review</em> 379, 378). In a dissenting view, the critic
                for <em>The Christian Examiner</em> intoned that "no
                modern writer had done more to strip the very name of
                woman all associations of moral beauty" than Thackeray
                in <em>Vanity Fair</em> (Baym 105).</p>

                <p>For the most part reviewers responded not with
                outrage or revulsion to <em>Vanity Fair</em>, but with
                appreciation of the spirit and even of the cynical but
                successful knavery of Thackeray&rsquo;s character. The
                emphasis was frequently on Becky&rsquo;s success and
                her wily manipulation of the characters and situations
                in which she finds herself. Nor did the novel surprise
                or offend these critics&rsquo; sensibilities (with the
                one exception) as might be expected in an era, the
                literary history of which is often characterized as
                wholly dominated by gentle and sentimental American
                domestic fiction. The writer for <em>North American
                Review</em> (1848) applauds Thackeray&rsquo;s
                willingness and ability to represent the breadth of
                humanity, good and bad, while referring to Becky as
                "the finest character in the whole novel. . . an
                original personage, worthy to be called the
                author&rsquo;s own, and as true to life as hypocrisy,
                ability, and cunning can make her. . . the very
                impersonation of talent, tact, and worldliness, and one
                who works her way with a graceful and effective
                impudence unparalleled among managing women" ("Novels"
                369). That Becky Sharp did not offend, and was widely
                admired for her wicked success, must be seen in the
                context of a more accurate representation of the
                literary marketplace; one flooded not only with the
                sensation fiction Reynolds has so carefully documented
                but also with reprints of British novels that were seen
                as far more damaging to readers&rsquo; morals than was
                Thackeray&rsquo;s ultimately moral purpose in
                <em>Vanity Fair</em>. The writer for <em>The North
                American Review</em>, in fact, singles out <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> as an admirable work (not only socially or
                morally, but in literary terms as well) from among
                eight other British reprints reviewed in the same
                article, including the Bront&euml;s&rsquo; <em><em>Jane
                Eyre</em></em>, <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, and <em>The
                Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em>, Lady Georgiana
                Fullerton&rsquo;s <em>Grantley Manor</em>, Edward
                Lytton Bulwer&rsquo;s <em>Harold, the Last of the
                Saxton Kings</em>, and <em>Hawkstone</em>. While these
                novels are by no means outrageous in the vein of Eugene
                Sue or the early Bulwer, some of them stretched the
                boundaries of propriety, as well as reality, in ways
                that were objectionable to some reviewers, with
                <em>Wuthering Heights</em> being the greatest offender
                in this group ("Novels" 354-69).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Thackeray&rsquo;s representation of Becky and her
                treachery is quite tame in comparison with either the
                sensation fiction that purported to reform readers with
                the demonstrated misdeeds of characters caught up in
                nefarious vices. <em>Vanity Fair</em>, while containing
                a representation of a morally repugnant character who
                engages in some fairly explicit sexual misdeeds, did
                not stand out&mdash;or rather, the representation of
                Becky stood out as an example of well-developed
                character in a novel with an ultimately moral purpose.
                Thackeray&rsquo;s satire was generally recognized for
                what it was. As Frederick Cozzens writes in his book of
                social and literary criticism, <em>Prismatics</em>, in
                1853: "Mr. Thackeray is one of the most genial and
                amiable of men. But however brilliant his wit, it has
                no warm, sunny side. He succeeds in creating very
                detestable people in his novels, for whom one does not
                feel the least sympathy. The satire, however, is
                perfect" (232). Taking this understanding of
                Thackeray&rsquo;s purpose, and parsing the definition
                of satire is Curtis, the author of <em>The Potiphar
                Papers</em>, who writes:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  It is called a satire, but after much diligent
                  reading, we cannot discover the satire. A state of
                  society not at all superior to that of <em>Vanity
                  Fair</em> is not unknown to our experience; and,
                  unless scalding tears of sorrow, and the bitter
                  regret of a manly mind over the miserable spectacle
                  of artificiality, wasted powers, misdirected
                  energies, and lost opportunities, be satirical; we do
                  not find satire in that sad story. (11)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Like this critic, many understood <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> and its representation of the foibles of
                "society" as truth. While the greater truth of these
                depictions only strengthens the satire, rather than
                eliding it with sadness, the point remains that the
                novel&rsquo;s moral purpose, recognized by many and
                exemplified by Charlotte Bront&euml; as she dedicated
                the second edition of <em><em>Jane Eyre</em></em> to
                Thackeray and his role as "the first social regenerator
                of the day"&mdash; a role recognized by many Americans
                as well (36).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><em>Vanity Fair&rsquo;s</em> reviews appeared in
                publications that are best identified as part of the
                general press and not as exclusively "lady&rsquo;s"
                journals. These publications also reviewed the American
                women&rsquo;s domestic fiction of the period, including
                <em>The Wide, Wide, World</em>, <em><em>The
                Lamplighter</em></em>, and <em><em>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s
                Cabin</em></em>. <em>Vanity Fair</em> did not, in other
                words, enter the American market in isolation&mdash;it
                was judged side by side with American women&rsquo;s
                domestic fiction, and in a market flooded with
                sensation novels. Nor was it ignored or overlooked in
                the predominantly feminine presses, including <em>The
                Southern Literary Messenger</em>, <em>Godey&rsquo;s
                Lady&rsquo;s Book</em>, and the <em>Literary
                World</em>, all of which also commonly reviewed and ran
                advertisements for American domestic fiction alongside
                those for British reprints.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>While many of these reviews lack critical
                analysis&mdash;they are composed in large part
                according to conventions of the genre, of long excerpts
                from the novel under review&mdash;they situate these
                novels in a particular market; when <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> was reviewed or noted by <em>The
                Knickerbocker</em>, <em>The Democratic Review</em> or
                <em>Godey&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo;s Book</em> and other
                popular American originals were reviewed there as well
                (as they were), we can place them in the same, or at
                least in a very similar, literary culture, made up of
                texts, publishers, books, and readers. While I do not
                intend to reconstruct a general body of readers, or
                their reception of <em>Vanity Fair</em> beyond the
                select and certainly non-representative response of a
                few, predominantly northeastern reviewers, I do want to
                emphasize the significance of the fact that British
                reprints, including <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em><em>David
                Copperfield</em></em>, and <em><em>Jane Eyre</em></em>,
                existed alongside American domestic fiction and were
                very much a part of the same, fluid literary market.
                This means they were read by the same class of readers
                that other critics including Nina Baym, Lora Romero,
                Jane Tompkins, and Anne Douglas (to name a few of the
                first to do so) have established as the primary
                consumers of American sentimental fiction&mdash;white,
                middle- and upper-class females, as well as by the men
                that made up the presumed market for sensational
                fiction. That is, these novels were reviewed and
                discussed in the same magazines and newspapers, they
                were published and sold alongside one another, and
                while British reprints were often less expensive than
                American originals, the advertisements for them, their
                binding, and the quality and quantity of illustration
                were comparable. Some critics have argued that the
                sensation literature of the 1850s, the precursor to the
                dime novel of the 1860s, was in fact the true popular
                literature of the day and that the above sentimental
                literature was genteel female reading, but I want to
                argue that the boundary between these genres and forms
                had not yet solidified by the 1850s. As the review
                history indicates, British fiction, as far as the press
                was concerned, was comparable to so-called "sensation"
                and "sentimental" fiction&mdash;none of which existed
                in its own market.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>By establishing <em>Vanity Fair&rsquo;s</em> full
                participation in the literary market and culture of the
                period I do not mean to imply that it was welcomed by
                all segments of that culture, nor that there was one
                unified literary culture at the time. The point I want
                to make is that the borders between "genteel"
                women&rsquo;s fiction, British reprints that fit into
                this category, those that didn&rsquo;t, and American
                originals not fit for "ladies," were constantly
                shifting. These borders help to identify how British
                reprints have for so long been overlooked in American
                literary history, and in particular in the history of
                women&rsquo;s fiction during this period. For it has
                been primarily through the study of women&rsquo;s
                nationally identified literary <em>production</em> that
                critics have approached the popular fiction of this
                period. In doing so, most critics have demarcated a
                fairly rigid boundary around the texts that
                <em>women</em> who were writing or living in the United
                States produced, thereby creating a category of fiction
                based on a specific kind of gendered, geographically
                specific production. This category is useful in many
                ways, but its limitations are revealed when this
                somewhat arbitrary category of producers and their
                goods become the object of the study of a group of
                nationally identified (presumed) gendered consumers.
                The once useful border around American gendered
                producers then becomes too circumscribed, as by its
                very definition it cannot accommodate fiction written
                by non-American women, even if this fiction is equally,
                if not more, important for the study of popular
                consumption.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>From this perspective of consumers in a busy and
                chaotic transatlantic print market, I want to use
                <em>Vanity Fair</em> to focus on the shifting debates
                over morality, realism and literary value and on the
                kinds of changes these values underwent over the course
                of the 1850s. In addition, I&rsquo;ll undertake a brief
                analysis of what was considered appropriate for
                antebellum American women to read and why, and begin to
                talk about the predominantly British novels around
                which debates over female reading circulated. How were
                these novels aligned and/or misaligned with American
                domestic/sentimental fiction&mdash;in other words, how
                do these novels change the way we view the literary
                history of the period?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The following passage underscores my point that it
                is impossible, or at least irresponsible, to comprehend
                female literary consumption in antebellum America
                without including British reprints in the discussion.
                Appearing in <em>Godey&rsquo;s</em> in 1847, just prior
                to the peak of consumption and production of American
                domestic fiction, the "Editor&rsquo;s Table" took up
                the question of "Courses for Reading for Ladies," with
                but three references to American authors. The remainder
                of the column is taken up by advice to women on the
                virtues and dangers of British novels:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Read all of Walter Scott&rsquo;s if you choose; and
                  [G.P.R.] James is as safe a friend as any
                  novel-loving young lady can find&mdash;none of his
                  novels need the <em>tabu</em>. . . . all the novels
                  by Mr. [Robert Plumer] Ward, and all by Charles
                  Dickens can be marked free. We wish we could say so
                  of all written by [Lytton] Bulwer and [Benjamin]
                  D&rsquo;Israli. In the perusal of these, a young lady
                  should consult her judicious friends. It is not wise
                  to give public prohibitions and yet there are cases
                  when the advice of a wise and delicate-minded friend
                  is of great advantage to a young lady in her reading.
                  (213)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Five short years later, in marked contrast to its
                enthusiastic endorsement of fashionable historical
                romances above, <em>Godey&rsquo;s</em> complained of
                literature that is "chiefly framed for amusement."
                Turning from the seeming innocence of romance to
                fiction demonstrating a higher social and intellectual
                utility, as well as a greater correspondence to
                reality, in 1853 both <em>Godey&rsquo;s</em> and
                <em>The North American Review</em> exhorted their
                readers to more serious purpose in their reading. As
                the writer for <em>Godey&rsquo;s</em> put it, "let the
                fervor of intellectual pursuits be encouraged; but it
                should be after knowledge, not excitement." Referring
                to the staples of polite American female reading,
                including Scott, Radcliffe, Burney, and Edgeworth, an
                essayist for <em>The North American Review</em> writes
                that "novels were not then supposed to express the
                spirit of the age. Their aim was to please the reader.
                . . The romance proper dealt only with an ideal" (105).
                He goes on to demand that readers strive toward a more
                elevated purpose in their reading, using Austen and
                Bulwer as examples of frivolous goods, emphasizing
                their lack of social and moral usefulness:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  We laugh at the foibles or frown at meanness; perhaps
                  resolve to beware of the one and the other. So far,
                  well enough. But what is our feeling of the social
                  world thus exhibited? Is our love of kind increased?
                  Are the Christian desire and duty of remedying the
                  ills we see quickened by these pictures of prevalent
                  heartlessness and folly? (108)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>These critics, in attempting to outline appropriate
                reading for women in an age steeped in Christian
                evangelical reform and an explosion of print that often
                did not suit the period&rsquo;s moralistic impulses,
                are addressing the period&rsquo;s popular fiction and
                in doing so are almost exclusively discussing British
                reprints. In this context <em>Vanity Fair</em> was seen
                as a useful form of social satire with an ultimately
                moral purpose in keeping with emergent American values

                <p>The perceived moral purpose of novels was central to
                shaping the emerging hierarchies defining various
                fictional genres. And yet, as Reynolds argues, "the gap
                between doctrinal social texts and entertaining
                imaginative texts" narrowed during this period, with
                the result that fluidity between genres was markedly
                increased as the social purpose infiltrating many
                novels became harder to distinguish from sermons or
                religious tracts. Thus, what Reynolds refers to as
                "sacrosanct themes" became a crucial element in
                fiction, while at the same time, those themes were
                invoked in a newly stylized version that called on "the
                mimetic, earthly world of literary realism" (16). Thus
                the emergent ideals of a more literary style combined,
                in the American context, with the demand for a more
                sophisticated morality underwritten by a "more serious
                purpose." That is, expectations for both the purpose or
                function of fiction as well as the style and devices
                used to accomplish that aim changed, becoming at once
                more "literary" and more didactic.</p>

              <li>
                <p><em>Vanity Fair</em> was widely understood in the
                Anglo-American press to be both a moral and literary
                accomplishment, with reviewers referring to
                Thackeray&rsquo;s "entire freedom from mannerism and
                affectation both in style and sentiment. . . His
                effects are uniformly the effects of sound wholesome,
                legitimate art; and we hardly need add that we are
                never harrowed up with the physical horrors of the
                Eugene Sue school in his writings, or that there are no
                melodramatic villains to be found in them"
                ("Thackeray&rsquo;s Writings" 272). This admiration of
                the "art" of Thackeray&rsquo;s work and what might be
                termed its genteel simplicity was repeated in many of
                the reviews. Often compared to Dickens and his level of
                "pathos," appraisals of both authors were continually
                caught up in addressing the morality of the
                authors&rsquo; stories, their views on human nature,
                and the ultimate effect of these tendencies on the
                reader&mdash;that is, the "lesson" their texts offer.
                The judgment of the moral value of a text was taken
                quite seriously, with a complex understanding of
                readers as serious consumers of narrative not taken in
                by, or more importantly, not affected by, artificiality
                either in prose, plot or character. As a reviewer
                writes in October 1856 in <em>The North American
                Review</em>:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Because the moral of a book is not written out in a
                  few pithy words on the last page, it does not follow
                  that the book has no moral. No faithful transcript of
                  human life and human passion can be clearly and
                  powerfully exhibited, without, of necessity,
                  containing a deep and searching moral, all the more
                  forcible to the thinking man because it is subtle and
                  beneath the surface. Is not Thackeray&rsquo;s
                  <em>Vanity Fair</em> a sermon of the most stringent
                  application? Its author holds a mirror to our hearts,
                  which reveals to each of us many a spring of action
                  that we blush for, many a littleness and weakness,
                  with much of worldliness and vanity, which we have
                  never before been forced fairly to acknowledge, even
                  to ourselves. We lay down the book, confessing, in
                  spite of ourselves, that it is a faithful likeness of
                  a large part of our human nature and this confession
                  is followed by a pang that is not always useless. . .
                  . Much self-knowledge may be attained, much healthful
                  humility promoted, by having, as it were, the picture
                  of our own hearts set forth before our astonished
                  eyes, touched by the hand of a skillful and fearless
                  master. ("Chapter" 349)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p><em>Vanity Fair</em> is admired not only for the
                moral lesson it offers, but also for the subtlety with
                which that lesson is imparted, and for the forcefulness
                of it, the result of the "faithful likeness" or the
                realism with which the "skillful and fearless master"
                sets the lessons forth. This suggests that the emerging
                divide between old and new was not parsed so much in
                terms of sentimentality and realism; rather, the divide
                is expressed on the one hand as a division between
                texts that followed dated narrative formulas and those
                that were able to move into a more sophisticated and
                character-driven expression of the novel&rsquo;s
                purpose; on the other hand, it is a divide between pure
                "amusement" and the purposeful, yet sophisticated,
                moral didacticism of the 1850s. As the same reviewer
                writes in <em>The North American Review</em>:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The modern novel differs from the old-fashioned one
                  in so many points, that hardly any similarity
                  remains, save that which is implied and necessitated
                  by the realm to which they appertain, and the
                  allegiance which both owe to the imaginative faculty
                  of their creators. They differ, not only in choice
                  and arrangement of materials and agencies, but their
                  motive powers are totally unlike. The successful
                  novel of the present day is strictly a work of art,
                  amenable to all the laws of art. . . Artistic beauty
                  of style must accompany the creation, development,
                  and completion of the plot. Harmonious and dignified
                  expression must follow powerful conception in the
                  romance that would win and retain a strong hold upon
                  the public taste. ("Chapter" 348)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Comparing these works to the "days when Richardson,
                Mrs. Radcliffe, and Miss Burney wrote romances which
                set the literary coteries of England in a blaze," the
                writer notes the "conventional ingredients" these
                novelists relied upon for their fiction but which have
                been supplanted by "the element of conversation. . . to
                allow the characters to unfold their individuality
                through the medium of their own expression." This
                aesthetic of the literary (identified as a less
                conventional telling of a story and by the absence of
                stock incidents, "startling events," "accidents and
                surprises," and "secrets and discoveries") is an
                essential element in "good" fiction, and yet fiction of
                all kinds is still positioned very much as an
                instrument of moral and intellectual improvement. He
                goes on to argue that, "The high requirements which
                criticism has lately made, have placed the novel on an
                elevated grade, not only as a composition, but as an
                assistant in mental and moral culture" ("Chapter"
                342).</p>

              <li>
                <p>A lengthy essay on <em>Vanity Fair</em> in <em>The
                American Whig Review</em> (October 1848) addresses
                realism and morality in a way that brings us, perhaps
                surprisingly, to the connection between women, books,
                morality and maternity, a set of terms crucial to both
                domesticity and sentimentality, and one around which my
                argument will frequently circulate. The reviewer,
                having discussed Balzac&rsquo;s characters, writes that
                "this mention of Balzac brings to mind a more serious
                charge. . . more than once heard" against Thackeray:
                "namely, that his sketches contain too many
                disagreeable characters." The reviewer then
                acknowledges: "a queer charge this to come from a
                reading generation which swallows copious illustrated
                editions of <em>Les Myst&egrave;res</em> and <em>Le
                Juif</em>, and is lenient to the loathsome vulgarities
                of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> and <em>Wildfell
                Hall</em> [<em>sic</em>]." The critic then goes on to
                defend Thackeray&rsquo;s use of such "scamps,
                profligates, and hypocrites;" these characters, the
                reviewer claims, are introduced "to show them up and
                put us on our guard against them. . . we hate them, and
                he hates them too. And if he ever does bestow
                attractive traits on his rogues, it is to expose the
                worthlessness and emptiness of some things which are to
                the world attractive&mdash;to show that the good things
                of <em>Vanity Fair</em> are not good per se, but may be
                coincident with much depravity" (<em>American Whig
                Review</em> 422-3). In other words, the complexity of
                Thackeray&rsquo;s text works to subtly and more
                effectively convey the novel&rsquo;s moral content. The
                assumption is that readers, particularly female
                readers, will identify with the text. This is the mode
                of reading I have identified with Dickens and which is
                linked to domesticity and its ideological shaping of
                gender insofar as women were assumed to have greater
                capacity for empathy and thus tended to be more
                influenced by their reading. The very qualities that
                made women maternal by nature also made them, by
                nature, more vulnerable and deeply invested consumers
                of fiction.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As Kate Flint argues, in the Victorian era
                "maternity was no longer regarded, in relation to
                women&rsquo;s reading, simply as a function which
                ensured close social guiding of one&rsquo;s offspring."
                Rather, she argues, it was "the ability to venture with
                sympathetic identification into the lives of others"
                that guaranteed "women&rsquo;s susceptibility to
                identifactory modes of reading" (31). This, of course,
                was constructed as a "natural" result of the female
                physiological makeup, including the reproductive
                capacity and the female brain. In turn, the deep
                identification with the text necessary to its
                "influence" is dependent upon a certain degree of
                realism to be effective. Thus one of the most
                influential books of the decade, <em>The Wide, Wide
                World</em>, was admired for its realism, a fact that
                may surprise many readers of the novel insofar as
                realism is generally posed in opposition to
                sentimentality. Warner&rsquo;s novel was viewed by many
                critics as both artful (with well-developed characters,
                scenes and plot) and at the same time true to its moral
                and religious purpose, neither of which were seen to be
                in conflict. The novel&rsquo;s status as the
                sentimental novel <em>par excellence</em> in the
                literary history of the period is a categorical
                position imposed on the novel <em>later</em> and not
                one that the novel occupied during the 1850s.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>To position Warner&rsquo;s and Thackeray&rsquo;s
                novels in a literary market together, and to see them
                as sharing readers, we need not recast these texts nor
                create unbridgeable divides between them; rather, we
                must grant the readers of the period a measure of
                sophistication in terms of their literary tastes. We
                must also give credit to these readers&rsquo; ability
                to attain some distance and perspective on the tears
                and sentiment they consumed, based again on their
                consumption of a satirical novel like <em>Vanity
                Fair</em>. Beyond the superabundance of tears, there is
                very little in common between Thackeray&rsquo;s Amelia
                Sedley and Warner&rsquo;s Ellen Montgomery, much less
                between his Becky and her Ellen; the books, however,
                have a serious didactic purpose (although not the same
                purpose) and each carries out its mission with prose
                that is attentive to the representation of the "real"
                in the interests of social and moral improvement. And
                while Thackeray&rsquo;s parody engages the perfect
                heroines of old, including those idols of perfection so
                popularized in England and America by Scott and Cooper,
                Warner&rsquo;s certainly owes a great deal to their
                sisters, the searching paragons of moral and social
                perfection exemplified in the novels of Burney and
                Edgeworth.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The overwhelming popularity of <em>Vanity Fair</em>,
                <em>The Wide, Wide World</em>, <em>David
                Copperfield</em>, <em>Jane Eyre</em>, and <em>The
                Lamplighter</em> all provide opportunities to perceive
                the way the taste for popular literature moved toward a
                mode of purposeful reform (an exhortation applied to
                both writers and readers) in the 1850s, while at the
                same time becoming more sophisticated and less
                formulaic in style, plot, and character. To pursue this
                point further, Becky Sharp and her relation to
                domesticity and self-improvement provides some insight
                into the values underlying the shift that the reviewers
                above identify. I will situate <em>Vanity Fair</em>,
                with its ambiguous "heroine," as a text that throws
                into relief many of the cultural and social imperatives
                exemplified by female protagonists as represented by
                Warner in <em>The Wide, Wide World</em> and by Maria
                Cummins in her 1854 novel <em>The
                Lamplighter</em>&mdash;two novels that, aside from
                Stowe&rsquo;s <em>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</em> and
                Bront&euml;&rsquo;s <em>Jane Eyre</em>, were the most
                popular novels of the decade.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><em>Vanity Fair</em> is a moral book because it is a
                successful satire; indeed, it could scarcely be read
                any other way given how often the novel&rsquo;s
                narrator tips his hand and laughs at the pretensions
                and conventions of the "sentimental" and "ever so
                stupid" novels he parodies. As the reviewer for <em>The
                United States Democratic Review</em> writes in October
                1848: "<em>Vanity Fair</em> is the world, and through
                its booths and busy places of pleasure and sorrow, the
                author leads the reader with Sentiment on one arm and
                Satire on the other." As this comment suggests, the
                American press had no trouble joining Thackeray&rsquo;s
                reverie, since the kinds of novels he mocks had long
                been staples of American reading and are included in a
                long list of British fiction read in the United States.
                Included in these perennial Anglo-American favorites
                are in fact many of the novels that polite society and
                genteel lady&rsquo;s magazines had long recommended
                women and girls read, including Edgeworth&rsquo;s
                <em>Belinda</em>, Fanny Burney&rsquo;s
                <em>Evelina</em>, Jane Austen&rsquo;s novels, and the
                works of Susan Ferrier. American domestic fiction, of
                course, also owes a great deal to these novels insofar
                as they established the "sentimental" genre as the
                female coming-of-age tale, a legacy that shaped both
                writers&rsquo; and readers&rsquo; expectations of the
                novel as a form meant, at least in part, for amusement.
                While the American works distinguish themselves in many
                ways in their treatment of race and class, they share a
                preoccupation with the British model in their treatment
                of emotion and intellect (or sense and sensibility)
                that is expressed through the representation of the
                female protagonists as sensitive, highly passionate and
                in need of training in the arts of self-control and
                reason. This is, of course, the novel&rsquo;s British
                inheritance dating back at least to Richardson&rsquo;s
                <em>Pamela</em>, the history of which is discussed
                fully by Nancy Armstrong and Kate Flint in their
                respective histories of the novel and of reading in
                Britain.</p>

                <p>Thackeray is not immune to the legacy of this
                formula, and yet he cunningly situates his text in such
                a way that it fits neatly into, while retaining some
                distance from, its narrative demands. From
                Amelia&rsquo;s sweetness, tears, and generosity
                (however mocked) to Becky&rsquo;s status as a penniless
                orphan, from the narrative structure that ultimately
                leads to its logical end (the marriage of Amelia and
                Major Dobbin, and Becky&rsquo;s second marriage) to the
                novel&rsquo;s perverse preoccupation with Becky&rsquo;s
                natural instincts, Thackeray retains many of the shared
                conventions of the sentimental novel while at the same
                time explicitly undermining them through the narrative
                voice. Most notably, Becky is not improved, nor does
                she wish to be. She openly engages in behavior that
                would make her repugnant according to any measure of
                idealized femininity of the period, which valued
                purity, benevolence and emotional self-control above
                all. Thackeray does not shy away from making a mockery
                of these traits in Becky, just as he does not hesitate
                to represent Amelia as a bald caricature of the insipid
                sentimental heroine. As an 1848 reviewer in <em>The
                Living Age</em> writes, one of Thackeray&rsquo;s women
                "is without a heart, the other is without a head"
                (413). Another critic, writing the same year for
                <em>The Democratic Review</em>, sees this tension
                between sentiment and satire in "these two women of
                opposite disposition" as the "woof and web of the
                story; all the rest is only nap, but nap of a most
                excellent quality" (378).</p>

              <li>
                <p>Because Thackeray deploys the staples of
                sentimentality so self-consciously, <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> is useful in reframing American domestic
                fiction and its complex situation in a mixed and
                chaotic print culture. In turn, the text provides
                insight into the preoccupation with purposeful and not
                merely frivolous novel reading by revealing how
                knowledge and sentimentality are entwined in the
                popular fiction of the period. By placing <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> in the body of American domestic fiction, we
                disrupt the isolation many critics have depended on in
                viewing American fiction as a self-enclosed universe,
                one that was either reflective of, or posed in
                opposition to, the real lives, work, and thoughts of
                American female readers. As Jane Tompkins famously
                argues, "the tears and prayers of sentimental heroines"
                were compelling to readers "not because they
                didn&rsquo;t know what good fiction was, nor because
                their notions about human life were naive and
                superficial, but because the 'order of things&rsquo; to
                which both readers and fictions belonged was itself
                structured by such narratives." While Tompkins is
                certainly correct in postulating a mid-century culture
                permeated by the reform movement and religious piety, I
                think it is a mistake to view the fiction itself or its
                readers as existing in such a vacuum. The popularity of
                <em>Vanity Fair</em> undermines the kind of
                naivet&eacute; Tompkins&rsquo;s claim depends on; it
                suggests that the need to understand the readers of
                domestic fiction as sophisticated consumers of a
                diverse array of narrative styles with varying didactic
                purposes.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As Reynolds and others have demonstrated, the reform
                impulse was expressed not only as sentimentality, but
                also as sensation. <em>Vanity Fair</em> bridges these
                two seemingly opposed modes of expression, or genres.
                By exploiting the period&rsquo;s sentimental novels in
                a way that suggests a far more complex "order of
                things" than Tompkins would have, <em>Vanity Fair</em>
                may be seen as at once sentimental and sensational. And
                while <em>The Wide, Wide World</em> certainly fits the
                conventional notion of reform writing insofar as it
                shows the path to goodness through examples of the
                heroine&rsquo;s internal mastery of self and soul, not
                all so-called sentimental writing did so. <em>Uncle
                Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</em>, and the writing of E.D.E.N.
                Southworth and Charles Dickens, to name just three
                examples, frequently fall into the sentimental and the
                subversive genres, showing the consequences of various
                vices in graphic and sensational language, while at the
                same time enacting maudlin scenes replete with tears.
                This implicates the reader in scenes of sympathy in a
                particularly intimate manner. Tompkins states that she
                does not view these readers as being "naive"&mdash;that
                the "order of things" was structured by "real" and
                fictional narratives that reinforced a sentimental
                world-view. I want to argue that by reading into the
                period&rsquo;s domestic fiction the satirical narrative
                <em>Vanity Fair</em> offers, the solidity of this order
                and the narratives that comprised it are both
                compromised and revealed to be working in unison with
                an assumption central to readers of <em>Vanity
                Fair</em>: cynicism. American popular novels (many of
                them "sentimental") must be viewed through a far more
                knowing, self-conscious lens than has been assumed as
                the cynicism of <em>Vanity Fair</em>&rsquo;s narrator
                exposes some of the more vulnerable lines beneath the
                seemingly enclosed body of American domestic fiction.
                Becky&rsquo;s character inverts many of the most
                essential qualities of the female protagonist, while
                reinforcing the centrality of class and market
                relations as determining factors in the
                protagonist&rsquo;s destiny. A deeply invested mode of
                reading is elicited by these texts, but the depth and
                emotion involved in this mode does not make it
                unknowing or innocent.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>I want to focus now on Becky&rsquo;s temper and her
                mis/management of it as something that forcefully
                distinguishes <em>Vanity Fair</em> from its British and
                American competitors including <em>David
                Copperfield</em>, <em>The Wide, Wide World</em>,
                <em>The Lamplighter</em>, <em>Jane Eyre</em>, and other
                British and American popular novels. These are all
                novels preoccupied with learning and, most centrally,
                with learning to control the passions through the use
                of books&mdash;or through the practices of writing, and
                reading. Becky&rsquo;s rejection of this model of
                self-improvement helps to reframe the narrative
                boundaries defining Anglo-American popular novels of
                the period. Through her refusal to tame either her
                passionate nature or her own self-interest Becky
                remains, throughout the novel, un-domesticated. As Amy
                Kaplan notes, we should think of "domesticity not as a
                static condition but as the process of domestication,
                which entails conquering and taming the wild, the
                natural, and the alien." <em>Vanity Fair</em> suggests
                that domestication fails Becky, that she is irrevocably
                "wild, natural, and alien"&mdash;"this rebel, this
                monster, this serpent, this firebrand" is never tame
                (52). Unlike <em>David Copperfield</em>, she cannot put
                aside the self-interest born of her early poverty.
                <em>Vanity Fair</em> not only takes place outside of
                the domestic in the sense that the novel does not
                locate its emotional center in or around a particular
                house, but its main character explicitly rejects the
                self-improvement necessary to domestication, a
                resistance that places Becky, as a white woman in
                genteel society, in a somewhat ambiguous relation to
                her gender.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Becky&rsquo;s resistance to domestication begins in
                the novel&rsquo;s opening scene, when we see how very
                mistaken "honest," "good natured" Jemima is when she
                slips a copy of the revered <em>Johnson&rsquo;s
                Dictionary</em> to Becky upon her departure from Miss
                Pinkerton&rsquo;s School, certain that Miss Becky "will
                be miserable if she don&rsquo;t get one" (41). Not only
                does Becky not value the book, she is repelled by it,
                and in fine comic fashion, "just as the coach drove
                off, Miss Sharp put her face out of the window, and
                actually flung the book back into the garden" (45). It
                is not only her rejection of <em>a</em> book, but of
                <em>this</em> book in particular, which in 1830s and
                1840s England was a proud testament to the power of
                words and to the knowledge necessary to their proper
                use. Becky doesn&rsquo;t want that knowledge, and she
                violently rejects the civilizing strictures&mdash;pomp,
                pity, and education&mdash;it represents. As Becky
                states bluntly to Amelia, "Revenge may be wicked, but
                it&rsquo;s natural"&mdash;and natural is precisely what
                Becky is and remains throughout the text (47). In
                sticking her face out the window, she exposes herself,
                barefaced as it were, not only to expose her act and
                its result, but to place her naked face there alongside
                the book as it flies through the air in a sort of open
                declaration of her brazen and unfeminine character.
                What is crucial about this scene is not that Becky
                would so rudely fling the book (she does much worse),
                nor that she is unrepentant about it. Becky&rsquo;s
                behavior is outrageous because the credo she announces
                never changes&mdash;she is content to be
                <em>natural</em>. She has no interest in or use for
                education nor, as I will argue, for moral or
                intellectual reform of any kind. She is to be taken as
                is, and no bonnet or head-scarf is called for to cover
                or to shield (herself or others) from her actions.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Becky&rsquo;s refusal of <em>Johnson&rsquo;s
                Dictionary</em> is a refusal that reverberates as she
                demonstrates that her natural instincts serve her
                self-interest very nicely. Having made use of Miss
                Pinkerton&rsquo;s school where she was "bound over as
                an articled pupil" because she could be "useful," and
                not to gain an education there, she is moved along when
                she becomes unmanageable and put to work as a
                governess, again, selling her skills in exchange for
                access to genteel society and, of course, money (49).
                Unlike the eminently improvable Amelia, or the anxious
                and ambitious type that includes Ellen of <em>The Wide,
                Wide World</em> and Gerty of <em>The Lamplighter</em>,
                Becky neither accepts nor needs instruction, except
                perhaps in the finer points of upper-class etiquette
                and speech&mdash;skills she gathers effortlessly: "that
                in a fortnight, and after three dinners in general
                society, this young woman had got up the genteel jargon
                so well, that a native could not speak it better; and
                it was only from her French being so good, that you
                could know she was not a born woman of fashion" (342).
                While Thackeray notes condescendingly that Becky "went
                through the little course of study which was considered
                necessary for ladies in those days," beyond this
                obligatory bit virtually all of what she knows is
                innately hers (51). The American heroines Ellen and
                Gerty, on the other hand, are desperate to learn and go
                to great lengths and make significant sacrifices of
                time and energy to learn, with French being just one
                example of the staple accomplishments the American
                novels take up, the same Thackeray mocks. As Ellen in
                <em>The Wide, Wide World</em> confesses, "I determined
                I would try to study myself. . . . French I can do
                nothing at all with, and that is what I wanted to learn
                most of all." Gerty, too, "conceived a strong desire to
                learn French," and proceeds to demonstrate "a wonderful
                determination for doing so." In contrast to the
                American heroines&rsquo;s commanding self-discipline
                and dutiful drive to learn French (not by accident a
                necessary accomplishment for a "lady" in genteel
                society), it is simply Becky&rsquo;s "mother-tongue."
                And while Becky does practice her music "incessantly"
                at Miss Pinkerton&rsquo;s, it is a labor which says
                more about the expression of her passionate nature than
                it does about her desire to improve her skills.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The representation of this proper feminine model,
                and its relevance to understanding how Becky&rsquo;s
                shocking "natural" behavior plays into this tradition,
                can best be viewed through one of the central
                conventions of the period&rsquo;s fiction&mdash;that of
                the motherless child. As the critic Carolyn Dever
                convincingly argues in <em>Death of the Mother</em>,
                the absence of the mother in Victorian fiction is a
                prerequisite for re/forming the <em>ideal</em> mother.
                In each of the novels I discuss, the protagonist is (at
                least initially) an orphan, a formulation which enables
                the ambiguity necessary to sustaining the ideal of a
                classless society (the orphans&rsquo; origins are never
                fully known, or are revealed at the end of the novel).
                With the notable exception of <em>Vanity Fair</em>, the
                void this absence creates is filled in each case with
                two linked substitutes, reading/books and the idealized
                maternal figure. The surrogate maternal characters,
                Emily in <em>The Lamplighter</em> and Alice in <em>The
                Wide, Wide World</em>, are themselves motherless, in
                effect doubling the effective absence and its
                representational possibilities. No better way could be
                contrived of representing the possibilities inherent in
                the threatened sacred feminine than through following
                the moral, intellectual and religious development of
                these lost children and their doubles. And while
                poverty and injustice are heaped upon the orphans, they
                are represented as spirited and capable in their
                struggle to master their passions. As Ellen confesses
                tearfully to Alice in one of their first meetings: "
                The worst is,&mdash;oh the worst is&mdash;that I
                meant&mdash;I meant to be a good child, and I have been
                I have been worse than ever I was in my life before. I
                have been passionate and cross, and bad feelings keep
                coming, and I know it&rsquo;s wrong, and it makes me
                miserable" (151). In turn, Gerty, of <em>The
                Lamplighter</em> confesses to her blind guide Emily on
                their first meeting (in a church, no less), "But I
                an&rsquo;t good...I&rsquo;m real bad!" (66). For, like
                Ellen, her passions "once excited...were always
                extreme" (148), although she badly wants to be "good."
                Through the representation of the good mother/orphan
                and her unfailing guidance of the passionate
                child/orphan (Emily and Gerty in <em>The
                Lamplighter</em>, Alice and Ellen in <em>The Wide, Wide
                World</em>) these novels repeat and reinforce the
                necessity and possibility of <em>learning</em> to be
                (domesticated) women. Of Becky we are told, "she never
                had been a girl; she had been a woman since she was
                eight years old," which means not just that she is
                knowledgeable about the world, but more importantly,
                that she is sexually compromised. Thackeray indicates
                as much with his shadowy description of her history
                with Mr. Crisp in Chapter Two, when he writes knowingly
                of her outlook in leaving school and embarking on a
                visit with Amelia&rsquo;s family that "in all events,
                if Rebecca was not beginning the world, she was
                beginning it over again" (49, 53).</p>

                guiding maternal ideal (Emily or Alice) is a great
                portion of the story the novel tells. As each learns to
                discipline her body and mind by decoding the necessary
                lessons for performing genteel womanly behavior, the
                reading these girls do and that their surrogate mothers
                give them access to is what fully transforms them. The
                paradox generated by the values circulating around
                sincere behavior and the learning of authenticity in
                antebellum American culture provides insight into the
                American novels&rsquo;s preoccupation with learning and
                reform as exemplified by these characters. The partial
                resolution of this paradox by mid-century enables us to
                better understand the central place the idealized
                heroine of <em>The Wide, Wide World</em> holds in
                American domestic fiction, and how her sentimentality
                can be understood without creating an inapproachable
                divide between Warner&rsquo;s novel (and others like
                it, including Cummins&rsquo;s) and other British
                reprints, including <em>Jane Eyre</em> and <em>Vanity
                Fair</em>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The standard version of this period&rsquo;s history
                is that the preoccupation with education that is
                characteristic of the age may in part be explained by
                social and economic change during the Jacksonian Era
                that eroded established means of identifying status,
                class and identity. As many historians have argued, in
                their absence a crisis of confidence arose, resulting
                in a flood of instructions for American men and women.
                "Conduct guides," whose purpose was to instruct
                Americans in how to behave&mdash;including how to
                dress, walk, mourn, worship, eat, and
                speak&mdash;flooded the market beginning in the 1830s
                and continued to appear in great numbers through the
                1850s. I quibble with this analysis only insofar as
                conduct guides did not spring out of nowhere, nor did
                they disappear after 1860. They were published in great
                numbers throughout the nineteenth century and beyond
                and, as Nancy Armstrong has argued convincingly in her
                study of the British novel, <em>Desire and Domestic
                Fiction</em>, their origins may be traced to
                Richardson&rsquo;s <em>Pamela</em> (1740). Virtually
                every period in American history may be characterized
                as containing great economic and social upheaval. The
                1850s are no exception, and perhaps even merit some
                special consideration on the grounds that the nation
                did in fact go through fairly radical social, political
                and economic upheaval on the eve of the Civil War as
                well as during the crash of 1857. Thus, while Americans
                experienced great economic and social change during
                this period, it is the way these anxieties were
                manifested&mdash;how they were expressed within the
                writing of the period&mdash;that concerns me.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>What is compelling about the proliferation of
                conduct guides during this period is how, somewhat
                paradoxically, they were aimed at instructing readers
                in the art of being sincere. As Karen Haltunnen argues
                in <em>Confidence Men and Painted Women</em>, the
                anxiety over social and economic anomie was resolving
                itself by mid-century as Americans became more
                comfortable with the manners and rituals that marked
                genteel, middle-class conduct; that is, they became
                more secure in the idea that proper manners, dress and
                conduct <em>represented</em> their sincerity (rather
                than hiding it), and guarded them against what
                continued to be their greatest fear, the hypocrite or
                the masked upstart (197). Warner&rsquo;s representation
                of the ideal feminine emphasize how Ellen&rsquo;s piety
                is manifested <em>internally</em>, a formula for
                politeness echoed by an advice manual of the period
                which advised that "true politeness has its foundation
                in benevolence. . . It is not confined to mere exterior
                behavior . . . it proceeds from the heart" (<em>Manual
                of Politeness</em> 7). This internal sense, however, is
                repeatedly linked to a morality that performs itself
                through deeds and actions while at the same time
                arising out of that performance. As Kathryn Sklar
                argues, a shift toward an emphasis on outward
                manifestations of piety and morality took place during
                this period that "was congruent with an increasingly
                democratic and individualized ethos." As behavior was
                valued over the psychological state of a "joyous love
                to God," conduct became crucially important. This shift
                changed, Sklar argues, "what had theoretically been
                merely superficial behavioral modes into rigid moral
                determinants. . . . Sexually differentiated definitions
                of morality were thereby heightened, since so-called
                <em>natural</em> and unnatural behavior could now be
                equated with the moral and immoral" (83). We can then
                explain how natural characteristics or the
                "undomesticated," including blacks and non-assimilated
                immigrants, were linked to immorality by examining more
                closely some of the origins of domesticity.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As Kathleen McHugh asks in her <em>American
                Domesticity</em>: "What have slavery, suffrage, and
                citizenship to do with domesticity? In the period
                between 1787 and 1840, the rise of the cult of
                domesticity coincided almost exactly with the fight for
                universal white manhood suffrage." Over the course of
                this fight, she argues, "the criterion for the
                franchise shifted from exclusions based on unequal
                distribution of property to exclusions that legally
                constituted identity itself as the premise for
                inequality" (39). One of the consequences of this shift
                toward a politics of identity-based citizenship (rather
                than class- or property-based) was "the transformation
                of domestic property relations." As McHugh argues, this
                transformation affirmed the private sphere as "domestic
                discourses formulated and celebrated the value of
                private property or the domicile as precisely
                dematerialized and idealized" (40). Connecting these
                discourses back to the natural and consequently back to
                Becky Sharp, we can see how McHugh&rsquo;s argument
                helps to explain the connections between feminine
                identity and property and in turn how Becky&rsquo;s
                need for property and the subjectivity that is
                underwritten by that property. As Becky herself
                famously acknowledges, in a tone reminiscent of Austen:
                "It isn&rsquo;t difficult to be a country
                gentleman&rsquo;s wife. . . I think I could be a good
                woman if I had five thousand a year" (495).
                Thackeray&rsquo;s narrator is unapologetic about the
                link between being a "good woman" and possessing
                property, with Becky&rsquo;s quest for riches, social
                stature and sexual purity underwritten by the
                narrator&rsquo;s comment that "who knows but Rebecca
                was right in her speculations&mdash;and that it was
                only a question of money and fortune that made the
                difference between her and an honest woman" (496).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>External manifestations of piety and morality gained
                in importance during this period in part because
                Americans were able to consolidate their construction
                of "natural" behavior through the articulation of,
                paradoxically, unpretentious manners while
                distinguishing those "natural" manners from "unnatural"
                behavior. In turn, the more rigid requirements for
                feminine gender performance was linked to the evolving
                importance of the private sphere and the construct of
                domesticity. And while England was not undergoing an
                identical crisis, the antecedents for and the
                intellectual foundation of the crisis are shared. What,
                I think, distinguishes the two at this point is the
                American drive toward nationalism and its explicit
                identification of simplicity as "American." This meant
                that in food, dress, and manners Americans began to
                desire to express and distinguish themselves&mdash;as
                Americans. This is not to say that the slightly
                conflicted Anglophilia that I would argue is a
                characteristic of the period did not exist. It is to
                say that Americans were beginning, for a variety of
                reasons, not the least of which was the impending fight
                over a united nation, to see themselves as separate,
                and as embodiments of new and simpler values. When
                Thackeray has a bit of fun with the construct of the
                "artless" woman, it is a construct that perhaps
                resonated even more strongly on the American side of
                the Atlantic. The feared interloper, according to
                <em>Vanity Fair</em>&rsquo;s narrator, is not far
                removed from what the revered figure represented in the
                American domestic novel. As Thackeray&rsquo;s narrator
                somewhat wickedly warns:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The best of women (I have heard my grandmother say)
                  are hypocrites. We don&rsquo;t know how much they
                  hide from us: how watchful they are when they seem
                  most artless and confidential: how often those frank
                  smiles they wear so easily, are traps to elude or
                  disarm&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean in your mere
                  coquettes, but your domestic models, paragons of
                  female virtue. (210-1)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>The cynicism of this view of the polished woman
                contrasts starkly with the American novel&rsquo;s
                unerring faith in the true woman&rsquo;s use of manners
                as a means of expressing authentic feeling. Indeed, it
                might be read as a scathing indictment of
                America&rsquo;s polite but deeply hypocritical white
                women&rsquo;s culture on the eve of war. Americans, I
                want to suggest, clung to the idea that actions
                (manners) expressed feelings (the source of truth). As
                Gerty in <em>The Lamplighter</em> demonstrates, perfect
                manners could not be separated from genuine emotion.
                The young and impressionable Fanny, when forced to tell
                Gerty&rsquo;s rule for learning politeness, responds
                that her advice "was the same my music-master gave me
                last winter" when she asked him how she should "learn
                to play with expression." The answer he gave and which
                Gerty&rsquo;s recommends was "You must cultivate your
                <em>heart</em>, Miss Bruce; you must cultivate your
                <em>heart</em>" (240-1). Thus while Cummins represents
                good manners as the result of genuine feeling,
                Thackeray represents them as pure artifice&mdash;as a
                part of the theater of society. Which is not to say
                that Becky&rsquo;s manners were lacking&mdash;in fact,
                Becky&rsquo;s "manners were fine, and her air
                <em>distingu&eacute;</em>" (342). Clearly, however,
                Becky&rsquo;s manners are precisely that, a means
                (access and acceptance) to an end (money, a husband) in
                genteel society&mdash;their honesty more closely
                matches England&rsquo;s treatment of race, whereas the
                American model seems to cling to a justification that
                manners might cover for hypocrisy.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Warner repeatedly engages the question of manners in
                <em>The Wide, Wide World</em>, with Ellen&rsquo;s and
                others&rsquo; manners discussed throughout the novel as
                markers of class, nation and racial identification. The
                following discussion gives some indication of this:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  "She is a fascinating child," said Mrs. Gillespsie.
                  "I cannot comprehend where she gets the manner she
                  has. I never saw such a perfectly polite child; and
                  there she has been for months with nobody to speak to
                  her but two gentlemen and the servants. It is natural
                  to her, I suppose; she can have nobody to teach her."
                  (475)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Warner&rsquo;s emphasis on Ellen&rsquo;s innate
                goodness is something of a paradox. While she shows
                that Ellen is passionate, and that those passions must
                be tamed and controlled through submission to God, she
                is also careful to demonstrate that Ellen is inherently
                "good" or unusually pious by nature. What Thackeray
                represents in Amelia as so much foolish
                falsehood&mdash;including the maudlin scenes that
                characterize sentimentality&mdash;are, paradoxically,
                in the American novels, represented as a manifestation
                of <em>authentic feeling</em>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Contextualizing this split between the
                Thackeray&rsquo;s cynicism and the American
                novelists&rsquo; more naive values requires delving
                deeper into the logic of sentimentality, and how it
                works within all three novels to subsume social and
                racial difference behind the already racialized and
                gendered enclave of the private middle-class
                home&mdash;the sanctuary of the white, middle-class
                woman. Indeed, as Shirley Samuels has argued, by
                resolving public difficulty within the private sphere,
                domestic sentimentalism in the American novels at once
                erased unresolvable differences and ignored them. In
                these texts, a specifically racialized class status is
                ostensibly secured by the knowledge of a set of rules
                that could be learned by anyone, and yet which are in
                effect a set of codes that enable the means of
                identification necessary to exclusion. At the center of
                this code, or deeply embedded within the logic of
                sentimentality, is the work it does in building and
                maintaining the boundaries defining of gender. Becky
                Sharp, because she is represented as the antithesis of
                the sentimental heroine, provides a striking example of
                the contours of gender. Because she is
                anti-sentimental, the result is the representation of
                an ambiguously gendered character.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In fact I&rsquo;d like to go further and suggest
                that Becky is coded masculine, identified as she is
                with the marketplace and with men throughout <em>Vanity
                Fair</em>. "She had never mingled in the society of
                women," Thackeray writes early in his description of
                her, a situation that might in part explain what he
                describes as "her hostility to her kind" (50, 48).
                Extending her quasi-masculinity and its consequences
                further, into the marketplace, I see her performing as
                a commodity in the text as she is repeatedly exchanged
                by (exchanges herself with) men and women, gathering
                use-value without engaging in the labor of
                self-improvement, becoming more and more expensive as
                she moves up the marriage market until she finally
                oversteps the line of propriety in her quest for
                greater riches and status, thus ultimately devaluing
                herself. Most importantly, Becky&rsquo;s value (as a
                subject, as a woman) is naturalized as an exchange
                value since one might argue that the most feminine
                behavior in the marriage market&mdash;being a
                commodity&mdash;is precisely what women are expected to
                do. The difference is that Becky understands herself
                and her relation to the world in commodity terms (she
                is for sale to Miss Pinkerton and then to the right
                husband, for the right price), and her efforts at
                self-promotion amount to a fairly successful marketing
                of her own assets.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>I see Becky&rsquo;s status as a commodity, combined
                with Thackeray&rsquo;s representation of her as natural
                and his repeated emphasis on her as anti-domestic, as a
                set of conditions that by coding her masculine invert
                many of the key assumptions sustaining the sentimental
                novel. The text, through Becky, subverts domesticity
                and its basic values by representing them as so much
                falsehood, so much pretense; and yet, the text&rsquo;s
                effort to undermine the tired genre goes much further,
                exposing the artificiality of white femininity itself.
                Thackeray, by coding Becky as masculine and yet
                representing her as a woman, enables her to enact, in
                an extreme form, the basic preoccupation with natural
                passions so evident in the period&rsquo;s popular
                fiction. In other words, Becky is an expression of what
                Reynolds identifies as the subversive impulse that
                floods the sensation fiction of the period&mdash;that
                is, she embodies the shocking human passions and their
                untrained expression that is at the core of this crude
                mode of reform writing, an expression that embodies
                masculinity.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Thackeray&rsquo;s novel thus may be seen to work in
                concert with American domestic fiction, but the novel
                does so in a way that draws its readers&rsquo;
                attention to sentimentality&rsquo;s central
                pretensions. For it is not ultimately learning and
                diligence, it is not spiritual and moral reform that
                makes womanly virtue possible; rather, these are
                revealed as the pretensions hiding the essential
                difference between classes&mdash;and it is ultimately
                the very American obsession with race that is
                underscored as the real difference between women. To be
                "natural," then, had a dual and somewhat contradictory
                meaning since it simultaneously signaled effortless,
                authentic performance of the "self" while also
                indicating an undesirable absence of cultivation and
                domestication most damningly and shockingly linked to
                female sexual passion which is in turn coded black.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In this formulation we can see that
                Thackeray&rsquo;s representation of Becky and her
                passionate, fiery and indeed often uncontrollable
                nature plays on the divide in American popular fiction
                between the sentimental and sensational modes. For
                while impulsiveness is represented in both genres as a
                great evil to be conquered (although it is often not
                conquered in the sensation novels), it is the play of
                race and gender that complicates the divide. For white
                female protagonists, the necessity of concealing and
                ultimately ridding the self of all uncontrolled desires
                and impulses is at the center of the drive toward
                achieving the virtue necessary to becoming a genteel
                wife&mdash;the end that is in store for virtually all
                heroines in all coming-of-age novels. This end, and its
                links to controlling the passions, cannot be
                overemphasized as the failure to achieve this control
                is represented not only as a moral failure but also as
                a failure to <em>become</em>, or to prove one&rsquo;s
                orphan-self to be, of solid (white) blood.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><em>Vanity Fair</em> provides a tame antidote that
                plays upon the pretensions of the sentimental novel
                while outing many of its most insipid conventions. And
                yet it fleshes out the space between genres, providing
                some of the gray area between genteel women&rsquo;s
                writing and the cruder yet extremely popular sensation
                novels of the period. That these novels existed in a
                divided universe of male and female is, I think, an
                untenable proposition, one that becomes more strained
                as we begin to understand the role of British reprints
                in this market and how their often less dogmatic
                narratives and more complex characters provide one more
                of the missing pieces of this period&rsquo;s literary
                history. By so explicitly engaging the formula followed
                by conventional sentimental fiction, <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> complicates our understanding of readers,
                texts, and the relations between them in 1850s
                America.</p>
