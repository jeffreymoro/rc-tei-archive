                <p>The Brazilian novel is born in the early 1840s as a
                response for the demands of a reading public formed by
                an incipient bourgeoisie that, although limited (only
                14.8% of the Brazilian population was literate by 1890,
                and this number was probably even lower by the middle
                of the century [Carvalho 65]), avidly consumed European
                novels either in the original&mdash;brought by the
                ships that docked in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro after
                their periodic trips across the Atlantic&mdash;or in
                translations sold by the budding publishing houses in
                the capital or published by newspapers in the form of
                <i>feuilletons</i> (C&acirc;ndido 119-22). Novels
                available in the country ranged from eighteenth-century
                sentimental novels, such as Saint-Pierre's <i>Paul et
                Virginie</i> and Isabelle de Montolieu's <i>Caroline de
                Lichtfield</i>, to the latest productions by
                Balzac.<a href=
                "#1">[1]</a>
                As it searched for its own form, the early Brazilian
                novel had to establish itself in relation to the
                novelistic corpus circulating in the country at the
                time. How did it navigate this sea of foreign models?
                And more importantly, how did it imagine its position
                in this broader transatlantic literary culture?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Joaquim Manuel de Macedo's <i>A Moreninha</i>
                represents a privileged entryway to a discussion of the
                formation of the novel in Brazil. Published in 1844, it
                is one of the first Brazilian novels, but, more
                interestingly, it can show how the interplay of
                different foreign literary models was pervasive in that
                period, and how the manipulation of these models was
                conscious and deliberate. Far from being an automatic
                attempt to copy the latest trends of European
                literature, the appropriation of foreign models by the
                early Brazilian novel was highly selective and in
                itself played important aesthetic and ideological
                roles. More importantly, <i>A Moreninha</i> may also
                show how the formation of a national identity, so
                important for the Brazilian novel at the time, was
                largely based on the interplay of these literary models
                imported from Europe, and that it takes place in an
                intermediary space that can be called
                transatlantic.</p>

              <li>
                <p>"This little novel owes its existence solely to the
                days of leisure and relaxation that I spent in
                beautiful Itabora&iacute; during my vacations last
                year," declares the author in his preface to the novel
                (Macedo 43).<a href=
                "#2">[2]</a>
                If we take the preface at face value, the novel is
                supposed to have been written very casually, as a
                pastime to fill out the days of a pleasant but
                uneventful vacation, and the constant appeals to the
                leniency of the reading public imply that it is meant
                to be read in the same spirit. The authorial persona
                goes out of his way to stress that <i>A Moreninha</i>
                is an amusing fiction, the result of the "frolics" of
                his imagination, and should not be taken seriously.
                More than a disclaimer for the possible shortcomings of
                the novel&mdash;or for eventual breaches of propriety
                in the text, which are never too daring and are always
                controlled by the narrative itself&mdash;the preface
                seems to serve the purpose, above all else, of
                grounding the novel not as a breakthrough in Brazilian
                literature (and certainly not as "art"), but as an
                unpretentious and agreeable entertainment.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Nevertheless, this avowedly unpretentious novel
                demonstrates a great concern with the European literary
                models circulating in the country at the time it was
                written, and it seems more interested in situating
                itself in relation to these models than to the social
                environment it is supposed to portray&mdash;or, more
                accurately, it translates the relationships that give
                form to this social environment in terms of the
                circulation of European literary paradigms. Indeed, the
                first chapter of the novel already places the whole
                narrative that is to follow in the context of the
                circulation of styles, none of which is considered
                essentially Brazilian, in spite of the chain of
                identifications in which they are involved, as we will
                see presently. Filipe, a student in Rio de Janeiro,
                invites three of his colleagues to spend a weekend at
                his grandmother's house on an island near the city. As
                an enticement for his friends, he uses the allurement
                of his two beautiful cousins. He describes the eldest
                as having black hair, dark eyes, and as being pale. The
                youngest is blond, with blue eyes, and has an
                "alabaster breast" (50). The two girls are
                respectively&mdash;and explicitly&mdash;associated to
                the literary paradigms of romantic and classical beauty
                in the text, and it is this explicit association that
                makes them irresistible. Nevertheless, as a further
                incentive to drag his friends to an otherwise appalling
                weekend with his grandmother, Filipe mentions his
                younger sister, who is only described as a
                fourteen-year-old <i>moreninha</i>.<a href=
                "#3">[3]</a>
                The students cannot place her under an existing
                literary paradigm. Her characterization as a
                <i>moreninha</i>, however, is enough to posit her as a
                typical Brazilian beauty, opposed to the romantic and
                classical beauties of the other two girls, which, in
                their paleness, have a foreign aspect. Apparently, it
                is also enough to establish her character: she is no
                doubt "interesting, unruly and funny" (51), as declares
                one of the friends&mdash;and that is indeed what we
                find she is, when we finally get to meet her.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The promise to meet the three girls convinces even
                Augusto, the most recalcitrant of the four friends.
                Augusto is also accused of being a
                romantic&mdash;"accused" because his romanticism is
                associated to his inconstancy, to his continuous
                flirting. He defends himself by insisting that he is
                sincere in his insincerity: he tells all his
                girlfriends he is inconstant. Augusto's romanticism is
                criticized as an affectation, an imitation of
                fashionable mannerisms made popular by French novels,
                and as an excuse for his inconstancy. His claims to
                sincerity, however, point to the possibility of a
                hidden truthfulness behind the coat of form and
                appearances.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Augusto boasts that he will probably flirt with the
                three girls at the same time, without growing truly
                attached to any of them. But Filipe insists Augusto
                will fall madly in love with one of them and remain
                hopelessly absorbed by her&mdash;at least for a while.
                They decide to settle the dispute in a bet: if Augusto
                falls in love with any girl in the island&mdash;and is
                faithful to her for at least fifteen days&mdash;he will
                have to write a novel telling of his defeat; if, on the
                other hand, he leaves the island unscathed, Filipe will
                have to write another novel on the triumph of Augusto's
                inconstancy. Yes, <i>A Moreninha</i> is the final
                result, as we learn in the last chapter of the
                book.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The whole narrative of the novel, therefore, is
                bracketed into a literary game&mdash;and, as Sant'Anna
                points out, the figure of the game is central in <i>A
                Moreninha</i> (95-96). The people gathered on the
                island engage in a series of games throughout the
                novel, and these include courtship, a game with very
                specific rules. This gaming is tied to the playful tone
                of the book and to the kind of pleasure it tries to
                create. But games are first and foremost the domain of
                form. They are based on a set of arbitrary rules that
                elicit a certain number of gestures which are therefore
                typified, stylized by them. These gestures have no
                meaning outside the motions of the game. In <i>A
                Moreninha</i>, games are the way forms circulate and
                are negotiated. Most of the social interactions in the
                book revolve around flirting or are erotically tinged.
                Love is no doubt the social glue of the little society
                on the island. But flirting, or courtship, in this
                novel involves the assumption of very specific rules
                and kinds of behavior, based on transatlantic literary
                codes. Social interaction, then, is seen as a game that
                promotes the circulation of forms&mdash;represented
                here by European literary paradigms&mdash;and where
                identities are constructed according to adherence or
                opposition to those forms. And these forms, these
                literary paradigms, mostly of Portuguese, French or
                British origins, are strangely eroticized, in
                accordance to the importance of love as a social binder
                in <i>A Moreninha</i>.<a href=
                "#4">[4]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>One example may make this clearer. Before going to
                the island, Augusto receives a letter from
                Fabr&iacute;cio, one of the friends at the bet scene.
                Fabr&iacute;cio reveals that in fact he is courting
                Filipe's avowedly "romantic" cousin, but the whole
                thing bores him terribly. D. Joaninha writes him
                endless letters in which she pours out her soul. He is
                forced to reply, writing at least four letters each
                week, and is at a loss as to how to find more idiocies
                to write and money to buy more paper. D. Joaninha has
                established a whole set of signs that they must
                exchange when they meet at the theater, and she wants
                to regulate how he dresses, how he cuts his hair, and
                what kind of cigars he smokes.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>D. Joaninha forces upon Fabr&iacute;cio a set of
                attitudes and behaviors directly extracted from her
                romantic readings. Fabr&iacute;cio, of course, is
                perfectly aware of that, for he, too, is a reader: "I
                must call her 'my beautiful cousin' and she calls me
                'dear cousin'. From this I conclude that D. Joana has
                read the Faublas. Now, that's a commendable quality!"
                (66). Fabr&iacute;cio's disapproving tone casts
                suspicions on D. Joaninha's readings as consisting of
                useless and morally questionable popular French novels,
                but it is possible that a criticism based on matters of
                national identity is also present.<a href=
                "#5">[5]</a>
                The love affair between Fabr&iacute;cio and D. Joaninha
                constitutes itself in the playing out of literary
                stereotypes, which finally shape their identities. D.
                Joaninha has no psychology besides playing the romantic
                heroine, and Fabr&iacute;cio's character is established
                in his opposition to romanticism (although he is
                familiar with D. Joaninha's reading matter, he insists
                he is a classicist). His complaints against D. Joaninha
                reflect an aesthetical incompatibility, a desire to
                return to his previous literary affiliation. He
                declares that, being a classicist "body and soul," he
                "calls things by their real names." Although everybody
                says D. Joaninha is "pale," Fabr&iacute;cio thinks
                rather that she is "yellow." "What used to be
                considered insipidity in a girl is now just the
                opposite: sublime languidness! There are no longer
                impudent or vain girls&hellip; Those who were like that
                are now called girls of spirit! The romantic school has
                reformed all this in consideration to the fair sex,"
                complains Fabr&iacute;cio (67-68). Actually,
                Fabr&iacute;cio's classicism reveals a very practical
                mindset: he prefers real kisses to the ones only
                dreamed of as dictated by romantic platonic love; he
                also immensely enjoys the pastries and sweets served
                during visits of courtship (61).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Classicism, in Brazil, was associated to a colonial
                literature, directly influenced by Portuguese culture,
                while romanticism was associated with the desire to
                create an independent, national literature, and the
                search for new models and a greater formal liberty.
                Nevertheless, in spite of all its claims of attempting
                to create a national culture, Brazilian romanticism is
                largely molded after French romanticism, which serves
                as a sort of template for the first Brazilian
                romantics, most of whom published their first works in
                the 1830s in literary magazines written and published
                in Paris (C&acirc;ndido 11-13). Given Fabr&iacute;cio's
                nostalgia for a more "classicist" time when "things
                were called by their real names," it may not be too
                far-fetched to associate him to the colonial past and
                to the practical and exploitative Portuguese colonizer.
                It is indeed this practical mindset and the materiality
                associated to it that Augusto condemns when trying to
                convince Fabr&iacute;cio of the beauties of romantic
                spirituality and idealism&mdash;and Fabr&iacute;cio's
                curiosity concerning the romantic lifestyle confirms it
                as new and modern. The clash between classicism and
                romanticism represented in the relationship between
                Fabr&iacute;cio and D. Joaninha points to the moment of
                a shift in paradigms and the replacement of one circle
                of cultural influences by another. In rough terms, this
                may be described as a shift from classicism, associated
                with tradition, the colonial past, and a set of rigid
                formal rules directly connected to Portuguese literary
                practices, to romanticism, associated with modernity,
                formal liberty and French culture&mdash;which was a
                symbol of cosmopolitanism in nineteenth-century Brazil
                and which seemed to offer an escape from the limiting,
                exclusivist exchange between the recently independent
                nation and its former Portuguese colonizer.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>What is most interesting in Fabr&iacute;cio's
                complaints against D. Joaninha, however, is that
                different lifestyles and points of view are directly
                and inescapably linked to literary trends, and that
                what would be in principle a clash between two
                competing literary/cultural paradigms is converted into
                a problematic love affair. Fabr&iacute;cio's courtship
                of D. Joaninha involves a circulation of international
                literary models ready to be "tried out" and left aside
                when found unsatisfactory. If the association of
                Fabr&iacute;cio's classicism to his longing for
                pastries presents this particular paradigm under a
                ludicrous light (and romanticism as represented by D.
                Joaninha and her irritating mannerisms does not fare
                much better), it is in the circulation and interaction
                of these literary models&mdash;and their being posited
                as objects of desire&mdash;that their characteristics,
                their merits and their usefulness can be played out.
                This logic of circulation, however, soon reveals itself
                as a logic of consumption. Fabr&iacute;cio sees D.
                Joaninha for the first time at the theater, but to
                reach her he must use her young slave, Tobias, as a
                go-between. Tobias, of course, charges dearly for his
                services, which are very similar to those of a pimp. D.
                Joana is one of the few characters whose affiliation
                and social situation are clearly and precisely stated
                in the novel: she is the daughter of a rich merchant.
                But here she becomes the merchandise, and the slave,
                who is her property, becomes the merchant. Finally,
                Fabr&iacute;cio literally pays for his love affair
                (buying paper and theater tickets, and bribing Tobias)
                and in the process he almost exhausts his
                allowance.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The association of this love affair to consumptive
                circulation and monetary expenditure dooms it to
                failure. D. Joaninha's compulsive writing is more a
                formal exigency of her role as the romantic heroine of
                an imaginary epistolary novel&mdash;the kind of novel
                which was so popular in eighteenth and early
                nineteenth-century Britain and France, and which was
                still being translated and widely read in 1840s
                Brazil&mdash;than a means of expression, and although
                she is genuinely in love with Fabr&iacute;cio, she
                obviously fails to establish a satisfactory
                communication with him. The whole chapter describing
                this unhappy, but very funny love affair is a criticism
                against classicism and especially romanticism as two
                sets of formal mannerisms turned into objects destined
                exclusively for consumption.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>On the other hand, the island where most of the
                novel is set opens a space where the circulation of
                transatlantic literary paradigms can occur more
                freely&mdash;and where the monetary element is absent.
                It is a kind of isolated haven where these paradigms
                are detached from the social context in which they are
                usually articulated and are made to interact on an
                empty, unmarked stage, and where they are accessible
                without the kind of obstacles Fabr&iacute;cio has to
                buy his way through. The contours of the whole island
                remain vague: it is never named, nor is its precise
                location ever given in the book. It is probably a
                fictitious island, but it would more likely be located
                inside Guanabara Bay, on whose shores the city of Rio
                de Janeiro was built (the island is not far from the
                city; the characters reach it on a small boat). It is
                never really described, either; it apparently consists
                only of the house where the characters meet, placed
                exactly at its center and surrounded by trees and
                flowers, "always bright and lively thanks to the
                eternal spring in our good land of Santa Cruz" (71).
                "Land of Santa Cruz" was one of the first names given
                to Brazil by the Portuguese when they took possession
                of their new colony in the West. This very concise
                description evokes traditional images of the island as
                an earthly paradise&mdash;images that abounded in the
                reports of travelers who visited Brazil, or the Spanish
                and Portuguese colonies in America in general, soon
                after their discovery in the late fifteenth
                century.<a href=
                "#6">[6]</a>
                The use of this image in conjunction with one of the
                first appellations given to Brazil evokes the very
                first stages of colonization, a time when what would
                later become the Brazilian territory was still
                conceived as a pristine land, ready to be taken,
                untouched by civilization and associated with a
                bountiful nature. The sparseness of description
                reinforces the identification of the island with the
                open, unmarked space that characterized Brazil in the
                imaginary of the first colonizers and reactivates this
                conception of the country in the present. As we will
                see ahead, this desired return to a point of origin has
                an important ideological role to play in the structure
                of <i>A Moreninha</i>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>W. H. Auden describes the symbol of the island as
                being "like the city in that it is an enclosed place of
                safety and like the sea-desert in that it is a solitary
                or private place from which the general public are
                excluded and where the writ of the law does not run.
                The primary idea with which the garden-island image is
                associated is, therefore, neither justice nor chastity
                but innocence; it is the earthly paradise where there
                is no conflict between natural desire and moral duty"
                (28-29). The island in <i>A Moreninha</i> is also a
                place of transition between the city (for Auden, the
                place of necessity) and the sea (the place of
                possibility): it is close enough to the city to be
                considered part of the Court, but is separated from it
                by the sea&mdash;or rather by the bay, an <i>inner</i>
                sea. Crossing the waters to reach it is like crossing
                into another reality, or like sailing in a dream; it is
                a kind of suspension, of magical passage.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>When Augusto first sees Carolina, the
                <i>moreninha</i>, he finds her ugly and impertinent.
                She is very unruly, and even makes faces at him. But
                the problem is that she is very hard to define. If she
                seems ugly, that is because her beauty does not fit any
                preconceived type&mdash;she is neither romantic nor
                classic, and the narrator complains how difficult it is
                to paint her. The fact that she is not associated with
                any existing international literary paradigm marks her
                as original and places her outside the realm of
                culture, identifying her with nature&mdash;it is
                significant that, rather than receiving cultural
                "labels," like her "romantic" and "classical" cousins,
                she is identified by her skin color: a physical,
                natural trait. Her characterization, then, reproduces
                the old Rousseauvian dichotomy between culture as the
                domain of appearances and constraint, and nature as the
                domain of spontaneity, transparency and, ultimately,
                truthfulness&mdash;a dichotomy made popular by a
                veritable host of eighteenth-century British and French
                sentimental novels which still circulated in Brazil by
                the time <i>A Moreninha</i> was published.<a href=
                "#7">[7]</a>
                Her misbehavior also puts her outside the roles usually
                assumed in the game of social interaction. She plays
                other kinds of games, more chaotic: those of a child.
                She sits in six different chairs in five minutes,
                playfully dismantles a bunch of roses, pours perfume in
                a guest's hat, pinches her brother, all in the first
                moments Augusto sees her (73). She refuses to hold any
                gentleman's arm when strolling in the garden, as the
                other girls do, because she would rather run around
                free (106). Her inability to stand still, her passion
                for movement, makes her an embodiment of
                circulation&mdash;but an aimless, spontaneous
                circulation, very different from that implied in
                Fabr&iacute;cio's and D. Joaninha's epistolary
                exchange, which was molded by literary/social
                conventions and was associated with monetary
                expenditure.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>On the one hand, then, we have an adult game,
                controlled by rules of conduct and locked in the
                circulation of forms, represented by the young people
                who flirt on the island, whose behavior is dictated by
                their literary affiliation and follows highly strict
                codes in its playfulness. On the other, we have
                children's play, which is described as amorphous and
                "invented at each moment" (113), and is associated with
                Carolina. She, in fact, actively opposes the codified
                rules of the game. When Augusto and his friends are
                playing a card game, Carolina bursts into the scene,
                throws a bunch of flowers on the table, steals one of
                the cards and completely disrupts the game
                (188-89).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Although Carolina is consistently associated to
                spontaneity in this novel, we must be careful not to
                read her as representing a rupture in the circulation
                of transatlantic literary models or as an indictment
                against it. <i>A Moreninha</i> seems to carefully avoid
                ruptures of this kind, and Carolina can be seen as a
                re-articulation of the way foreign literary models are
                appropriated in this novel. For besides functioning as
                a positive allegorical figure for circulation, she
                herself is based on a literary model, that of the
                sentimental heroine. Her very spontaneity, her
                childlike innocence and her unruliness, which are
                supposed to make her unique, are traits she shares with
                many of her sentimental predecessors, such as
                Ad&egrave;le in Mme. de Souza's <i>Ad&egrave;le de
                S&eacute;nange</i>, Ernestine in Mme. Riccoboni's
                <i>Histoire d`Ernestine</i> and Camilla in Frances
                Burney's <i>Camilla</i>. These traits were also the
                basis for these characters' claims for originality in
                their respective novels, but although in the
                sentimental novel childlike spontaneity is an endearing
                or even desirable characteristic, it is also seen as a
                danger if not properly controlled, while in <i>A
                Moreninha</i> it is intensified and more freely
                embraced.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The insistent positing of Carolina as a typical
                sentimental heroine through her embodiment of the
                culture versus nature dichotomy, her association with
                childlike innocence, and the stress given to her
                sensibility, elements that define Caroline as a
                character and which are marked with a positive valence
                in the novel, seems to offer her as a more satisfactory
                counterpoint to classicism and romanticism taken as
                mere formal mannerisms. If, at first, Carolina seems to
                evade the possibility of being inserted into a model,
                now it appears that she in fact represents the adoption
                of a model that is never as explicitly discussed in
                <i>A Moreninha</i> as classicism and romanticism: the
                sentimental novel that was so central in French and
                British literature from the second half of the
                eighteenth to the first decades of the nineteenth
                century. How far, then, does the adoption of this model
                entail the exclusion of other transatlantic models and
                bring to an end the circulation of literary forms that
                is such a driving force in the narrative of <i>A
                Moreninha</i>?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The role of the sentimental paradigm is central in
                this novel not only in terms of characterization, but
                also of plot. It is Carolina who fixates Augusto's
                wandering desire when he visits the island, but this
                can only be achieved by a return to the past and by an
                even stronger association with childhood. For Augusto's
                notorious inconstancy was merely a screen, a way to
                avoid any serious commitment while remaining faithful
                to his one true love: a young girl (about seven years
                old) he had met on a beach years earlier when he was
                still an adolescent, and who he had never seen again.
                The growing attachment the two children felt while
                playing on the beach had been clinched and converted
                into a promise of marriage when they witnessed and were
                profoundly moved by a sentimental tableau of a poor
                fisherman dying in a miserable hut nearby. The
                consciousness of shared feelings cemented their love
                and the young girl has remained an ideal love object in
                Augusto's mind for the rest of his life&mdash;until he
                meets Carolina, who increasingly shows signs of being
                imbued with the same kind of sensibility. Augusto's
                "false" romanticism was, then, a cover for a "truer"
                romanticism: he was after all faithful to the kind of
                spiritual attachment that he explicitly associates to
                romantic love in his discussions with Fabr&iacute;cio.
                What finally opens the possibility of a "true"
                romanticism, as opposed to romanticism as a set of
                formal mannerisms, is the presence of this attachment
                with all its spiritual and idealistic overtones, and
                which is only achieved in this novel by invoking the
                sentimental tradition.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The threat of unfaithfulness brought by Carolina's
                presence on the island (Augusto is torn for a long time
                between his increasing attachment to her and his desire
                to remain faithful to his young bride) is defused in
                the end by his discovery that Carolina was really the
                little girl on the beach. The idealized attachment
                between the two protagonists, then, is established when
                desire is partially de-sexualized by being fixated to
                childhood. This is already attempted by positing the
                fourteen-year old Carolina, with all her childlike
                innocence, as the main erotic object of the novel, and
                is finally achieved in the beach scene. For when
                Augusto met the young girl on the beach, he was already
                becoming aware of his own sexual desire&mdash;he
                already searched his "blasphemies" in the Latin
                dictionary, meaning, of course, Latin words with a
                sexual content (112)&mdash;and he promptly converts
                this budding sexual awareness into child's play,
                re-inscribing it in the realm of childhood innocence.
                This tendency is later reproduced in his courtship of
                Carolina, which involves playing with dolls and mock
                embroidery lessons.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The possibility of a "true" romanticism associated
                with childhood and nature, where deeper attachments can
                be formed outside the domain of culture, does not
                constitute, however, an opposition to the circulation
                of forms. As we have already seen, the possibility of
                such attachments is firmly grounded on the tradition of
                the sentimental novel, which is also behind the way
                childhood innocence is articulated in <i>A
                Moreninha</i> in the first place. Terms like "true" or
                "false" are not the most adequate to describe the way
                this novel establishes a relationship with its models,
                since what seems to be central here is putting the
                available literary codes in circulation and selecting
                from them those aspects that can elicit certain
                affective and moral effects, and which will be
                activated more intensely, as opposed to those that
                remain dormant as purely formal possibilities, but
                which are never actually rejected and whose presence
                still retains the promise of a potential use. Hence, if
                the idealization of the amorous connection between
                Augusto and Carolina seems to point to a preference for
                the spirituality and sentimentality associated to
                romanticism in this novel, and to a tacit defeat of
                classicism in the literary dispute outlined in its
                first chapters, classical elements are still present in
                the construction of the idyllic atmosphere of the
                island.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>But even the attachment to romanticism and
                sentimentality remains somewhat qualified in <i>A
                Moreninha</i>. When Augusto and Carolina are
                temporarily separated by the intervention of Augusto's
                father, who is afraid the young man has been neglecting
                his studies, both lovers fall into a fit of melancholic
                sickness, which prompts the following remark from the
                narrator: "Our lovers had just reached the sentimental,
                and with their sentimentalism were spoiling the life of
                those who wished them well. Lovers are like children:
                first they amuse us with their antics, then annoy us
                with their crying" (256).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>At first, this seems to throw a jarring note into
                the narrative. The comment not only offers a satirical
                view of sentimentality, but also ridicules the image of
                love as child's play that is laboriously developed in
                the novel and that is so important for the effects it
                tries to achieve. An apparently contradictory position
                seems to have been reached between the wholehearted
                adoption of a foreign literary model and a reluctance
                to fully embrace it&mdash;a position reminiscent of the
                place in-between that Silviano Santiago describes as
                the one typically occupied by the Latin American
                writer, whose appropriation of foreign models is always
                accompanied by their criticism in a process closer to
                parody than to copy.<a href=
                "#8">[8]</a>
                The tone of the narrator's comment on Augusto's and
                Carolina's love-sickness, however, is more good-humored
                than properly sarcastic, and it does not seem to
                properly constitute an attack on the sentimental model
                nor to question in any way its adoption in the rest of
                the novel.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>If we bear in mind the author's assertion in the
                preface that the novel was written as a pastime and
                therefore should not be taken too seriously, this
                comment can offer a glimpse of the kind of attitude
                that is the precondition for the textual enterprise
                carried out in <i>A Moreninha</i>. Poking fun at the
                sentimental model is less a criticism of this model
                than a refusal to take <i>any</i> literary model too
                seriously, even those that play a central role in this
                novel. It is a means to maintain a certain distance
                from it, while simultaneously stressing its visibility
                as a model, as something that the author can
                appropriate and use for his own ends &ndash; a move
                that marks the process of appropriation as conscious
                and deliberate. Moreover, in not taking his own models
                too seriously, the author, like his heroine, does not
                strictly adhere to the codified rules of the game and
                inscribes his exercise of appropriating European
                models&mdash;and of novel writing &ndash; under the
                heading of child's play. The eventual contradictions
                among different models, or even within a single model,
                can be conciliated or at least left suspended in this
                process of playful appropriation.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The question of identification is, of course, very
                important in the mechanism of appropriation, where
                adopting a literary model is a form of insertion into
                the context of its original production. In absorbing
                models created in Europe, the nineteenth-century
                Brazilian novelist was asserting his right to belong to
                the same literary tradition as the "civilized" nations.
                In the case of Macedo, the circulation of models
                involves a knowledge of them <i>as models</i>, that is,
                as pre-existing paradigms that cannot be na&iuml;vely
                appropriated. This awareness, like the sexual awareness
                of the characters in <i>A Moreninha</i>, is, however,
                safely absorbed by the element of play, so that the
                whole process maintains an aspect of childlike
                innocence. The process of appropriation borrows from
                Europe a history for the genre of the novel, still
                virtually nonexistent in Brazil by the time <i>A
                Moreninha</i> was published, at the same time that it
                neutralizes this history in presenting the Brazilian
                novel as a child who has not yet fully absorbed its
                education and is still largely free from the dictates
                of any tradition.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This neutralization of literary history is
                paralleled by an effacement of Brazilian history in
                <i>A Moreninha</i>. When any references are made to the
                Brazilian past in the novel, some three hundred years
                of colonization are skipped over and we return to an
                image of the country as a pristine natural garden. As
                we have already seen, the description of the island in
                <i>A Moreninha</i> associates it with the narratives of
                the first travelers who visited the country,
                identifying the Brazil of the narrative present to the
                newly discovered territory, still untouched by
                civilization, still unformed and still a land of
                limitless possibilities. This seems to reveal a desire
                for a return to a point of origin where the essence of
                Brazilian national identity is to be found&mdash;a
                desire shared by most romantic writers of
                nineteenth-century Brazil in their relentless search
                for what constitutes the spirit of the new nation
                (S&uuml;ssekind 61). In the case of <i>A Moreninha</i>,
                however, this return to a point of origin seems less
                concerned with the rediscovery of an essence already
                formed in the past than with bringing this point of
                origin to the present and associating it with the
                innocence and openness of childhood&mdash;the endless
                becoming so stressed in the main character, and the
                limitless possibilities involved in child's play. But
                in <i>A Moreninha</i>, child's play also characterizes
                the exercise of novel writing itself, so that yet
                another identification is possible. The novel is also
                like a child in its formative stages; it plays with its
                models in its process of becoming, a process full of
                possibilities. The novel and the nation are imagined in
                the same way, and one mirrors the other&mdash;they are
                part of the same process of formation.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In <i>A Moreninha</i>, the island is also an
                in-between space that offers a detachment from the
                demands of a commercial society without relinquishing
                its advantages: its cosmopolitanism and its modernity.
                It may be possible to read in it an idealized imaginary
                picture of the young Brazilian nation itself: placed on
                the margins of the sea of international commerce,
                retaining its childlike innocence and originality, but
                at the same time engaging in an intensive interaction
                with European civilization&mdash;especially by
                consuming its products. In this interaction, it becomes
                a part of this civilization (it knows its codes) while
                still remaining its more childlike and natural other.
                Its "civilized" knowledge, like the sexual awareness of
                the characters in <i>A Moreninha</i>, does not destroy
                its childlike innocence, neither does it force its
                insertion in the world of necessity dictated by the
                weight of a long historical tradition.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Another example from this period of formation may
                show how some of these questions are pervasive in the
                nineteenth-century Brazilian novel. Jos&eacute; de
                Alencar's <i>Luc&iacute;ola</i>, published in 1862, is
                also structured on an intensive exercise of model
                appropriation, although here this process is not
                associated with child's play and follows a different
                dynamic. Nevertheless, a concern with childlike
                innocence, with the possibility of a return to a
                pristine point of origin, and a desire to escape from
                the determinations of history are also vividly present
                in this novel.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><i>Luc&iacute;ola</i> is to a great extent a
                re-writing of Dumas fils' <i>La Dame aux
                cam&eacute;lias</i>. It also tells the story of a
                courtesan, L&uacute;cia, who finds redemption through
                love. In appropriating the premise, and some plot
                elements (the jealousy of the lover, the prostitute's
                contempt for her position and for her paying clients,
                for instance) of Dumas fils's novel, Alencar reveals a
                strong admiration for his model. Nevertheless, towards
                the middle of his narrative, he has his heroine read
                <i>La Dame aux cam&eacute;lias</i>, only to
                contemptuously reject it as a lie (Alencar 82).<a href=
                "#9">[9]</a>
                This is a much stronger rejection of the model than
                Macedo's humorous jabs against sentimentality, and it
                marks the point from which the differences between
                <i>Luc&iacute;ola</i> and Dumas fils' novel become more
                pronounced.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Before exploring these differences, it is useful to
                point out that the explicit reference to a model is
                also present in <i>La Dame aux cam&eacute;lias</i>. The
                model in question is, of course, <i>Manon Lescaut</i>,
                which Marguerite Gautier also reads with some
                misgivings: "lorsqu'une femme aime, elle ne peut pas
                faire ce que faisait Manon" (Dumas fils 169). It is
                interesting that the point which marks the explicit
                departure from the model in Alencar is also a reference
                to this same model and reproduces it at another level:
                L&uacute;cia is supposed to humble Marguerite, just as
                Marguerite was supposed to humble Manon. In inscribing
                his novel in this textual dynamic, Alencar connects it
                to the European novelistic tradition, which now
                supplies&mdash;as was the case in <i>A
                Moreninha</i>&mdash;a historical literary background
                for <i>Luc&iacute;ola</i>. But, again as in Macedo's
                novel, it is a desire to transcend the constraints
                dictated by history that seems to motivate Alencar's
                work.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>L&uacute;cia condemns <i>La Dame aux
                cam&eacute;lias</i> because Marguerite maintains a
                sexual relationship with Armand, offering him the same
                body that so many others had enjoyed: "Didn't this girl
                [Marguerite] feel, when she threw herself in her
                lover's arms, that it was the leftovers of corruption
                she was offering? Wasn't she afraid that her lips at
                that moment still throbbed with the kisses she had
                sold?" (82). This is, of course, essentially a moral
                objection which radicalizes the question of moral
                redemption already present in Dumas fils's novel,
                re-inscribing it in a much more absolute conflict
                between vice and virtue reminiscent of sentimental
                literature, whose rhetoric supplies the terms in which
                this conflict is developed in Alencar's novel. The
                absence of the kind of financial entanglements that
                made it so hard for Marguerite to fully relinquish her
                condition as a courtesan (the narrative of
                <i>Luc&iacute;ola</i> stresses again and again that
                L&uacute;cia was in fact quite rich and had no debts)
                is another element that firmly grounds L&uacute;cia's
                story on a purely moral level.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><i>Luc&iacute;ola</i>, then, effaces several
                realistic traits present in <i>A Dame aux
                cam&eacute;lias</i> in favor of a more intensely
                spiritualistic and idealized stance. As opposed to
                Marguerite, L&uacute;cia's redemption is in no way
                influenced by disease and remains connected to her
                desire to regain her virtue and to her own
                sensibility&mdash;to her characterization as a
                sentimental heroine, in short. Unlike Marguerite, she
                strives for&mdash;and will successfully
                attain&mdash;the kind of relationship with her lover
                associated in Brazilian romanticism (as we have already
                seen in <i>A Moreninha</i>) to platonic love, and which
                is fundamentally spiritual and sentimental. More
                importantly, because her conflict is essentially moral
                and free from any sort of objective determinism, she is
                able to effectively erase her own history by an act of
                will, and return to the original state of innocence
                that preceded her prostitution when she was only
                fourteen years old.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This is marked in the novel by a literal return to
                L&uacute;cia's point of origin, to the house where she
                spent her childhood, which she visits in the company of
                her lover. This house shares many of the traits of the
                island in <i>A Moreninha</i>, and is also a sort of
                in-between place by the sea, rurally idyllic but still
                located on the outskirts of the city. Like
                L&uacute;cia's past, it remains intact and unchanged,
                ready to be retaken. There she can playfully run
                through the gardens like Carolina and cast the period
                she worked as a courtesan into oblivion: "I suppose
                I've slept through these last seven years and woke up
                today all of a sudden" (103). From that moment on, she
                will be like a "fifteen-year old girl, pure and
                innocent" (102).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>It is this return to the past, this complete
                effacement of personal history, that is barred to
                Marguerite. More than any moral flaw, it is the
                impossibility of a return to the <i>tabula rasa</i> of
                a pristine point of origin that Alencar seems to be
                rejecting in his model. But it still is in a dialogue
                with this model that he manages to make his point. It
                is only by explicitly bringing it into his own text
                that he can assert his own difference. On the other
                hand, this pristine state of childlike innocence, which
                is presented as natural and spontaneous, is only
                established in <i>Luc&iacute;ola</i>, as much as in
                <i>A Moreninha</i>, by activating other European
                literary models, such as the sentimental novel and a
                romantic view of spirituality. If indeed these novels
                promote the creation of this image of childlike
                innocence and indeterminacy as what is specifically
                Brazilian about them, then their search for a literary
                and national identity remains relational. This image is
                connected to the search for an in-between state that,
                as far as the appropriation of models is concerned,
                offers less the possibility of a critical stance than
                of acting out the desire for a limitless inclusiveness,
                where different&mdash;and often
                contradictory&mdash;stances can coexist side by side,
                and where potentially any model or literary paradigm
                can be incorporated.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The explicit way in which this inclusiveness is
                translated into children's play in <i>A Moreninha</i>
                points to a deliberateness in the process of
                appropriation, and an enjoyment of it, indicative that
                this place in-between where the novel is
                located&mdash;and which is metaphorically represented
                by the island as its setting, since it is placed in the
                bay where the most intense interaction between the
                Brazilian capital and the European nations occurred (a
                space we may safely call transatlantic)&mdash;is not a
                place occupied by necessity by the Latin American
                writer, as Silviano Santiago seems to imply, but rather
                a place actively created in works such as <i>A
                Moreninha</i> and occupied by choice. It is first and
                foremost an object of desire. In the case of the
                nineteenth-century Brazilian novelist, it seems to
                offer the opportunity of avoiding the commitment to a
                specific national or social project which would
                necessarily preclude other options. More importantly,
                it makes it possible to evade the relative determinism
                of the historical past and an established cultural
                tradition. The indeterminacy it supplies offers a much
                easier and open access to the future and modernity than
                the highly hierarchical structure of nineteenth-century
                Brazil, based on centuries of exploitation of slave
                labor, could offer. If the maintenance of this rigid
                hierarchical structure precludes an advancement towards
                modernity in European lines, this possibility remains
                open, paradoxically enough, in a return to a pristine
                past and the indeterminacy of a childlike <i>tabula
                rasa</i>, inconsequential and free of guilt.</p>

            <p class="indent"><i><a name="3" id=
            "3"></a></i><sup>3</sup> <i>Moreninha</i> is a difficult
            term to translate into English. It is the affectionate
            diminutive form of the adjective/noun <i>morena</i>, which
            has two meanings in Portuguese: it may simply refer to a
            dark-haired girl, or it may refer to a girl who also has
            dark, or tanned, skin, without being black. In opposition
            to her pale "romantic" cousin, Filipe's sister is described
            as having a "rosto moreno" (154)&mdash;a tanned, dark
            skinned face. The <i>morena</i> is a common Brazilian type,
            and we tend to picture her as the typical Brazilian
            woman.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><a name="4" id="4"></a><sup>4</sup> One
            must only remember the fascination Filipe's cousins exert
            over his friends by the simple fact of their being
            identified with classicism and romanticism. Here is an
            account of Augusto's reaction to one of the cousins, when
            he first sees her on the island: "D. Joaninha's black locks
            and romantic face made a terrible breach in his heart"
            (73).</p>

            Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvray's novel trilogy, <i>Les
            Amours du chevalier de Faublas</i> (1787-89), which dwells
            mainly on the sexual escapades of its hero&mdash;a sort of
            amiable young libertine&mdash;and on the corrupted morals
            of eighteenth-century France, would indeed be a peculiar
            reading matter for a nineteenth-century Brazilian girl of
            good standing. Its amoral tone throws a suspicious light on
            D. Joaninha's readings. Faublas's inclination towards
            cross-dressing, however, does raise the question of
            appearances and circulation of forms that is also an issue
            in <i>A Moreninha</i>. The kind of humor present in the
            Faublas novels&mdash;not to mention the fascination with
            the youth of their protagonist, whose budding (but intense)
            sexual experience still carries many elements of child's
            play&mdash;also bear some striking similarities to Macedo's
            novel, so it is hard to guess where his sympathy actually
            lies in this seeming condemnation of Faublas.</p>

            <p class="indent"><a name="7" id="7"></a><sup>7</sup> The
            contrast between culture and nature is a widespread concern
            of French sentimental novels, and it is also present in
            British novels. Examples range from Rousseau's own <i>La
            Nouvelle H&eacute;lo&iuml;se</i>, published in 1761, to
            Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's <i>Paul et Virginie</i>, first
            published in 1788 as part of <i>Etudes de la
            Nature</i>.</p>
