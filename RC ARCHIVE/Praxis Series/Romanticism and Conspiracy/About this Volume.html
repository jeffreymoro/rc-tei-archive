<h2>About this Volume</h2>
This hypertext volume of essays had its inception at a session on Romanticism and Conspiracy at the Boston NASSR Conference, in November 1996. The text is encoded in HTML, with some extensions for HTML 2.0, including a limited use of tables and frames. It will work best with Netscape 2.0 or a comparable browser; earlier browsers may not display everything properly. Although the essays are arranged "linearly" so that following the Introduction are the pieces by Gilmartin, Wheatley, Mahoney, and Pfau, they can, of course, be accessed through links on the Contents page in whatever order you choose. Because you may enter and exit these files along multiple paths, you may have to use the back-arrow button on your browser to return to your starting point. The full text of the volume, like all hypertexts in the Romantic Circles Praxis Series, is <a href="/search/node/">fully searchable</a>. The essays were marked up in HTML by John Morillo.
