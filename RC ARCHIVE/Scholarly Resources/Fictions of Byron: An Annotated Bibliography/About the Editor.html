<p>G. Todd Davis, an assistant professor at Kentucky State University, specializes in Nineteenth-century British Literature and Critical Theory, with specific subfields in The Gothic and Queer Theory. He has a passion for, some would say an obsession with, Lord Byron&#8212;the one person with whom the author would like to have dinner, if time travel were ever possible. The author gratefully acknowledges the editors of <em>Romantic Circles</em> and Melissa J. Sites and David Brookshire, who provided numerous emendations and incredibly detailed suggestions for improvement. Their help was and continues to be deeply appreciated.
