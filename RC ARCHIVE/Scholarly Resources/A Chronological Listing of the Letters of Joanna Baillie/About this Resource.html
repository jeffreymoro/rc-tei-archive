    <p>This chronological listing takes the form of a database, and was compiled and edited by Thomas McLean. It is published in conjunction with the <em>Romantic Circles Praxis</em> volume <a href="/praxis/utopia/index.html"> </a><em>Utopianism and Joanna Baillie</em>, edited by Regina Hewitt, to which Thomas McLean contributed <a href="/praxis/utopia/mclean/mclean.html"> </a>an essay explaining this chronological listing.</p>
    <p>Since the 1999 publication of <em>The Collected Letters of Joanna Baillie</em>, some two hundred new letters have been located. This chronology orders all known Baillie letters and provides more accurate dates and identifications for many of the previously published letters. By providing watermarks, the place of writing, and the correspondents' names, the chronology also gives a new vantage point from which to view Baillie's life and times. As new letters appear, they will be added to the chronology.</p>
