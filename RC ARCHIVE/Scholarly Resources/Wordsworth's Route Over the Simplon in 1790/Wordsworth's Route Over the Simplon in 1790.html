Wordsworth's curt, matter-of-fact statement in a letter to his sister belies the importance his crossing would later assume in the poet's imaginative life and the daunting amount of often very fine criticism written in response. In August 2001, we hiked Wordsworth's route over the Simplon Pass in order to get a better sense of the experience described so splendidly in Book VI of <i>The Prelude</i>, but also to evaluate the condition of the trail today, and to establish, of several reconstructed versions of the hike, which route Wordsworth and Robert Jones most likely followed.<a name="note1" id="note1"> </a>  <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1">&nbsp;</a></sup> </p>

They used what is today known as the Stockalper trail, named after Baron Stockalper, who controlled trade over the Alps in the late seventeenth century.

Francis Kinloch, who crossed the Alps in 1804 coming from Italy, recalled in his <i>Letters from Switzerland and France</i> (1821) how he descended "through a continued forest of pines, amid a number of clear and rapid streams, which rushing along to join the torrent that roared below, contributed to animate and diversify the scene" (70). Dorothy was similarly impressed by the pine forest and the Taferna when, 30 years later, William decided to follow the old trail "because he had travelled it before" (<i>Journals</i> II 263) rather than descending along the
                        new Napoleonic road. The trail</p>

The stream now small, and sounding cheerfully, filled all the space at the bottom of the glen. Pine-trees cover the upright hills, seeming to touch the sky, yet the broad highway which we had quitted, though at the first wholly out of sight, is over still higher ground. It was a pleasing thought, after looking in vain to espy that road, that we were enclosed among the natural solitudes of the Alps unmastered by the equalizing contrivances of men. ... meanwhile the voice of the stream, never turbulent, might always be listened to. Larch trees among the pines, though less frequent than yesterday, when we had first the pleasure of seeing that tree in its native mountain fastnesses. Some of the pines are magnificently tall.

                    <p align="left">After Napoleon's new road was completed in 1805, travellers increasingly neglected the Taferna Inn. This may explain why Wordsworth significantly downgraded the "inn" (<i>Prelude</i> 1805 VI 498) to a mere "halting-place" (<i>Prelude</i> 1850 VI 565) in the 1850 text&#8212;if, indeed, it is the Taferna Inn where they had their lunch. The traditional candidate for Wordsworth's inn, and the hypothesis argued by Max Wildi, is the Old Spittel (&#8220;Ospitale&#8221; on Pozzi's map), also described by Francis Kinloch. Coming from Italy he first describes his stay at Simplon Village and then mentions the Old Spittel followed by the Hospice (&#8220;Ospizio&#8221; on Pozzi's map), then under construction. "At a mile or two from the village," Kinloch writes, "we passed a solitary house, which now serves as a <i>hospice</i>; I know no word for such a place in England. ... A new hospice is to be erected, as soon as the passage shall have been completely opened; and every traveller will be entitled to a pound of bread and a cup of wine, and to such other assistance as he may stand in need of" (20).</p>

If the Taferna Inn is the place where Wordsworth and Jones had their lunch break, the line "Descending by the beaten road" (<i>Prelude</i>, 1805, VI 502) in the <i>Prelude</i> is problematic, clashing with the topographical evidence. A central key to the problem is the fact that the muleteers left them at the inn to continue their journey on their own. It is important at this point to reconsider the topography at the top of the pass. From there, the trail levels off <a name="pic11" id="pic11"> </a>(<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/reference/misc/simplon/pic11.jpg">pic 11</a>) and then descends quite considerably for 3 kilometers before one reaches the Old Spittel (1870m)<a name="pic12" id="pic12"> </a> (<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/reference/misc/simplon/pic12.jpg">pic 12</a>). If this is indeed where they had stopped, as Wildi argues, one might assume not only that the two hikers would have realized that they were walking downhill, but also that the muleteers would have told or at least somehow indicated to the young travellers that they had reached the summit.

                    <p align="left">Even though this manuscript version dates from c. 1828, a good 40 years later, Wordsworth seems to recall that the inn appeared after they had crossed the ridge. However, the poet might simply have condensed the whole experience into that handful of lines that we now have in the <i>Prelude</i>. As Bernhardt-Kabisch notes, "Wordsworth frequently took considerable liberties with his settings, adding, rearranging, and telescoping specific details of an observed or remembered landscape to suit his poetic purpose" (381). Furthermore, Bernhardt-Kabisch draws attention to Wordsworth's careful distinction between "inn" and "hospital", the former being "by definition commercial" (383, 384n7), which is certainly not the case with the Old Spittel. All things considered, the Taferna Inn remains a possible candidate for their lunch spot.</p>

Right before Gabi, the trail fades off today. Based on Dorothy's <i>Journals</i> (260-261), it seems quite clear where Wordsworth and Jones lost their way &#8212; rather than dipping left into the Gondo ravine right after Gabi<a name="pic16" id="pic16"> </a> (<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/reference/misc/simplon/pic16.jpg">pic 16</a>), the original mule trail shoots straight up a second, lower range of mountains <a name="pic17" id="pic17"> </a>(<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/reference/misc/simplon/pic17.jpg">pic 17</a>). The reason why Wordsworth may have been misled into thinking that he had not yet crossed the Alps is that during the four hour walk from the pass to Gabi, one faces this mountain, which, in bad weather particularly, does indeed seem "lofty" (1850 VI 548). Picture 17 shows a clearing half-way up the mountain with the very "cottages, where they had first been warned of their mistake" (<i>Journals</i> II 261). The mountain is the Feerberg (&#8220;Colle di Forca&#8221; on Pozzi's map) where, as Max Wildi is right to suggest, they got lost.<a name="note5" id="note5"> </a>  <sup><a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="back5">&nbsp;</a></sup>  The route they were following goes up the Feerberg to the Furggu (1872m), then down to Zwischbergen (1435m) and Gondo (855m) &#8212; somewhat misleadingly called &#8220;Strada delle miniere d&#8217;Oro di Gondo" on Pozzi's map &#8212; was in fact the <i>standard</i> muleteer trail in 1790. So Wordsworth and Jones were not altogether lost: they were simply following the
                        old, safer route that takes four hours longer to reach Gondo, which is why the local "peasant" (<i>Prelude</i> 1805 VI 513) told them to take the shortcut through the Gondo gorge. <sup><a href="#6">[6]</a><a name="back6">&nbsp;</a></sup> </p>

Much of it has been wiped out by rockfall, but one can still trace visually its vertiginous route. Until the Stockalper trail is fully restored, hikers must follow the Napoleonic road and even the new highway much of the way. Walking through the ravine while dodging the fast cars coming from Italy takes approximately two hours. Counting the hour-and-half it took Wordsworth and Jones to go up and back down the Feerberg, this time accounts for the "three hours" which produced such a strong impression on the poet (<i>Letters</i> I 33).

As described by Dorothy Wordsworth (II 258-9), it does have eight floors each with "high and spacious rooms" which kept the poet lying "melancholy among weary bones" (<i>Prelude</i> 1850 VI 646-8). Perhaps it is here, more than anywhere else along the walk, that one can best understand how hiking the Simplon could have marked Wordsworth so indelibly. It is an experience one has to feel in the legs in order to accurately size it up.</p>

        <p class="indent"><a name="1"> </a> <sup>1</sup> Wildi (1959), Bernard-Kabisch (1979), Hayden (1979), Johnston (1997). <a href="#back1">BACK</a></p>
        <p class="indent"><a name="2"> </a> 2 Most British travellers'&#160;accounts of the Simplon describe the Napoleonic road, which follows a significantly different route until the pass. Mourning the loss of the old mule track became almost a common place in the Swiss travel literature after 1805. Louis Simond wrote, for example, that "what with this road, and the road over Mont Cenis, all the glory, the poetry, or, if you please, the sport of crossing the Alps are lost ; one might as well travel in Flanders" (Simond, I, 504). However, despite the new road, the passage remained challenging, taking twelve to thirteen hours by post, and some travellers even found the addition of tunnels sublime. Henry Coxe, for instance, described the Gondo tunnel as the eighth wonder of world, where "art and nature seem to have combined in this place everything which is calculated to strike the imagination"(70). James Johnson was similarly impressed, calling the new road the "'seventh wonder' of the world" offering a "scene ... sublime, and even fearful" (59-60). <a href="#back2">BACK</a></p>
        <p class="indent"><a name="3"> </a> <sup>3</sup> Traveling up the pass in 1814 on the Napoleonic road, Henry Coxe noted that "below the Schalbet [a gallery built for the road] are the two houses called <i>Tavernettes</i>, where travellers who keep the old road stop for refreshment" (66). <a href="#back3">BACK</a></p>
        <p class="indent"><a name="4"> </a> <sup>4</sup> Kenneth Johnston also notes this anomaly, noting that the two men, used to mountain walking, "could hardly have misinterpreted the relief they felt in their muscles" and that "by the time you reach the spittal, it is quite clear that one has crossed the Alps" (206-7) Although Johnston writes that the exact place where Wordsworth and Jones had lunch that day "is a matter of some critical importance" (206), whether or not they ate at the Taferna or at the Spittal and why they failed to understand they had already reached the pass remain biographical conundrums but do not change the way we interpret the poem. <a href="#back4">BACK</a></p>
        <p class="indent"><a name="5"> </a> <sup>5</sup> Johnston's remark that "nearly a quarter of their time and distance on this day was taken up with wandering around, lost, near the top of the pass" (205) is inexact. Wordsworth and Jones got lost four hours after and over a thousand meters down from the actual pass. As Wildi has noted, they could not have been lost more than an hour and a half (181), while the whole walk takes approximately ten to twelve hours. <a href="#back5">BACK</a></p>
        <p class="indent"><a name="6"> </a><sup>6</sup> There are a couple of details about the mistaken-path episode that emerge in Wordsworth's first draft of the passage (in the second volume of <i>The Thirteen-book Prelude</i>, ed. Mark L. Reed, Cornell U. P., 1991, pp. 254-255 [25v-26r of the manuscript concerned]), that he eliminated from later versions. While the walkers were proceeding on the mistaken (or rather less-preferable) path, they were overtaken by a heavy shower, and took shelter in one of the rude sheds or outhouses on <a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/reference/misc/simplon/pic17.jpg">picture 17</a>; and it was while they were sheltering there that the peasant passed who gave them the perplexing information about the other way. <a href="#back6">BACK</a></p>
