    <p><span class="c4">W</span><span class="c5">elcome to the Romantic Circles Conference Archive. This page provides an archive of programs from conferences and sessions of special interest to Romanticists, in the years 1990 through 1998. It includes a complete record, during that time, of NASSR (North American Society for the Study of Romanticism) and ACR (American Conference on Romanticism) conference programs, as well as MLA (Modern Language Association) sessions sponsored by the Division on the English Romantic Period, the Division on Comparative Studies in Romanticism, the Wordsworth-Coleridge Assocation, the Keats-Shelley Association, and the Byron Society. It also provides links to the Romantic Circles Virtual Conference series and to conference sites archived on RC and on servers elsewhere.</span></p>
    <p>We hope that the Archive will prove especially useful for conference and session organizers who wish to see what has been done, and what remains to be done, in the field. Scholars working on book proposals or planning dissertations may also find it helpful to have a partial record at hand of interest in a given topic, author, or work. Those charting the history and contemplating the future of Romantic studies may also find a valuable resource in the Conference Archive.</p>
