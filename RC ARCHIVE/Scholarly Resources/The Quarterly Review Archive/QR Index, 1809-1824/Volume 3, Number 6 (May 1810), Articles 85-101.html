      In attributing the article to Barrow, Shine cites JM III's Register (but incorrectly 
      transcribes the entry); Barrow 501-2; and Smiles I 166. Shine also quotes 
      from the following two letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, 3 July 1810: 'Beloe 
      has been worrying Mr B for an Article on Sir G Staunton.' Murray MS., WG to

      and his <i>Travels in China</i>. There is a specific reference on p.276 of 
      the article to p.271 of #48, Barrow's first article. The first sentence of 
      article #119, also by Barrow, refers back to this article; this article is 
      also referred to in #333, 349, and 389, articles that are by Barrow. The author 
      of #142WI (probably Barrow) takes credit for this article and articles #85, 
      119, 147, 333, and 389, all of which are by Barrow. In his <i>QR</i> articles, 
      it was Barrow's signature practice to refer to his own works. Murray MS. John 
      Barrow to WG, [multiple letters] 6 Mar. 1810, 20 Mar. 1810, 26 Mar. 1810, 
      and 6 Apr. 1810, discuss this art. at its various stages of development. BL

      to #86]. Murray MS., Ellis to JM, 4 Feb. 1810 and Murray MS., Ellis to JM 
      4 Apr. 1810, Ellis states his interest in reviewing this work. BL MS. 28099

      of Staunton will be first and Ellis's 'American Article' second. </span></p>

      XXI 138; Douglas I 160; Graham 41; Idman 314n11; and Scott-Maturin. Shine 
      also quotes from Iowa MS., JM to [John Wilson Croker], n.d.: 'Walter Scott 
      gave us one or two &lt;general&gt; ideas upon Romances in his review of "Fatal 
      Revenge." Q. R Vol 3 No 6 p339'. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published here for the 
      first time. The article was advertised in the <i>Courier</i>, 26 Mar. 1810 
      for inclusion in QR Number 5, but delays kept it out. Maturin was Scott's 
      prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The ten letters quoted or summarized below establish Scott as the 
      author of #87, of a second article, #100, and possibly of a third article, 
      #90. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint"><b>A</b> Murray MS., WG to JM, [17 Mar. 1810]: 'The 
      packet from Scott is this instant arrived&#151;but I do not see how we can 
      insert it, as I think we are full. However we will talk it over&#151;I have 
      not yet opened it.' This letter is quoted by Shine at entry #90. But the following 
      letters suggest that the first article of Scott's to arrive at this time was 
      #87. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint"><b>B</b> Murray MS., WG to JM, [17 Mar. 1810]: 'Mr 
      Heber, who called here this evening, thinks Scott's Article should if possible 
      appear on account of his name. If you are of the same opinion, let me know, 
      and I will prepare it.' 'Scott's article,' as <i>supra</i>, appears to refer 
      to #87, but may refer to #71. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint"><b>C</b> Murray MS., WG to JM, [Mar. 1810], says 
      Scott's article has arrived and 'it is an Ironical imitation of Dr Johnson.' 
      Articles #87 and 100 cannot reasonably be described as ironical imitations 
      of Dr. Johnson. Article #90, on the other hand, can possibly be so. Johnson 
      is mentioned in #90 (on page 379), which may have suggested the thought to 
      WG. There is a better argument, however, for article #71 being ironically 
      Johnsonian.</span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint"><b>D</b> NLS MS. 3878 (f.119), WG to Walter Scott, 
      28 Mar. 1810, says Scott's 'pleasant Article' was advertised for issue Number 
      5 but delays kept it out. The only article advertised in the <i>Courier</i>, 
      26 Mar. 1810, for inclusion in <i>QR</i> Number 5 that did not appear was 
      a review of Murphy's <em>Revenge</em>. In the same letter WG speaks of a second article: 
      'I received the little Article from Croker which is very good. Both, of course, 
      go into our <u>next</u> No.' As all evidence suggests that Croker's first 
      contribution was #146, WG's meaning is that he has received an article from 
      Scott who had made use of John Wilson Croker's franking privileges as Secretary 
      of the Admiralty. The 'little Article' cannot be #100 as WG only proposes 
      the topic of #100 in this letter. It perhaps refers instead to #90. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint"><b>E</b> Murray MS., George Ellis to JM, 4 Apr. 
      1810, says that JM has a review by Scott in hand. The reference is probably 
      to #87. In the light of the letter quoted at note B, it is significant that 
      Ellis mentions only a single review. It appears he was unaware of the second 
      article, the 'little Article' that is also alluded to in the following letter. 
      </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint"><b>F</b> BL MS. 28099 (f.72), WG to Ellis, 6 Apr. 
      1810: 'O that Scott! He sent me two hurried articles, just as the Rev. [Number 
      5] was printed.' This is strong evidence to suggest that before the publication 
      of Number 6 WG had in hand at least two articles by Scott. It may suggest 
      that he had two articles in hand in addition to #87, as WG had received that 
      article in time to publish in Number 5. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint"><b>G</b> NLS MS. 3879 (f.116), WG to Scott, 24 May 
      1810, informs Scott that in the upcoming Number his 'poor Irish friend's book 
      is reviewed' and he need not fear an attack on his person, though 'the hero 
      of his tale' comes under fire. (See page 342 of #87.) Maturin, Scott's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, 
      was Irish. Article #87 is the only prose fiction reviewed in this Number. 
      On the face of it, the statement suggests that someone besides Scott reviewed 
      Maturin. WG, however, is merely defending his own editorial intrusions. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint"><b>H</b> Iowa MS., JM to [John Wilson Croker], n.d.: 
      'Walter Scott gave us one or two &lt;general&gt;<general> ideas upon Romances 
      in his review of "Fatal Revenge." Q. R Vol 3 No 6 p339' </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint"><b>I</b> NLS MS. 3879 (ff. 171-72), JM to Scott, 
      28 Aug. 1810: 'the little article on <u>Maturin</u>&#151;is universally picked 
      out for its original & just ideas of Romance writing.' In this manner WG typically 
      stroked his contributors' egos, which is further evidence that #87 is by Scott. 
      </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint"><b>J</b> NLS MS. (3879 f.197), WG to Scott, 22 Sept. 
      1810, thanks Scott for his 'two little articles in our last'. This suggests 
      that Scott contributed only two articles to this Number. However, as #87 was 
      originally scheduled for Number 5, and Scott had already received WG's thanks 
      for it, it is possible that #90 and #100 are being singled out. </span></p>

      only two articles to this Number. However, as #87 was originally scheduled 
      for Number 5, and Scott had already received WG's thanks for it, here #100 
      and possibly #90 and are being singled out. See also the evidence at #87 that 
      unravels the complex evidence of Scott's participation in this Number. In 
      the letter quoted above, Murray MS., WG to JM, [Mar. 1810], WG says Scott's 
      article has arrived and 'it is an Ironical imitation of Dr Johnson.' Article's 
      #87 and 100 cannot reasonably be described as ironical imitations of Dr. Johnson. 
      Article #90, on the other hand, possibly fits that description. Johnson is 
      mentioned in #90 (on page 379), which may have suggested the thought to WG.

      among the natives for four years. He began to dress and live as a Tongan, 
      and married one of the native girls. He built up an estate and became a prosperous 
      Tongan gentlemen until the beginning of the civil wars in 1799. He was tattooed, 
      and looked and spoke like a Tongan. He escaped the wars on the ship, Royal 
      Admiral, and returned to Nottingham where he died in 1838. He told his story 
      to James Orange and only two versions have been printed, this one in 1810 
      and one in 1840. His description of Tonga at the end of the eighteenth century 
      is important in that it precedes William Mariner's longer account published 
      in 1817, but the two accounts give uniquely objective reports of Tonga before
