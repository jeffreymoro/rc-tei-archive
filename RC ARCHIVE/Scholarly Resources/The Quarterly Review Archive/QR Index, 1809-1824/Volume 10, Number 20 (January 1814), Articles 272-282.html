        <ul>
          <li>Allied armies invade France from the north, south and east, inciting 
            Bourbon sentiment as they traverse the country. Napoleon fights a series 
            of brilliant counter-attacks but, by March, Paris has fallen. <br>
          </li>
          <li>April: Napoleon abdicates and, through the efforts of Talleyrand, 
            is succeeded by Louis XVIII. Napoleon is exiled to the Italian island 
            of Elba (see QR #321). <br>
          </li>
          <li>The great European powers meet for the Congress of Vienna (September 
            1814-June 1815) and agree upon a conservative and monarchist world order. 
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>British forces attack Washington D.C., burning the White House and 
            Capitol. American forces under Jackson are victorious at New Orleans. 
            The &quot;War of 1812&quot; is concluded by the Treaty of Ghent. <br>
          </li>
          <li>English Corn Laws passed in Parliament. These protectionist laws encouraged 
            the export and limited the import of corn when prices fell below a fixed 
            point, later becoming the object of a fierce political struggle between 
            the landowning and industrialist classes. <br>

      also mistaken about his having reviewed Edgeworth's <i>Tales</i> (#42). At 
      the time he compiled his lists (in the 1840s) he seems to have misremembered 
      having written all of the Edgeworth reviews in the <i>QR</i>.&nbsp;</span></p>

      In attributing the article to Thomas Dunham Whitaker, Shine cites JM III's 
      Register and quotes from Murray MS., WG to JM, [8 Mar. 1814],&nbsp; '... Whitaker 
      on Greece.' In querying Stratford Canning as an alternative attribution, Shine 
      cites Murray MS,. Stanley Lane Poole to JM III, 14 June [1887]: 'I have a 
      letter from George Canning to his cousin, Stratford, in which he says, &quot;I 
      return your proof . . . it will do you good in Giff's credit&quot;&#151;dated 
      20 Feb 1814. The proof appears to have dealt with matters of style and grammar 
      for G C criticises some of Stratford's remarks about &quot;aorists and paulas&quot; 
      &amp; &quot;the explosion of the dual number.&quot; Can this be a Quarterly

      in JM III's Register to Whitaker is suspect as this article does not appear 
      in Nichols's mostly reliable list of Whitaker's articles. Also, current events 
      and Greek language are novel and unlikely subjects for Whitaker. In the light 
      of Murray MS., Poole to JM 14 June [1887], a passage on p. 447 of the article 
      demonstrates that the article is by Canning: 'The use of the dual number is 
      exploded. All the nice distinctions so laboriously arranged by the ancient 
      grammarians, the delicate shades of first and second future, the paulo post 
      futurum, first and second aorist, the participles, &amp;c. &amp;c. are entirely

      In attributing the article to Barrow, Shine cites JM III's Register and Graham 
      10. Shine also quotes from Murray MS., WG to JM, [8 Mar. 1814]: 'send me the 
      second sheet of America ... this [copy] I have scratched on.' Shine offers 
      alternative attributions to each of William Gifford (from Tichnor I 58); to 
      Robert Southey (from British Library catalogue entry number 1431 c. 19); and 
      to Basil Hall (from Graham in <i>PQ</i> II 101, 101n). But the evidence to 
      support these suggestions is weak.&nbsp; </span></p>
