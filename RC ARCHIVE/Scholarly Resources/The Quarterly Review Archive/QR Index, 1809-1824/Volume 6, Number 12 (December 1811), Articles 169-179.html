      Public Expenditure' solicited by Gifford and originally
      intended as the first article of this Number (the proofs are
      in the Murray archives), and possibly for an article on
      Persia. In the archives is a lawyer's letter dated 10 May
      1813 announcing proceedings on two unnamed articles. Murray
      had written to Gifford in April, 1813 to state his opinion
      that Persia is the last thing on people's minds and Horace
      Twiss the last person who should appear in the
      <i>Quarterly.</i> See entry for #237 in the Shine volume.

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. National Maritime Museum MS.,
    LBK/65/1, (ff.92-93), John Barrow to Lord Walpole, [c. Mar.]
    1812 [copy], says that Walpole is sending Barrow the third
    volume of Krusenstern's <i>Voyage</i>. Barrow hopes Lord
    Walpole was satisfied with the <i>QR</i>'s articles on volumes
    I and II. Article #170 is referred to in articles #178, #190,
    #255, #299, and #517 (twice), all of which are also by Barrow.
    In his <i>QR</i> articles<i>,</i> it was Barrow's signature
    practice to refer to his own works. Note the discussion of
    cannibalism (p.371), similar to Barrow's treatment of the topic
    elsewhere (for example, #165).</span></p>

    Francis Jeffrey's sarcastic review of Montgomery in&nbsp;the
    <i>Edinburgh Review (</i>#332, Jan. 1807) greatly offended
    Southey. Jeffrey's review was a key reason behind Southey's
    refusal in late 1807 to write for the <i>Edinburgh</i> when
    Walter Scott, at Jeffrey's request, asked him to do so. In
    1808, Southey cited his wish to avenge Jeffrey's Montgomery
    review as one of his primary motivations for supporting
    Murray's new journal.</span></p>

    was an important step towards objective methods in field
    archaeology and established Colt Hoare's reputation as an
    archaeologist. Sir Richard Colt Hoare (1758-1838) was the
    grandson of Henry Hoare, the banker, who had laid out the
    gardens at Stourhead. At the beginning Colt Hoare was only
    called upon to finance Cunnington's enterprise of recording all
    that could be discovered about the inhabitants of Wiltshire
    from prehistoric to Roman times. In the course of the
    preparations though he aquired a rapidly growing interest and
    knowledge, became a collaborator, and was soon described by a
    fellow enthusiast as "barrow mad". Colt Hoare wrote the work
    with the support of William Cunnington who had assembled much
    of the archeological information on excavation sites but died
    in 1810. Stephen and John Parker did the actual excavation
    work, while Philip Crocker made all the surveys and executed
    the detailed drawings for the plates. For a full account of
    Colt Hoare's life and archaeological pursuits, see K.
    Woodbridge, <i>Landscape and Antiquity</i>, Oxford,

    <p><span class="smallprint">Some of the following evidence was
    first published in <i>VPR</i> 27; additional discussion is
    published here for the first time. Gilchrist was the primary
    author of the review (despite his denial to Philip Bliss; see
    letter of 23 June 1811 below); Gifford made some significant
    additions; the extent of Field's role is not entirely clear.
    The most certain evidence that Gilchrist, not Field or WG, was
    the primary author of the article is Gilchrist's being paid
    &#163;16.11.3 for it (see in particular Murray MS., WG to
    Gilchrist, 13 Feb. 1812, quoted below). The article is
    remarkable for WG's disturbing characterization in it of the
    writer Charles Lamb as a 'poor maniac' (pg. 485). Southey,
    Lamb's friend, confronted WG who convinced Southey that Lamb
    was to him only a name, that he knew nothing about the writer's
    chronic mental illness (<i>Southey's Correspondence</i> V 151).
    It appears that Gilchrist, but probably not Barron Field, may
    have been complicit in the calumny against Lamb, if such it
    was. See also Marrs, <i>Letters of Charles and Mary Anne
    Lamb</i> III 131-33n. Southey convinced Lamb to contribute to
    the <i>QR</i> a review of Wordsworth's <i>Excursion</i>. Lamb
    did so and it was published as #315. See also the discussion at
    #315.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">BL MS. 28099 (f.93), WG to George
    Ellis, 19 Feb. 1811, WG is displeased at Scott's pledge to
    review Weber, because he thinks Scott lacks knowledge of the
    old language.&nbsp;Murray MS., WG to Octavius Gilchrist, 29 May
    1811, asks Gilchrist to look over George Ellis's
    (unsatisfactory because too sympathetic) notes on Ford, and to
    add material on Weber, 'a young man toiling for bread for the
    booksellers' and therefore deserving of tolerance. BL MS.
    34567, Bliss correspondence, (ff.222-23), Octavius Gilchrist to
    Philip Bliss, 23 June 1811: ' ... Mr Weber's edition of Ford's
    plays, which I had long since promised Gifford to review for
    the Quarterly. I have however been so annoyed by his attacks
    upon Ben that I could not have kept up the style&#8212;Royal
    <u>office</u>, but should have "thrust my head through the
    lion's skin and cryed [<i>sic</i>] Jn' [<i>sic</i>] Bottom the
    weaver"; I thought it better to leave those volumes to a more
    dispassionate hand and vent my spleen in another pamphlet.'
    [The style Gilchrist speaks of is third
    person&#8212;dispassionate, disinterested, and imperious.
    Gilchrist takes a comic turn on the legend of Heracles and the
    lion of Nemeios; he states that were he, like Heracles, to slay
    the beast (in this case, Weber) he would don, not the skin of a
    lion, but, like Bottom in Shakespeare's <i>Midsummer Night's
    Dream</i>, the head of an ass.] Murray MS., WG to Gilchrist,
    Wednesday [therefore the 5th, 12th, 19th, or 26th], June 1811,
    says that he will add to Gilchrist's critique of Weber. BL MS.
    34567 (f. 248), Gilchrist to Bliss, 2 Sept. 1811: 'I am making
    an article for the Quarterly.' [The reference is possibly to
    #166.] Murray MS., WG to Gilchrist, 3 Sept. 1811:&nbsp; 'I
    certainly wish for something on Weber. ... I will take the
    drudgery &amp; leave you to comment on the original. ...
    Remember, that I must not be mentioned as having any thing to
    do with Weber&#8212;the guilt must lie on you&#8212;or G.E.
    will scold.' Devon MS. 1149M (ff.103-4), to Edward Copleston,
    12 Feb. 1812: 'If you look at the critical part of Ford's
    article, I hope that you will not think I have been too hard on
    Weber.' Murray MS., WG to Gilchrist, 13 Feb. 1812: 'I have for
    you, for your article on Weber, 16.11.3. ... P.S. [dated 17
    Feb.] Did your friend Field write the article on Weber in the
    Criti[cal]. Rev[iew].' John Murray was publisher of two of the
    volumes listed in the head note for review, <i>A Letter to
    William Gifford</i> and <i>A Letter to J. P.
    Kemble</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Mr. Ronald Solomon, who is writing
    a biography of Barron Field, in private correspondence with the
    present writer supplies evidence for Field's friendship with
    Gilchrist and for Field's probable participation in #177.
    Solomon reports that 'In Field's <i>The Reflector</i> article
    on "Early and Late Hours," at p. 109 he wrote, "With the
    assistance of my friend, Mr. Gilchrist, I have gleaned a few
    more minute proofs ...." Gilchrist's article preceded this
    article of Field's in <i>The Reflector</i>. Field [probably]
    assisted Gilchrist with article #177 just as Gilchrist worked
    with Field on his contribution to <i>The Reflector</i>. Field's
    part in #177 may have been the correction of Weber's reprint
    from about p. 477.' Solomon notices that 'from p. 477 on, the
    style is typical of Field's critical writings, on Wordsworth
    and Dawson Turner as examples. He owned a 21 volume "Variorum
    Shakespeare" referred to at p. 478. It is now in the State
    Library of New South Wales with many of his text notes. [Field]
    did not approve of Reed and Steevens. Neither did the reviewer
    at p. 478: "Steevens is a dangerous guide."' Solomon points out
    that 'in the conclusion of Article #112 the reviewer advocates
    the adoption of improved orthography, much the same as does the
    reviewer at p.480 of Article #177.' Concerning Field's having
    had prior knowledge of WG's calling Lamb a 'poor maniac,'
    Solomon concludes that 'Barron Field and Charles Lamb were
    close friends. Field was usually a champion of any friend's
    interests, and it is hard to imagine that he conspired in a
    slander or stood back from it.' <o:p></o:p></span></p>

    Perceval, who were very much afraid that they had allowed

    Shine states: 'Barrow's authorship is indubitable: 11 other MS

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
