    circumstance of his sitting for the picture' (i.e., Joshua
    Reynold's portrait). The author has access to Hadyn's
    correspondence (see page 97). Cf. p.87: 'music and musical
    instruments of the ancients; a subject that is still involved
    in considerable obscurity, notwithstanding Dr. Burney's acute
    and elaborate investigation.' Note reflections on the nature of
    biography (pp.82, 91), an interest of D'Israeli's. Cf. p.98:
    'the history of man [i.e., biography] appears to us more
    interesting than that of music' (hardly what Burney would have
