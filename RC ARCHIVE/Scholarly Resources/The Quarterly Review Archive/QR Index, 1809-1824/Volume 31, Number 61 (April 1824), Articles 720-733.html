      Coleridge, [20 Sept. 1824 postmark], says he thinks Murray
      'is grown quite timid, &amp; afraid to look his situation [of
      hiring a new editor] in the face.</span> I have formally
      resigned ... from absolute debility&mdash;but he haunts me in
      forma pauperis and begs of charity that I will go for a few
      weeks longer to give him time to make his arrangements! He
      has had two years, &amp; has done nothing.' Murray MS., JM to
      Robert Southey, [draft] <s>30 Nov. 1824</s> 11 Dec. 1824,
      states that his decision on the new editor accords with
      Southey's recommendation (to hire J. T. Coleridge) and asks
      Southey if he would, 'of your own accord,' express his
      opinion to George Canning and John Wilson Croker, 'whose
      confidence it is of great importance, for us to obtain.'
      Murray MS., JM to WG, [copy] 11 Dec. 1824 <s>Saturday</s>,
      encloses Coleridge's answer to Murray's offer and says that
      he is sorry to see Gifford's tenure as editor come to an
      end.<br />

    "smallprint">In attributing the article to Milman, Shine cites
    JM III's Register.&nbsp;Shine also quotes from the following
    letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, [24 Dec. 1824]: 'I will just
    look at Milman, &amp; if you will have the goodness to send
    your man here in <u>about half</u> an hour, he shall bring it
    you for press.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [24 Dec. 1824]: 'You will
    still have, I suspect a crow to pick with Milman&mdash;The
    revise that he has seen, is not my revise, at least in the page
    form; and I have omitted a long and what I conceive, a
    hazardous passage, which he probably fancies not a little. I
    was, at first, surprised at his unusual praise&mdash;till I saw
    his revise. I know I am right.' In suggesting Robert Southey as
    an alternative attribution, Shine cites Southey 577 and
    <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> XXI 579. Shine also says to see
    'however, Warter III 467: Southey to N. White, January 17,
    1825: "The paper in the 'Quarterly' is not mine, nor have I any
    thing in that number."'</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., Henry Hart Milman's
    holograph list of his articles in the <i>QR</i>. Murray MS., H.
    H. Milman to John Murray, Aug. 1824, he sends his article on
    religious dissent. The article's author refers to #684 and
    #721, both of which are by Milman. The article does not appear
    in Robert Southey's definitive MS. list of his <i>QR</i>
    articles.</span></p>
