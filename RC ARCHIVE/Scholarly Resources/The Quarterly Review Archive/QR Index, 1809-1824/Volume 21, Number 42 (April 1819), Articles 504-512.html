    to Backhouse, Thursday morn., 11 Mar. 1819 [which cannot be
    right, the 11th is a Tuesday, so if the letter was not written
    on Tuesday, then Thursday the 8th or 15th]: 'I thank you for
    the remr of the Note&mdash;Mr Canning spoke to me of adding a
    transcript of the Bill to a former Note,&mdash;will you have

    Shine quotes from the following letters. Iowa MS., JM to
    [Croker], n.d.: 'I send you a most extraordinary Poem by
    Godwin[']s now Son-in-law&mdash;pray keep it under Lock &amp;

    a few pages on Shelley.' Murray MS., WG to JM, Ryde, 6 July
    1819: '... Coleridge's two mss which he has revised at my
    desire ... should be set up as Rowarth [the printer] has types
    ....' In suggesting Reginald Heber as an alternative
    attribution, Shine cites Clark 276 and says to see also Clark
    232.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., WG to John Taylor
    Coleridge, 7 June 1819, says that Shelley deserves the severe
    treatment Coleridge has given him in his article. Concerning
    the two manuscripts WG mentions in his letter to JM of 6 July
    quoted above, it is possible that two separate reviews, of
    <i>Laon</i> and <i>Revolt of Islam</i>, were combined into
    one.</span></p>

    <p class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note: 'In 1817 Shelley
    visited London to find a publisher for <i>Laon and Cythna</i>.
    Ollier agreed to publish this work with Sherwood, Neely and
    Jones. Shelley's father in law, William Godwin, recommended B.
    M'Millan, a master printer, who altered some of the text,
    spelling, and punctuation. Shelley wrote to Ollier complaining
    about M'Millan, where upon Ollier read the work for the first
    time, and found it distasteful. In this original version, the
    lovers were brother and sister. Shelley was later forced to
    recast the lovers as childhood friends. Rumours had been
    circulating of an incestuous relationship between Shelley,
    Mary, and Claire, and the changes were intended to quash the
    stories (St. Clair: <i>The Godwins and the Shelleys</i>,
    p.432.) Shelley's alterations to the text resulted in 26
    cancelled leaves when the work was eventually republished as
    <i>The Revolt of Islam</i>. Forman suggests that <i>Laon and
    Cythna</i> is rare because wherever possible the sheets were
    reused for <i>The Revolt of Islam</i>. The first issue,
    distinguished by the flyleaf with a quotation from Pindar is
    thought to have been of only 12 copies.']</p>
