    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Arguably, in writing this article
    Haygarth plagiarized an essay by Thomas Arnold in the
    <i>Encyclop&oelig;dia Metropolitana</i>. Murray MS., William
    Haygarth to JM, 4 Jan 1822, says he has received the proofs of
    his article on 'Banke's History.' Bodleian MS. d.130
    (ff.62-63), Thomas Arnold to John Taylor Coleridge, 12 Dec.
    1822: 'Can you tell me who wrote the Article in the last
    Quarterly about the Roman History? It was a curious coincidence
    that it should appear just at the Time with my Essay on the
    same Subject in the Ency. Metrop:,&mdash;and there is a
    marvelous Agreement in the Arguments used by us both, which
    made me anxious to know who it is that I so resemble.' Murray
    MS., WG to Coleridge, 19 Dec. 1822: 'the writer of the paper
    you mention, was a gentleman of the name Haygarth.'&nbsp;The
    article is referred to in #42<i>WI</i>, which is by Thomas
    Arnold. Interestingly, <i>Gentlemen's Magazine</i> XXXI, 579
    attributes #638 to Arnold. John Murray published the volume
    under review.</span></p>

    cites JM III's Register. Shine also quotes from the following
    two letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, postmarked 18 July 1822:
    'Cohen, too, I have read here&mdash;Before I left town he
    requested that the Edinburgh Advertisement might, above all, be
    preserved. I had not read it. He is very wrong, for the thing
    is heavy &amp; dull &amp; not a creature will wade through it.
    It spoils his paper &amp; should not be preserved in
    it&mdash;but I will write to him. The article itself is
    excellent.' Murray MS., WG to JM, postmarked Ramsgate, 27 July
    1822: 'There is also Cohen's Art which I wish him to have as
    soon as possible. If we can agree about the dull long-winded
    advertisement, there is nothing to dispute about. He has
    improved it since I saw it, &amp; the paper is, in fact, highly
    creditable to his powers of writing....'&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. On the first page of the article the
    author makes a specific reference to page 116 of article #582,
    which is also by Cohen, and implies that the present article is
    a continuation.&nbsp;WG lost his argument about the
    advertisement (see the letter quoted above), for it appears in
    the article on page 327. Murray MS., Francis Cohen to JM, 13
    Aug. 1822: 'I have just left my article at Rowarth's [Murray's
    printer].' Cohen later took the name Palgrave. This article is
    not reprinted in Palgrave's <i>Collected Historical
    Works</i>.</span></p>

    entertaining, &amp; visibly improves. Still he wants tact to
    govern his feelings &amp; experience of what the world will
    bear .... There is a want of connection &amp; a desultory
    slipping into the midst of modern times while in the height of
    antient discussion. The paper is far too long as is, &amp; yet
    he must say a word or two on the French translation. If he has
    not read it, send him the Edinb Revw [<i>Quarterly Review</i>
    Archive editor's note: a reference to <i>ER</i> #972 and #984,
    articles on the Greek orators, by Henry Brougham] &amp; he may
    make up something from the extracts which are all that I know
    of the work. He has not, I suppose, put the last hand to it.
    When he has done this, let me have his copy &amp; I will go to
    work with it&mdash;What is cut out may be used hereafter. Upon
    the whole my judgment of the paper is highly favourable. ... I
    once thought that Mr Mitchell ... might be useful to us in
    light articles of two or three pages, but I am convinced now
    that if he is not <i>great</i> he is nothing.... I like his
    notion of taking up the Don &amp; Friar much. The latter, I
    believe is little understood in this country, and therefore
    little praised.' Murray MS., WG to JM, postmarked Ramsgate, 19
    July 1822: 'Our friend Mitchell you see, has made the very
    discovery which my former letter pointed out. Let him by all
    means, do as he says. But some work must be chosen to head the
    art. Of the satisfaction I feel at his taking up the Don I

    for two humiliations: the withdrawal under fire after a naval
    victory at Sackett's Harbour and a similar retreat at
    Plattsburg where the Canadian naval flotilla was defeated on 11
    Sept. 1814. He was summoned to England in 1815. On arrival
    there he found that a naval court had condemned his conduct. He
    demanded a court martial but died on 5 Jan. 1816, a week before
    the date set for the trial. His family tried for many years to
    obtain a hearing, feeling sure that his memory could be
    vindicated, but their requests met with refusal. The authorship

    <p><span class="smallprint">Gooch is author of an article on
    the same topic #69<i>WI</i>, Dec. 1825 (the evidence for
    attribution is unassailable). Oddly, Gooch is credited with the
    authorship of 'The <i>Quarterly</i> review of Dr. Macmichael on
    contagion' in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> #283, Feb. 1826. The
    latter attribution derives from a publisher's list and, given
    the circumstances, appears to the present writer to be
    suspect.</span></p>
