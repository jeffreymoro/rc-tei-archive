      'Our No. appeared yesterday.'; cf. <i>Courier</i>

      <br /></li>

      <li><span class="redbold">During the preparation of this
      Number, Gifford was very frail and Murray had to undertake
      much of the correspondence.</span> To relieve his pains in
      getting about, Murray gave him a carriage 'neat, easy, and
      exceedingly comfortable' [Smiles I 337]<br />
      <br /></li>

      <li><span class="redbold">An editor's note appears on page
      292 correcting an error concerning the conduct of the 79th
      regiment during the battle of Les Quartre Bras.</span> The
      note was inserted at the instigation of Lieutenant Colonel
      Sir Neil Douglas.<br />
      <br /></li>

      <li><span class="redbold">Reginald and Richard Heber's
      brother Tom died 27 Mar. 1816. The event led to the delay of
      #386, that had been slated for the previous
      Number</span><br />
      <br /></li>

      <li><span class="redbold">News of the great Tambora volcanic
      eruption in Indonesia that occurred in April 1815 reached
      London via a report in <i>The</i> <i>Times</i> in
      November.</span> Fallout from the eruption exacerbated
      already difficult climate conditions in Europe that had begun
      in 1814; the winter of 1814-15 was severe; 1816 came to be
      known as the 'year without a summer.' The cold wet weather is
      said to have indirectly inspired Mary Shelley's
      <i>Frankenstein</i>; the startling sunsets caused by volcanic
      dust in the upper atmosphere are pictured in Turner's
      landscapes. Useful Internet links include a page on <a href=

    two young army officers of the East India Company, Captain
    Charles Christie and Lieutenant Henry Pottinger, disguised as
    Tartar horse-dealers for a Hindu merchant, anchored near the
    village of Sonmiani in Sindh. Their mission, prompted by fear
    of invasion of British Indian territories by European powers,
    was to survey the previously unknown area of Baluchistan and
    research the possibility of European armies passing through the
    lands that lay beyond Persia.' Pottinger later became the first

    Vansittart, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had a long
    discussion with Grosvenor Bedford about the article. Vansittart
    then spoke with Lord Liverpool. Liverpool requested that
    Southey travel south to confer with him at Government expense.
    Southey declined the funds. It appears that nothing more came
    of this initiative, or if the meeting did take place Southey
    kept it a deep secret. (Bodleian MS. Eng. d.53 f. 64, 26 Aug.

    Robert Southey to JM, 23 Dec. 1815: 'You know I have long had
    in mind an essay for which the Poor Society would furnish the
    text. It has long been begun, &amp; many materials for it are
    in their place among my Quarterly memoranda books.' Southey to
    JM, 20 Jan. 1816: 'You shall also have the paper upon the Poor
    for your next.' Southey to JM, 29 Mar. 1816: 'You will not have
    room for the Poor.' Southey to JM, 27 Apr. 1816, promises 'the
    Poor' for the next Number. Southey to JM, 29 June 1816, sends
    the conclusion of the Poor that evening. Iowa MS. (f. 131), JM
    to Croker, 18 Aug. 1816: 'The Article on the Poor has
    absolutely electrified every one who has read it and
    &lt;elicited&gt; from them sparks of goodness&mdash;nothing
    could have been more happy than the precise moment of its
    appearance &amp; the public service which it will positively
    render. There is a most base &amp; infamous quotation from it
    in the Times professing to be taken from the <i>Tracts of the
    Society for the Poor</i> &mdash; &amp; [I] have been thinking
    if it be not possible to so prosecute that vile fellow Walter
    for continuing thus to extract after the notes I gave him in

    "color: windowtext">[Bookseller's note, derived from Cyrus
    Ghani, <i>Iran and the West,</i> 237:&nbsp; 'Malcolm's history
    begins with the legendary kings and ends with the beginnings of
    the Qajars. There is a chapter on religion, government, climate
    and social customs. In the last chapter, he has a word of
    "advice" for his readers. He states that the future of Persia
    is really in the hands of just one person (The King) and talks
    of the need for Persian kings to at least appear religious.
    Malcolm (1769-1833) visited Persia three times on diplomatic
    missions. He travelled to most of the provinces and he had
    excellent officers, some of whom also wrote books on Persia. He
    had dispatched his officers to various parts of the country to
    observe and report (Pottinger and Kinnier). Malcolm briefly
    served as a member of Parliament towards the end of his
    life.']</span></span></p>
