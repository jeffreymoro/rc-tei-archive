      rub their eyes and begin to see that the Review might be of
      the "utmost importance" to them, but they never condescend to
      write a thought on it when there is both time and an earnest
      will to serve them (<i>i.e.</i> the country), and nothing
      wanting but the means which they are called upon to supply.
      How often has this been urged! Yet who of them procures us a
      single line? / They are often happy to leave all to chance,
      and have neither the courage nor&mdash;but I am tired of
      this. Mr. Croker is the only link that unites us at all with
      the Ministers, and the service he has done them by his
      various papers is incalculable; but he cannot do everything,
      and it is certain that, to meet the present state of the
      country, an elaborate article is requisite.' [quoted in

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and
    information is published here for the first time. Murray MS.,
    Book Loans Register: the book reviewed was sent to 'John
    Barrow' on 28 Jan. 1818. Murray MS., John Barrow to JM, 1 July
    1820, speaks of his article on Burckhardt and mentions
    'Mangles' (see pp.454, 478). The article's author refers to
    #337 (specific reference) and #457 three times (including a
    specific reference), both of which are by Barrow. The article
    is referred to in #544 and #651, both of which are also by
    Barrow. In his <i>QR</i> articles<i>,</i> it was Barrow's
    signature practice to refer to his own works. The publisher of
    the volume under review is the Association for promoting the
    Discovery of the interior Parts of Africa. The Association was
    a forerunner of the Royal Geographical Society, whose primary
    founder was John Barrow. (Royal Geographical Society holds the
    Association's papers, 1788-1831, reference code: GB 0402 AAS.)
    A primary purpose of the Association (founded in 1788 and
    headed by Barrow's geographical mentor, Sir Joseph Banks) was
    to encourage the effort to discover the source of the Niger, a
    major preoccupation of Barrow's. Burckhardt's volume was
    published by John Murray.&nbsp;</span></p>

    vengeance.' (p.481) 'The breaking up of the ten years frost in
    which Buonaparte had bound up the limbs and faculties of
    Europe, carried away in its <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> King
    Jerome and his court. The ill-assorted kingdom of Westphalia
    fell to pieces, and the liberated people returned with joy to
    the beneficent rule of their sovereigns of a thousand
    years:&mdash;while Counts Daru and Beugnot, and Simeon and
    Jollivet, found in France, under the wise and discriminating
    rule of Louis XVIII., that countenance and fortune, those
    honours and those offices, of which the tried friends of his
    martyred brother, and the devoted companions of his own
    adversity are deprived, with all the jealousy of a relentless
    and personal persecution.' (p. 492)</span></p>
