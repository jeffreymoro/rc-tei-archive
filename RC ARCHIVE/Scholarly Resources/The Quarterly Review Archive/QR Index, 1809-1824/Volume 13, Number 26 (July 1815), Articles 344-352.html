      <li><span class="redbold">News of the great Tambora volcanic
      eruption in Indonesia that occurred in April 1815 reached
      London via a report in <i>The</i> <i>Times</i> in

      already difficult climate conditions in Europe that had begun
      in 1814; the winter of 1814-15 was severe; 1816 came to be
      known as the 'year without a summer.' The cold wet weather is
      said to have indirectly inspired Mary Shelley's
      <i>Frankenstein</i>; the startling sunsets caused by volcanic

    of Scott in the missing letter .... Since that, I have

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. The objective evidence for an
    attribution to Ellis is weak, relying as it does solely on JM
    II's marked <i>QR</i>. JM II's notations in his marked
    <i>QR</i>, however, tend to be most secure for prominent and
    frequent contributors, such as Ellis. At this time, Ellis was
    the <i>QR</i>'s primary contributor of reviews of significant
    literary figures, such as Scott and Byron. The other sources in
    this case ultimately rely on JM II's attribution via JM III's
    Register and add no additional evidence; the letter quoted in
    Shine does not mention Ellis.&nbsp;</span></p>

    Sept. 1815: 'Send also to Mr. Barrow the second sheet of this

    suggesting Robert Southey as an alternative attribution, Shine
    cites JM III's Register and says to see also Southey 262,
    269.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. The article is claimed by Barrow in
    articles #368, #522, and #641. In his <i>QR</i>
    articles<i>,</i> it was Barrow's signature practice to refer to
    his own works. As Barrow does elsewhere, the author praises the
    Serampore Baptist missionaries for their contribution to
    Chinese translation.&nbsp;In the light of Murray MS., WG to JM,
    6 Sept. 1815, quoted above, Shine sets aside the attribution to
    Southey in JM III's Register. Misled by letters in the Murray
    archives, JM III attributed the article to Southey; in doing so
    he ignored JM II's marked <i>QR</i>. The article is not in
    Southey's definitive MS. list, and note the following letters
    from Southey to Murray in which he seems to propose a review of
    this work but retires in favour of Barrow. Murray MS., Robert
    Southey to JM, 10 Feb. 1815: 'The Methodist traveller in Africa
    is odd and amusing .... Most probably Barrow will take him in
    hand, &amp; then he will fare but scurvily .... I can however
    steer clear of him by making a history of the mission in South
    Africa.' Murray MS., Southey to JM, 15 Feb. 1818, promises
    Wellington first [#343], Egypt [#332], and South Africa.
    Southey to JM, 25 Feb. 1815: 'Though the Travels are not all
    that might be wished they contain a great deal of curious
    information.' Murray MS., Southey to JM, 26 June 1815: 'You see
    I rightly supposed that Campbell's Travels lay within Mr.
    Barrow's line of demarcation.' Unlike Southey's writing, the
    article is uninventive and has no strong thesis. In keeping
    with Barrow's usual manner, the article is mainly factual with
    an emphasis on geographical discovery, natural history, and the
    study of races.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., Robert Southey to JM, 31
    Dec. 1816, asks to be sent 'the American voyage (Porters) which
    was so properly dealt with by Barrow.' The article's author
    refers back to #68, which is also by Barrow. In his <i>QR</i>
    articles<i>,</i> it was Barrow's signature practice to refer to
    his own works. Note on page 352 the author's pride in
    possessing the only copy in England of this book. (Barrow was
    prone to self-promotion.) Compare the author's doubts about
    cannibalism on pg.367 with similar sentiments expressed in #68
    and #311, both of which are by Barrow. Note the repetition on
    pp.367-68 of Dentrecasteaux's mistaking 'the bones of a
    kangaroo for those of a young girl' mentioned in #68 (p.30) and
    #311 ('the bones of a kangaroo for those of a girl,' p.23). The
    author transcribes Admiralty correspondence (pp.376-77) and
    manages to work in new information about the <i>Bounty</i>
    mutiny, another of Barrow's preoccupations. Galapagos is
    spelled in the article's head note as above. Cruise is spelled

    Shine also quotes from Murray MS., WG to JM, 21 Sept 1815: 'I
    have also taken much pains with Cohen, &amp; his article will
    be amusing.' In suggesting Taylor as an alternative
    attribution, Shine cites Surtees xiv. In suggesting Walter
    Scott as a third alternative attribution, Scott cites Grierson
    IV 544, 544n.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and
    discussion is published here for the first time. The topic is
    very much in Cohen's (Francis Palgrave's) vein and bears his
    marks: the article is extraordinarily erudite and almost
    tediously comprehensive. However, the article is claimed by
    George Taylor in his <i>Memoir of Robert Surtees</i> [1852],
    xiv. In the absence of additional primary evidence, there is no
    reason to discount Taylor's claim; indeed, it needs to be
    accounted for. On the other hand, there is also no reason to
    think that at the last minute WG withdrew the article Cohen had
    evidently produced. There is no other article in this Number
    that could be by Cohen (nor, for that matter, is there an
    article in Number 27 that might plausibly have been written by
    him). On balance, there are solid reasons to speculate that
    Cohen produced an article, WG found it obscure or otherwise
    intractable, and handed it on to George Taylor for sub-editing.
    The pains WG says were taken were probably taken by Taylor,
    which is why in his list Taylor thought to lay claim to the
    article.</span></p>

    "smallprint">In attributing the article to Southey, Shine cites
    JM III's Register; Robinson I 178; Warter II 411, 413, 416-17,
    418, 421-22, 425, 429-30, III 5-6, 13; Cottle 242-43;
    <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> XXI 140; Young 251; Brightfield
    322; Halloway in <i>RES</i> X 63; Coleridge 267-78; and Southey
    317. Shine also quotes from the following letters. Murray MS.,
    WG to JM, 29 Sept. 1815: 'Of Southey's I think very highly, I
    carried it to our friend that he might insert the letters etc,
    as he desired.' [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note:
    The reference may be to Croker or Hay and to #350 or #351, but
    is more likely to #352.] Iowa MS., JM to Croker, 2 Nov. 1815:
    'Mr Gifford received yesterday the Revise which is not yet
    worked off &amp; we might yet be in time for the interesting
    account of the Battle which you mention. Should you think it
    right to trust it to Gifford and Southey who is here on his
    return from Brussels ....' Murray MS., WG to JM, [?1815]: 'Mr
    Southey has brought back the name of Alexander Davidson ... for
    <u>Alexander</u> <u>Davidson</u> read an <u>individual</u> or a
    <u>gentleman</u> &amp; omit <u>free spirit</u> before liberal,
    and it may do, though I do not see the necessity of it.' [Cf.
    p.523.] Murray MS., WG to JM, [25 Nov. 1815]: 'I wish Southey
    had not been quite so obstinate, but his Article is of such
    surpassing merit that tis not possible to be angry. Still our
    friend has done it much good unperceived by S.' [<i>Quarterly
    Review</i> Archive editor's note: The friend may be Robert
    William Hay but is probably Croker, though in his Clements
    Library holograph lists, Croker does not claim co-authorship of
    this article.]</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. The article appears in Southey's
    definitive MS. list of his <i>QR</i> articles. Murray MS., WG
    to JM, 21 Sept. 1815: 'Southey just called with Grosvenor
    Bedford &amp; his brother.... I will... take care of the
    Letters &amp;c. for the Art. I think it a fine spirited piece
    of writing, &amp; such as will do us great credit.' Iowa MS.
    (f. 104), JM to John Wilson Croker, 20 Oct. 1815: 'I have no
    doubt that Mr Scott has sent you a copy of his poem
    <u>Waterloo</u>. ... I am anxious too for the earliest
    opportunity of offering my best acknowledgements for the most
    valuable communications which you have been so good as to make
    to Mr Gifford lately which render the Article in which they are
    comprised the most important that ever yet appeared in my
    Review or in any other.' [The reference may instead be to #350
    or #351]. Iowa MS. (f. 105), JM to John Wilson Croker, 30 Oct.
    1815: 'As there is just a chance of some accidents I write to
    say that Mr Gifford is in unutterable despair at not receiving
    back the Revise of our Waterloo which he sent you the week
    before last.'&nbsp;</span></p>
