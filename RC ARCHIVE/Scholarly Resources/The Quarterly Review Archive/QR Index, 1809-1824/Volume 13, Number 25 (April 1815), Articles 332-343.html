    published here for the first time. Bodleian MS., Eng. lett. 134
    (f.41), John Keble to John Taylor Coleridge, [11 Apr. 1815],
    says he thinks <i>The Velvet Cushion</i> should be defended
    against the review in Rennell's <i>British Critic</i>. The
    Keble - Coleridge letters appear to suggest that Keble did not
    contribute to the <i>QR</i> in this period; there is no
    indication in the letters that Coleridge took up Keble's
    suggestion and submitted a review. A man named Collinson
    (certainly either John Collinson or his uncle Septimus
    Collinson) is a candidate for authorship of this article. He is
    mentioned as a contributor by John Wilson Croker in an 1823
    letter to John Murray: '... remember the necessity of absolute
    secrecy on this point, and indeed on all others. If you were to
    publish such names as Cohen and Croker and Collinson and
    Coleridge, the magical WE would have little effect, and your
    Review would be absolutely despised&#8212;omne ignotum pro
    mirifico.' (Croker to Murray, Brighton, 29 March 1823 quoted in
    Smiles II 57-58). In the article's head note, the word 'new'
    appears in lower case, as above. See also #327.</span></p>

    at #457 (twice) and #531 (specific reference), both of which

    the author's adoption of the form '30th January, 1805,' '1st

    "smallprint">Defends Mungo Park against the accusation that
    much of his <i>Journal</i> was composed by another hand and the

    The article summarizes the narrative from Park's <i>Journal</i>
    of his exploration of the Niger River and provides a lengthy
    narrative of Park's death from dysentery. It concludes with a
    discussion of the source of the Niger. The author speculates
    that the Niger meets the Nile and that the Niger and Zaire
    rivers are one and the same.&nbsp;</span></p>

    "smallprint">In the absence of guidance from JM III's Register,
    Shine does suggest an author for this article.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following information was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 28. Support for the attribution to
    Lyall is based entirely on internal evidence. In the opinion of
    the present writer, the strongest element in this evidence is
    the article's commonality with Lyall's known method of
    argumentation. The author's dependence on italicized words and
    phrases is a peculiar practice shared by Lyall. There is a
    reference in the article to #322, which is by Lyall,
    specifically to 'doubts respecting the substantial existence of
    those many simple and elementary faculties with which the mind
    is commonly considered endowed' (p.165.)&nbsp; In #322 and #339
    the review impugns the authors' motives and mildly and
    ironically chides their character. In both articles the
    authors' arguments are placed under a microscope and
    methodically dissected; in both articles the author employs a
    gentle satire. In both cases the reviewer believes the authors'
    suppositions do not stand up under close scrutiny. The author
    of #322 and the author of #339 very frequently employ italics;
    each repeatedly uses the phrases 'we do not,' 'we would not,'
    'we have not,' and 'having thus'. Similarly, the reviewer of
    Wordsworth in #362 (Lyall, attributed on fairly good evidence),
    like the reviewers in #332 and #339, challenges the consistency
    of the author's assertions and his practice (in Wordsworth's
    case, his claim to write in the simple language of everyday is
    contradicted, the reviewer says, by his poems, whose language,
    expression, and meaning are obscure). The author of these three
    articles is fond of the uncommon word 'phraseology.' Against
    the attribution to Lyall is the comment on page 161 of #339
    that author suffers from 'imperfect eye-sight.' In his
    portraits and in his effigy in Canterbury cathedral, Lyall is
    not represented as wearing spectacles. Perhaps misleadingly, WG
    was effectively blind in one eye.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Richard Chenevix, a reviewer in the
    <i>QR</i> who later wrote on Gall and Spurzheim, would be a
    candidate except that, as John van Wyhe notes (in a personal
    correspondence with the present writer, quoted by permission),
    'it is unlikely that Chenevix wrote the <i>QR</i> article. His
    later <i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i> article was a glowing
    confirmation of phrenology, and the <i>QR</i> article was the
    first to really damn phrenology in Britain (excepting one in
    the <i>Edinburgh</i> in 1803). The <i>QR</i> article on
    Spurzheim came at a time when Spurzheim was first touring
    Britain and published his first book. The article is really a
    rebuke of Spurzheim's pretension.'</span></p>
