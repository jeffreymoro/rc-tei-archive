      <br /></li>

      <li>In the same <i>Courier</i> advertisement the following
      notice appears, evidently in response to booksellers' and
      subscribers' frustration with the inability of the
      <i>Quarterly</i>'s publisher and editor to turn out a Number
      on time:<br />

        <blockquote>
          <p>No. 11 will be published on the First of October; and
          the future Numbers regularly every three months.</p>
        </blockquote><br />
        The advertisement was repeated every day to Monday, 30
        Sept. 1811 and one more time, on 2 Oct. 1811. Compare Iowa
        MS, f.147, JM to John Wilson Croker, Wednesday [1811]: 'We
        must publish our Number on the first of October.'<br />
        <br />

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Copleston offered to review this work,
    but he thought 'a Scotch gentleman' recommended by Henry Home
    Drummond would be preferable. WG and Copleston understood this
    gentleman to be 'Brown,' (probably <a href=
    "http://www.thoemmes.com/404.asp?404;http://www.thoemmes.com/encyclopedia/brown.htm"
    target="_blank">Thomas Brown, 1778-1820</a>; follow link to
    offsite encyclopedia) a man they trusted. In May 1811, the
    article still had not arrived and WG and Copleston were
    mortified to learn that the writer was not Brown but Macvey
    Napier, of whom WG knew nothing. (Napier, editor of the
    supplement to <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, later became
    editor of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>.) With Richard Heber
    acting as sub-editor, WG excised an unflattering reference to
    Copleston on the question of Oxford University
    instruction.&nbsp; In the late 1830s or early 1840s, John
    Murray II recorded the mistaken suggestion that 'Archdeacon
    Lyall' had written the article.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Devon MS. 1149M (f.82), WG to
    Edward Copleston, 17 Feb. 1811, says he learned through Richard
    Heber that Copleston had offered to review Stewart, though he
    had also suggested 'a Scotch gentleman' who would be
    preferable. Henry Home Drummond had forwarded an offer from
    'this person.' Devon MS. 1149M (f.83), WG to Copleston, 26 Feb.
    1811, thanks Copleston for surrendering the topic. Devon MS.
    1149M (f.91), WG to Copleston, 31 May 1811, says the Stewart
    article has still not arrived and '... what is more to be
    lamented, I fear, is, that we are all wrong with respect to the
    writer. This morning's post, I had a note from Home Drummond
    communicating under secrecy, his name, which, notwithstanding
    the injunction, I think it necessary to mention to you. It is
    not Brown but <u>Napier</u>&mdash;a person of whom I know
    nothing. Is he known to you?' Devon MS. 1149M (f.93), WG to
    Copleston, 4 Aug. 1811, says Richard Heber told him that
    Copleston had seen 'our Northern friend's contribution,' a
    cause for regret because WG had not yet edited the ms. and
    there was a passage in it he thought personally offensive to
    Copleston. BL MS. 34611 (ff.15-16), WG to Macvey Napier, 25
    Aug. 1811, says he omitted the references to Copleston as
    inconsistent with the journal's line on the Oxford University
    controversy. Devon MS. 1149M (f.94), WG to Copleston, 26 Aug.
    1811: 'I thank you for your hints on Stewart's
    article&mdash;all of which I have attended to. ... Your
    allusion to Macvey's omissions to the second &amp; certainly
    the most interesting &amp; amusing part, only serve to increase
    my regret&mdash;I hate to think of it, though I sinned
    innocently.' Devon MS. 1149M (f.100), WG to Copleston, 27 Oct.
    1811: 'I hope you will find nothing to give you offence in the
    1st Article&mdash;I did my best with it; but unfortunately, I
    am but a tyro on the subject, and had no one to advise
    with&mdash;Your letters, however (for I saw Heber's) were of
    signal service to me.' John Murray, with Cadell and Davies, was
    the London publisher of the volume under review. (Constable was
    its Edinburgh publisher.)&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. The evidence for an attribution to
    Barrett, though persuasive, is not definitive. The attribution
    to George Ellis in JM III's Register apparently derives solely
    from JM II's marked <i>QR</i>. It is possible that Barrett
    wrote the article and that WG and Canning devolved
    sub-editorial responsibility for it onto Ellis. Harewood MS.,
    WG to George Canning, 26 July 1811: 'Barrett is not very
    correct&mdash;but I certainly wished that you should look at
    his m.s. to see if it be safe. The poor fellow is extremely
    anxious to have it in the Quarterly, and no less so that you
    should see it. You have a devoted admirer in him .... I will do
    all you suggest.' The reference is probably to Eaton Stannard
    Barrett (1786-1820).</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note, modified:
    'Mathison ... states that "the motive which suggested the
    publication, is a desire to rouse the attention of planters to
    a recollection of their own true interests; to explain to
    those, who may not have had the same opportunities of
    observing, in what manner the circumstances of their
    plantations may be affected, either beneficially or otherwise,
    by the abolition of the slave-trade." While the <i>Notices
    Respecting Jamaica</i> certainly focuses on the treatment of
    slaves, Mathison is a careful observer of his surroundings. He
    comments on the climate, medical conditions, the kinds of work
    done on the plantations.']</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., Book Loans Register:
    earlier volumes of Edgeworth were sent to 'Mr. Richardson' on 8
    July 1809 and to 'Geo. Ellis' on 5 Dec. 1809. Murray MS.,
    George Ellis to JM, 3 Dec. 1809, says a review should be done
    of Edgeworth on education. Devon MS. 1149M (f.75), WG to Edward
    Copleston, 3 Jan. 1810, agrees to review Edgeworth. Murray MS.,
    Ellis to JM, [n.d.], says he will not write on Edgeworth and
    education because it is in abler hands. Murray MS., WG to JM,
    [n.d.], says the article on Edgeworth is 'heavy, because our
    friend has taken the wrong course' and suggests it be revised.
    Devon MS. 1149M (f.81), WG to Copleston, 11 Feb. 1811: 'I
    flattered myself that Mr Davison was at work for us. Heber told
    me that he felt inclined to say something on Edgeworth. I have
    an article on him but I fear somewhat too feeble &amp; I
    postponed it in the hope that the subject would be taken up by
    our friend [i.e., Davison]. Will you have the goodness to make
    my respects to him &amp; say that nothing can give me more
    pleasure than to find &lt;him&gt; [paper tear] disposed to

    prefer? What book shall I send?' Devon MS. 1149M (f.82), WG to
    Copleston, 17 Feb. 1811: 'I shall be extremely glad of Mr
    Davison's Edgeworth. I have a neat but <u>feeble</u> review of
    it, which, at any rate, I shall not use, after what has
    appeared in the Edin. Rev. ....' Devon MS. 1149M (f.92), WG to
    Copleston, 24 June 1811: 'Mr Davison I look upon as sure for
    the next No.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [Sept. 1811]: 'Do not form
    your opinion of D'Oyly [#164] till he is set up &amp; seen
    together .... Davidson [<i>sic</i>], however, must come first.'
    Devon MS. 1149M (f.100), WG to Copleston, 27 Oct. 1811: 'If you
    do not admire our friend Davison, I shall admire at you. Is it
    not truly excellent?'</span></p>

    Murray MS., WG to JM, n.d.: 'If you mean&mdash;by being no
    Calvinist that D'Oyly is not to come in, I do not see how this
    can be.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [9 Oct. 1811]: 'There are two

    WG to JM, [Oct. 1811]: 'I send D'Oyly which I have

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following information and
    evidence is published here for the first time. Devon MS. 1149M

    the Bishop of Lincoln [Tomline] is by D'Oyly ... with a little
    assistance.'&nbsp;Smiles at I 203 supplies a more complete
    transcription of Murray MS., WG to JM, n.d.: 'If you
    mean&mdash;by being no Calvinist that D'Oyly [Smiles
    transcribes this as 'Daly'] is not to come in, I do not see how
    this can be&mdash;as we shall have an article from Mr. C. in
    the No. following. Nor can I frame excuses for your omissions.
    This business begins to get too heavy for me, and I must soon
    have done, I fear.' Smiles interprets the undated letter as
    applying to #194, which is also by D'Oyly, but Shine may be
    correct in applying it instead to #164, as the reference in it
    to 'an article from Mr. C. in the No. following' may be to
    Edward Copleston's review of Ensor in #173. Copleston evidently
    took an interest in #164 and WG may have worried that to
    dispense with it may have upset Copleston. The word ancient is
    spelled in the article's head note as above.</span></p>

    Brahmin excesses on p.216 of this article resembles similar
    passages in other articles by Barrow: on p.109 of article #160
    and on p.418 of #529. Article #496, p.76, also probably by
    Barrow, discusses Hindu infanticide. Still, in the absence of
    direct primary evidence or allusions to other articles by
    Barrow (Barrow's signature practice in his <i>QR</i> articles

    This is one of the earliest works on the widespread practice of
    female infanticide and was based on Moor's own observations and
    on access to unpublished government sources. Despite the
    efforts of Company officials, such as Jonathan Duncan in Bombay
    (to whom Moor dedicated his Hindu Pantheon), Alexander Walker
    in Gujerat, Montstuart Elphinstone, and John Campbell, progress
    in stopping the practice was slow and it persisted in some of

    co-attributing the article to Southey and Gifford, Shine cites
    JM III's Register; Robberds II 348: 'All the stings ... drawn';
    Southey 577 and 278: 'all the shot of my heavy artillery ...
    drawn before the guns were fired'; Cottle 242-43; Warter 248,
    250, 298; <i>CHEL&nbsp;</i>XIV 449; and <i>CBEL</i> III 107.
    Shine says to see also Southey 278 and Warter II 236. Shine
    quotes from the following letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, [9
    Oct. 1811]: 'I send you the remainder of Southey ... great care
    must be taken to see that the last page be properly filled up
    from my corrected proof.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [18 Oct.
    1811']: '... I have taken fright upon reading over the last
    sheet. I am quite afraid at Southey's violence and must leave
    out the passages which attack the ER so personally. I am sure
    Mr Ellis would be displeased. ... We must not ... enter into
    our friend Southey's quarrel.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [18 Oct.
    1811; notation on letter in JM II's hand: 'Bell &amp;
    Lancaster]: '... I am alarmed at the danger we ran&mdash;I am
    quite sure we should have terrified our best friends .... Pray
    do not let a line of the last sheet go out. I have desired
    Rowarth's boy to call at half past 8 by which time all the
    omissions will be made.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [18 Oct. 1811]:
    '... I hope that I have made Southey now safe &amp; am
    confident that I have taken no part of his spirit or meaning
    from him. I was doubtful of the king &amp; princess [?Prince]
    for the king unluckily supported Lancaster, &amp; of the
    prince, I knew nothing&mdash;Nor do I quite believe what he
    said of the ministers&mdash;for Perceval, I rather think is not
    so warm as he fancies. He is now safe.' BL MS. 30928, Robert
    Southey to Charles Danvers, 24 Oct. 1811: 'Dr Bell is also at
    Keswick. I have been fighting his battles in the Quarterly,
    &amp; had not my work been mutilated even more unmercifully
    than usual, this essay would have been the severest blow that
    the Edinburgh Review ever received ....'</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following information and
    evidence is published here for the first time. WG excised
    attacks in the article on Francis Jeffrey and Sydney Smith, the
    editor and a leading writer of the <em>QR</em>'s rival, the
    <em>Edinburgh Review</em>. WG seems also to have suppressed
    Southey's assumptions about the opinions of other prominent
    persons, including members of the Royal family. Southey,
    angered by the cuts, extracted from JM the promise that he
    could reprint the article with the suppressed portions
    restored. This was against JM's policy; during WG's tenure,
    Southey and Barrow alone were allowed to republish their
    <i>QR</i> articles. The article, in an expanded form, appeared
    under Southey's name as a pamphlet, <i>The Origin, Nature, and
    Object of the New System of Education</i>.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Claimed by Southey in his
    definitive MS. list of his <i>QR</i> articles. Devon MS. 1149M
    (f.101), WG to Edward Copleston, 29 Oct. 1811: 'You are right
    as to Southey&mdash;He is, indeed, a most excellent creature. I
    found it necessary to omit a few personal attacks on Jeffrey
    &amp; Sydney Smith, &amp; he (Southey) tells me he proposes
    with Murray's leave, (which he will procure) to reprint the
    Article some little time hence with additions &amp; sharp
    animadversions, in his own name. He is a most valuable
    friend.'&nbsp;</span></p>
