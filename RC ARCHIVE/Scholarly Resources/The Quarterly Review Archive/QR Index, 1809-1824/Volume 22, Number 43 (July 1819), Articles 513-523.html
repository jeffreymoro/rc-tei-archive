    "smallprint">In attributing the article to Croker, Shine cites
    JM III's Register and Brightfield 454. Shine records a definite
    attribution to Croker, despite the qualification in JM III's
    Register.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 28. While the article is included in
    the Cambridge University bound volumes of Croker's articles and
    while it is claimed by Croker in five of his Clements Library
    MS. lists, in what is demonstrably the latest of the
    comprehensive lists, the article is queried. The evidence for
    Croker is therefore not definitive. To the present writer, with
    the exception of the opening pages, there are aspects of this
    article that do not resemble Croker, in particular the author's
    preference for some French jurisprudential practices over
    English ones and his charitable and accommodating tone. It is
    possible that Croker collaborated with another author or
    heavily sub-edited someone else's work.</span></p>
