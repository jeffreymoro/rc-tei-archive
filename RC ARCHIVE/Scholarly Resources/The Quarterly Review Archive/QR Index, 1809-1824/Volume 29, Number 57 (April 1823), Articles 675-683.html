    or if that is not ready perhaps his America, which I suppose is

    Numerous Murray MS., John Barrow to JM letters in this period
    refer to the preparation of an article on America. There is an
    allusion on page 13 of the article to page 377 of article #667,
    an article by Barrow on Franklin's expedition to the polar sea.
    It was Barrow's signature practice in his <i>QR</i> articles to

    governor of Michigan for the purpose of visiting and
    negotiating with various Indian tribes of the Old Northwest. In
    this case, he also proposed to determine the source of the
    Mississippi River. Schoolcraft's narrative is interwoven with a

    the article only for Procter.</span></p>

    <p class="smallprint">The following evidence and information is
    published here for the first time. Murray MS., George Procter
    to JM, 25 Nov. 1822: 'I will with the greatest of pleasure see
    what I can do in the way of making an Article on the Spanish
    War ....' The Shine volume is mistaken in co-attributing the
    article to Croker for to do so would lead to the re-attribution
    of dozens of articles to Gifford who, like Croker in this
    instance, liberally applied his editorial pen to bring the
    article up to standard. In the holograph lists of his articles
    preserved at the Clements Library, Ann Arbor, Croker indicates
    with a 'P' articles he claims part responsibility for, but
    Croker claims article #677 in <i>none</i> of his holograph
    lists, nor is the article included in the bound volumes of
    Croker's articles preserved at the Cambridge University
    Library. Smiles II 57-58 is a transcription of John Wilson
    Croker to John Murray, Brighton, 29th March 1823, in which
    Croker discusses at length his reasons for 'plastering up'
    Procter's review. Croker lamented 'This cursed system of
    writing dissertations' and pledged, should he continue to edit
    the journal, to put an end to it. He proposed that Murray pay
    as much for one sheet as for two or three and that longer
    articles should be 'permitted only for matters of great and
    immediate interest and importance.' There is a specific
    reference in a note on page 84 of #677 to article #46, by
    George Canning and George Ellis. John Murray published the
    volume under review.</p>

    Murray MS., John Barrow to JM, 18 Aug. 1823, states
    unequivocally that he is the author and that Canning edited the

    <p class="smallprint">The following evidence was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 28. The author of #601 (Whittington)
    briefly discusses the Tatars (pp.42-43). In the absence of more
    specific guidance from JM III's Register, Shine identifies
    Whittington only by his last name. His forenames are
    established from the evidence of a letter quoted at #601:
    Murray MS., H. D. Whittington to JM, Brighton [1 Oct. 1821
    postmark]: 'As you were kind enough to say that you would send

    Shine cites JM III's Register and Copleston 34. Shine also
    quotes from the following letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, [July
    1823]: 'Mr Buckland, I know complains that he has been treated
    solely as a geological writer&mdash;but he aspires to something
    higher, and it was this which made me wish for a more
    philosophical view of the subject: and this the Provost could
    well have given.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [July 1823]: 'The
    Provost of Oriel has written to me this morning to say that he
    has an Article on Buckland, taking a philosophical view of the
    subject. This is just what is wanted, as our friend Barrow has
    already given us the technical part of it: which is but a
    narrow contemplation of a great question sufficiently important
    in many respects.' [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's
    note: Cf. #646, on Buckland, by Barrow. Shine misses the
    significance of this letter in establishing the author of
    #646.] Murray MS, WG to JM, [Sept. 1823]: 'The Provost, from
    whom I heard today, promises to be ready in three or four
    weeks, but wishes for a later place. He will take
    pains.'&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="smallprint">The following evidence is published here
    for the first time. Wales MS. 21743C (17/2), WG to Edward
    Copleston, Thursday, [?July 1823; notation at top of letter in
    Copleston's hand: 'Wrote to Buckland&mdash;from
    Exeter&mdash;July 14.1823']: 'I recall ... [y]ou said nothing,
    I think, of taking up Buckland; but I never heard a syllable
    before of Barrow's new attempt. Can Murray be acquainted with
    it? I have written to him to inform him of your kind
    inclination. You will probably see him on your return, when he
    will naturally speak to you of my letter. I made not the least
    allusion to Barrow.' Murray MS., Cash Book 1821-24, p.264:
    'Quarterly Review 57 23 Sept 1823 ... 1 Dr Copleston / 1 Revd T
    R Malthus [#682] / 1 Prof Buckland / 1 Revd Blanco White [#683]
    .... Rejected ... Reliq Diluv.' The rejected article might be
    by Barrow. William Buckland, it seems, was himself working on
    an article, perhaps back in 1821-22. Murray MS., WG to JM,
    Ramsgate, 17 July [n.y., but the letter is among the 1825
    letters]: 'I see Buckland inst[alled] &lt;canonry&gt; of
    C[orpus]. C[hristi]. He owes something to the Quarterly. But
    see how Copleston gets on! Whately, Senior, &amp; Buckland all
    in the course of a year!' In 1825 Senior was made professor of
    political economy at Oxford, Whately was made principal of St
    Alban's Hall. BL MS. 59416 Grenville Papers (f.93), Edward
    Copleston to Lord Grenville, Sidmouth, 10 Dec. 1823: 'Knowing
    as I do the interest your Lordship takes in Buckland's
    Geological pursuits, I am inclined to hope that you will not
    think my vacation wholly misemployed in reviewing his late work
    on the Deluge. I have just sent off the article, which is to
    appear in the next number of the Quarterly Review. It appeared
    to me a good opportunity of making known the importance of his
    labours in a theological point of view, and of impressing upon
    the public mind a just sense of his services, which I think,
    are not sufficiently estimated even at Oxford.' John Murray
    published the volume under review.</p>
