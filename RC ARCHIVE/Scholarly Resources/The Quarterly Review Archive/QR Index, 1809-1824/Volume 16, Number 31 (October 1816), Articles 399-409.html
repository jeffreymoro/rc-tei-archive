        <ul>
          <li>Continuing industrial depression and unrest in
          England. Riots occur at the opening of Parliament; a
          working-class insurrection is put down in Derbyshire;
          seven members of the Society of Luddites are hanged under
          the Frame-breaking Bill; the "Manchester Blanketers"
          march on London; Hampden Clubs petition Parliament for
          reform; May-June, Oliver the Spy, a government agent
          provocateur, urges a general rising; in June Jeremiah
          Brandreth leads an abortive rebellion at Pentridge,
          Derbyshire.&nbsp;<br /></li>

          <li>Political unrest in England leads in March to passing
          of the so-called Coercion Acts, including the suspension
          of Habeus Corpus and the suppression of radical and
          democratic societies.<br /></li>

          <li>A bill for the relief of Roman Catholics from civil
          and religious disabilities was defeated in 1817, but
          Roman Catholics are admitted to the Army and Navy;
          additional legislation passed to enforce duty to maintain
          curates (57 Geo. III. c.99, cl. xlviii ff.); in May 1817,
          Thomas Chalmers is a sensation in London.<br /></li>

          <li><i>Black Dwarf</i>, a radical magazine, is founded by
          William Hone. Hone is put on trial by the government over
          his publishing of <i>Political Litany</i>.<br /></li>

          <li>Oct. 1817 <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i> is
          founded with John Murray having a part-interest in the
          journal; Byron publishes <i>Beppo: A Venetian Story</i>
          and <i>Manfred: A Dramatic Poem</i>; Coleridge publishes
          <i>Biographia Literaria</i> and <i>Sibylline Leaves</i>,
          the first volume of his collected poems. The edition
          contains "Dejection, an Ode" and a revision of "The Rime
          of the Ancient Mariner"; Keats publishes <i>Poems</i>
          (see <i>QR</i> #473); in May Mary Shelley finishes

    "smallprint">In attributing the article to Barrow, Shine cites
    only JM III's Register.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and
    discussion is published here for the first time. Murray MS.,
    Book Loans Register: the book reviewed was sent to 'John
    Barrow' on 9 Nov. 1816. The article is referred to in #472,
    which is also by Barrow. In his <i>QR</i> articles<i>,</i> it
    was Barrow's signature practice to refer to his own
    works.&nbsp;The author was paid &pound;17.11 for the article
    (Murray MS. Cash Day Book 1814-1816). John Murray published the
    book under review.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The possible influence of this
    article (and the critical authority of the <i>QR</i> in
    general) in the development of Shelley's 'Ozymandias' (1818)
    has been overlooked. As is well known, Shelley and his circle
    loathed and feared the <i>QR</i> for its politics and the
    supposed tyranny of its criticism, so much so that Hunt and
    Hazlitt, who by the time Shelley wrote his poem had been the
    object of critical stings (Hunt #374, Hazlitt #425), issued
    prose invectives against the <i>QR</i>'s editor. Shelley,
    against all logic and reason, some years later blamed Keats's
    death on the <i>QR</i>'s 1818 review of <em>Endymion</em>
    (#473, an article by Croker, although Shelley and others blamed
    Gifford for it). With the imagery and themes of Shelley's
    famous poem in mind, it is reasonable to speculate that in
    'Ozymandias' Shelley may have subliminally or even
    self-consciously figured-forth his hatred of Gifford.* The
    'sneer of cold command' can be seen as a comment on the
    <i>QR</i>'s critical despotism. The poem is often read as a
    meditation on the impermanence of power; why not, then, a
    meditation on the fleeting nature of the critic's invective and
    the ultimate triumph of the poet's art. Contemplating the
    <i>QR</i> as rhetorical occasion&mdash;Barrow's article as a
    crucible of imagery and the real source of some of Shelley's
    famous lines&mdash;could be a fruitful line of inquiry. See
    especially pages 9-11 of the article: '... that one single
    measurement of the remnant of a statue of red granite, lying
    among the ruins of the Memnonium, "whose dimensions across the
    shoulders were twenty-five feet," ... surrounded as they were
    by whole colonnades of gigantic columns, some of them seventy
    feet high ... and by fragments of colossal statues, whose
    dimensions almost exceed belief. ... Among the ruins of Luxor,
    Pococke measured a statue of one single stone sixty feet high;
    but he found no traces of the statue of Osymandyas, whose foot
    (said to be 10 1/2 feet long) bore this inscription:&mdash;"I
    am the king of kings, Osymandyas&mdash;if any one would know
    how great I am, and where I lie, let him exceed the works I
    have done.' ... many illustrious travellers of antiquity, who
    had come thither to hear the sounds emitted by the statue when
    struck by the first rays of the sun ....'</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">*(Shelley and his friends thought
    the review against them were by WG; really John Wilson Croker
    and John Taylor Coleridge were the reviewers of Shelley and his
    circle.)</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The subject of this article was
    reviewed in <i>ER</i> #782, Dec. 1816, possibly by E. D.
    Clarke.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and
    information is published here for the first time. Internal
    evidence suggests that the article is almost certainly by
    Barrow, but no objective evidence to secure the attribution to
    Barrow has been discovered. The author introduces topics that
    Barrow frequently treats in other reviews and expresses opinons
    that are consistent with Barrow's views elsewhere. On p.82 the
    author illustrates his idea that Christianity elevates women's
    morals, using the example of Robert Adams of Pitcairn Island of
    <i>Bounty</i> mutiny fame. The identical sentiment and
    illustration of it appears in #347 (p.380), an article by
    Barrow. The author denies cannibalism (p.80), and dwells on
    female form (p.79), both of which are preoccupations of
    Barrow's in a number of his articles. The author is more
    negative toward missionaries here than Barrow is elsewhere:
    'Little as we are disposed to attach value to the missionary
    labours, in general, for their progress in converting savages
    to the Christian religion, and least of all to those of the
    Evangelical or Methodist missionaries,&mdash;whose ignorance
    and absurd conduct and conversation make them, in fact, a
    laughing-stock even to the savages ....' but nevertheless calls
    for 'the&nbsp; Church of England to be sent. ... ' The author,
    as Barrow is elsewhere, is sympathetic to the equality of
    women: 'If Christianity had no other advantage than that of
    placing women on a level with the other sex, the dissemination
    of it is well worth our best exertions.'&nbsp; The author was
    paid &pound;10.4.4 for the article. (Murray MS. Cash Day Book
