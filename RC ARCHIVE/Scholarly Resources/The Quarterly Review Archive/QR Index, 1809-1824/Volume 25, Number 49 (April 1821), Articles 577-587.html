    accompany Charles Ritchie, who had been requested by the
    British government to undertake the exploration of the Sudan by
    way of Tripoli and Fezzan. Lyon knew some Arabic, but the
    expedition nonetheless turned out to be disastrous.
    Inadequately funded, their stores exhausted, and the weather
    impossibly hot, Ritchie died at Murzuk in the south of Fezzan
    in November, 1819. Lyon, suffering badly from dysentery, made
    his way back to Tripoli and thence to England, arriving in
    July, 1820. Despite his illness and his disappointment with
    this abortive venture, Lyon's literary abilities, excellent
    perceptions, and artistic talents made this one of the most
    entertaining and popular works on North Africa.']</span></p>

    Shine cites JM III's Register. Shine also quotes from Murray
    MS., WG to JM, [Sept. 1820]: 'Do not forget Southey, nor our
    Edinbg correspondent&mdash;for we must not lose any friends.
    His address is James Glassford, 52 Castle Str. Edinburgh
    ....'&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., Macvey Napier to JM, n.d:
    says William Erskine proposed Glassford's article to WG who
    approved it, it was forwarded by Macvey Napier to the Admiralty
    [to John Barrow, probably for the sake of saving postage], and
    was edited by WG, but the article did not appear until
    Glassford complained. Murray MS., James Glassford to JM, 19
    Apr. 1820, says that in 1817 at the request of Erskine he
    (Glassford) wrote the article and conveyed it to WG via Napier,
    WG approved it in his letter of 3 Dec. 1817.</span></p>
