      <li><span class="redbold">The Number was supposed to appear
      23 Jan. 1809</span>, as announced in the <i>Monthly Literary
      Advertiser</i>, 10 Jan. 1809. The desultory work habits of
      its editor, William Gifford, and that of some of his
      contributors led to delays. It was a pattern repeated
      throughout Gifford's tenure, resulting in considerable
      friction between publisher and editor. On that subject see
      <a href="../features/pub_dates.html" target=
      "_blank">Publication Dates of the <i>Quarterly
      Review</i></a>. Having failed to meet the January deadline,
      Murray announced the journal's appearance for the first day
      of March. Walter Scott wrote to John Murray that he saw the
      <em>Quarterly</em> advertised for that day. Indeed, the
      following advertisement appeared in the <i>Courier</i> 29
      Feb. 1809: 'Tomorrow, the first of March, will be published,
      in 8vo. / price 5s, the First Number of the <i>Quarterly
      Review</i> by John Murray, 32, Fleet-street, Hatchard,
      Piccadilly, and Richardson, Cornhill, London; John Ballantyne
      and Co. No.48, North Hanover-street, Edinburgh.' Copies of the journal were
      sent to Scotland in late February (a copy was obtained by
      Francis Jeffrey, editor of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
      probably via Archibald Constable, John Murray's some time
      Edinburgh business partner). Murray wished to have the
      <i>Quarterly</i> appear at the same time in London and
      Edinburgh and for that reason delayed its London release for
      a few days after it was printed (see Smiles, I 143, 145).
      Ballantyne, Murray's Edinburgh distributor, to whom Murray
      had granted a one-eighth share in the venture, had copies in
      hand by 28th February. These were advance copies for himself
      and Scott. That same day Murray sent to Ballantyne a supply
      of 200 copies.<br />
      <br /></li>

      <li><span class="redbold">Murray printed 3000 copies to
      accommodate anticipated interest;</span> for the next Number
      Murray expected to print between 1000 and 1500. For this
      first Number, 850 were sent to Scotland [Smiles, I
      147]<br /></li>

      reprinted the number, 1000 copies, on 14 July 1810. The
      reprinting sold out. Murray printed a third edition of this
      Number on 6 May 1811, a run of 1000 copies. The Third Edition
      cost Murray &pound;123, including &pound;52 for printing,

    and that 'Mr. Ellis has readily undertaken the Spanish article
    ....'</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time; the evidence clarifies Ellis's and
    Canning's respective roles in producing the article. Murray
    MS., Paid Contributors List for issue Number 1: the same person
    was paid for articles 1 and 18. Ellis is the author of article
    18 (#18). NLS MS. 3878 (f.6), WG to Walter Scott, 20 Jan. 1809:
    'Your excellent article is in hand: it will immediately follow
    that of G. Ellis&mdash;for which space is kept, as he is
    anxious to have the latest information from Spain.' Murray MS.,
    George Ellis to JM, [Feb. 1809], speaks of this article as his.
    BL MS. 28099 (f.86), WG to Ellis, 15 Nov. 1810: 'I read over
    yesterday your first Article on Spain with great delight ....'
    (Ellis wrote a second article on Spain, #46.)</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The article indirectly answers
    Francis Jeffrey and Henry Brougham's October 1808 <i>Edinburgh
    Review</i> article, 'Don Cevallos on the French Usurpation of
    Spain' (<i>ER</i> #439). That article, forthright in its
    declaration of republican principles, contributed to the
    formation of the QR. Other factors were involved, however, such
    as the commercial rivalry of John Murray with the publisher of
    the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, Archibald Constable, Walter
    Scott's and other writers' anger over negative or unfair
    reviews in the <i>Edinburgh</i>, and Robert Southey's and other
    religious-minded persons' upset over the <i>Edinburgh</i>'s
    anti-Christian bias. In the fall of 1808, WG asked Robert
    Southey to write on the subject of Spanish resistance. George
    Canning and John Murray were ready to object as they did not
    trust Southey's politics, but Southey declined in any case. He
    desired instead to answer Sydney Smith's <i>Edinburgh
    Review</i> articles on evangelical missions to India, which he
    did in article #17.</span></p>

    under William Wilberforce, popularly known as the Saints) on
    missionary work in India. Smith's articles are: ER 11 (Jan.
    1808):340-62; 12 (Apr. 1808): 151-81; 14 (Apr. 1809): 40-50. In
    two of these articles, Smith took the 1806 Vellore Mutiny in
    India as occasion for attacking India missions in particular
    and evangelicalism in general. Sepoys at Vellore had killed a
    number of British soldiers and expatriates. British authorities
    had covered up their own culpability in the affair (they had
    attempted to replace the Sepoys' turban with British military
    headgear) by shifting the blame to Baptist missionaries at
    Serampore for supposedly inflaming the Sepoys' religious zeal.
    A pamphlet war in England had ensued between evangelical and
    anti-missionary factions in the East India Company: Scott
    Waring and Thomas Twining for the anti-missions faction, and,
    for the evangelicals, two members of the Clapham Sect, Charles
    Grant, the powerful East India Company chairman, and Lord
    Teignmouth, former Governor General of India. Partly because he
    was offended by Smith's articles, in early 1808 Southey refused
    Walter Scott's request that he write for the <i>Edinburgh
    Review</i>. Pointing to the anti-Christian bias of the journal,
    and citing Smith's articles in particular, Southey attempted to
    shame Scott into breaking his association with the
    <i>Edinburgh</i>. Scott was deeply affected by Southey's action
    and arguments. These circumstances played a considerable role
    in the formation of the QR.</span></p>
