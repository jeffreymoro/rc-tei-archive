    I have ... looked over Greece, of which I must have a revise
    .... I wish the Greece had been half so soberly written [as
    #674 was].' Murray MS., WG to JM, [July 1823]: 'As for Greece,
    let it go as it is ... some allowance will be made for its
    enthusiastic tone&mdash;besides I have omitted a good deal that
    was objectionable.... Mr Haygarth is very anxious about its
    appearance: so pray indulge him.'&nbsp;</span></p>

    see no trace of its having been revised by any government hand.
    However, it is safe, though far from elegant and tasty. Jacob
    called here and read it while I was out. He made one or two
    marginal marks which I shall attend to. He appears ... to like
    it.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [July 1823]: '... I shall send off
    Spain with the next parcel &amp; not want to see it again ... I
    wish the Greece had been half so soberly written.' Murray MS.,
    WG to JM, [July 1823]: 'I send the remr of Spain. It is not
    necessary that I should see it again; but Mr H or some one for
    him, should look at the revise. ... I have lightened the Art
    &amp; it will not read amiss. The pencil m.s. at the end is by
    Mr Jacob, who read it as I believe I told you, in my absence. I
