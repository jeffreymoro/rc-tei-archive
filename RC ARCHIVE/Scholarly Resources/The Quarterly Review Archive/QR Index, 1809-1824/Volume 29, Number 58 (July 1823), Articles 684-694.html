    <p class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note, silently modified:
    'Important account of America by an English farmer dedicated to
    the Duke of Bedford and Thomas William Coke. Faux set off for
    America in order to determine emigration prospects in the wake
    of an exodus of his countrymen. His journal gives an account of
    his voyage from London to Boston and his visits to Charleston,
    Camden, Philadelphia, New York, Washington, Kentucky, Indiana
    and the Birkbeck settlement in Illinois. "Faux laps up stories
    that are unpleasant or frightening, including reports about
    bilious fever, ague, jaundice, and other diseases which might
    discourage emigration. Yet <em>Memorable Days in America</em>
    is not a one-sided account. It makes light of things British as
    well as American. On the whole it is as complimentary as it is
    critical. American dislike of the book was probably partly due
    to sensitiveness about any British criticism of American
    institutions in those postwar years." (Clark pp. 239-240)']</p>

    Thomas Law in <em>A Reply to Certain Insinuations, Published as

    Review</i> Archive editor's note: Shine, almost certainly
    incorrectly, conjectures that the 'Low' referred to in JM III's
    Register is David Low. In the Index of Contributors section,
    Shine speculates that this could be either David Low
    (1768-1855), the Bishop of Ross or David Low (1768-1859), a
    professor of agriculture at Edinburgh. But Shine appears to
    have been misled by JM III's spelling 'Low' as neither of the
    men Shine mentions is recorded as having taken any public
    interest in slavery or West Indian affairs; Joseph Lowe, on the
    other hand, in 1807 published an <i>Inquiry into the State of
    the British West Indies.</i>]</span></p>

    evidence is published here for the first time. The opening
    paragraph of the article, which constitutes a prefix and may be
    an editorial addition, contains a reference to #602, which is

    articles to refer to his own works. Murray MS., Robert John
    Wilmot Horton to WG, 20 Oct. 1824: says that he hears 'a good
    deal of interest among those persons who are connected with
    Abolition &amp; West India affairs' and that in the <i>New
    Times</i> a series of articles has been published attacking it
    under the signature 'Anglus'. Horton states that in the
    <i>Star</i> 'Vindex' has defended the article. Horton proposes
    bringing Vindex together in a pamphlet that could then be the
    subject of an article in the <i>QR</i>.&nbsp;There is a

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., Edward Edwards to WG, 23
    Mar. 1823: speaks about his article on ecclesiastical revenues.
    Edwards emerges at this time as a literary advisor to John
    Murray and he published numerous articles in the <i>QR</i>
    under Coleridge and Lockhart, some on topics related to this
    one. Liverpool Library MS., Reginald Heber to an unidentified
    correspondent, 'Saturday,' [n.d. but c. 1823] asks for the loan
    of Dr. Cove on <i>Ecclesiastical Revenues</i>. The letter can
    be dated approximately from the following statement: 'I think
    it as well to add that in conversing yesterday with some
    literary men at the Bishop of London's.&mdash;I heard a very
    high Character of Mr Coleridge&mdash;after the reports wh. we
    heard this is very satisfactory, as, in such a quarter, a
    person of doubtful religious opinions wd certainly have not
    been so highly spoken of.' Coleridge was being considered for
    the editorship at this time by the <i>QR</i>'s editorial
    coterie (to which Heber belonged). The article was reprinted,
    with changes, in an anonymous pamphlet, <i>The Revenues of the
    Church of England Not a Burden upon the Public</i> (London,
    1830). Heber died in India 1826, making it less likely that the
    article is his. The article is referred to on p.493 of
    <i>WI</i>#39, which is attributed to G. A. Dealtry.</span></p>
