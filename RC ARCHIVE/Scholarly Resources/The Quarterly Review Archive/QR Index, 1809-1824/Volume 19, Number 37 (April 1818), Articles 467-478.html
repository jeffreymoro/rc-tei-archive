    soon as he comes to town. Light's letter is very good&#8212;but
    what possesses these men to give their things away? What can
    Walpole do? He is at best, a feeble writer, while Light himself
    shows vivacity and a strength of remark. I wish we had known
    him before.' (Cf. #470, 'Walpole's letters to Montagu,'
    reviewed by Scott.)&nbsp; The article is referred to in #486
    (twice) and in #563, both of which are by Barrow. The article's
    author refers to #399 ('We have frequently been told that our
    review of that work contained more than was to be found in the

    accused of not reading the works which they affected to
    criticise. On the present occasion we shall anticipate the
    author's complaint, and honestly confess that we have not read
    his work. Not that we have been wanting in our duty&#8212;far
    from it&#8212;indeed, we have made efforts almost as superhuman
    as the story itself appears to be, to get through it; but with
    the fullest stretch of our perseverance, we are forced to
    confess that we have not been able to struggle beyond the first
    four books of which this Poetic Romance consists. ... it is
    not, we say, that the author has not powers of language, rays
    of fancy, and gleams of genius&#8212;he has all of these; but
    he is unhappily a disciple of the new school of what has
    somewhere been called Cockney poetry; which may be defined to
    consist of the most incongruous ideas in the most uncouth
    language. / Of this school, Mr. Leigh Hunt, as we observed in a
    former Number, aspires to be the hierophant.'

    exploration includes #451, #461, #474, #503, #585, #667, #705,

    #503, and by way of allusion in #667. Articles #406 and #451,
    also by Barrow, are alluded to in the article. In his <i>QR</i>
    articles<i>,</i> it was Barrow's signature practice to refer to
    his own works. The author has ready access to official
