    <p><span class="smallprint">The following information and

    Jacob to JM, 17 Feb. 1824, unequivocally refers to his
    <i>QR</i> paper on Mexico.&nbsp;Guatemala is spelled in the

    <p>[Booksellers' notes on Robinson: 'A highly important
    eyewitness account of Mexico during the late years of its wars
    for Independence. Robinson was one of the first U.S. writers on
    Mexican matters and here provides the first detailed
    information in English on General Mina's expedition against the
    royalist forces of Mexico, launched from the Southern U.S.
    Robinson also broaches here the possibility of a trans-isthmian
    canal through Nicaragua.' 'Important account of the Mexican
    Movement for Independence. Robinson was an American merchant
    who spent some years in Venezuela and Mexico, the latter during
    the time of which the events reported were occurring. He was
    generally badly treated by the Spaniards in control, and his
    sympathies are all for the Mexicans and their attempt to gain
    independence, which they did in 1821. His account may well be
    the first in English of this period; his relation of the
    expedition of Xavier Mina definitely is the first in English.
    Mina recruited among the southern states and a good part of his
    force was American. Both Streeter and Howes describe Mina's
    Expedition as in the nature of filibustering, but this is not
    right: he is more of a Mexican Lafayette, with the difference
    that his efforts came to nothing, and he was shot. Robinson
    also was one of the first to broach the possibility of a
    transoceanic canal across Nicaragua, following the river
    Chagres. The book was published in 2 volumes in London the next
    year, and into Dutch, German and Spanish in 1823 - 24.' 'A
    native of Philadelphia, he was a merchant who travelled
    throughout northern Latin America as a tobacco buyer, getting
    into trouble just about every place he went. He actively
    participated in the Mexican Wars of Independence on the side of
    the insurgents, and was captured and imprisoned several times.
    His narrative is included in Streeter's Texas bibliography
    because of the contemporary account of Gen. Mina's expedition
    from Galveston Island to Soto la Marina, and their subsequent
    march into Mexico. This is a fine eyewitness account.']</p>

    Morier served in the British diplomatic service in Persia and
    published two important accounts of his travels: <em>Journey
    through Persia, Armenia, and Asia Minor to Constantinople in
    the Years 1808 and 1809</em> (1812) and <em>A Second Journey
    through Persia</em> (1818). After his return to England, Morier
    embarked on a successful literary career, completing several
    popular novels set in the Middle East. The "Hajji Baba" stories

    <p class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note: 'Interesting account
    of the second voyage of Sir William Edward Parry (1790-1855) to
    the Arctic regions, in search of the North-West Passage. Parry
    was one of the earliest and greatest explorers of the Arctic.
    He commanded five expeditions to the Arctic between 1818 and
    1827, and reached farther north than any other explorer to that
    time. Parry did not get as far as the Bering Straits in his
    expedition, but he reached Melville Island, a point which even
    75 years later, with the aid of steam, had not been passed. It
    was not until 1852 that McClure, coming from the opposite
    direction, and reaching a point on the north of Banks Land,
    which Parry had seen and named, was able to connect the two
    positions by passing on foot across ice, showing positively
    that the North West Passage was not blocked by land. This book
    records the events of his second voyage, which was not as
    successful as the first, but contains important information on
    Eskimo life. The work is a treatise on aboriginal life, rather
    than a narrative of scientific discoveries. Particularly clear
    and vivid are the numerous engraved plates. In the back of the
    book is a series of excellent and very detailed maps. Pp.
    559-571 contain a vocabulary of Eskimo words and
    sentences.']</p>

    response to widespread calls for judicial reform; the writer is
    highly critical of the propensity for "lawyers by profession to
    attack, in our days, not only one of the first and most
    distinguished courts of judicature in the kingdom, but even the
    judgment and integrity of the first and ablest Law Officer of
    the Crown." Dedicated to Richard Preston, a highly successful
    Devonshire conveyance attorney (see <em>DNB</em>), who also was
    very conservative in his approach to the law.']</p>
