          painted by the late / JOHN HOPPNER, Esq. R.A. / This
          Portrait was the last for which Mr. Pitt sat, having been
          painted for Lord Mulgrave, in the October preceding his
          death. It is the same from which, with the permission of
          Lord Mulgrave, Mr. Nollekens copied his celebrated Bust.

      announcing proceedings on two unnamed articles. Murray had
      written to Gifford in April, 1813 to state his opinion that
      Persia is the last thing on people's minds and Horace Twiss
      the last person who should appear in the <i>Quarterly</i>.

    of Persia. When in 1809 he was sent back to England, Morier
    elected to make the return journey by way of an overland trek
    across Persia, Armenia, and Turkey. "The record of his journey
    at once took rank as an important authority on a country then
    little known to Englishmen, and by its admirable style and

    our clever friend to be sure&mdash;he would go on
    forever&mdash;however, what he has sent is pleasant enough. It
    was but last night that I amused myself with reading the very
    Chorus which he has translated. [See <i>QR</i> IX 159] ... We
    want Frere for this. Pray send it to Rowarth [the printer]
    directly .... It is odd enough that both Mitchell &amp; Foscolo
    should have fallen upon the same part of Plato's
    Banquet&mdash;Both have translated it &amp; it forms the most
    beautiful part of both of their papers&mdash;yet one must be
    omitted. Prepare Foscolo for this&mdash;&amp; you may truly say
    that had he been first, I would have omitted Mitchell&mdash;but
    you know that Mitchell has been lying on my table for several
    months.' Shine also notes the queried attribution of the
    article to John Hookham Frere in JM III's Register and notes
    that the Register cites JM II's marked <i>QR</i> and

    would put you in mind of a certain acquaintance of
    yours.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence suggests
    that James Henry Monk was at this time preparing an article on
    Sophocles for the <i>QR</i>, but the article was never
    published. Dr. Christopher Stray (Swansea, University of Wales)
    informs me that Monk later provided two pieces on Sophocles for
    <em>Museum Criticum</em> so perhaps Monk's material was used
    there. Murray MS., Cash Day Book 1810-12, 'Quarterly Review Dr
    [i.e., debit] / To Sophocles &lt; ? &gt; 5 vols. / sent Revd Mr

    a sense opposite to that of the original. The quoted passage

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. WG was pressed by Walter Scott to let
    his friend J. B. S. Morritt review Clarke's second volume. WG,
    however, evidently gave the task to Heber as Heber claims the
    review in a letter to WG dated 2 July 1816 (see below). Murray
    MS., WG to JM, [1813; notation on letter in JM II's hand: '223
    QR No 17']:&nbsp; 'Clarke I have never given to R. Heber.' In
    his comment, WG is perhaps responding to Walter Scott's request
    that J. B. S. Morritt be commissioned to review
    Clarke&mdash;see next cited letter. NLS MS. 853 (ff.11-12),
    Walter Scott to J. B. S. Morritt, 3 Oct. 1810 (copy), says he
    will stake Morritt's claim to review the second volume of
    Clarke's travels. NLS MS. 853 (f.19), Scott to Morritt, 26 Apr.
    1811 (copy), says he has informed WG that Morritt wishes to
    review Clarke. Murray MS., Reginald Heber to JM, 2 July 1816,
    says he wants his authorship of the review of the third and
    fourth volumes of Clarke to be as scrupulously concealed as was
    his review of the second volume. The first volume of Clarke's
    travels was reviewed at #110, by George Ellis, volumes III and
    IV at #426, by Reginald Heber.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Edward Copleston was Dudley's envoy
    and the guardian of Dudley's identity as a contributor to the
    <i>QR</i>. Murray MS., WG to JM, 17 May 1813, says to send
    without delay the enclosed to 'Mr. C. ... I send a note for Mr
    Coplestone [<i>sic</i>] .... put it on your Chimney piece &amp;
    <u>say nothing</u>.'&nbsp;The following evidence suggests that
    Robert Southey took an interest in #243, but there is no direct
    suggestion that Southey sub-edited the article. Murray MS., WG
    to JM, 20 May 1813 [notation on letter in JM II's hand: 'Q.R.
    17'], says he told Robert Southey that he proposed to begin the
    Number with his article. (No article in No. 17 or 18 has been
    attributed to Southey.) Murray MS., WG to JM, 24 June 1813: 'I
    did not know that Southey &amp; Rogers were friends&mdash;still
    I do not think that he [i.e., Dudley?] has been
    <u>severe</u>&mdash;Southey's prose is so good, that every one
    defers to him. But take care how you confess it. Mum is always
    the safest word. When S. comes to town let him do as he
    pleases.'&nbsp;In the absence of JM's side of the
    correspondence with WG,&nbsp;it is difficult to know exactly
    what WG means here, but the following is a reasonable
    conjecture. Southey appears to have expressed a concern that
    his friend Rogers might be negatively reviewed. Southey, being
    a persuasive writer, might convince JM to suppress or change
    the article. WG is imploring JM to convince Southey that the
    review of Rogers is in reliable hands. JM should be careful not
    reveal the author's name. In any case, JM should mollify
    Southey by deferring to his judgment.&nbsp;</span></p>

    cites JM III's Register and quotes from the following letter.
    Murray MS., WG to JM, [1813, numbered 223]: 'Mr B has not sent

    minute.&nbsp;[<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note:
    this letter is more fully quoted below.]</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and
    discussion is published here for the first time. The East India
    Company was discussed in three articles in this period, in
    #213, #221, and #244. The strong opinions of #244 against the
    Company are much more circumspectly expressed in an early
    article on the same subject, #221, making it difficult on the
    face of it to understand how the two articles could be from the
    same hand. However, there are good reasons, presented below and
    at the entry for #221, to establish Barrow as the author of
    both these articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Murray MS., Barrow, to JM, 24 May
    1813: WG wants Barrow to suppress negative comments on
    missionaries in his article on India [see page 237]. Murray
    MS., WG to JM, [1813; in JM II's hand: '223 QR No 17']: 'Mr.
    &lt; B &gt;. has not sent the remr. of the Indian folio (a most
    important paper).' Murray MS., WG to JM, [1813; notation on
    letter in JM II's hand: '223 QR No 17']: 'I am not much
    surprised at Lord Glenbervie's [Sylvester Douglas's]
    letter&mdash;for that Art. of Mr. B was certainly the most
    important National &lt; ? &gt; that ever appeared in any
    Review.'&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 28 in support of an attribution to
    George Ellis. It now appears to the present writer that the
    evidence supports, rather, an attribution of #213 to Ellis (an
    earlier article on the East India Company) and of #244 to
    Barrow. Commentary on the evidence presented in <i>VPR</i> 28
    is given below between crotchets. BL Add. MS. 28099 (f.101), WG
    to George Ellis, 15 July 1812, and (f.107), same, 20 July 1812,
    Ellis is working on an East Indian article; Ellis's poor health
    led to delays. [But these letters tend, rather, to prove
    Ellis's authorship of #213.] There is little in the article's
    manner to suggest Barrow, there is no cross-reference in other
    Barrow articles to this one, and none of Barrow's other
    articles are mentioned in this one. [But at this point Barrow
    was still early in his career as a reviewer and had not begun
    the practice of systematically referring to his own works.] The
    article is more in the manner of George Ellis or George
    Canning. Moreover, Barrow's recommendation of a Christian
    presence in India on page 284 of article #221 is contradicted
    on p. 237n of article #244. [This is a salient point, but a
    closer reading suggests that Barrow's recommendation in #221 is
    weak and hedged by serious qualifications, making the tenor of
    his comments there closely resemble those on page 237 of
    article #244.] The author supports education in English and
    favours colonization (p.244). 'We are old enough to remember
    the extraordinary effect which the India bill of Mr. Fox
    (passed afterwards in a modified form by Mr. Pitt) produced on
    the general feeling' (p.250). In the book, apparently, Grant
    charges the <i>QR</i> as among 'the literary antagonists of the
    Company, who contemplate a radical change.' As in this article
    so in #213, which is by Ellis, the author recommends the
    transfer of political and military control over India from the
    East India Company to the Crown and the termination of the
    Company's trading monopoly. Missionaries are blamed for the
    1806 mutiny at Vellore (p.235). [Article #244 casts the East
    India Company in a negative light. Ellis's #213, published less
    than a year before, was criticized by George Canning for being
    too much in favour of the Company. See notes at
    #213.]</span></p>
