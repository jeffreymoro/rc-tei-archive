    <p><span class="smallprint">Mr. Ronald Solomon in
    correspondence with the present writer supplies evidence in
    favour of an attribution to Barron Field for #559: 'The author
    [of #559] attacked W. C. Wentworth subjectively, which was kept
    up in the review of Wentworth's third edition in
    [#51<em>WI</em>]. Field wrote to his friend in New South Wales,
    the Rev. Samuel Marsden, on 21 Nov. 1824, that he was reviewing
    Wentworth and the Bigge report for the <i>QR</i>. In it he
    continued the attacks on Wentworth. Also, in #559 Oxley's
    journals are reviewed and in Field's letter to JM, 13 Dec. 1817
    he refers to a review of either Oxley or Vaux.' [<i>Quarterly
    Review</i> Archive editor's note: however, the present writer
    has definitive evidence that John Barrow was author of
    #51<i>WI</i>. It appears, therefore, that in the case of
    #51<i>WI</i> Field was usurped by Barrow. The following
    evidence, in any case, demonstrates Field's authorship of
    #559.] Murray MS., Barron Field to JM, 13 Dec. 1817, Field
    offers to review Oxley. Murray MS., Field to JM, 24 Aug. 1819,
    Field states that if JM will not publish his submission on New
    South Wales he should return it. Most uncharacteristic of
    Barrow, in #559 there are no references to previous articles by
    Barrow, a significant observation as it was Barrow's signature
    practice in his <i>QR</i> articles to refer to his own works.
