      use of italics and repeated use of the phrases 'we are not,' 'we have not,' 
      'we do not,' 'we would not,' 'having thus,' characteristic of Lyall's writing, 
      but there is nothing else to indicate that Lyall took an interest in this 
      subject. Note the phrase: 'We have not sufficient materials . . . .' (p.421) 
      that is also found in an article by Robert William Hay (#269). Ends with: 
      'We must now take our leave of . . . .' cf. #422, Barrow, and the article 
      contains other references that echo Barrow, including references to China 
      and Lord Macartney but little else in the article makes one think of Barrow.

      mentioned on p.423&#151;are reviewed at #390 by Whitaker. In that article
