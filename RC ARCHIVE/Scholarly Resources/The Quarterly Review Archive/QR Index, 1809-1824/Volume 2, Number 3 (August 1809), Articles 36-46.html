    Gifford, Shine quotes from the following letters. Dudley 13-14
    (11 Feb 1814): 'I was preparing to make a vigorous defence of
    Miss E from the canting hypocritical accusations against her on
    the score of religion, when luckily I bethought myself of
    turning back to the two former papers on Miss E in the
    <i>QR</i> [#42 and 198], in which I found this charge preferred
    with great earnestness and solemnity ... just at the same time,
    to my great surprise, [I] accidentally learnt from Murray ...
    that those passages were of Gifford's own manufacture, and
    inserted (pro salute animae) at his particular instance in an
    article furnished by that "serious young man" the younger
    Stephen.' Murray MS., Henry John Stephen to JM, n.d.: 'I
    returned the "Tales of Fashionable Life" last week, and am much
    obliged for the use of them. Before I put my review of that
    work into your hands I could wish to see the Treatise on
    Practical Education by the same Author. The loan of it for an
    hour or two will be sufficient for this purpose.' Murray MS.,
    WG to JM, 21 July 1809: 'I think young Mr Stephen's criticism
    will do very well. It is much better than you gave me reason to
    expect. In short, I see nothing amiss in it, &amp; a few
    trifling alterations will make it pass muster famously.' Murray
    MS., WG to John Ireland, [19 or 22 Aug. 1809]: 'Stephen will do
    well enough, perhaps.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [Aug. 1809]: 'To
    Mr Stevens or Stephens as you spell it (pray correct my
    address) I have mentioned the M.S. on Russia, &amp; offered it
    to him. It is now too late to write a new letter, and I shall
    at all events make no scruple of using it if convenient and
    proper.' Shine also cites a letter quoted at entry #198, Iowa
    MS., JM to John Wilson Croker, n.d.: '... perhaps you will make
    an effort upon Miss Edgeworth who merits all your care.... we
    used [her] very scurvily in our Review (see no 3 or Vol 2 p
    146) of the first three Vols of her Tales ....'</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., Book Loans Register: the
    book reviewed was sent to 'H. J. Stephens (Henry John) / 4
    Sergts Inn' on 22 June 1809. NLS MS., 3878 (f.121), WG to
    Walter Scott, 22 Aug. 1809: 'I was ignorant that you had taken

    we may thank Adam!! For I shall never say to thunder in your

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and
    information is published here for the first time. Smiles I 160
    quotes from George Ellis to JM, n.d.: 'I had a large mass of
    materials to read and even to study; and I wish that Canning
    should see and, if necessary, correct what I have done. He
    wishes it also, but has suggested to me that it would be
    pleasanter to him to see it in print. Pray get it printed, if
    it be possible, <i>immediately</i>, and send me down a proof by
    Friday's post, as he promises to be with me on Saturday.'
    Murray MS., Ellis to JM, 21 Aug. 1809: indicates that the first
    paragraph is by Canning. NLS MS., 3878 (f.24), WG to Walter
    Scott, 17 Feb. 1810: 'James Moore must be out of his senses.
    Does he suppose that he possesses an <span class=

    done. His father was very fond of me, and had no reason to
    repent of his attachment. With the young man I never was
    extremely intimate.' NLS MS., 3878 (f.121), WG to Scott, 22
    Aug. 1809: WG is sending a parcel to Scott from JM and says,
    'Prick up your ears for the Spanish Article. ... WE [as opposed
    to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>] have a grand article on Spain;
    the best our friend E[llis]. says, that has yet appeared in
