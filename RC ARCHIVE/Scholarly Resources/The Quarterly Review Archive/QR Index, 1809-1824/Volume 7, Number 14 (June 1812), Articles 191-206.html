        <span class="redbold">In September 1812 Murray moved his
        offices from 32 Fleet Street to 50 Albemarle Street</span>
        (See Smiles I 233 ff. for details about the move.) The
        following quotations and discussion are published here for
        the first time.

        <blockquote>
          <p>By the way&#8212;you will find this house of Murray's
          not unpleasant&#8212;there is a good room, detached from
          the shop, which will at all times be open to you, &amp;
          where you may transact any incidental business that might
          otherwise occasion you to extend your walk. [Harewood
          MS., William Gifford to George Canning, 4 Nov. 1812]</p>

          <p>When you come to town, you will find Murray settled in
          Albemarle St. His house is not an unpleasant lounge, and
          Canning &amp; a few others have furnished a private room
          with the Morning Papers. It is a sort of Horse and cab,
          &amp; in Parliament time, forms a convenient place of
          meeting. [BL MS. 28099, f.111, William Gifford to George
          Ellis, 7 Jan. 1813. ]</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Later in the decade, Murray's literary and political
        friends used as a retreat the expansive first floor drawing
        room over Murray's book store at 50 Albemarle (see Smiles I
        264-65). But the 'convenient place of meeting' Gifford
        mentions in the quotations above is more likely the small
        ground floor waiting room in that venerable building. In
        the nineteenth century, Murray kept a book store in the
        ground floor room that faces the street; Gifford alludes to
        it and describes the 'good room' as separate from it. The
        small waiting room, tucked away at the end of the ground
        floor entrance hall, is a private intimate space. It has a
        fireplace and its own skylight, the latter made possible by
        the room being situated at the base of a shaft formed on
        three sides by Murray's building and on the fourth by a
        neighbouring building. The room is in that sense, then, as
        Gifford says, 'detached from the shop.' To gain access, one
        ascends a couple of steps; these circumstances and the
        room's intimate dimensions make the room resemble, one
        could fancy, 'a sort of Horse and cab.'</p>

        <p>Murray's waiting room, and later the drawing room, in
        this period fulfilled the function of a building that
        adjoined John Wright's Piccadilly book shop in the
        Canningites' <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> days.&nbsp; To quote the
        <i>DNB</i> article on Wright: 'In 1797 Canning, John
        Hookham Frere, and others, projected the "Anti-Jacobin, or
        Weekly Examiner." They took a lease of 168 Piccadilly, the
        next house to Wright's, which was vacant on account of the
        failure of J. Owen, the publisher of Burke's pamphlets, and
        made over the house to Wright, reserving to themselves the
        first floor. By means of a door in the partition wall they
        passed from Wright's shop to the editorial room without
        attracting notice.'<br />

    'Gilchrist ... is much pleased with the Art. in hand.' Murray
    MS., WG to JM, [possibly misdated 14 Mar. 1812]: 'Gilchrist has

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and

    WG to Octavius Gilchrist, Monday [probably 3 Feb.] 1812, says
    he thinks Number 12 is just out and that Gilchrist's 'little

    [June or July 1812?]: 'I was obliged to cut down Jones. ... [I

    <p class="smallprint">[Booksellers' notes, combined and

    was continued thence to 1782 by Isaac Reed, and brought down to
    the end of November 1811 by Stephen Jones (1763-1827).' 'Baker
    (1730-1767) trained as a scholar and mathematician until
    joining an itinerant group of actors. He published the first
    edition of this work, under the title of <em>Companion to the
    Playhouse</em> in 1764. The <i>DNB</i> notes that Baker "was
    largely indebted to his predecessor Langbaine. He adds but
    little information concerning the early dramatists, but his
    work is a useful book of reference for the history of the stage
    during the first half of the eighteenth century." The first
    part of the work contains a critical and historical account of
    every tragedy, comedy, and farce in the English language. The

    quotes from the following two letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, [4
    July 1812]: 'Whatever be the case, Eveleigh cannot be left out
    this time without displeasing Dr Ireland, who fully expects
    it.' Murray MS., WG to JM, 10 July [1812 postmark]: 'Eveleigh,
    I have cut down into a very unexceptionable article ....' In
    suggesting John Ireland as a queried alternative attribution,
    Shine cites exactly the same evidence as above.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 27; the citation of JM II's <i>QR</i>
    and the quotation from Murray MS., George D'Oyly to JM, 25 Oct.
    [1811] are the first primary evidence to be published that
    supports an attribution of #194 to D'Oyly. The volume was
    reviewed because Eveleigh was an associate of Edward Copleston;
    Copleston succeeded Eveleigh as Provost of Oriel College.
    Eveleigh was also a friend of John Ireland, Gifford's closest
    confidant. Both Smiles and Shine have created problems in the
    presentation of evidence that concerns #194. Smiles at I 203
    quotes a fuller version of Murray MS. WG to JM, [4 July 1812]
    that demonstrates the tension between WG and JM in the
    admission of religious articles, this article in particular.
    Smiles interprets the letter as illustrating 'the influence
    over Gifford of his friend Dr. Ireland, which JM considered
    baneful.' But taking into account a wider range of evidence, it
    appears instead that JM objected equally to D'Oyly, the author
    of #194. JM had complained about D'Oyly's contributions before:
    after quoting from the 4 July 1812 letter, Smiles quotes from
    Murray MS., WG to JM, [n.d.], 'If you mean&#8212;by being no
    Calvinist that D'Oyly is not to come, I do not see how this can
    be&#8212;as we shall have an article from Mr. C. in the No.
    following. Nor can I frame excuses for your omissions. This
    business begins to get too heavy for me, and I must soon have
    done, I fear.' Shine may be correct in applying this undated
    letter instead to #164, as the reference in it to 'an article
    from Mr. C. in the No. following' may be to Edward Copletson's
    review of Ensor in #173.&nbsp;</span></p>

    'opposition coaches which give such features of pleasantness to

    Manchester doctor, well-known to the <i>QR</i>'s editorial
    coterie. His essay on Massinger WG included in his edition of
    Massinger, and, an avid book collector and a friend of Richard
    Heber, he was author of <i>Bibliomania: An Epistle to Richard
    Heber, Esq.</i> (1809). Because of the subject matter, John
    Barrow's possible participation should be considered. The
    article is not in Barrow's style, however. Note the classical
    and literary allusions untypical of Barrow and the emphasis not
    on information but on criticism. Devon MS. 1149M (f.106), WG to
    Edward Copleston, 3 Mar. 1812, suggests this topic for Mr.
    Vaux. Ferriar's <i>Essay towards a Theory of Apparitions</i>

    of Walter Scott's.&nbsp;The attribution to Ferriar cannot be

    Marchand, <i>Byron's Letters</i> II 235, Byron to JM, 23 Oct.
    1812: 'Did Mr. Ward write the review of H. Tooke's
    life?&#8212;it is excellent.' Smiles at I 218 (cited in Shine)
    quotes JM to Byron, 4 Nov. 1812: 'Neither Mr. Gifford nor I, I
    can venture to assure you, upon honour, have any notion who the
    author of the admirable article on "Horne Tooke" is.' The
    author of the review (or one of the authors) is old enough to
    have a remembrance of Tooke's political life (p.314) and to
    recall the events of 1794 (see p.328). Dudley was born in 1781,
    Heber in 1773, and Copleston in 1776.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    for Copleston's friend (i.e., Lord Dudley). Devon MS. 1149M
    (ff.103-4), WG to Copleston, 12 Feb. 1812: 'I wrote to you a
    few days since respecting Sismondi, and strange to say, within
    these few minutes, I have recd an Article on him from the very
    person who had long since excused himself on the score of ill
    health!' The author adopts the form 'Henry the Seventh'
    (p.371), which Merivale does in at #222 (p.289; 'Louis the
    Fourteenth' ). Pg. 360n of #200 mentions Giovanni Villani, the
    subject of #256, which is also by Merivale. The first sentence
    of #256 refers back to this article which is also referred to

    friend's translation of 'the five concluding volumes of Mr.

    fourteenth No of the Q Review ... but ... I ... fear to afford
    a precedent which might lead to unforseen
    consequences.'&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., Peter Elmsley to JM, 25
    June 1813, proposes publishing a pamphlet based on his Greek
    article in <i>QR</i> Number 14. Murray MS., Elmsley to JM, 11
    July 1813, having been refused permission to do so declares he
    will no longer write for the journal. An Appendix that follows
    #220 in issue Number 15 supplies corrections to #206. Article
    #220 is also by Elmsley.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">JM III's Register: attribution to
    Elmsley, but without evidence.&nbsp;</span> <o:p></o:p></p>
