    <p class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note, modified: Mariner was
    a young British sailor on the Port au Prince that sailed in
    1805, a whaler that spent much of her time attacking Spanish
    shipping. In the spring of 1806 she captured two ships, the
    brig Santa Isidora and the corvette Santa Maria. The Port au
    Prince visited Hawaii in late 1806, and then sailed with a
    number of Hawaiian crew. At Tonga the crew mutinied; most of
    the crew were massacred by the natives, but Mariner, who had
    come under the protection of the king lived there as his
    adopted son for four years. Mariner's story was cited by Byron
    as one of the two sources for his poem 'The Island, or
    Christian and his Comrades,' a romantic narrative of the Bounty
    mutiny. Mariner's work is one of the earliest accounts of
    indigenous medical practices in the Pacific. John Martin,
    Mariner's ghost-writer, was a physician and meteorologist of
    some note. Hill, p. 192.]</p>

    sufficient for a definite identification. However, the

    Hay's writing. The topic and the quality of the writing, the

    to complete the cartographic survey of the Australian coast.
    P<span lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">&eacute;</span>ron sailed
    as naturalist on the expedition and Freycinet as cartographer.
    It was a celebrated voyage, which brought back to France the
    most important collection of natural history specimens in the
    history of the French Museum, as well as a wealth of
    geographical and other information. Flinders completed his
    survey of the Australian coast before Baudin, but Flinders's
    imprisonment by the French in Mauritius for seven years
    resulted in the French exploration account being published
    first. Consequently, the Baudin-Freycinet narrative includes
    the first complete and fully detailed map of the Australian
    continent. The Atlas Historique contains a series of wonderful
    coloured plates, some of the most beautiful early views of
    Australia and fine natural history images. Ferguson, 449; Hill,

    Croker and Gifford, Shine cites JM III's Register and, for
    Croker alone, <i>Gentleman's Magazine&nbsp;</i>XXI 140;
    Jennings I 98; Brightfield 332n, 333, 454; and Pfeiffer in

    Warter III 78, 78-79; and Fitzpatrick 189-90, 198. Shine also
    quotes from a number of letters, including the following:
    Murray MS., J[ohn]. H[ookham]. Frere to JM, [n.d.]: 'I wish
    very much to have Ly Morgan&mdash;I have done I think a sheet
    ... just in the proper way .... a rodomantade of humorous
    nonsense ... the most <u>laughable</u> <u>nonsense</u> that I
    ever did.' Pencil notation on letter: 'Q R 33 Art 11.' Murray
    MS., WG to JM [1816]: 'Frere is excellent&mdash;his letter
    shall be taken care of.' Iowa MS., WG to JM, postmarked Aug 16,
    1817: 'There are good hopes of the next No. [of the <i>QR</i>]
    but I am anxious to get out of this, &amp; therefore would have
    you quicken Mr Frere, now that he has mentioned his purpose. Do
    you think that it will be advisable to delay publication beyond
    the 1st of September? The paper truly will be highly desirable.
    Try to ascertain this before you leave town. Represent to him,
    the necessity of losing no time.' Murray MS., WG to JM
    [erroneous notation on outside: '1819-20.' Allusion to article
    on Paris (see Entry 427) establishes 1817]: 'The Art [on Lady
    Morgan] seems ... formal &amp; somewhat tending toward a
    pleading ... it is shrewd &amp; convincing, &amp;, I think,
    powerful .... Pray let Mr Smith copy out for me from the
    preface that part in which she notices advice to her in our
    former No. I think more may be made of it.' Iowa MS., JM to
    Croker, n.d.: The Marchioness of Abercorn called to express her
    gratification at seeing Lady Morgan so justly exposed in the
    Review. Many others are doing the same,&mdash;a few of them
    thinking it too violent, but none thinking it unjust. Shine
    also cites Jennings I 102 that quotes Croker to Robert Peel, 26
    Nov. 1817: 'I wrote the main part ... but ... was called away
    to Ireland when it was in the press; and I am sorry to say that
    some blunders crept in accidentally, and one or two were
    premeditatedly added....' Shine also cites Clark 196-99 who
    thinks it does not resemble Croker's work and suggests Gifford.
    Shine also cites Pfeiffer in <i>PQ</i> XI 101, 412, that quotes
    WG to JM, 1817: 'I am not surprised at what C says of Lady
    Morgan.... The criticism, however, must be softened
    ....'&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint"><span lang="EN-CA" xml:lang=
    "EN-CA">The following evidence is published here for the first
    time. John Hookham Frere evidently read and commented on a
    draft of the article and asked that its criticisms be toned
    down. Iowa MS. (f.94), WG to JM [16 Aug. 1817]: 'I am not
    surprised at what Mr. F[rere]. says of Lady Morgan, and shall
    be glad to receive his remarks. The book, however, is so
    diabolical ... that it merits a more than common degree of
    reprobation. The woman is dangerous. She is labouring to
    acquire notoriety; she is a professed writer for the public;
    &amp; her impudent &amp; persevering puffs cannot, I suspect,
    be met by gentle means. She is evidently capable, &amp;
    desirous of doing mischief. It is necessary to put an
    extinguisher on her popularity with the ignorant &amp; young
    &amp; innocent. The criticism, however, must be softened[,] yet
    I can excuse our friend C. &amp; even approve his indignation.'
    Iowa MS. (f.142), WG to JM, n.d., has been reading the first
    volume of Lady Morgan, finds it far worse than he had
    suspected, thinks that Croker has missed an important point.
    'It is a counterpart of Hobhouse whom she evidently had in
    view&mdash;pray send a line to Ryde before you set out, &amp;
    beg&nbsp; Mr C. to think of this, &amp; draw C. to this
    comparison. A few lines will do it.' Claimed by Croker in four
    of his Clements Library MS. lists and included in the Cambridge
    University bound volumes of Croker's articles. The article's
    author refers to #412 (specific reference on p. 261n), which is
    also by Croker. Proofs of part of the article and part of the
    manuscript in Croker's hand are preserved in the Murray
    archives. An acerbic editor's note on page 286, appended to
    #430, states that a 'second' edition of Lady Morgan's
    <em>France</em>, recently published, is merely a reprint of the
    first edition.</span></span></p>
