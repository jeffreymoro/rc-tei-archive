    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and
    discussion is published here for the first time. JM III's and
    the Shines' attributions in this instance are instructive of
    their respective methods in assigning authorship. In the
    absence of other available evidence, JM III often derives his
    attributions unquestioningly from JM II, and therefore followed
    JM II's error in this instance. In the absence of other
    evidence, the Shines in their turn privilege assertions of
    attribution in JM III; in the case of #323 additional evidence
    steered the Shines toward the correct attribution.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">It seems probable that JM II,
    recalling that Southey and Barrow each had articles in this
    Number, confused their respective roles in the production of
    #323 and #326. The article appears in Southey's definitive MS.
    list of his <i>QR</i> articles. Ramos 14, 142.&nbsp;The
    holograph MS. of the article is preserved as BL Add MS.

    <i>A Journal of the Voyages and Travels of a Corps of

    Archive editor's note: each of these sources asserts Whitaker's
    authorship but does not supply evidence. Nichols is generally,
    but not uniformly, reliable; the list in <i>Gentleman's
    Magazine</i> is in many places incorrect and supplies no
    evidence; Graham depends upon JM III's Register.]</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. A cloud of secondary witnesses favours
    an attribution to Whitaker, but the only relevant primary
    source so far discovered, the following letter, is not
    definitive. Murray MS., WG to JM, [date?] says he thinks JM's
    'friend ... writes rather colloquially .... We must always be
    careful in our language.' WG recommends rendering in English a
    Greek passage [see p.390, the only Greek passage in this
    Number]. Henry Hart Milman attributes the article to Whitaker
    in his introduction to <i>Life of Gibbon</i>, 5.</span></p>

    the ambiguity of Murray MS., WG to JM, [14 Nov. 1814]: 'I have
    just rec'd the enclosed from Southey. It is interesting that he
    should have taken up Colquhoun&mdash;I have however, told him

    he may easily find another book to put at the head of his

    1815 (cited in Curry <i>WC</i>): WG encloses an article for
    Huskisson to sub-edit. 'It is, as you see, a Review of
    Colquhoun&mdash;drawn up by our zealous &amp; indefatigable
    associate Barrow.' Murray MS., Robert Southey to JM, [26 Nov.
    1814 postmark]: 'Colquhoun's book I shall want with the poor
    reports ...' Murray MS., WG to JM [14 Nov. 1814], suggests that

    against Thomas Rennell in the <i>British Critic</i>. A man
    named Collinson (certainly either John Collinson or his uncle
    Septimus Collinson) is a candidate for authorship of this
    article. He is mentioned as a contributor by John Wilson Croker
    in an 1823 letter to John Murray: '... remember the necessity
    of absolute secrecy on this point, and indeed on all others. If
    you were to publish such names as Cohen and Croker and

    Barrow, as having 'established a new era in naval
    architecture.' In his <i>QR</i> articles<i>,</i> it was
    Barrow's signature practice to refer to his own works. The

    Shine cites JM III's Register; Warter II 414, 420; Cottle
    242-43; Southey 577; <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> XXI 140; the
    <i>DNB</i> article on Barr<i>&eacute;</i> Charles Roberts; and

    following evidence is published here for the first time. The
    article appears in Southey's definitive MS. list of his
    <i>QR</i> articles. Murray MS., WG to JM, Wed., n.d. [1812
    watermark], says Southey writes in his best manner. 'Have you
    any more of the <u>Letters</u>?' Southey habitually
    communicated with Murray, not with WG. (But cf.
    #286.)&nbsp;</span></span></p>
