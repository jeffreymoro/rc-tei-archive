    <span class="smallprint">In querying its co-attribution of the
    article to John Herman Merivale and William Gifford, Shine
    cites JM III's Register. Shine also quotes from the following
    letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, 15 July 1814: 'I am quite sorry
    that I did not give you Mr Merivale's draft&mdash;he probably
    wants it .... His little art. I had not the leisure to
    revise.'&nbsp; [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note:
    the previous issue of the <i>QR</i>, Number 21, having been
    published four days after Gifford wrote this letter is reason
    to believe that the reference may be instead to #289. Shine
    also introduces this letter as evidence of Merivale's probable
    authorship of #306.] Murray MS., WG to JM, [20 Oct. 1814
    postmark]: 'Rowarth [the printer] has all the Articles except a
    little thing ... on Kett, from whom I could not keep my
    fingers. I had something sent me&mdash;but I have changed the
    tone &amp; made it a
    high-panegyrick.'&nbsp;[<i>sic</i>]</span></span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint"><span style="color: windowtext">The
    following evidence is published here for the first time. The
    evidence Shine supplies is not sufficient to attribute the
    article to Merivale, though WG's substantial role in this brief
    article is well attested to in Shine and in the evidence that
    follows. Shine used Murray MS., WG to JM, 15 July 1814 to
    buttress the attribution for #306. However, as #307 is a
    'little art.', if that letter does not refer to #289, it could
    well refer to #307. The attribution in JM III's Register is
    unsubstantiated and appears to be based on a supposition. BL
    MS. 28,099 (f.125), WG to George Ellis, 2 Dec. 1814: 'I also
    had a hand in Kett&mdash;but was restrained from saying as much

    Compare the author's statement that 'National and moral
