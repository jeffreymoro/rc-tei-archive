    your care, as I have been obliged to return the latter for the

    Petrarch, &amp; into which you may &amp; I hope will slyly slip
    a morsel or two of praise on Lord W[oodhouselee, Alexander
    Fraser Tytler].' NLS MS. 3879 (f.228), WG to Scott, 27 Oct.
    1810: 'I hope Murray has sent you the Petrarch, as I shall want
    it for this No. What I wish to have is any little compliment to
    your good friend; for I think that the substance of our review
    is correct.' NLS MS. 3879 (f.262), WG to Scott, 22 Nov. 1810:

    want for this No.' NLS MS. 852 (ff. 37-38), Scott to JM, 3 Dec.
    1810 (copy), says he has sent 'Petrarch,' wants it much
    modified as it would be 'disagreeable in its present shape to
    Lord W[oodhouselee],' and promises to 'fill the gap.' Murray
    MS., WG to John Taylor Coleridge, 7 Nov. 1820, Penrose was
    angry when, having been asked for corrections and after much
    delay, his review was finally inserted. 'I have had more
    complaints about the delay of this Art. than of all the rest of

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and
    information is published here for the first time. Harewood MS.,
    WG to George Canning, 22 Sept. 1812: 'Barrow [is reviewing] an
    American pamphlet ... which affords ... a better justification
    of the Orders [in Council] than has yet been publicly made in
    this country.' The article continues the defence of the Orders
    in Council commenced in #180, which is also by Barrow.&nbsp;
    Cf. 'We were always of the opinion, from the general conduct of
    Mr. Madison, coupled with his well known predilection for
    French principles, that a secret understanding existed between
    him and Buonaparte' (p.193) with a similar sentiment in #180
    (p.7). This article is referred to in #282, which is also by
    Barrow. In his <i>QR</i> articles, it was Barrow's signature
    practice to refer to his own works.&nbsp;</span></p>

    from a highly successful legal career out of consideration for
    his declining health, and promptly applied himself to farming
    on scientific principles and to embroiling himself in
    contemporary political dialogue. Sometimes called "the little
    Rebel" or "the Boston Rebel," the New England Federalist
    opposed Madison's policies, the proposed French alliance, and
    the War of 1812. This pamphlet went through eight printings in
    1812, the year of its first publication; it argues that the war
    would serve no purpose other than promoting French interests
    and wronging Great Britain. Shaw and Shoemaker 25897; Sabin
