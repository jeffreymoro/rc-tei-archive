    first published in <i>VPR</i> 28; additional evidence and
    information is published here for the first time. Murray MS.,
    Book Loans Register: one of the pamphlets reviewed was sent to
    'Geo. Ellis' on 13 May 1809.&nbsp; Devon MS. 1149M (ff.107-8),
    WG to Edward Copleston, 23 May 1812:&nbsp; 'The Orders in
    Council were written at the Admiralty, &amp; chiefly by my
    friend Barrow&mdash;Croker &amp; Robinson lent their aid, and
    Canning was kind enough to give me two or three hours revisal
    of them.' The Robinson mentioned is almost certainly John
    Frederick Robinson, Viscount Goderich, who was at this time an
    Admiralty Lord. Other possibilities are less likely because WG
    assumes Copleston's familiarity with the name and these other
    men are too obscure: William Robinson, Extra Clerk in the
    Marine Pay Department and Christopher Robinson (1766-1823), a
    Tory MP 1818-20, King's Advocate from 1809, who became a judge
    of high court of Admiralty in 1828. Murray MS., JM to John
    Bristed, New York, 12 Dec. 1811, says that he is interested in
    obtaining articles from Bristed on 'the real state of the
    parties in America' and on other American matters of interest
    to the British.</span></span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint"><span style=

    by James Stephen, a friend of Prime Minister Preceval and a key
    member of the Saints (Evangelical parliamentarians and
    philanthropists under the leadership of William Wilberforce,
    later known as the Clapham Sect). The Saints were important
    early supporters of the <i>QR</i>.</span></span></p>

    'Orders in Council of Jan. 7 and Nov. 11, 1807 aimed at
    strangling neutral commerce, the United States being the chief
    target; the orders were repealed but too late to prevent the
    War of 1812.' 'On taking office Madison had repealed
    Jefferson's embargo on European commerce and installed his own
    policy that there would be "non-intercourse" with England or
    France until they repealed their own non-trading policies. In
    1809 Macon's Bill No. 2 was passed. This restored trading with
    England and France but promised that if either would recognize
    America's neutral stand then America would stop trade with the
    other. As of 2 November 1810 Napoleon had announced that he had
    revoked his "antineutral system and [it was determined] that
    non-intercourse would be revived against Britain, if in three
    months' time she did not repeal her orders in council."
    (Morison "Oxford History" p. 378) France did in fact not stop
    its "antineutral" practices but Madison felt that he had given
    the country's pledge and on 2 March 1811 intercourse with
    Britain was banned under the Macon Act. England suffered under
    this as Napoleon had cut off many of their other markets and
    the winter of 1811 to 1812 was the bitterest "between the Great
    Plague and 1940/1." 16 June 1812 Castlereagh rescinded the
    Orders in Council; two days later, not having heard of this
    decision, Congress declared war.']</span></span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint"><span style=

    published in <i>VPR</i> 24. Murray MS., George D'Oyly to JM, 25
    Oct. 1811, says he has received books on the Bishop of London.
    Porteus was a Cambridge man, which might have recommended him
    to the author of this article. D'Oyly was a professor at
    Cambridge. Whitaker was an Oxford graduate. Cf. the praise of
    Porteus's anti-Calvinism here with similar sentiments in #164,
    which is also by D'Oyly. The article is not attributed to
    Whitaker in Nichols. Whitaker mentions Porteus in #183 and

    JM, [20 Apr. 1812, numbered 192]: 'I send the remr of

    #182 is an example of the Shine volume rejecting JM III's
    Register in favour of primary source evidence, which is
    relevant as the Shine volume in very many instances accepts the

    <p><span class="smallprint"><span style=

    information is published here for the first time. The article
    is in Southey's definitive MS. list of his <i>QR</i>
    articles.&nbsp; Murray MS., Book Loans Register: one of the
    books reviewed in #182 was sent to 'R. Southey' on 4 Oct. 1811.
    Murray MS., Robert Southey to JM, 13 Dec. 1811, says he is
    working on 'Iceland.'&nbsp; Murray MS., Southey to JM, 31 Jan.
    1812, says he will submit 'Mackenzie' as soon as he can.&nbsp;
    Murray MS., Southey to JM, 7 Mar. 1812, sends some of
    'Iceland.' Article #182 is quoted in #368, by John Barrow. Note
    that the Hooker volume under review was published by 'Miller,
    Albemarle-street' and is therefore one of the last volumes
    printed by William Miller (1769-1844) who retired in 1812. In
    August 1812, John Murray purchased Miller's premises at 50
    Albemarle and moved his business there in September; the
    building remained the headquarters of John Murray until 2002
    and, as of this writing (June 2003), still houses the offices
    of John and Virginia Murray and the company's venerable

    'Mackenzie, a distinguished mineralogist and president of the
    physical class of the Royal Society, travelled to Iceland in
    1810 in the company of Drs. Henry Holland and Richard Bright.
    The present work is the joint production of the three men,
    Mackenzie contributing the narrative of the voyage and travels,
    and the chapters on mineralogy, rural economy and commerce, Dr.
    Bright the sections on zoology and botany, and Dr. Holland the
    chapters on literature, diseases, and government, laws and
    religion. The mineralogical collections brought back from the
    expedition were spoken of with great admiration by Sir Charles
    Lyell. The fine hand-coloured aquatints of scenery and costume
    by J. Clark and text engravings and plates by R. Scott and E.
    Mitchell are based on original sketches by the three

    his escape from the burning ship. The book contains interesting

    Young was associated with Cambridge. See also evidence at #73
