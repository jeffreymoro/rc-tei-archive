    <p>My dearest Annie<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/murray/notes/Murray_to_Annie_Murray_10-5-1808_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>I returned today about 3 oclock from my visit to Mr Scott &amp; had the pleasure of finding your letter, which would have been more agreeable, perhaps, if you had said something <strike>of</strike> about your own health &amp; my sons, &amp; if you had told me what you had been about &amp; where visiting&#8212;but I presume that you continue well &amp; are content.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/murray/notes/Murray_to_Annie_Murray_10-5-1808_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    <p>Upon reading your letter, I really began to feel that I had been rather dilatory of late in writing to my dearest girl, but it is as she supposes, my time has been completely engrossed by business &amp; engagements. I sent you a few hasty lines on Monday from Ashestiel when I had arrived on Sunday, intending to leave it the next day, but Mr Scott was pressing for my remaining longer &amp; I was too happy in the opportunity of improving my acquaintance with him not to remain. A very rich literary man who lives not far from Hawkestone in Shropshire, Mr Heber, was on a visit to Mr Scott also. On the Monday, Mr S. took us along that most interesting walk to Newark Tower&#8212;the Braes of Yarrow &amp; other places celebrated in his poem,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/murray/notes/Murray_to_Annie_Murray_10-5-1808_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> made even more interesting to us by being shown there by the poet himself. We ran off, immediately after my short letter to you, for which they waited, &amp; we did not return until 5 o'clock&#8212;it was a truly delightful walk&#8212;the evening was passed in most charming conversation in which both Mr Scott and Mr Heber excel.</p>
    <p>Yesterday Mr S. took Mr Heber &amp; myself <strike>&amp;</strike> in his carriage &amp; Mr Ballantyne rode on the Dickey&#8212;to Holy Melrose,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/murray/notes/Murray_to_Annie_Murray_10-5-1808_notes.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a> which he took us over &amp; shewed us all these beauties even the hasty look of it which I took upon a former yet more interesting occasion, had not [?allowed] me to remark. In our way we passed Mr Bruce, who happened to be standing in the Park (the father I mean) Mr Scott knew &amp; bowed to him &amp; I did the like but he could not have recollected me, as I never saw him but the day he dined at Mr Allens when you were there. We passed also Lord Somerville&#8217;s, where Mr &amp; Mrs Somerville are now staying&#8212;but to my great regret I could not call upon either. When Mr Ballantyne &amp; I left Mr Scott &amp; Mr Heber at Melrose &amp; travelled to Kelso&#8212;my first attention was to secure the room where my dearest love and &amp; I rested once before, &amp; I did not sleep, she will believe me, without a thousand thoughts of her whom I now love a thousand times more dearly than when we were there together. We passed the day tolerably especially as the Mrs Ballantyne, whom you know, came to see us[.] &amp; this morning at six we set out for Edinburgh.</p>
    <p>I am truly happy in being able to assure you of the most complete satisfaction which I derived from my visit to Mr Scott &amp; it has now realized or [is] likely to do so, all that had been agitating in my mind for this last twelve months &amp; of [which] even you shall know the particulars when we meet. I arrived so late today that I can not set out tomorrow &#8230;. [the balance of the letter is about domestic matters]</p>
    <p>My most dear Girl</p>
    <p>Your faithful husband</p>
    <p>John Murray</p>
