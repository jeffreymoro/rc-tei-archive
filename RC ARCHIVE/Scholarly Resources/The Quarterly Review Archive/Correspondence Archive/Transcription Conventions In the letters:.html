<h2>Transcription Conventions In the letters:</h2>
<ul>
<li>supplied readings appear in square brackets</li>
<li>illegible words are signified by a query in square brackets, with one query representing one word, e.g., signifying two illegible contiguous words:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; [ ? ? ]</li>
<li>conjectural readings are in square brackets and are preceded by a query, e.g.: [?Barnstaple]</li>
<li>notes clarifying lacunae and other matters relating to the physical text are also, I hope not confusingly, given in square brackets where they occur, e.g.: [paper tear]</li>
<li>presently, passages in Greek are not reproduced but will be scanned in in the near future</li>
<li>&#160;Gifford's spelling, punctuation, and formatting have not been regularized; with the exception of indents, they are transcribed as they appear in the text</li>
<li>punctuation has been supplied for the letters of John Murray (see notes to individual letters)</li>
</ul>
