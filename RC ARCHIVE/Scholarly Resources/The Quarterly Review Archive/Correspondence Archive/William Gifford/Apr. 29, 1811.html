    <p>My dear Sir</p>
    <p>Make no apologies for your letters, for I never see the direction of one of them but with pleasure, [so as] to receive some note of kindness.</p>
    <p>I shall really be glad of Lord Charlemont,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-29-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> as I think that it will be very possible for me to insert <sub>^</sub><sup>it in</sup> this No. unless the article on Dugald S.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-29-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> runs to an immoderate length, which I trust it will not. You may rely on the most rigid secrecy:&#8212;but the honest truth is, that I have not the slightest suspicions of my unknown correspondent. I was so careful of his secret, that when I found there was no time to send him the proof, I even destroyed your letter without taking the initials down: and as I cannot quite trust my memory, I must trouble you again, when time shall serve, to repeat them.</p>
    <p>The author of the critique on Blomfield is known to me but indirectly.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-29-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> I have every reason to believe him to be the Greek Professor of Cambridge. The communication of the Art. was made to me by D'Oyly of Benet Coll who has furnished [much scratching out] two or three theological articles. He is desirous of being concealed; you will, therefore, be kind enough to keep this intimation to yourself. I should add, what indeed, I ought to have mentioned before, that when no express injunction of secrecy is laid upon me, I will at all times, give you most readily every information in my power.</p>
    <p>The post that brought me your letter brought also one from Whitaker. It consists of a few lines only; being mostly to ask a question. I subjoin a literal transcript of what he says in the conclusion.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-29-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> "The Critique on my little Latin Work is most able, fair and manly&#8212;I do not always agree with the Writer in his Verbal Criticisms, but on the whole have very great reason not only to be satisfied but flattered by it".&#8212;my own opinion is that it is the most complete &amp; perfect piece of criticism which we have yet given to the world.</p>
    <p>Have you seen Mr Vaux, and will he fix on any thing. I am extremely anxious to set him to work.</p>
    <p>Heber arrived in town last night from the plow.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-29-1811_notes.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
    <p>I have just had a glimpse of him: he leaves us again on Wednesday night for Yorkshire, on warlike matters. You [tear] he is a very Cincinnatus&#8212;only [tear] no Racilia to put on his [dicta]torial robes, before the oxen [tear]<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-29-1811_notes.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>Ever, my dear Sir, your</p>
    <p>obliged &amp; very faithful</p>
    <p>servt Wm. Gifford</p>
    <p>P.S. From the date of your letter it ought to have reached me on Saturday: it came, however, but this morning.</p>
