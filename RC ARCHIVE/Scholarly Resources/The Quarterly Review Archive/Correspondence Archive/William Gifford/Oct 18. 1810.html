    <p>Mr dear Sir,</p>
    <p>I am sorry to say that Roscoe is in hand&#8212;I say <u>sorry</u> because I like the mode of treating him, which my unknown friend meant to pursue very much. Geo. Ellis has taken him, but I do not think that he proposes to make him a very prominent figure on the canvas, as he has coupled him with another writer.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-18-1810_notes.html#1">1</a></sup> I am much gratified by your friend's thinking of us, and trust that he will be pleased to continue his kindness; and think of some other work. I have much confidence in his politicks.</p>
    <p>I thank you most cordially for your letter. I should have troubled you with a line, if I had known you had been so near; and, indeed, [I] wrote last night to Dr Ireland, who is on the wing for Oxford, to make an inquiry if you were yet at Oriel, for Heber<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-18-1810_notes.html#2">2</a></sup> had told me that your far away [Greek]<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-18-1810_notes.html#3">3</a></sup></p>
    <p>I shall be very glad indeed to receive your critique.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-18-1810_notes.html#4">4</a></sup> As for the space it may occupy, that I leave entirely to you. The subject is not highly interesting in itself; but it may be made so by adjuncts, &amp; then space is a matter of no consideration. But I beg that you would <u>always</u> determine for yourself.</p>
    <p>We are very late this time, which is more vexatious as we ventured to promise an early appearance. The delay has arisen from an unknown friend, who sent me a considerable part of an Article more than six weeks since, with an assurance that the rest should immediately follow it&#8212;That [?vol] I only recd a week ago. We are now out of the press, &amp; I trust shall come forth on Saturday.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-18-1810_notes.html#5">5</a></sup> &#160;</p>
    <p>This, however, is the last No. in which I shall venture to trespass on the indulgence of our readers; as I am now making every exertion to regain our lost time. This is the Original Sin of our undertaking&#8212;we began without materials, and when I printed the first Article, I did not know <strike>f</strike> <sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-18-1810_notes.html#6">6</a></sup> what the fourth would be.</p>
    <p>Will it be in your power (I hope it will) to give us yours for this No.? In that case it will be necessary to have it by the end of November.</p>
    <p>I omitted to say that no alteration shall be made in your friend's m.s. without his consent: at all events, he shall see the last proof, if he pleases.</p>
    <p>[seal tear] hope that you congratulate us on [seal tear]rath shewn in the last Edin. Re[view] [seal tear]ab die unrevenged, if I do no[t] [seal tear] compel them to name us&#8212;at pr[esent] [seal tear] they only hint at us. Your trium[ph] [seal tear] is complete.</p>
    <p>I have a thousand things to say, but the Post is in the street, and I hear his hale. I am glad that I returned from the city&#8212;time enough to make even this rude scrawl&#8212;then I have been engaged to-day in business very foreign from Reviewing&#8212;no other than superintending Lottery tickets<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-18-1810_notes.html#7">7</a></sup>&#8212;which sharpens the wit wonderfully, as you have undoubtedly found by this time. Ever my dear Sir, your obliged &amp; faithful</p>
    <p>friend</p>
