    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>I was not aware that I had so strangely misstated my meaning; but I wrote in a hurry. I never had an idea of desiring you to abridge the Article in question, which I think a most excellent one &amp; intirely to the purpose. I merely intended to say that if any word could be softened with propriety, I should not be sorry as Whitaker was a zealous and able friend of ours; but this, I left intirely to you.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-11-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> As to the passage <em>I</em> 28, I really do not see that it can be mended, and assuredly I have no objection to it.</p>
    <p>It strikes me at this instant that you <sub>^</sub><sup>probably</sup> may allude to something which Murray may have blundered on, as the proof came thro' him&#8212;Launce's dog Crabb<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-11-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a>, never led his master into more scrapes than Murray has me: in a word, my dear Sir, he must be put intirely out of the question , &amp; though of no more than a middling infant&#8212;"A good man, neighbour, but his wits are not as blunt as&#8212;they should be.["]<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-11-1811_notes.html#3"> </a> "He will be talking".<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-11-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> Meantime, I hope that I am not injuring him, for I have not seen him&#8212;I have however sent him word to forward the proof immediately.</p>
    <p>What do you think of Prince Eugene for Mr Vaux? He has probably seen the article on Him in the last Edin. Rev. That is not, I think, insuperable; but he can judge. It was written for the Quarterly by Dr&#8212;&#8212;<sub>^</sub><sup>of Manchester</sup> I do not recollect his name&#8212;the person who detected Hume's plagiarisms from old Burton,&#8212;He told Heber that Sidney Smith had begged it of him so importunately that he could not refuse it.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-11-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>Ever my dear Sir, with sincere</p>
    <p>regards, your most faithful</p>
    <p>friend &amp; servt</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford</p>
