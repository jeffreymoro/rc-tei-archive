    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>You will, I know, excuse my troubling you on this occasion&#8212;On Monday, I sent a part of Charlemont to Mr Budd's,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-19-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> as you directed, &amp;, on the two following days, the remainder.&#8212;No inquiry has been made for the letters; and, as we are absolutely at a stand, at the 120th page, I am in considerable alarm about the time of our appearance.</p>
    <p>Will you, then, have the goodness to write a line without delay to your friend, &amp; say that the proofs wait for him at the appointed place. You may, and, I hope will be, too late; but I am anxious to take every precaution&#8212;</p>
    <p>Heber called on me yesterday in his flight to Shropshire, in good health but somewhat dejected by the death of poor Raine, whom, at his leaving town a short time before, he had seen in the full expectation of recovering his former health.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-19-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>I hope you will be able to let us have Ensor,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-19-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> or whatever you have in view, before the end of November; as we must be out before the holydays commence, &amp; the men take to the porter house.</p>
    <p>Aliter non fit, Avite, liber.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-19-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> Davison has been ill, and, I fear very ill: he has sent his article,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-19-1811_notes.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a> which I was obliged to give the printers immediately to keep them in employ. If any alterations are made they must be made in the proofs:&#8212;but I know not that they will be wanted.</p>
    <p>I wish you could see your friend's article in print.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-19-1811_notes.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a> You would be quite charmed with it. It makes just 23 pages.</p>
    <p>Ever, my dear Sir, most faithfully yours.</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford</p>
