    <p>My dear Sir</p>
    <p>On Sunday Evening<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_1-9-1811_notes.html#1">1</a></sup> Heber brought me your welcome letter; which I should have acknowledged immediately had I not been desirous of ascertaining the fate of Roscoe before I wrote. I believe that I told you G. Ellis had taken him up; Geo. however, was so busy with Huskisson<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_1-9-1811_notes.html#2">2</a></sup> &amp; so merry with Sir John,<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_1-9-1811_notes.html#3">3</a></sup> that this minor culprit escaped. I wrote to Sunning Hill on Monday, &amp; have this instant recd an answer. He is well content to cede him to your friend,<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_1-9-1811_notes.html#4">4</a></sup> &amp; I heartily wish that this had been done at first. I should regret it still more had not Roscoe's Evil Genius urged him to collect his tracts in the interim, &amp; thus to afford us a further <u>pris&#233;</u> on him. I asked George what his plan was, &amp; this is his reply "My idea was to couple him with Goldsmith, who has challenged him as he has Lord Grey; to treat him with some quiet ridicule, and to shew that he is in general a very pitiful politician&#8212;to give him credit for a spirited attack on Lord Grey's plan of <u>economical</u> warfare: this I thought would be safe and serviceable." He then repeats that he shall be glad to see an attack on him by a volunteer &amp;c. In this situation, I must beg of you to apply to your friend once more, and I heartily wish you may prevail on him to undertake it for the present No. I thank you for the mention of French literature. I should, indeed, be glad of some assistance in it.</p>
    <p>I come now to your friendly attention to Falconer;<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_1-9-1811_notes.html#5">5</a></sup> you have much improved his essay, and your Introductory matter is very good indeed, &amp; to the purpose. I really feel myself deeply obliged to your kindness and beg you to accept my sincere acknowledgments.</p>
    <p>I shall be glad to receive your Article on our good friend Whitaker<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_1-9-1811_notes.html#6">6</a></sup> whose critique on Chalmers marks a powerful and discriminating mind. Nares, not much to his credit as a man of literature&#8212;admitted into a former No. of the British Critick, an illiberal piece of imbecility on the Dr's work, which quite disgusted me.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_1-9-1811_notes.html#7">7</a></sup></p>
    <p>Heber, who is truly what you stile him, our excellent friend, &amp; whose zeal [seal tear] [and ac]tivity, are above all praise&#8212;is, [seal tear] [ ? ? ] "a jew an Ebrew jew<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_1-9-1811_notes.html#8">8</a></sup>&#160; [seal tear] in hand so long about going [seal tear] Oxford, and taking a line to Mr Davison for me<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_1-9-1811_notes.html#9">9</a></sup>, that I put off writing till I was shamed to write at all; and now he tells me, that gentleman is not to be found at Oxford. Here again, I must beg you to step in, and if you see Mr Davison to intreat that he will "banish Poins, banish Bardolph, banish Heber; but not honest Jack Falstaff"<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_1-9-1811_notes.html#10">10</a></sup> who is not much to blame in this case, and think of something for us with his earliest leisure. Your congratulations are very welcome to me:&#8212;with your assistance, with the University on our side, which, I hope, it will cordially be, what may we not look forward to! It consoles though it vexes me to see the Edin. people who insult these Establishments unable to produce a learned Article which is not derived from them. With the truest esteem, I am</p>
    <p>ever, my dear Sir, your obliged</p>
    <p>&amp; faithful servt</p>
    <p>Wm Gifford.</p>
