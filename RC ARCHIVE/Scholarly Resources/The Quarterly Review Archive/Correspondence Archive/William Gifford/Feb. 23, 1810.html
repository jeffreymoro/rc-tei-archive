    <p>Devon: no serial number. 2pp. Date: in another ancient hand (Copleston's?) that appears to have been traced over the original: Feb. 23. 1810</p>

    <p>My dear Sir</p>
    <p>I write to you from a sick couch, to which I have now been confined for several days by a very severe fever. This is the first exercise of my hand; the first exercise of my eyes has been to read your castigation of Squire Coker, which was brought to me this morning; and a very nice castigation it is.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-23-1810_notes.html#1">1</a></sup></p>
    <p>But the object of my writing is to thank you most cordially for the two Articles, the last of which <sub>^</sub> <sup>ie. that on S. Smith</sup> arrived on Wednesday.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-23-1810_notes.html#2">2</a></sup> I grieve to say that my ill state of health has hitherto prevented my looking it over: however, I have ordered it to be set up in slips, and it shall certainly appear; as it is quite in time&#8212;the Rev'd Gent. makes a second entr&#233;e in our No. but, in a more dignified character, namely as a <u>moderator</u> between Lord Grenville &amp; Dr. Duigenan.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-23-1810_notes.html#3">3</a></sup>&#160;</p>
    <p>Pray have the goodness to excuse this attempt at a letter, and believe me, my dear Sir, with the truest regard, your</p>
    <p>ever obliged &amp; obedt servt</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford.</p>
    <p>James St</p>
