    <p>My dear Ellis</p>
    <p>Your summary of criticism is quite as favourable to us as I could reasonably expect. Waverly is Croker's.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_George_%20Ellis_12-2-1814_notes.html#2">2</a></sup> I would have laid a heavy hand upon it, had he been in England, but he is captious &amp; capricious, and I cannot do without him: so, in doubt of consequences, I suffered his interminable quotations to pass. Badham,<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_George_%20Ellis_12-2-1814_notes.html#3">3</a></sup> as you perhaps guess, is mine: the man made me rather angry, by his dishonesty. I had also a hand in Kett<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_George_%20Ellis_12-2-1814_notes.html#4">4</a></sup> - but was restrained from saying as much as I wished, on Heber's account; who had hinted that if <sup>(Kett)</sup> should fall in my way he hoped he would be as leniently handled as truth would admit, for his active services in furthering his own view upon Oxford.</p>
    <p>Majoris [?habemus] - I greatly rejoice in your kind purpose of reviewing Sismondi's pamphlet<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_George_%20Ellis_12-2-1814_notes.html#5">5</a></sup>: the subject of it, too, is not only interesting and important at the moment, but will have an air of novelty in our pages. A month we can allow - Will that be sufficient? Our last No. was too long delayed; and it would be most desirable to hasten the appearance of the present.</p>
    <p>With respect to the Northern Book that can await your leisure - I own that I greatly wish for a review of it from you <u>&amp; pour cause</u>: but this shall be as you please, and when you please.</p>
    <p>I have written to Canning<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_George_%20Ellis_12-2-1814_notes.html#6">6</a></sup> - but the wicked winds have laid, I fear, an embargo on any dispatches. I see no objection in pressing the Edin. Reviewers into the service, at the expense of a trifling alteration or two. The Art. Will form a decent introduction to <u>the woe to come</u>; for surely he will not leave these people to triumph, or to believe that they triumph, in their impudence and falsehood - fiani no potent amigo mio. Portugal would not be a bower of roses to any other man; but he will overawe the rascally ill-disposed government, and find leisure to turn his thoughts towards us.</p>
