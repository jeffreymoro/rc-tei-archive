    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>With ten thousand thanks, I take the liberty of inclosing two drafts, the smaller of which is for our ingenious friend.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-11-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> I believe you have already apprised him that I venture to do this in consequence of an <u>indispensable</u> law to which all our correspondents have the goodness to submit.</p>
    <p>I should be extremely glad to know in what forwardness the Article is, which he kindly talked of furnishing us with, and about what time it may be expected.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-11-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> I long to anticipate the Edin. gentry this time, or, at least, to meet them on their first appearance. I really feel very great obligations to you for the assistance of this able pen: his Roscoe is excellent,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-11-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> and I flatter myself that he will not be displeased at any minute alteration which he may discover&#8212;indeed, I think that there is no one at all perceptible.</p>
    <p>And now, my dear Sir, let me also express my gratitude for your most sound &amp; critical &amp; ingenious review of the Dr.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-11-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> It will do us high credit, &amp; be universally approved by the learned.</p>
    <p>I hope that this is merely the commencement of your support,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-11-1811_notes.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a> &amp; that you will allow me to look to you for something in the present No. I have long known your friendly zeal, and I assure you that I am not insensible to it.&#8212;</p>
    <p>You mentioned a gentleman that would not improbably undertake a French Article: pray has he thought of Eugene or any other?&#8212;If you can procure us a volunteer, I shall be thankful. We stand high at present, and my anxiety increases.</p>
    <p>Pray admire our Article on India. I have not often seen such a performance. It is anonymous: but Lord Teignmouth, from whom I received it, tells me that the person who wrote it, has had recourse to every original document which India or England could furnish.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-11-1811_notes.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>What is become of Heber?<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_4-11-1811_notes.html#7"><sup>7</sup></a> Buried in one of his own furrows? I can hear nothing of him. He certainly did not intend to be absent so long when he left Town.</p>
    <p>Ever my dear Sir, with the</p>
    <p>sincerest esteem, your obliged</p>
    <p>&amp; faithful servt</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford</p>
    <p>&#160;</p>
    <p>Thursday morn.</p>
    <p>&#160;</p>
