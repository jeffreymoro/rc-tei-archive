    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>I have now the pleasure of saying that I look on myself as a convalescent of the first order&#8212;but I have been sadly pulled down.</p>
    <p>I thank you very sincerely for your little Art. which I hope to send you in a few days in the proof for your final glance.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_12-7-1811_notes.html#1"> </a> I like the tone of it, which accords with our plan; though the man (as far as personally concerned) deserved no mitigation of terms. Croker, who knows him, tells me that he is an officer of cavalry, &amp; just what his book shews him to be&#8212;<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_12-7-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    <p>And now, my best friend, let us look forward&#8212;What will your kindness &amp; leisure admit of your doing for our next? Have you thought of any thing? Can I procure you any books here that you would wish to look at, for the chance of being tempted to give us your opinion of them?</p>
    <p>&#8212;<u>One word in private</u>. You know the talents of Burney &amp; Elmsley, &amp; how serviceable they might be made to us, and how honourable&#8212;Yet, by some strange fatality, all turns out perversely. Instead of assisting us in the only way they can&#8212;they have both chosen to offer their lucubrations in theology. You probably saw the long winded review of Bishop Tomline's Calvinism in the Brit. Critick about 5 months ago&#8212;that was offered me by the former, &amp; would have sunk us. And it is with very sincere regret I add, that I was compelled to return to the latter a long article on the Dispute about the burial of Dissenters, with Judge Nichols. It was heavy &amp; indistinct, &amp; instead of taking a view of the question &amp; turning it in his own mind, the writer traveled backward and forward from the Judge to the Clergyman, till the patience was absolutely wearied out. This is a little hard&#8212;they send their learning to the Edinburgh where it is not understood nor valued, but received for selfish purposes, &amp; their theology, which Jeffrey would not condescend to look at, to us.&#8212;We should at least have both. Still, I hope we are on fair terms; for I have never expressed myself but with the sincerest respect for both these admirable scholars.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_12-7-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>Our friend Davison is in Coll. I find, &amp; am glad of it. He speaks modestly of his Article; but since I heard from him, I have had many warm congratulations on it, &amp; some very cordial ones from Scotland.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_12-7-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> I shall write to him on Monday in the hope of procuring a short article from him for this No. for we shall be so hard driven (owing, in some measure to my long illness) that I must sue my friends in form&#226; pauperis.</p>
    <p>The Brit. Crit. has, as you say, changed hands&#8212;It was not a moment too soon; for it was on the verge of ruin, &amp; even now will be saved with difficulty.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_12-7-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> See the effects of a mean spirit! Both Nares (Whom I respect) &amp; Beloe (whom I do <u>not</u>) wrote for promotion, &amp; never "stood in the presence of a great man."<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_12-7-1811_notes.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a>&#8212;Beloe came to me with a message from some Bishop on the appearance of our first No. which had spoken too freely, as he thought of the Church. I treated the messenger &amp; the message with equal light, &amp; heard no more.</p>
    <p>Ever, my dear Sir, with</p>
    <p>the sincerest esteem,</p>
    <p>your obliged &amp; faithful</p>
    <p>servt. Wm. Gifford</p>
