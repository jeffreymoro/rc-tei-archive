    <p><font color="#000066"><b><a name="celebration" id=
    "celebration"></a>A Celebration of the Murray
    Archives</b></font><br />
    With the imminent sale of the Murray Archives (one hopes to the
    National Library of Scotland, as planned), it is fitting to
    point out that the <i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive is,
    essentially, a celebration of that wonderful repository. The
    great majority of the documents cited or quoted in the over
    250,000 words of this website are from Murray's. The editor and
    the users of this site owe a debt of gratitude to the Murray
    family for preserving over a period of 200-odd years&mdash;and
    for providing generous access to&mdash;what is by any measure
    an extraordinary national treasure, the record of an
    illustrious publishing house's negotiations with a panoply of
    authors great and small.</p>

    <p><br />
    <b><a name="attributions" id="attributions"></a><font color=
    "#000066">Original Attributions of Authorship</font></b><br />
    The main purpose of this website is to publish original
    attributions of authorship of unsigned articles in the
    <i>Quarterly Review</i> for the period 1809-24 and to be an
    accessible archive of primary source material on the
    journal.</p>

    <p>Articles in the <i>Quarterly</i>, as was the custom for
    literary-political reviews at the time, were published
    unsigned. Discovering the identities of the journal's writers
    has involved four separate groups or individuals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>John Murray III who, in the mid-nineteenth century,
      recorded his researches into his company's archives in what
      is now called his "Register"</li>

      <li>Hill Shine and Helen Chadwick Shine in the late 1940s,
      who depended largely upon Murray's "Register" and published
      their work in <i>The Quarterly Review Under Gifford:
      Identification of Contributors 1809-1824</i> (1949)</li>

      <li>The editors of <i>The Wellesley Index to Victorian
      Periodicals</i> Volume I (1967), who also depended largely
      upon Murray's "Register"</li>

      <li>And the present writer, most of whose work appeared in
      three articles in <i>Victorian Periodicals Review</i> (24:3;
      27:4; 28:4). Readers who are interested in full details of
      how and why the present effort came about may consult in
      particular my "<i>Wellesley Index I's Quarterly Review</i>
      Identifications: Was the Murray Register a Reliable Source?"
      (<i>VPR</i> 27.4:294-299). A considerable amount of new
      material that may be of interest to scholars is published for
      the first time in this website's <a href=
      "../index/index.html"><b>index pages</b></a>. In preparing my
      work I have attempted to make use of all available primary
      and secondary sources (concerning which, please see the
      <a href="acknowledgements.html"><strong>acknowledgements
      page</strong></a> and the <a href="sources.html"><b>primary
      sources bibliography</b></a>; secondary sources are pointed
      to in the Shine volume and, supplementary to Shine, in the
      notes on this website).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Shine volume (<i>The Quarterly Review Under
    Gifford</i>), to which scholars most often refer as an
    authority in the matter of <i>Quarterly Review</i>
    attributions, reflects the best information available at the
    time of its publication (1949). The Shines' claim to have
    identified authors for almost 90 per cent of the articles
    published under Gifford is not accurate. Fully 60 per cent of
    the attributions in Shine are unsupported by evidence or offer
    evidence that is unconvincing; a few of the attributions in
    Shine are incorrect. Much of the work in Shine is in fact a
    transcript of the original investigations of John Murray III.
    Murray's attributions, recorded in an unpublished manuscript
    the Shine volume designates as the "Register," have turned out
    to be generally reliable, but a majority of the Register's
    attributions are not backed by evidence. Despite this lack of
    evidence, the Shine volume more often than not accepts the
    Register's attributions at face value.</p>

    <p>When I set out to write a history of the <i>Quarterly
    Review</i>, I soon realized that the work could not proceed
    until the inadequacies of the Shine volume were rectified. In
    order to secure the scholarly reliability of John Murray III's
    work, and to extend it, I therefore undertook to reinvestigate
    all of Murray's sources, and then some. As a result, of the 733
    articles published during Gifford's tenure the authors of 706
    have now been identified. (Some of these attributions,
    lamentably, must be designated "probably" while a few, on the
    lowest rung of certainty, are designated "possibly".) Of the 77
    articles the Shine volume lists as unattributed, fewer than 25
    remain for which no suggestion of authorship can be made.</p>

    <p>On the question of assigning authorship, I hold views
    similar to those of P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens, Defoe
    scholars: "there is something unsatisfactory in works being
    attributed to an author ... on internal evidence alone. It is
    not till there is some scrap of external evidence present that
    internal evidence comes into its own." The editors of the
    <i>Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals</i> thought so too,
    until they discovered that stylistic or internal evidence, when
    used by knowledgeable investigators, can yield excellent
    results. Still, in the absence of external evidence, regardless
    of how certain the individual scholar may be that he or she
    recognizes the mark of an author in a work, others have a right
    to be less than certain. Consequently, I agree with Furbank and
    Owens that, with rare exceptions, attributions based on
    internal evidence can at best be considered "probable". In the
    early <i>Quarterly</i> the exception, to my mind, is John
    Barrow, who by design left clear signs of his authorship.
    Against intuition, it is also possible for objective evidence
    to mislead, or appear to, and I have tried to be cognisant of
    that weighing evidence. Ultimately, each reader of the evidence
    will have to form his or her own judgment.</p>

    There is one index page for each Number of the review in the
    period 1809 to 1824. For each Number the following information
    is supplied:</p>

    
      <ol>
        <li>Volume and issue numbers. Publication date as indicated
        on the Number's or Volume's title page</li>

        <li>Extensive notes on the Number as a whole appear at the
        head of each Index page

          <ul>
            <li>If available, information about number of copies
            printed and sales</li>

            <li>Again, if available, information about cancelled or
            rejected articles</li>

            <li>For the first Number in a given year a listing of
            key British and world events, with an emphasis on
            politics and literature</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>This note establishes the actual publication date of
        the Number. In many cases the real publication date differs
        from the publication date that appears on the title page
        (concerning this, see the essay on <a href=
        "../features/pub_dates_essay.html">Publication
        Dates</a>)</li>

        <li>Following the head note to each Number are entries for
        each of the articles in the Number. Each entry is
        introduced with basic identifying information, as follows

          <ul>
            <li>Article serial number inherited from Shine, <i>The
            Quarterly Review Under Gifford</i> (1949)</li>

            <li>Article number as indicated in the Number</li>

            <li>Full titles of the volumes under review</li>

            <li>The article's inclusive page numbers</li>

            <li>The article's author as established through
            original research. The following conventions are used
            to indicate the article's primary author or authors and
            sub-editorial contributions. The article's primary
            author is indicated first, in bold. The conjunction
            'and' indicates multiple primary authors, as in 'George
            Ellis and George Canning'. The preposition 'with'
            indicates the article's sub-editor or minor
            collaborators, including persons who merely supplied
            materials. Less than certain author attributions are
            indicated as 'probable' or 'possible', depending upon
            the strength of the evidence. The degree of certainty
            assigned to each attribution represents an assessment
            by the present writer of the objective evidence
            presented in the Index pages.</li>

            <li>The article's running title</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Next, for each article Notes are provided, arranged as
        follows:

          <ul>
            <li>The Shines' evidence in favour of the attribution
            is supplied and commented upon by the present writer.
            For abbreviations the reader is invited to consult the
            Shine volume. Some additional abbreviations are
            identified in a popup window that can be opened from a
            link in the Index pages</li>

            <li>Evidence supplied by the present writer follows.
            This evidence is based on original research. The
            evidence may support, supersede, or qualify the
            attribution in Shine or it may establish a wholly new
            attribution. These notes extend our understanding of
            the complex editorial life of the <i>Quarterly
            Review.</i> Information in these notes clarifies author
            attribution and supplies details about the article's
            publishing history. The information in many cases
            identifies the article's sub-editor and the
            often-complex negotiations between the editor, the
            publisher, and the article's contributor.</li>

            transcriptions of the entries in the so-called Murray
            Register and JM II's notations in his marked run of the

      per cent of the time during William Gifford's tenure as
