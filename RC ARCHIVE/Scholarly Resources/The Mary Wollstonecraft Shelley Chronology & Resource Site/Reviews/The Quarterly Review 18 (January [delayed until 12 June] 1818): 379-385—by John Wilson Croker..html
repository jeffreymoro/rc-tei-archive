<p><b><i>Quarterly Review</i> 18 (January [delayed until 12 June] 1818): 379-385&mdash;by
    John Wilson Croker.</b></p>
<p>Frankenstein, a Swiss student at the university of Ingolstadt, is led by a peculiar
enthusiasm to study the structure of the human frame, and to attempt to follow to its
recondite sources 'the stream of animal being.' In examining the causes of <i>life</i>,
he informs us, antithetically, that he had first recourse to <i>death</i>.&mdash;He
became acquainted with anatomy; but that was not all; he traced through vaults and
charnel houses the decay and corruption of the human body, and whilst engaged in this
agreeable pursuit, examining and analyzing the minutiae of mortality, and the phenomena
of the change from life to death and from death to life, a sudden light broke in upon
him&mdash;</p>
<div class="indent30"><blockquote><p>'A light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I
    became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was
    surprized that among so many men of genius, who had directed their inquiries towards
    the same science, I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
    secret.</p>
<p>'Remember, I am <small>NOT</small> recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not
    more certainly shine in the heavens, than that which I now affirm is true. Some
    miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and
    probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in
    discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of
    bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.'&mdash;p. 84-85. </p></blockquote>
<p>Having made this wonderful discovery, he hastened to put it in practice; by
    plundering graves and stealing, not bodies, but parts of bodies, from the
    church-yard: by dabbling (as he delicately expresses it) with the unhallowed damps
    of the grave, and torturing the living animal to animate lifeless clay, our modern
    Prometheus formed a filthy image to which the last step of his art was to
    communicate being:&mdash;for the conveiniece of the process of his animal
    manufacture, he had chosen to form his figure about eight feet high, and he
    endeavoured to make it as handsome as he could&mdash;he succeeded in the first
    object and failed in the second; he made and animated his giant; but by some little
    mistakein the artist's calculation, the intended beauty turned out the ugliest
    monster that ever deformed the day. The creator, terrified at his own work, flies
    into one wood, and the work, terrified at itself, flies into another. Here the
    monster, by the easy process of listening at the window of a cottage, acquires a
    complete education: he learns to think, to talk, to read prose and verse; he becomes
    acquainted with geography, history, and natural philosophy, in short, 'a most
    delicate monster.' This credible course of study, and its very natural success, and
    brought about by a combination of circumstances almost as natural. In the aforesaid
    cottage, a young <i>Frenchman</i> employed his time in teaching an <i>Arabian</i>
    girl all these fine things, utterly unconscious that while he was </p></div>
<blockquote>'whispering soft lessons in his fair one's ear,' </blockquote>
<p>he was also tutoring Frankenstein's hopeful son. The monster, however, by due diligence,
becomes highly accomplished: he reads Plutarch's Lives, Paradise Lost, Volney's Ruin of
Empires, and the Sorrows of Werter. Such were the works which constituted the
Greco-Anglico-Germanico-Gallico-Arabic library of a Swabian hut, which, if not numerous,
was at least miscellaneous, and reminds us, in this particular, of Lingo's famous
combination of historic characters&mdash;'Mahomet, Heliogabalus, Wat Tyler, and Jack the
Painter.' He learns also the decypher some writings which he carried off from the
laboratory in which he was manufactured; by these papers he becomes acquainted with the
name and residence of Frankenstein and his family, and as his education has given him so
good a taste as to detest himself, he has also the good sense to detest his creator for
imposing upon him such a horrible burden as conscious existence, and he therefore
commences a series of bloody persecutions against the unhappy Frankenstein&mdash;he
murders his infant brother, his young bride, his bosom friend; even the very nursury
maids of the family are not safe from his vengeance, for he contrives that they shall be
hanged for robbery and murder which he himself commits. </p>
<div class="indent30"><p>The monster, however, has some method in his madness: he meets his
    Prometheus in the valley of Chamouny, and, in a long conversation, tells him the
    whole story of his adventures and his crimes, and declares that he will 'spill more
    blood and become worse,' unless Frankenstein will <i>make</i> (we should perhaps say
        <i>build</i>) a wife for him: the Sorrows of Werter had, it seems, given him a
    strange longing to find a Charlotte, of a suitable size, and it is plain that none
    of Eve's daughters, not even the enormous Charlotte of the Variétés herself, would
    have suited this stupendous fantoccino. A compliance with this natural desire his
    kind-hearted parent most resonably promises; but, on further consideration, he
    becomes alarmed at the thought of reviving the race of Anak, and he therefore
    resolves to break his engagement, and to defeat the procreative propensities of his
    ungracious child&mdash;hence great wrath and new horrors&mdash;parental unkindness
    and filial ingratitude. The monster hastens to execute his promised course of
    atrocity, and the monster-maker hurries after to stab or shoot him, and so put an
    end to his proceedings. This chase leads Frankenstein through Germany and France, to
    England, Scotland, and Ireland, in which latter country, heis taken up by a
    constable called Daniel Nugent, and carred before Squire Kirwan a magistrate, and
    very nearly hanged for a murder committed by the monster. We were greatly edified
    with the laudable minuteness which induces the author to give us the names of these
    officers of justice; it would, however, have been but fair to have given us also
    those of the impartial judge and enlightened jury who acquitted him, for acquitted,
    as our readers will be glad to hear, honoourably, acquitted, he was at the assizes
    of Donegal.&mdash;Escaped from this peril, he renews the chase, and the monster,
    finding himself hard pressed, resolves to fly to the most inaccessible point of the
    earth; and, as our Review had not yet enlightened mankind upon the real state of the
    North Pole, he directs his course thither as a sure place of solitude and security;
    but Frankenstein, who probably has read Mr. Daines Barrington and Colonel Beaufoy on
    the subject, was not discouraged, and follows him with redoubled vigour, the monster
    flying on a sledge drawn by dogs, according to the Colonel's proposition, and
    Prometheus following in another&mdash;the former, however, had either more skill or
    better luck than the latter, whose dogs died, and who must have been drowned on the
    breaking up of the ice, had he not been fortunately picked up in the nick of time by
    Mr. Walton, the master of an English whaler, employed on a voyage of discovery
    towards the North Pole. On board this ship poor Frankenstein, after telling his
    story to Mr. Walton, who has been so kind to write it down for our use, dies of
    cold, fatigue, and horror; and soon after, the monster, who had borrowed (we presume
    from the flourishing colony of East Greenland) a kind of raft, comes alongside the
    ship, and notwithstanding his huge bulk, jumps in at Mr. Walton's cabin window, and
    is surprised by that gentleman pronouncing a funeral oration over the departed
    Frankenstein; after which, declaring that he will go back to the Pole, and there
    burn himself on a funeral pyre (of ice, we conjecture) of his own collecting, he
    jumps again out the window into his raft, and is out of sight in a moment. </p>
<p>Our readers will guess from this summary, what a tissue of horrible and disgusting
    absurdity this work presents.&mdash;It is piously dedicated to Mr. Godwin, and is
    written in the spirit of his school. The dreams of insanity are embodied in the
    strong and striking language of the insane, and the author, notwithstanding the
    rationality of his preface, often leaves us in doubt whether he is not as mad as his
    hero. Mr. Godwin is the patriarch of a literary family, whose chief skill is in
    delineating the wanderings of the intellect, and which strangely delights in the
    most affecting and humilitating of human miseries. His disciples are a kind of
        <i>out pensioners of Bedlam</i>, and like 'Mad Bess' or 'Mad Tom,' are
    occasionally visited with paroxysms of genius and fits of expression, which makes
    sober-minded people wonder and shudder. </p>
<p>We shall give our readers a very favourable specimen of the vigour of fancy and
    language with which this work is written, by extracting from it the three passages
    which struck us the most on our perusal of it. The first is the account of the
    animation of the image. </p>
<blockquote><p>'It was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils.
    With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life
    around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at
    my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the
    panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the
    half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed
    hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. </p>
<p>'How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom
    with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in
    proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!&mdash;Great
    G&mdash;! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath;
    his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but
    these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that
    seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set,
    his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips. </p>
<p>'The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human
    nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing
    life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I
    had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had
    finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled
    my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of
    the room, and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my
    mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and
    I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of
    forgetfulness. But it was in vain: I slept indeed, but I was disturbed by the
    wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the
    streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprized, I embraced her; but as I imprinted
    the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features
    appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my
    arms; a shrowd enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds
    of the flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead,
    my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow
    light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window-shutters, I beheld the
    wretch&mdash;the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the
    bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened,
    and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might
    have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me,
    but I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard belonging to
    the house which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night, walking
    up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing
    each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which
    I had so miserably given life.'&mdash;vol. i. pp. 97-101.</p></blockquote>
<p>The next is a description of the meeting in the valley of Chamouny. </p>
<blockquote><p>'It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat upon
    the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the surrounding
    mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the
    glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea,
    descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost
    a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite
    mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert
    was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in
    awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and
    stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its
    dependent mountains, whose a&euml;rial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and
    glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was before
    sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed&mdash;"Wandering
    spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this
    faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life." </p>
<p>'As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing
    towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among
    which I had walked with caution; his stature also, as he approached, seemed to
    exceed that of man. I was troubled: a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness
    seize me; but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived,
    as the shape came nearer, (sight tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch
    whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach,
    and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke
    bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
    rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rage
    and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm
    him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.'&ndash;vol. ii. pp.
    21-23.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last with which we shall agitate the nerves of our readers is Captain Walton's
    description of the monster he found in his cabin. </p>
<blockquote><p>'O! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I
    hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have
    recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe. </p>
<p>'I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend.
    Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe; gigantic in stature, yet
    uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was
    concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour
    and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach,
    he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror, and sprung towards the window.
    Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome, yet
    appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily, and endeavoured to recollect
    what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay. </p>
<p>'He paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again turning towards the lifeless form
    of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture
    seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion. </p>
<p><b>'"</b>That is also my victim!" he exclaimed; "in his murder my crimes are
    consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh,
    Frankenstein! generous and self-devoted being! what does it avail that I now ask
    thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou
    lovedst. Alas! he is cold; he may not answer me."</p>
<p>'His voice seemed suffocated; and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the
    duty of obeying the dying request of my friend, in destroying his enemy, were now
    suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached this tremendous
    being; I dared not again raise my looks upon his face, there was something so
    scaring and unearthly in its ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away
    on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent
    self-reproaches.'&mdash;vol. iii. pp. 178-181.</p></blockquote>
<p>It cannot be denied that this is nonsense&mdash;but it is nonsense decked out with
    circumstances and clothed in language highly terrific: it is, indeed, </p></div>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'a
    tale <br /> Told by an ideot, full of sound and fury, <br /> Signifying
    nothing&mdash;'</p></blockquote>
<p>but still there is something tremendous in the unmeaning hollowness of its sound, and the
vague obscurity of its images.</p>
<div class="indent30"><p>But when we have thus admitted that Frankenstein has passages which
    appal the mind and make the flesh creep, we have given it all the praise (if praise
    it can be called) which we dare to bestow. Our taste and our judgment alike revolt
    at this kind of writing, and the greater the ability with which it may be executed
    the worse it is&mdash;it inculcates no lesson of conduct, manners, or morality; it
    cannot mend, and will not even amuse its readers, unless their taste have been
    deplorably vitiated&mdash;it fatigues the feelings without interesting the
    understanding; it gratuitously harasses the heart, and wantonly adds to the store,
    already too great, of painful sensations. The author has powers, both of conception
    and language, which employed in a happier direction might, perhaps, (we speak
    dubiously,) give him a name among these whose writings amuse or amend their
    fellow-creatures; but we take the liberty of assuring him, and hope that he may be
    in a temper to listen to us, that the style which he has adopted in the present
    publication merely tends to defeat his own purpose, if he really had any other
    object in view than that of leaving the wearied reader, after a struggle between
    laughter and loathing, in doubt whether the head or the heart of the author be the
    most diseased. </p>
