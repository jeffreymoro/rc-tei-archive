<div class="indent30">
<p>This novel is a feeble imitation of one that was very popular in its day,&mdash;the
    St. Leon of Mr. Godwin. It exhibits many characteristics of the school whence it
    proceeds; and occasionally puts forth indications of talent; but we have been very
    much disappointed in the perusal of it, from our expectations having been raised too
    high beforehand by injudicious praises; and it exhibits a strong tendency towards
        <i>materialism.</i></p>
<p>The main idea on which the story of Frankenstein rests, undoubtedly affords scope for
    the display of imagination and fancy, as well as knowledge of the human heart; and
    the anonymous author has not wholly neglected the opportunities which it presented
    to him: but the work seems to have been written in great haste, and on a very crude
    and ill-digested plan; and the detail is, in consequence, frequently filled with the
    most gross and obvious inconsistencies. We shall hereafter point out a few of those
    to which we allude.</p>
<p>The story begins at the end. Walton, an enthusiastic traveller, bound on a voyage of
    discovery in the north seas, after having been for some time surrounded with ice, is
    astonished by the appearance of a human being of apparently savage character who
    passes the vessel at a distance, in a sledge drawn by dogs. The day after this
    extraordinary adventure the ice breaks up; but previously to the vessel sailing away
    from it, they encounter another human being, nearly exhausted with fatigue and
    privation. This last, who is taken into the vessel, proves to be Frankenstein, the
    hero of the tale; who at the time he had been nearly destroyed by the breaking up of
    the ice, was in pursuit of the being that had passed the vessel on the preceding
    day. After a time Frankenstein contracts a friendship with Walton, the Captain of
    the vessel, and relates to him his supernatural story.&mdash;In his youth he had
    been led by accident to study chemistry; and becoming deeply interested by the
    results of his experiments, he at length conceived the idea of its being possible to
    discover the principle of vital existence. Taking this possibility as the leading
    point of his studies, he pursues them with such effect as at last actually to gain
    the power of endowing inanimate matter with life!!! He instantly determines to put
    his newly acquired power into practice; and for this purpose collects the materials
    with which to form a living human being. From the difficulty of arranging some of
    the parts, arising from their minuteness, he determines to chuse them of more than
    ordinary size. In short, after incredible pains and perseverance, he at length
    succeeded in producing a living human being, eight feet high, and of proportionate
    powers. From this moment Frankenstein commences a life of unmixed and unceasing
    misery. The being which he has formed becomes his torment, and that of every one
    connected with him. He causes one by one the death of all Frankenstein's dearest
    connections; his brother, his friend, and lastly his wife&mdash;whom he murders on
    their wedding night. The fiend then quits the country where he has committed these
    horrors; and Frankenstein, in dispair, determines to pursue him until he shall
    either destroy him, or die by his hand. The story ends shortly after what we have
    related in the beginning. Frankenstein dies on board the vessel of Walton; and the
    fiend may, for any thing we know to be the contrary, be wandering about upon the ice
    in the neighbourhood of the North Pole to this day; and may, in that case, be among
    the wonderful discoveries to be made by the expedition which is destined there. </p>
<p>We have mentioned that there are gross inconsistencies in the minor details of the
    story. They are such, for example, as the following: the moment Frankenstein has
    endowed with life the previously inanimate form of the being which he has made, he
    is so horror-struck with the hideousness of the form and features, when they are put
    in motion, that he remains fixed to the spot, while the gigantic monster runs from
    the horizontal posture in which he lay, and <i>walks away;</i> and Frankenstein
    never hears any more of him for nearly two years. The author supposes that his hero
    has the power of communicating <i>life</i> to dead matter: but what has the vital
    principle to do with <i>habits,</i> and actions which are dependent on the moral
    will? If Frankenstein could have endowed his creature with the vital principle of a
    hundred or a thousand human beings, it would no more have been able <i>to walk</i>
    without having previously acquired <i>the habit</i> of doing so, than it would be to
    talk, or to reason, or to judge. He does not pretend that he could endow it with
        <i>faculties</i> as well as life: and yet when it is about <i>a year old</i> we
    find it reading <i>Werter</i>, and <i>Plutarch</i> and <i>Volney</i>! The whole
    detail of the development of the creature's mind and faculties is full of these
    monstrous inconsistencies. After the creature leaves Frankenstein, on the night of
        <i>its birth</i>, it wanders for sometime in the woods, and then takes up its
    residence in a kind of shed adjoining to a cottage, where it remains for many months
    without the knowledge of the inhabitants; and learns to talk and read thro' a chink
    in the wall! "<i>Quod mihi ostendit</i>," &amp;c</p>
<p>We have heard that this work is written by Mr. Shelley; but should be disposed to
    attribute it to even a less experienced writer than he is. In fact we have some idea
    that it is the production of a daughter of a celebrated living novelist. </p>
