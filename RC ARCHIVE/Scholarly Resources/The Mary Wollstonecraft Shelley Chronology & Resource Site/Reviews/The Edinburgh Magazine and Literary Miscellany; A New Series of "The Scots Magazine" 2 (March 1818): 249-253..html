        <p><b><i>The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany; A New Series of "The Scots
            Magazine"</i> 2 (March 1818): 249-53.</b></p>
<div class="indent30">
    <p>Here is one of the productions of the modern school in its highest style of
        caricature and exaggeration. It is formed on the Godwinian manner, and has all the
        faults, but many likewise of the beauties of that model. In dark and gloomy views of
        nature and of man, bordering too closely on impiety,&mdash;in the most outrageous
        improbability,&mdash;in sacrificing every thing to effect,&mdash;it even goes beyond
        its great prototype; but in return, it possesses a similar power of fascination,
        something of the same mastery in harsh and savage delineations of passion, relieved
        in like manner by the gentler features of domestic and simple feelings. There never
        was a wilder story imagined, yet, like most of the fictions of this age, it has an
        air of reality attached to it, by being connected with the favourite projects and
        passions of the times. The real events of the world have, in our day, too, been of
        so wondrous and gigantic a kind,&mdash;the shiftings of the scenes in our stupendous
        drama have been so rapid and various, that Shakespeare himself, in his wildest
        flights, has been completely distanced by the eccentricities of actual existence.
        Even he would scarcely have dared to have raised, in one act, a private adventurer
        to the greatest of European thrones,&mdash;to have conducted him, in the next,
        victorious over the necks of emperors and kings, and then, in a third, to have shewn
        him an exile, in a remote speck of an island, some thousands of miles from the scene
        of his triumphs; and the chariot which bore him along covered with glory, quietly
        exhibited to a gaping mechanical rabble under the roof of one of the beautiful
        buildings on the North Bridge of Edinburgh,&mdash;(which buildings we heartily pray
        may be brought as low as the mighty potentate whose Eagles are now to be seen
        looking out of their windows, like the fox from the ruins of Balclutha.) Our
        appetite, we say, for every sort of wonder and vehement interest, has in this way
        become so desperately inflamed, that especially as the world around us has again
        settled into its old dull state of happiness and legitimacy, we can be satisfied
        with nothing in fiction that is not highly coloured and exaggerated; we even like a
        story the better that it is disjointed and irregular, and our greatest inventors,
        accordingly, have been obliged to accommodate themselves to the taste of the age,
        more, we believe, than their own judgment can, at all times, have approved of. The
        very extravagance of the present production will now, therefore, be, perhaps, in its
        favour, since the events which have actually passed before our eyes have made the
        atmosphere of miracles that in which we most readily breathe. </p>
    <p>The story opens with a voyage of discovery to the North Pole. A young Englishman,
        whose mind has long been inflamed with this project, sets sail from Archangel, soon
        gets inclosed, as usual, among ice mountains, and is beginning to despair of success,
        when all his interest and thoughts are diverted suddenly into another channel, in
        consequence of a very singular adventure. One day a gigantic figure was seen moving
        northwards on a sledge, drawn by dogs, and a short time afterwards a poor emaciated
        wretch was picked up from a sledge that drifted close to the vessel. The Englishman
        soon formed a violent friendship for this stranger, and discovers him to be a person
        of the greatest virtues, talents, and acquirements, which are only rendered the more
        admirable and interesting, from the deep cloud of melancholy which frequently
        overshadowed them. After a time, he gets so far into his confidence, as to obtain
        from him the story of his life and misfortunes. His name was Frankenstein, son of a
        Syndic of Geneva, and of an amiable mother, who very properly dies at the beginning
        of the book, to leave her son and a young female cousin, who resided in the family,
        so disconsolate, that they could find no comfort except by falling in love.
        Frankenstein had been left much to his own disposal in the conduct of his studies,
        and, at a very early period, he had become quite <i>ent&ecirc;t&eacute;</i> with
        some of the writings of the alchemists, on which he accidentally lighted; and we
        were at first in expectation that, like St Leon, he was to become possessed of the
        philosopher's stone, or of the <i>elixir vitae</i>. He is destined, however, to
        obtain a still more extraordinary power, but not from the alchemists, of the
        futility of whose speculations he soon became convinced, but whose wild conceptions
        continued to give to his mind a strong and peculiar bias. </p>
    <p>At the university, stimulated by the encouragement of some distinguished
        philosophers, he applied himself, with the utmost perseverance and ability, to every
        department of natural science, and soon became the general object of envy and
        admiration. His researches led him to investigate the principle of life, which he
        did in the old and approved manner by dissecting living animals, groping into all
        the repositories of the dead, and making himself acquainted with life and death in
        all their forms. The result was a most wonderful discovery,&mdash;quite simple, he
        says, when it was made, but yet one which he very wisely does not communicate to his
        English acquaintance, and which, of course, must remain a secret to world,&mdash;no
        less than the discovery of the means of communicating life to an organized form.
        With this our young philosopher sets himself to make a man, and that he might make
        no blunder from taking too small a scale, unfortunately, as it turns out, his man is
        a giant. In a garret of his apartments, to which none but himself was ever admitted,
        he employs four months on this wonderful production. Many of the ingredients seem to
        have been of a very disgusting description, since he passed whole nights in
        sepulchres raking them out; he thought, however, that he had succeeded in making a
        giant, as gainly in appearance as least as O'Brien, or the Yorkshire Boy, and every
        thing was now ready for the last touch of the master, the infusion of life into the
        inanimate mass. In breathless expectation, in the dead of night, he performed this
        last momentous act of creation; and the creature opened upon him two immense ghastly
        yellow eyes, which struck him with instant horror. He immediately hated himself and
        his work, and flew, in a state of feverish agony, to his room below; but, finding
        himself followed thither by the monster, he rushed out into the streets, where he
        walked about in fearful agitation, till the morning dawned, and they began to be
        frequented by their inhabitants. Passing along, he saw step from a coach an intimate
        friend of his from Geneva. For the moment he forgot every thing that had happened,
        was delighted to find that his friend had come to pursue his studies along with him,
        and was conducting him to his apartments, when on a sudden he recollected the
        dreadful inmate who would probably be found in them. He ran up and examined them,
        and, on finding that the monster had disappeared, his joy became quite foolish and
        outrageous; he danced about like a madman, and his friend was not surprised when
        immediately after he was seized by a delirious fever, which confined him for some
        weeks, alleviated, however, by all the attentions which friendship could bestow. </p>
    <p>Scarcely had he recovered, when a sad piece of intelligence arrives from home. His
        father writes him that his little brother had strayed from them in an evening walk,
        and was at last found dead, and apparently strangled. He flies home to comfort his
        family, but it is night ere he reaches Geneva, and the gates being shut, he remains
        in the neighbourhood, and walks out in the dark towards the hills. The monster on a
        sudden stalks past him, and moving with inconceivable rapidity, is seen by him
        perched on one of the highest cliffs. The thought instantly strikes him, that this
        fiend, the creation of his own hand, must have been the murderer of his brother, and
        he feels all the bitterness of despair. Very ill able to comfort others, he next
        morning went to his father's house, and learns, as an additional misery, that a
        young servant girl, who had been beloved as a friend in the family, was taken up on
        suspicion of the murder, and was to be tried for her life. A picture, which the
        child had worn on the fateful night, was found in her pocket. Though, in his own
        mind, he could not doubt of the real author of the murder, and his beloved Elizabeth
        was equally convinced that it could not be her favourite Justine, still
        circumstances were so strong against her, that the poor girl was condemned and
        executed. No wonder that Frankenstein now fell into a deep melancholy; to relieve
        him from which, his father took him and Elizabeth on a tour to the valley of
        Chamounix. This part of the book is very beautifully written; the description of the
        mountain scenery, and of its effect on Frankenstein's mind, is finely given. One
        rainy day they did not proceed on their journey, but Frankenstein, in a state of
        more than common depression, left them early in the inn, for the purpose of scaling
        the summit of Montarvet.</p>
    <p>"It was nearly noon (he says) when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time
        I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the
        surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon
        the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea,
        descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost
        a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite
        mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montarvet was
        exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in
        awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and
        stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its
        dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and
        glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was before
        sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed&mdash;'Wandering
        spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this
        faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.' As I
        said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing
        towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among
        which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to
        exceed that of man. I was troubled: a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness
        seize me; but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived,
        as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred,) that it was the wretch
        whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach,
        and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke
        bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
        rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes."</p>
    <p>Frankenstein at first addresses him in words of violent rage,&mdash;the monster,
        however, endeavours to soften him.</p>
    <p>"Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who
        implores thy goodness and compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein: I was benevolent; my
        soul glowed with love and humanity: but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my
        creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who owe me
        nothing? they spurn and hate me. The desart mountains and dreary glaciers are my
        refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear,
        are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies
        I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow-beings. If the multitude of
        mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my
        destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?&mdash;Hear my tale; it is long
        and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine
        sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens;
        before it descends to hide itself behind yon snowy precipices, and illuminate
        another world, you will have heard my story, and can decide. On you it rests whether
        I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man, and lead a hapless life, or become the
        scourge of your fellow-creatures, and the author of your own speedy ruin."</p>
    <p>The monster now begins his story, and a very amiable personage he makes himself to
        be. The story is well fancied and told. Immediately on his creation he wandered out
        into the forest of Ingoldstadt, where he remained for some days, till his different
        senses learnt to perform their appropriate functions, and he discovered the use of
        fire and various other rudiments of knowledge; and thus accomplished, he ventured
        forth into the great world. But in the first village that he reached he was hooted
        and stoned, and was obliged to take shelter in a hovel at the back of a cottage.
        Through a crevice in the wall, he soon became intimate with all the operations in
        the cottage, the inhabitants of which were an old blind man, his son and daughter.
        After the reception he had met with in the village, he kept himself very snug in his
        hole through the day, but being really a good&mdash;natured monster, and finding the
        young man was much overwrought in cutting fuel for the family, what does he, but
        betake him to the wood in the night time, and collect quantities of fuel, which he
        piles up beside the door? The good people think themselves the favourites of some
        kind spirit or <i>brownie</i>. In the mean time, he learns how to apply their
        language, which he found he could imitate tolerably well. He gradually, too, becomes
        acquainted with more of their circumstances and feelings; and there was so much
        affection between the venerable blind man (who moreover played beautifully on a
        musical instrument) and his children, and they were so loving to each
        other,&mdash;and they were so interesting withal from their poverty, that the worthy
        monster took a vehement passion for them, and had the greatest inclination to make
        himself agreeable to them. By close study, and the occurrence of favourable
        opportunities, he also acquires a knowledge of written language; and one day on his
        rambles, lighting on a portmanteau, which contained the Sorrows of Werter, a volume
        of Plutarch, and Milton's Paradise Lost,&mdash;he becomes quite an adept in German
        sentiment, ancient heroism, and Satanic sturdiness. He now thought himself qualified
        to make himself acquainted with the family,&mdash;though aware of his hideous
        appearance, he very wisely began with the blind gentleman, on whom he ventured to
        make a call when the rest of the family were out of doors. He had just begun to
        interest the old man in his favour, when their <i>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</i> is
        unluckily interrupted, and the poor monster is abused and maltreated as heretofore
        by the villagers. He flies to the woods, furious with rage, and disappointed
        affection; and, finding on his return that the cottagers had forsaken the place,
        scared by his portentous visit, he amuses himself in his rage with setting it on
        fire, and then sets out in search of his creator. Other circumstances occur in his
        journey to give him a greater antipathy to the human race. He confesses the murder
        of the boy, whom, lighting upon, he wished to carry off, in the hope that he might
        find in him an object to attach himself to;&mdash;the murder was partly
        accidental,&mdash;but the slipping the picture into Justine's pocket was a piece of
        devilish malice. He concludes with denouncing vengeance against Frankenstein and all
        his race, if he does not agree to one request, to create a female companion for him
        like himself, with whom he proposes to retire to the wilds of North America, and
        never again to come into contact with man.</p>
    <p>It is needless to go minutely through the remainder of this wild fiction. After some
        demurring, Frankenstein at last accedes to the demand, and, begins a second time the
        abhorred creation of a human being,&mdash;but again repents, and defies the demon;
        who thenceforth recommences his diabolical warfare against the unhappy
        philosopher,&mdash;destroys his friends and relations one by one, and finally
        murders his beloved Elizabeth, on the very evening of their marriage. Frankenstein,
        alive only to vengeance, now pursues the fiend over the world,&mdash;and it was in
        this chace that he had got into the neighbourhood of the North Pole, where he was
        but a little way behind him, but had quite spent himself in the pursuit. So ends the
        narrative of Frankenstein, and worn out nature soon after yields to the bitterness
        of his thoughts and his exhausted frame. He dies, and, to the astonishment of our
        Englishman and the crew, the monster makes his appearance,&mdash;laments the fate of
        his creator,&mdash;says that his feelings of vengeance are for ever at an
        end,&mdash;departs, and is heard of no more. </p>
    <p>Such is a sketch of this singular performance, in which there is much power and
        beauty, both of thought and expression, though, in many parts, the execution is
        imperfect, and bearing the marks of an unpracticed hand. It is one of those works,
        however, which, when we have read, we do not well see why it should have been
        written;&mdash;for a <i>jeu d'esprit</i> it is somewhat too long, grave, and
        laborious,&mdash;and some of our highest and most reverential feelings receive a
        shock from the conception on which it turns, so as to produce a painful and
        bewildered state of mind while we peruse it. We are accustomed, happily, to look
        upon the creation of a living and intelligent being as a work that is fitted only to
        inspire a religious emotion, and there is an impropriety, to say no worse, in
        placing it in any other light. It might, indeed, be the author's view to shew that
        the powers of man have been wisely limited, and that misery would follow their
        extension,&mdash;but still the expression "Creator," applied to a mere human being,
        gives us the same sort of shock with the phrase, "the Man Almighty," and others of
        the same kind, in Mr Southey's "Curse of Kehama." All these monstrous conceptions
        are the consequences of the wild and irregular theories of the age; though we do not
        at all mean to infer that the authors who give into such freedoms have done so with
        any bad intentions. This incongruity, however, with our established and most sacred
        notions, is the chief fault in such fictions, regarding them merely in a critical
        point of view. Shakespeare's Caliban (though his simplicity and suitableness to the
        place where he is found are very delightful) is, perhaps, a more <i>hateful</i>
        being than our good friend in this book. But Caliban comes into existence in the
        received way which common superstition had pointed out; we should not have endured
        him if Prospero had created him. Getting over this original absurdity, the character
        of our monster is in good keeping;&mdash;there is a grandeur, too, in the scenery in
        which he makes his appearances,&mdash;the ice-mountains of the Pole, or the glaciers
        of the Alps;&mdash;his natural tendency to kind feelings, and the manner in which
        they were blighted,&mdash;and all the domestic picture of the cottage, are very
        interesting and beautiful. We hope yet to have more productions, both from this
        author and his great model, Mr Godwin; but they would make a great improvement in
        their writings, if they would rather study the established order of nature as it
        appears, both in the world of matter and of mind, than continue to revolt our
        feelings by hazardous innovations in either of these departments. </p>
