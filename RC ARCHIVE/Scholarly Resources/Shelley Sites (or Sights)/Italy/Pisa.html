    <td>As Richard Holmes points out in <i>Shelley: The Pursuit</i>, Pisa "became the nearest thing Shelley ever had to a home anywhere since leaving Field Place" (575). Pisa has since treated Shelley like an adopted son, albeit a misplaced one: although the Via Shelley (and Via Byron) can be found here, neither poet ever lived anywhere near them. Shelley and Byron preferred the slightly decaying elegance of the Lung&#8217;Arno, a collection of palaces, plazas, upscale hotels, and mansions that front both sides of the Arno River.</td>

    <td>In January 1820, Shelley returned to Pisa, hoping to establish or find there: "a society of our own class, as much as possible, in intellect or in feeling." Pisa was the logical spot, for, as he pointed out to Mary, "Our roots were never struck so deeply as at Pisa and the transplanted tree flourishes not" (cited in Holmes 672). The society would be formed primarily of writers, with Shelley, Byron, and Leigh Hunt as the guiding figures. During the last part of October 1821, the Shelleys moved into the top floor of the Tre Palazzi di Chiesa, overlooking the Ponte Fortezza, on the Lung'Arno Galileo Galilei (Mary filled the place with potted plants). Later, Edward and Jane Williams moved into the ground floor.</td>
