    <td>The Shelleys, their two children, and Claire Clairmont stayed at Casa Bertini, just outside and above the town of Bagni di Lucca, from mid-June to mid-August 1818. They were the happiest they had been since Marlow, although they remained for only two months. They spent their time walking and admiring the surrounding landscapes, studying (mostly ancient Greek authors), visiting the spa, and perusing early (although mostly negative) responses to <i>Frankenstein</i>. The place was not particularly conducive to creative work, however; Shelley had planned to draft his "Tasso" here, but instead turned his attention to translation&#8212;most notably Plato's <i>Symposium</i>, completing the monumental task in only ten days.</td>

John Webster reports that he was in Bagni di Lucca not long ago, and was directed to a different house&#8212;having been told by by an expatriot Englishman that the Italians had put the plaque on the wrong house. He has supplied a photo of a house (below) which corresponds to that shown in Holmes's book. (Webster also maintains a lovely <a href="http://www.pathfinderaudio.co.uk/">website</a> with a number of Shelley and Byron images.)</td>
