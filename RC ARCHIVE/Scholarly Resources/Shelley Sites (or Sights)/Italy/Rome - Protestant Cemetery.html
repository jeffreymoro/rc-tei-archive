Shelley's grave is set off in a sheltered area at the rear&#8212;the roof can be seen between the trees in the first photo below. Next to him is buried his friend Edward Trelawny, who died in England in 1881.</td>

    <p>Unhappily, Shelley's remains suffered not only a sea-change but a variety of other transformations before arriving at the cemetery. A number of romanticized paintings depict Shelley&#8217;s cremation: the young poet lies serenely atop his bier, surrounded by his friends (including Byron) and grieving widow.</p>
    <p>Actually, what was left of Shelley&#8217;s body was hardly in any condition to be painted. The corpse had washed up some ten days after the drowning and all exposed flesh was gone&#8212;Shelley was identified by his socks, trousers, and a volume of Keats&#8217;s poetry in his pocket. The body was then covered in quicklime and temporarily buried in a shallow grave until permission for cremation could be acquired. Mary did not attend the cremation; Byron was there for a short time but got nauseous and had to leave. The ashes were eventually transferred to the Protestant cemetery in Rome.</p>
