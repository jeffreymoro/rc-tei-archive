						<term target="#ablack">a black and comfortless sky</term>
						<p>After the allusions to hell in these paragraphs the absence of any conventional sign of heaven is starkly telling. So
							"hellish" has Victor's psychological state become that the universe seems to have changed to reflect it. Even as one
							posits moral or theological implications to this language, however, one must be conscious that the megalomania that
							allowed Victor to presume to usurp God's prerogatives in the first place might just as easily issue in changing the
							universe to suit the mood of his mind. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="2">
						<term target="#absent">an absent child</term>
						<p>Victor is at this point twenty-three years old.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="3">
						<term target="#absent1">my long absent son</term>
						<p>Victor is at this point twenty-three years old.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="4">
						<term target="#accent">a foreign accent</term>
						<p>Victor's native tongue is French, which, the reader will recall, is a language Walton cannot speak (I:L2:02 and note).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="5">
						<term target="#acquire">acquirement of the knowledge which I sought</term>
						<p>By the time Mary Shelley made these revisions, Goethe's Faust, Part I, had become a European classic. She knew the work
							well, not only because Percy Bysshe Shelley had translated parts of it during his last months, but because she had twice
							prepared the text of these—a partial version the first time, in The Liberal, the shortlived periodical the Shelleys,
							Byron, and Leigh Hunt had projected—and then in full in her 1824 publication of Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley.
							The Faustian desire for knowledge, of course, was also deeply implicated in the 1818 edition. Mary Shelley was introduced
							to it shortly after she began work on her novel when Matthew (Monk) Lewis, visiting Byron during the 1816 summer at
							Geneva, translated parts of it to the assembled company. Faust also had a profound effect on Byron's dramatic poem
							Manfred, begun shortly thereafter.</p>
						<p> The extent to which Walton here throws all caution to the winds will be balanced late in the novel by Victor
							Frankenstein's adoption of the same kind of rhetoric in appealing to the sailors on Walton's vessel to risk everything for
							the mission's success (See III:WC:14). It is at that point that Walton's prudence and essential humanity return, perhaps
							as a secondary effect of his having, in the meantime, by this outburst elicited Victor's sobering account of the cost to
							him and to those he loved of his passion for knowledge. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="6">
						<term target="#adesign">a design which she never found reason to repent</term>
						<p>The first-time reader of this sentence would see no reason to pause and ponder its import, but for one returning to the
							text and tracing its linguistic and thematic linkages, it would hard to understand how Victor could speak in such bland
							terms about circumstances his mother could not foresee but through which he has suffered inordinately. Moreover, not only
							does he have strong personal reason to repent this "design," but its fulfillment, as he bitterly knows, will result
							directly in the death of his father (III:6:16).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="7">
						<term target="#advance">advancement in his profession</term>
						<p>This, the first substantive change in the 1831 edition, speaks volumes on the shifts in consciousness that have taken place
							during the thirteen years separating the two editions. A separate middle-class identity and sense of upward mobility have
							become endemic in British cultural attitudes, bringing heroic concepts like glory firmly to earth.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="8">
						<term target="#advanced">well advanced on my voyage</term>
						<p>The supposition is that Walton has met with a ship above Finland at the end of the common sea-route out of the Russian port
							of Archangelsk. Here, at the top of Scandinavia, as Walton continues his northern voyage, the other ship prepares to curve
							in a southerly direction toward England. With its departure Walton loses his last contact with his domestic circle: from
							now on he must prepare himself to be in isolation.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="9">
						<term target="#afriend">a friend</term>
						<p>Slowly, if we compare this statement with the initial voicing of this theme in I:L2:2, it begins to take on secondary
							associations. Here, the primary value of friendship is to provide sympathy, which is here glossed not as mere compassion
							or genial fellow-feeling, but as a mirror for the self that will be conducive to personal growth.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="10">
						<term target="#again">again and again testify</term>
						<p>Only in retrospect will the conclusion of this letter take on additional meaning from the remarkably heightened rhetoric
							indulged in by Walton here at its end. For Walton so to "testify" is to "bear witness" before the world to a dependence
							upon and need for his sister. In a narrative in which solitude and obsessiveness will come to seem a threat to all
							normative human relationships, this prior assertion of the primacy of human affection bears an ideological import.
							Students of English Romantic poetry may even be reminded of the highly emotional faith with which Wordsworth turns to his
							sister Dorothy in "Lines Written a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey", a poem that will be quoted by Victor Frankenstein in an
							encomium to his friend Henry Clerval at a point of structural balance with this passage, at the beginning of Volume 3 of
							the novel (III:1:21).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="11">
						<term target="#agitate">These reflections have dispelled the agitation</term>
						<p>We are thus invited to return at this point to the beginning of Walton's letter (and the novel), perhaps to reflect on the
							fact that the first noun we encounter in the novel is "disaster" (I:L1:1). Clearly, however he may publicly suppress their
							effects, Walton, to some extent at least, shares the "evil forebodings" of his sister he recalls in that initial sentence. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="12">
						<term target="#agony">agony</term>
						<p>Several critics have noted the extent to which Mary Shelley goes out of her way, as Victor brings his creation to life, to
							transpose the physical pains of childbirth into an equivalent psychological state. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="13">
						<term target="#agrippa">Cornelius Agrippa</term>
						<p>Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, 1486-1535, German mystic and alchemist.</p>
						<p>Agrippa of Nettesheim was born of a once-noble family near Cologne, and studied both medicine and law there, apparently
							without taking a degree. In 1503, he assumed the name Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, adopting the von to suggest a
							noble background; three years later, he established a secret society in Paris devoted to astrology, magic, and Kabbalah.</p>
						<p>His career is diverse: secret agent, soldier, physician, orator, and law professor, in Cologne, Paris, Dôle, London, Italy,
							Pavia, and Metz. In 1509, he set up a laboratory in Dôle in the hopes of synthesizing gold, and for the next decade or so

						<p>Agrippa's wrote on a great many topics, including marriage and military engineering, but his most important work is the
							three-volume De occulta philosophiae (written c. 1510, published 1531), a defense of "hidden philosophy" or magic, which
							draws on diverse mystical traditions -- alchemy, astrology, Kabbalah. A later work, De incertitudine et vanitate
							scientiarum (Of the Uncertainty and Vanity of the Sciences), attacks contemporary scientific theory and practice.</p>
						<p>Many of his opinions were controversial. His early lectures on theology angered the Church, and his defense of a woman
							accused of witchcraft in 1520 led to his being hounded out of Cologne Cologne by the Inquisition. In his own day, Agrippa
							was widely attacked as a charlatan. After his death, legends about him were plentiful. Some believed him to be not only an
							alchemist but a demonic magician, even a vampire. In one account, he traveled to the New World.</p>
						<p>In 1799, Robert Southey published an amusing ballad on this man, suggestive of his later reputation as a master of black
							magic, as well as of his susceptibility to gothic trappings. Percy Bysshe Shelley listed Agrippa and Paracelsus among his

						<term target="#albertus">Albertus Magnus</term>
						<p>Albertus Magnus (1193 or 1206-1280), German monk and alchemist, known as "Doctor Universalis."</p>
						<p>Born to a noble family in Bavaria, Albertus (Albert von Bollstüdt) became an adherent to the newly formed Dominican Order
							while he was a student at Padua in 1223. After being ordained in Germany, he traveled to Paris and in 1245 became master
							of theology at the University there. His most famous student was Thomas Aquinas. Albertus had a lifelong interest in the
							natural sciences (at a time when alchemy had not yet been sharply distinguished from more legitimate sciences such as
							chemistry), and was an important scholar of Aristotle, whose influence pervaded both his scientific and his religious
							writings.</p>
						<p>From 1260 to 1262, Albertus was the bishop of Regensburg, the nearest principal medieval city on the Danube to the north of
							Ingolstadt. He died in Cologne in 1280. Not long after his death, a number of writings on magic circulated under his name,
							although the validity of these attributions is questionable.</p>
						<p>Albertus was beatified in 1622. In 1931, Pope Pius XI declared him a saint and a Doctor of the Church; in 1941, Pope Pius

						<p>Frankenstein is a novel that centers on a transgressive birth; it is replete with orphans and both women and men who, cut

						<term target="#angelofd">the Angel of Destruction</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's emendations of 1831 once again link early statements in Victor's narrative with his condition when he is

							chapters of Volume 3, are a driving force in his obsessive pursuit of the Creature. It is interesting to note that even
							this late in her work on the novel Mary Shelley is recalling the machinery with which Percy Bysshe Shelley invested his

						<p>"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," is frequently also the subject of subtle allusion (see, for instance, I.2.7 and note, or
							III.1.8 and note) casts a long shadow over its conceptions.</p>
						<p>There is nothing odd about this, for Coleridge bore an unusual weight in the house in which Mary Godwin was raised. William
							Godwin, although separated from Coleridge on key matters of philosophy and theology, was deeply attached to him, calling
							him one of his four "oral instructors." Accordingly, Coleridge was a frequent guest in the Godwin household. Mary Shelley
							never forgot the experience of hearing Coleridge recite his "Rime" as she hid behind the sofa. Given Coleridge's
							brilliance in conversation, she may have imbibed more from her youthful encounters with him than a later time can ever

						<term target="#anomen">an omen</term>
						<p>Although as a novel Frankenstein is highly ingenious in its interweaving of omens, it also casts those who believe in them

						<p>There have been veiled if persistent questions raised thus far about Victor's mental stability. These will slowly increase

						<term target="#aplain">a plain and simple explanation of the facts</term>
						<p>Justine discounts how much eloquence counts in her world, and in this novel (see, for instance, I:L4:24and note). But if a

						<term target="#apparit">this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant</term>

						<term target="#astonstu">astonishment of the students</term>
						<p>The condescension Victor so easily adopts toward Professor Krempe here seems to extend as well to his peers among the

							an almost instinctive aversion to those he considers in some sense inferior to him. His observation here may thus be
							intended by Mary Shelley to help prepare us for his sudden rejection of the Creature to whom he gives life. Yet it might
							also be designed to bear a double reading: not just that Victor's fellow-students are in awe of his commitment, but that
							they are aware of something neurotic in its intensity.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="44">
						<term target="#astrange">a strange tale</term>
						<p>When Walton resumes his narrative in Volume 3 (III:WC:1) his words will echo Victor's here, as he calls the narrative a
							"strange and terrific story" and acknowledges that the "tale is connected, and told with the appearance of the simplest
							truth," phrases suggestive of how broadly the judging of truth is an issue in the novel.</p>
						<p>This phrasing also introduces the complicating factor of the novel's deliberately involuted structure. To adapt Walton's
							language, Victor's account of the strange tale occurs within his own strange tale, which has already conveyed the
							narrative of William's death provided by his father (as well as, in the chapter before, Elizabeth's account of local
							doings). This tale will be told twice more, in the courtroom (I:7:6) and in the Creature's autobiographical summation
							(II:8:33). If, in the end, readers can assume that they are able to sift the truth from its excessive narrative
							elaboration, the fact remains that in the official account Justine Moritz will be known as the murderer, and no one in
							Victor's family—including Ernest, who will presumably inherit a substantial fortune and the position that goes with it and
							his family's reputation in Geneva—will ever be any the wiser. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="45">
						<term target="#atonetim">at one time for five, and at another for nearly two years</term>
						<p>Justine, we remember from Elizabeth's letter to Victor (I:5:4), had come to imitate the expression and demeanor of Caroline
							Frankenstein. Thus, having lived with the Frankenstein family for seven years, which is the age at which William was
							murdered, she has in some sense become a surrogate for his mother who died when William was yet an infant. Further in the
							paragraph, Elizabeth explicitly compares her treatment of William as "like [that of] a most affectionate mother."</p>
						<p>This detail, which has no effect on anyone outside the family circle, would seem intended by Mary Shelley to insinuate a
							class bias into the court proceedings. Although Elizabeth speaks of her almost as a member of the family, she is not so
							seen by the judges or the populace of Geneva. Whatever the circumstance that separates her from an equality with other
							family members, the important issue is the very principle of separation by which she can be socially cast as a scapegoat. </p>

						<term target="#attend">His daughter attended him</term>
						<p>The novel slides, seamlessly and without calling attention to itself, from Walton's nursing Victor Frankenstein back from a

							continual necessity in Frankenstein and a measure of a character's capacity for sympathy.</p>

						<term target="#attended">attended on him</term>
						<p>Walton here assumes the position of ministrant that Clerval held during Victor's "nervous fever" in Ingolstadt (I:4:17),
							pointedly an inversion of customary gender roles. Healers are accorded a privileged value in this novel, though by no
							means in the world that encompasses its fiction. Justine Moritz's attendance on Victor's mother in her final illness earns
							for her no particular credence from her judges (I:7:10), and his mother, contracting scarlet fever from nursing Elizabeth,
							dies as a result of her good offices (I:2:2)</p>

							inflated language. The figure Victor will cut in his own narration is very much darker than the one to whom we are being
							introduced through Walton's eyes. The underlying problem of how perspective shapes reality is thus being subtly
							reinforced.</p>

						<term target="#beautif">Beautiful!</term>
						<p>Victor's instinctive aesthetic sense has already allowed him to misjudge his teacher, Professor Krempe (I:2:12). Now it
							operates to overpower any sense of shared humanity with the Creature. In respect to the master categories of
							eighteenth-century aesthetics, the Creature is exactly the opposite of the Beautiful: he is the embodiment of the Sublime,
							at once awesome and terrifying. If most of our experience with sublimity is mediated through art and literature, the
							Creature in all his encounters forces it with stunning immediacy into normative human life, always with disastrous
							consequences</p>

					<item n="56">
						<term target="#beendest">been destroyed</term>
						<p>Victor suddenly shows a political consciousness that has not been active up to this point. The context suggests that the
							enclosed world of the domestic affections, governed by a feminine sensibility, is threatened—and through history actually
							destroyed—by the masculinist drive for power. This is a sentiment with which both her father William Godwin and her
							husband Percy Bysshe Shelley would have agreed. In the shadow of the Napoleonic Wars and the reinstitution of reactionary
							monarchies across Europe, it is a sentiment not in accord with the prevailing state of political opinion in England.</p>
						<p>It could be argued that Victor simply serves momentarily as mouthpiece for the author's pointedly liberal views to surface.
							What would complicate that supposition is the fact that this series of political failures is identical with those the
							Creature derives from the oral reading of Volney's Ruins of Empire by Felix De Lacey (see II:5:14). If we focus on that
							identity retrospectively, we are suddenly confronted with the amazing fact that Victor, whether he registered it or not,
							will actually learn something concrete from the Creature's narration in the second volume of the novel. </p>

						<p>Bellerive (which connotes "beautiful shore") is a suburb of Geneva, situated north of the city on the western shore of the

							Frankenstein family possesses a country house testifies to their comparative wealth and social standing in the community,
							an issue that will be of some moment to the trial recounted in I:7:1. After its painful conclusion the family will seek

						<term target="#bendispo">Their benevolent disposition</term>
						<p>The repetition of the adjective "benevolent" three times in as many paragraphs indicates the stress Mary Shelley places on
							this as a fundamental attribute of human virtue. However it may be stressed in Victor's memory, the frequency with which
							such benevolence is actually encountered as a motivating force will be tested when the Creature flees Victor's apartment
							and attempts to make his way in the world.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="62">
						<term target="#benevol">benevolently</term>
						<p>Victor's stress on the term marks it as of particular importance to him and indicates that it is also of concern to the
							novel. With some pathos, Victor will begin the second volume by recalling that he had himself "begun life with benevolent
							intentions" (II:1:1). At this point we cannot know how far from disinterested benevolence Victor has strayed. In

					<item n="63">
						<term target="#bestow">bestowing on the state sons</term>
						<p>As Walton's first letter opens with an expression of the opposed perspectives of men and women (I:L1:1 and note), so this
							initial paragraph of the first chapter accentuates the concern of the patriarchy with replicating itself. Alphonse
							Frankenstein's sense of public purpose is to reproduce himself for the good of the state. By suppressing the role of the
							female in this process, he paradoxically voices what will become his son's obsession with creating a new man without the
							intervention of woman. With that creation in mind, however, it does not require of the reader an undue stretching of the
							sense to regard the distinctive tone of this language, so abstracted and clinical, as being more characteristic of Victor
							than of his father.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="64">
						<term target="#bestowig">bestowing animation upon lifeless matter</term>
						<p>Although not the elixir of life per se (which would give the owner perpetual youth), Victor Frankenstein's discovery is

						<term target="#biron">Louisa Biron</term>
						<p>This would appear to be an in-joke among the writing friends, since Lord Byron's name, in Geneva, would have been

							Allegra, the illegitimate daughter Claire Clairmont bore in January 1817, the name of Biron.</p>

						<term target="#blackest">the blackest ingratitude</term>
						<p>The same noun is employed by Alphonse Frankenstein in the previous chapter (I:6:37). The word conveys a sense of obligation
							and therefore of class difference. Again and again it is emphasized that Justine has been raised above her rank in life by
							the active interest of the Frankenstein household in her welfare. But has she really altered her condition? Not just the
							family but the whole of Geneva society condescend to her as having less than full rights to her supposedly respectable
							condition. The ease with which her claims to equity are abrogated implicitly places her on a par with Victor's Creature,
							named a wretch and denied the claim of human sympathy.</p>

						<term target="#blame">blame</term>
						<p>What is odd about this statement is not the sense of guilt embedded in it—Victor, we will learn, has much to acknowledge on

							the confession that it calls attention to his rhetoric as self-serving, less than candid, and perhaps not to be wholly

						<term target="#blankinc">that blank incapability of invention</term>
						<p>Although Mary Shelley surely exaggerates the time it took her to begin her novel as well as the anxious writer's block that
							inhibited her starting forth, there is a more serious aspect to this account than her personal uncertainties. Questions
							concerning the circumstances of and responsibility for creativity, the attitude with which intellectual ambition
							approaches the unknown, and the moral neutrality of the human imagination, are deeply inlaid within the structure of
							Frankenstein. There is thus a sense in which this personal account in her Introduction seems intended to focus attention
							on such larger, more public concerns with which the reader will soon be asked to grapple.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="70">
						<term target="#blasted">blasted stump</term>
						<p>That the power that Victor will use to create life is initially associated with destruction is significant for the symbolic

						<p>Erasmus Darwin explains the destructive force of lightning as resulting from the emission of light and heat through the
							admixture of what he calls the vitreous and resinous ethers, in modern terms essentially positive and negative electrical
							charges (though he is arguing against Benjamin Franklin's mechanical model of electricity). See Note XII, sections 2.7,
							8.1, and 11.2 of the Additional Notes to his Temple of Nature. </p>
						<p>That the forces of nature are equally devoted to creation and destruction is an issue whose dynamics are central to Byron's
							conception in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto 3, and one, likewise, that Percy Bysshe Shelley will later explore in such
							poems as "The Cloud" and the "Ode to the West Wind," poems dating from 1819. In those latter poems one can sense the
							influence of Indian sacred texts like the Bhagvat-Gita. It is by no means far-fetched to suggest their applicability to

						<p>The difference in the Genesis account of human creation could not be more pronounced:</p>

							and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth

						<p>1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</p>
						<p>1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and
							have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the
							earth.</p> Victor's adjective "breathless" may be intended by Mary Shelley to resonate ironically against the moment in
						Genesis in which Adam is actually brought to life: 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
						into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. </item>

						<term target="#brutal">the usual brutality</term>
						<p>Walton is referring obliquely to the wide-spread practice of flogging to keep discipline aboard ship. It had been a serious

							and the Nore in the spring of 1797. The Shelleys' friend Leigh Hunt wrote several attacks on the practice in his weekly

					<item n="78">
						<term target="#buffon">Buffon</term>
						<p>Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, 1707-1788, French naturalist.</p>
						<p>Buffon spelled out his views in his monumental Natural History (Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière), an attempt
							to present systematically all the known facts of natural science, of which the first volumes appeared in 1749 and the
							final volumes in 1804.</p>
						<p>Buffon rejected Linnaeus's method of classifying species, insisting instead on smooth gradations between not only species
							but individual organisms. Although he was willing to use anatomical structures to make working distinctions between
							species, he believed any division into orders, classes, genera, and species misrepresented the variety of nature.</p>
						<p>His own experiments, however, caused him to think seriously about the idea of the species. Buffon discovered that animals
							of different species could be crossbred, but the offspring were infertile: he therefore defined a species as a group of
							animals that could produce fertile offspring.</p>
						<p>Buffon did believe in the idea of the mutation of species, and was the first to suggest the possibility that all animals
							might have descended or evolved ultimately from a single breeding pair. He rejected the notion of evolution, however,
							favoring instead a devolutionary theory: animals over time fell off by degrees from their originally perfect state. The
							broad range of his scientific interest includes subjects of direct import for Frankenstein: comparative geography, the
							diversification of types within a species, the sexual origin of species, and monsters. </p>
						<p>Buffon's most important work in physical anthropology appeared in The Varieties of the Human Species (1749), in which he
							described the physical and cultural differences between groups of humans. He attributed these differences to the races'
							accommodation to different environmental conditions.</p>
						<p>This well-known theory is alluded to in a letter that Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote his long-time friend Thomas Love Peacock
							during the Geneva summer of 1816. That citation, in turn, was included in the last letter appended to Mary Shelley's
							History of a Six Weeks' Tour. </p>

						<p>Having twice in his letters to his sister (I:L2:5 and I:L3:3) assured her of his prudence, Walton here becomes carried away

							designating a feature shared by the male protagonists whose value, like the other shared attribute of curiosity, is
							complexly ambiguous. He has already declared himself overly ardent (I:L1:2). Soon, we will observe the same problem in

						<term target="#cannot">cannot begin life anew</term>
						<p>Although the extent of Victor's losses must await his own narration, his despairing language here calls attention to itself

							renew life is, in some profound sense, not truly alive, a condition made famous by Coleridge in the idea of
							"Life-in-Death" advanced in "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," line 193. Philosophically speaking, Victor's language

						<term target="#canto3">the third canto of Childe Harold</term>
						<p>This was the work on which Byron was working during the summer of 1816. It was carried to his publisher John Murray by

						<term target="#catastro">catastrophe</term>
						<p>The powerful wrench to the language here replicates the effect of Victor's awaking from his dreams into a new and alien

							novel's first sentence (I:L1:1) as foreseeing for Walton's expedition. The stark word would have borne another kind of
							resonance in Mary Shelley's culture: Buffon'sNatural History gave wide currency to a catastrophic theory of creation, and
							Victor's adolescent delight in that account (at least as it is recounted in the first edition of the novel—see I:1:25)
							would thus seem to have left an indelible, ironic imprint on him.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="88">
						<term target="#catholic">Roman Catholic</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's general dismissal of Roman Catholicism in this novel should be placed within the context of centuries of

							change markedly during the nineteenth century, it is well to understand that Catholic Emancipation was still a decade away
							at the time Frankenstein was published.</p>

					<item n="90">
						<term target="#celest">celestial observations</term>
						<p>This suggests that Walton implicitly recognizes the third element, after electricity and magnetism, in what would in the
							twentieth century be called a "grand unified field theory," gravitation.</p>
						<p> That a unified field theorem is a still unrealized ideal of experimental physics, one that has excited the ambitions of
							major scientific minds in all quarters of the world, may indicate the seriousness of the scientific issues and passions
							underlying Mary Shelley's novel. Without denigrating those ambitions here, she characteristically reminds us of human
							limitations in Walton's inability to recognize that in a land of eternal light, as he imagines the pole might be,
							celestial observations would be impossible. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="91">
						<term target="#changed">I have changed no portion of the story</term>
						<p>Most modern commentators would dispute this statement strongly, taking exception both stylistically and substantively, and
							tending to see the 1831 edition as truly a reconception of the 1818 edition rather than the tidying-up suggested here. But
							it is not entirely easy to focus categorically on the differences between the texts. Some political innuendos of moment in
							1818, for instance, were no longer relevant to the changed climate in the year before the Great Reform Bill, but that does
							not mean that others—for instance, the curious intrusion of imperialism into the plot (see I:6:14 and note)—have not taken
							their place. Mary Shelley did greatly rewrite the first chapter of 1818 breaking it into two separate chapters in 1831.
							She similarly reworked the opening chapter of Volume 2. Throughout her revision she endeavors to flesh out her characters
							rather than merely to add descriptive elements to the novel. In this regard, her most extensive elaboration is in making
							Victor's account of his life from the very beginning subtly reflect the paranoid mental condition to which experience has
							reduced him.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="92">
						<term target="#checked">enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety</term>
						<p>This poses a contrast worth contemplating: on the one hand, as earlier in the chapter (I:3:8 and note), enthusiasm here
							literally suggests the presence of an indwelling deity, or at least Victor's aspiration to play God; on the other hand,
							anxiety indicates a counterforce within his mind, disrupting his self-assurance, even prompting self-alienation. Since in
							Milton's myth Satan is created as a counterforce at the precise moment that God announces his plan to create a new race,
							these contrary poles are essential to the basic creation myth in terms of which Mary Shelley plots her novel.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="93">
						<term target="#cheerful">I cheerfully consented</term>
						<p>Victor's blasé consent is in sharp contrast with his sense of follow-through, and his truancy from school is indicative of

						<term target="#chemisty">rational theory of chemistry</term>
						<p>During the latter part of the eighteenth-century the life sciences were undergoing a radical transformation of their

							conceptual ordering and deductive animism inherited from medieval and Renaissance paradigms. The exacting science of
							chemistry influenced these developments and, in turn, was given impetus by the responsiveness of the life sciences to
							their renewed systemization. When Victor speaks of a "rational theory," he means, at least in part, such a logical
							ordering of constituent knowledge within the discipline. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, particularly in
							Great Britain under the guidance of figures like John Dalton and Humphrey Davy, chemistry made enormous advances in basic
							knowledge, winning for the discipline something of a cachet among educated people. </p>

						<term target="#child">something better—their child</term>
						<p>Although there are occasional instances in the literature of Romanticism where the world of childhood is

							Victorian, another sign of the major shift in British culture during the 1820s. The nostalgic sentimentality, however,

						<p>Frankenstein is a novel haunted by the spectre of death. Not yet a quarter of the way through the novel, the reader will

							Creature with mummies and ghouls (I:4:4), and the death of Justine's three siblings and mother in this paragraph. The

						<term target="#chivalry">chivalry and romance</term>
						<p>An inordinate interest in chivalry, suggestive of an investment in archaic notions of manners and social hierarchy,

					</item>
					<item n="101">
						<term target="#climate">they sought the pleasant climate of Italy</term>
						<p>Whether Mary Shelley, in framing her revisions, intended to give her novel a geographical symmetry by placing an Italian
							sojourn in the early part of Victor's narrative to balance that of Safie and her father at its absolute center
							(1831:II:14:12) can be only a matter of conjecture. It is consistent, however, with the strong structural patterning of
							the novel. By 1831, of course, she might simply have decided to translate her own experience into the rewriting of the
							novel, for it was certainly the case that she and Percy Bysshe Shelley sought Italy in 1818, just months after the
							publication of Frankenstein, ostensibly for reasons of health.</p>
						<p>One consequence of the considerable emendation made to this first chapter of Victor's narrative is to emphasize how well
							off his family is. To see the sights of Italy is one thing; to make a leisurely tour of the country, then extend the
							excursion to take in France and Germany, requires substantial means as well as leisure. In the 1818 text the Frankensteins
							were respected members of their community; by 1831 they have assumed something of the trappings of aristocracy. </p>

						<term target="#commune">communication</term>
						<p>Walton raises for the first time a major concern of the novel, the aims, uses, and potential limitations of writing.
							Although he affirms the importance here of a human presence that will guarantee unmediated sympathy, still he does so in
							the form of a written letter that in the previous sentence names his correspondent ("Margaret") and in the sentence to

							suggests the actual limitations of the unmediated exchange. Although he admires the officers of his ship, for instance,
							Walton cannot expect their sympathy in the refined emotions he here transmits to his distant sister.</p>
						<p>At the same time, Victor Frankenstein's retreat into obsessive study and his Creature's enforced isolation will show the
							consequences of trying to fall back upon one's own singular resources. That Mary Shelley regards the communication of
							emotion as fundamental to human need and experience seems implicit in her choice of an epistolary form in which to frame

						<term target="#concern">the manner in which I should employ it</term>
						<p>It seems never to cross Victor's mind that he might not "employ" his discovery or even that he might collaborate with

					<item n="106">
						<term target="#confessd">confessed her guilt</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley contorts the plot somewhat to force this detail upon it. This is of a piece with her concentration on
							individual responsibility, but it also stresses the element of social coercion that brings about this miscarriage of
							justice. That Justine will prevaricate in a situation where Victor cannot bring himself to speak the truth once more
							underscores how relative is the nature of truth in this novel.</p>

						<term target="#confessr">My confessor has besieged me</term>
						<p>Early nineteenth-century English anti-Catholic prejudice stressed the hierarchical conformity of the Roman Church as

							emphasized. Yet if this confessor is manipulative and reminds one of that staple of Gothic fiction, the obdurate
							inquisitor, he seems to stand in contrast to the earlier confessor, who acted as a kindly mender of family fences to
							convince her mother after the deaths of her other children to take Justine back into her home (I:5:6). Of course, he could
							be the same priest, only apparently kind in his offices, but essentially superstitious in interpreting God's will and
							actively supporting firm social structures to curb errant individual desire.</p>

						<term target="#confused">a confused and unintelligible answer</term>

						<term target="#contempt">contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley seems to understand with acuity a phenomenon that could only have just come into general awareness in her

							a disciplinary partnership with the physical sciences. From that point forward all notions of distinct animistic or
							quasi-magical differences separating them disappear. Furthermore, under this conceptual format nineteenth-century

						<p>Ordinarily in the writings of the English Romantics, and particularly in the contemporaneous poems of Byron (Childe

							preferable to one of known or dogmatic limitation—in the succinct formulation of Wordsworth, "The budding rose above the

						<p>If one reads back from this point into the previous paragraph, it is evident that Victor has attempted in some sense to

							even deranged, emotion. Victor quickly displaces it with a new, contemporary, seemingly spontaneous effusion that, being

						<p>In evoking traditional martial virtues Walton unwittingly echoes Milton's Satan who stresses this and other such heroic

						     What though the field be lost?<lb/> All is not lost; the unconquerable will,<lb/> And study of revenge, immortal

						<p>This, the second death in as many paragraphs, almost slips by without notice. But surely Walton might have been left a

							whom we may assume was of an age comparable to his. This unexpected source of his independence, means sufficiently ample
							to allow him to hire a crew and outfit an ocean-going vessel for a lengthy voyage, testifies to the instability of
							fortune, the constant threat of mortality, and even to how important are extended families in this narration. It also

						<p>As Victor exactly echoes the diction used by Walton to explain his eagerness to hear the account to which he now listens

							trait that impels the actions of all the major characters in the novel. Often, as here, the interest is wholly idle and

					</item>
					<item n="125">

						<p>Mary Shelley reverts to the characteristic (and problem) of human curiosity first broached in Walton's Letter (I:L1:2) and

							establish for the first and only time a momentary bridge between Victor's Creature and humanity (III:WC:38).</p>

					<item n="126">
						<term target="#curious">ardent curiosity</term>
						<p>The initial posing of a highly problematic theme of the novel, the thirst for knowledge as an end in itself. The same theme
							implicates "Alastor," Percy Bysshe Shelley's major poem written in 1815, and published in March of the next year, four
							months before Mary Shelley conceived the idea for Frankenstein, as well as William Godwin's first great success in
							fiction, The Adventures of Caleb Williams (1792): whose fourth paragraph begins, "The spring of action which, perhaps more

					<item n="127">
						<term target="#daemon">dæmon</term>
						<p>This is the term that, as his narrative proceeds into Volume 3, Victor will increasingly use to denominate his Creature.
							But to have it thus introduced here without any preparation, and in this peculiar period spelling, is to raise a serious
							question as to what exactly Victor may intend by the term. Walton's interpolation, "as he called him," emphasizes the
							importance of perspective in any such definition and may even indicate his own lack of assurance about what is meant by
							Victor's usage.</p>
						<p>Samuel Johnson's Dictionary (1755) is uncharacteristically reductive in its definition:</p>
						<p>DEMON, n.s. [dæmon, Latin; daimôn.] A spirit; generally an evil spirit; a devil.</p>
						<p>The Oxford English Dictionary, in contrast, exhibits the full range and complexity of the word's history. (The examples are
							here abridged.)</p>DEMON<p>demon 1. Also 6-9 dæmon. In form, and in sense 1 a, a. L. dæmon (med.L. demon) spirit, evil
							spirit, a. Gr. dai'mwn divinity, genius, tutelary deity. But in sense 1 b and 2, put for L. dæmonium, Gr. daimo'nion,
							neuter of daimo'nioj adj. '(thing) of divine or dæmonic nature or character', which is used by the LXX, N. Test., and
							Christian writers, for 'evil spirit'. Cf; Fr. dimon (in Oresme 14th c. dimones); also 13th c. demoygne = Pr. demoni,
							Ital., Sp. demonio, repr. L. dæmonium, Gr. daimo'nion.</p>1.<p>a. In ancient Greek mythology (= dai'mwn): A supernatural
							being of a nature intermediate between that of gods and men; an inferior divinity, spirit, genius (including the souls or
							ghosts of deceased persons, esp. deified heroes). Often written dæmon for distinction from sense 2.</p>
						<p>b. Sometimes, particularly, An attendant, ministering, or indwelling spirit; a genius. (Chiefly in references to the
							so-called 'dæmon of Socrates'; Socrates himself claimed to be guided, not by a dai'mwn or dæmon, but by a daimo'nion,
							divinum quiddam (Cicero), a certain divine principle or agency, an inward monitor or oracle. It was his accusers who
							represented this as a personal dæmon, and the same was done by the Christian Fathers (under the influence of sense 2),
							whence the English use of the word, as in the quotations. See tr. Zeller's Socrates iv. 73; Riddell, Apology of Plato,
							Appendix A.).</p>2. An evil spirit.<p>a. (Representing daimo'nion of the LXX and N.T. (rarely dai'mwn); in Vulgate
							dæmonium, dæmon). Applied to the idols or gods of the heathen, and to the 'evil' or 'unclean spirits' by which demoniacs
							were possessed or actuated. A Jewish application of the Greek word, anterior to Christianity. Daimo'nia is used several
							times by the LXX to render shedim 'lords, idols', and secirim 'hairy ones' (satyrs or he-goats), the latter also rendered
							ma'taia 'vain things'. It is also frequent in the Apocrypha (esp. in Tobit), and in the N.T., where in one instance (Matt.
							viii. 31) dai'monej occurs in same sense. In the Vulgate generally rendered dæmonium, pl. -ia, but once in O.T. (Lev.
							xvii. 7), and in 10 places in N.T. (8 in St. Matthew) dæmon, pl. -es. These words are indiscriminately translated deofol
							in the Ags. Gospels, feend or deuil in Wyclif, and in all the 16-17th c. versions devil; the Revisers of 1881-5 substitute
							demons in Deut. and Psalms, but in the N.T. retain devil, -s, in the text, with the literal translation demon, -s, in the
							margin. Quite distinct from this is the word properly translated 'Devil', dia'boloj, which is not used in the plural. It
							is owing to this substitution of devil in the Bible versions, that demon is not found so early in this, as in the popular
							sense b, which arose out of this identification.</p>
						<p>b. In general current use: An evil spirit; a malignant being of superhuman nature; a devil.</p>
						<p>c. Applied to a person (animal or agency personified), of malignant, cruel, terrible, or destructive nature, or of hideous
							appearance. (Cf. devil.)</p>
						<p>d. fig. An evil passion or agency personified. spec. an alcoholic drink. Also attrib.</p>
						<p>e. Applied to a being of superhuman or 'diabolical' energy, skill, etc. (cf. 3 a spec.); also to an action, etc.</p>
						<p>Accordingly, although Victor Frankenstein obviously wishes to "demonize" his Creature as a kind of fiend or devil (as in
							2b), in both his actual encounters with him, the Creature acts as a kind of conscience in the sense of 1a (II:2:7,
							III:3:13), reminding him of his duties as a creator. In later chapters of the novel, where a complex doubling effect
							occurs, it seems at times as if the Creature were, indeed, an inner genius, as in 1b. The Creature does, of course, have
							the hideous appearance defined in 2c, and he exhibits the extraordinary energy and skill noted in 2e, aspects that remind
							us that Victor himself fabricated his Creature to be superhuman. This sense of his own responsibility for the Creature's
							nature is exactly what is canceled by Victor's calling him a demon. </p>
					</item>
					<item n="128">
						<term target="#daemon1">dæmon</term>
						<p>Against the very mundane cruelty of a miscarriage of human justice, Victor seems to feel obliged to inflate the terms as a
							means of assuaging his guilt. His rhetoric transcendentalizes his Creature, who can thus be conceived as beyond human
							suffering, as maliciously sporting with life. With a nice irony, the Creature will use exactly the same terms on Victor
							when they later meet: see II:2:7 and note.</p>

						<term target="#dante">Dante</term>
						<p>In the lower circles of the Inferno, Dante represents sinners grotesquely transfigured by the nature of their sins, as
							their physical presence imitates the moral condition of their souls. For Victor to invoke Dante in this manner, however,
							is to remind us that in his medieval Christian universe no one is born damned, but rather must actively estrange the self
							from God's merciful love in order to embrace damnation as a principle of one's being. Victor also unwittingly raises the
							disturbing question that will be underscored in the ensuing paragraph: in a world where man plays God, what is the state

					</item>
					<item n="130">
						<term target="#darenot">I dared not advance</term>
						<p>This may be a premonition of Victor's own complicity in William's death, or it can be read as one of several instances

							will. It is perhaps a natural reaction of one who has pursued one course of action with compulsive energy (see I:3:9) and

						<term target="#darktyr">the dark tyranny of despair</term>
						<p>The theme of dejection is a significant component of "dark" Romanticism. The most influential exploration of it in the

							already figured in the structure of the novel (I:L2:6). Of the major Romantic poets (besides Percy Bysshe Shelley),

						<term target="#darwin">Dr. Darwin</term>
						<p>Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802). The reference is almost certainly to his last work, The Temple of Nature; or, the Origin of
							Society: A Poem, with Philosophical Notes, published posthumously in 1803.</p>
						<p>Its cryptic citation in the opening paragraph of the Preface testifies to the major importance of this work for the
							conceptual structuring of Frankenstein, particularly in the electromagnetic linkage of the scientific concerns of Victor
							Frankenstein and Robert Walton, as well as for the conspicuous and strange polar setting of the novel. The relevant note
							is the twelfth in the appendix.</p>
						<p>What exactly Percy Bysshe Shelley is referring to in his glancing citation of The Temple of Nature is harder to discern.
							That he knew the work intimately can be discerned by how much its form, as well as its science, contribute to the
							underlying conception of Queen Mab (1813) and its two-book redaction published in the Alastor volume in March 1816, "The
							Daemon of the World." In respect to Frankenstein, he is probably thinking of Darwin's notion of creation as occuring from
							the dynamic interaction of polar opposites in Book I.227ff, or its extension in the notion of life and death as
							interacting forces in Book IV.375ff. Likewise, of relevance (though wholly erroneous in its suppositions) is the first of
							the Additional Notes in the appendix, on "Spontaneous Vitality of Microscopic Animals." Darwin also has a curious
							exposition of male reproduction in nature without the intercession of females: see Book II, section III, somewhat

						<term target="#daughter">the daughter of two persons of distinguished literary celebrity</term>
						<p>Although Mary Shelley publishes this revision of her novel pseudonymously, as by "The Author of The Last Man, Perkin
							Warbeck, &amp;C. &amp;C.," she writes as though she had signed her full name to the title page, speaking
							familiarly of her husband toward the end of the Introduction as "Shelley" (see I:Intro:7) and here casting her parents,
							William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, as almost legendary, if historical, figures whom she need not bother to name.
							Constrained to keep the Shelley name out of the press by the meager allowance Sir Timothy Shelley had reluctantly settled
							upon his grandson, and thus remaining, as her opening paragraph indicates, "very averse to bringing [her]self forward in
							print" (see I:Intro:1), Mary Shelley nonetheless goes out of her way here to establish her major credentials as an artist
							and her strong claim to public notice. An appearance of modesty to cloak an unladylike presumption is a standard ploy of

					<item n="134">
						<term target="#daunt">dauntless courage</term>

							dauntless courage, and considerate pride<lb/> Waiting revenge.<lb/> -- I.600-604</p>
						<p>The author's purpose seems not to be one of branding this crew with a diabolic association (though it is true that they
							will later become united in rebellion against their master), but rather this early on in the novel to plant motifs that
							will serve as unifying structural and thematic devices as Mary Shelley begins to interweave multiple narrative lines. In

						<p>In his earlier letter (I:L1:3 and note) Walton had also singled-out this faculty of imaginative reverie. As there, the tone

					</item>
					<item n="137">
						<term target="#daydream">day dreams</term>
						<p>The customary term for such a faculty in literature of the Romantic period is imagination. Yet, the connotations of
							Walton's diction do not aspire to such a level of import, a "day dream" implying something less substantial than a
							reverie, which itself signifies a mental state much less imposing than a vision. This implicit deflation of the power or

					</item>
					<item n="138">
						<term target="#days">days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue</term>

							reader. That Caroline's death is a consequence of selfless nurture suggests that this is an expectation of women that is
							not without danger. Mary Shelley could not have failed to recognize that, in focusing so sharply on the death of Caroline
							Frankenstein as being brought on by her stepdaughter, she was in some sense rehearsing the death of her own mother Mary
							Wollstonecraft following her birth. Critics have likewise traced the novel's twin emphases on responsibility and guilt to

						<p>The shift in pronouns here (from "its" to "he") is telling but hardly indicative of a sudden sense of human identification

						<term target="#depraved">a depraved wretch</term>
						<p>The phrasing suggests not just a vile being, as "wretch" was used in I:4:3 and I:4:6, but now also one who is corrupt,
							wicked. Victor, who has no discernible religious belief or instruction, has wandered into a treacherous theological
							morass. The Judeo-Christian God has created humanity, in Milton's words, "just and right,/ Sufficient to have stood,
							though free to fall" (Paradise Lost, III.98-99). Victor, however, as God's stand-in, has no assurance that his Creature is
							without flaw. Having constructed him from whatever bodily parts he could lay his hands on (and without any particular
							nicety that they even be human), Victor presumes a correlation between body and soul, both being corrupt. In theological
							terms, however, such a vision of God as the creator of evil is fundamentally heretical, for it would hold God directly
							responsible for human depravity. Victor's chain of thoughts does not extend so far as openly to convict himself of the
							responsibility for the evil he assigns his Creature. Yet, his sudden sense here of their twin relationship does suggest
							the glimmer of that terrible truth the novel will slowly unfold.</p>
						<p>Johnson's 1755 Dictionary represents the verb to deprave with an uncharacteristic lack of discrimination:</p> To vitiate;
						to corrupt; to contaminate. <p>The Oxford English Dictionary, on the other hand, registers historical and theological shifts
							in usage:</p>
						<p>depravity An extension of pravity (ad. L. pravitas) previously used in same sense, after deprave and its derivatives. (No

							unarticulated. In the present narration he will slowly begin to explore the range of determinants of his "destiny,"
							starting a few paragraphs earlier by acknowledging that it ought to have been tied to his patriarchal inheritance as a set
							of understood family obligations (I:1:1), a duty that is here to be set in opposition to a self-absorbed obsession with

						<p>Once again, as in the previous chapter (I:1:15), Victor suggests that the course of his development is not of his own
							making, but was necessitated by his professional commitment. His linking of his destiny to scientific knowledge has the
							effect of transferring the systematic logic of the discipline to the random events of his life, an inductive leap that,
							however much it may lack a rational base, will bear profound consequences.</p>

						<term target="#disaster">a new, and a not less terrible, disaster</term>
						<p>In her revision Mary Shelley seems conscious of the uncanny freight this word carries from beyond the novel. It is, we

							London and repeated by him in writing her (I:L1:1)</p>

					</item>
					<item n="150">
						<term target="#disciple">a disciple of Albertus Magnus</term>
						<p>The first such disciple of Albertus Magnus was his student Thomas Aquinas, who was the greatest medieval systematizer of
							knowledge in the Aristotelian mode of division and subdivision and by no means a proselytizer for alchemy. Albertus
							Magnus, it should be noted, was for a time the bishop of Regensburg, the nearest principal medieval city on the Danube to
							the north of Ingolstadt, the university city to which Victor travels in the next chapter (I:2:8). Though he attributes the
							choice of university to his parents (I:2:1), perhaps Victor's sense of discipleship to the bishop contributed to his
							acquiescence.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="151">
						<term target="#dissect">dissecting room</term>
						<p>Here Victor is explicit about his dependence on the anatomical theater of the University of Ingolstadt. Although nowhere in
							Mary Shelley's writings does she refer to her knowledge of the actual university facilities in Ingolstadt, which in the
							eighteenth century included a state-of-the art anatomy theater and dissecting table, this detail does appear to indicate
							an awareness of the exact particulars of the institution.</p>

					<item n="152">
						<term target="#distill">distillation</term>
						<p>Frankenstein's inclusion of distillation among the "processes of which my favourite authors were utterly ignorant" is

						<term target="#disturbd">my disturbed imagination</term>
						<p>Another example of an unexpectedly dark context in which to encounter a word so generally privileged in English

						<term target="#diverted">diverted our solicitude from our own situation</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley is insinuating an irony whose burden will not be clear to the reader for several chapters. Although the

							another human being, this particular being has never in his existence been the object of either human identification or
							sympathy.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="157">
						<term target="#divine">divine wanderer</term>
						<p>It is hard for a reader not to think that such inflated phrasing was intended by Mary Shelley to be read ironically. Yet
							even if these terms do call attention to themselves in that way, their context would appear to be complicated, even
							ambiguous, and thus not simply productive in the reader's mind of a countering deflation. For Mary Shelley the most
							immediate resonance would be of a work written during the same summer in which Frankenstein was begun, Byron's Childe
							Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto 3. Stanza 70 of that poem contrasts the solitary Romantic impulse with the debilitating
							contentions of society denounced in its opening lines.</p>
						<p> There, in a moment, we may plunge our years<lb/> In fatal penitence, and in the blight<lb/> Of our own soul turn all our
							blood to tears,<lb/> And colour things to come with hues of Night;<lb/> The race of life becomes a hopeless flight<lb/> To
							those that walk in darkness: on the sea,<lb/> The boldest steer but where their ports invite,<lb/> But there are wanderers
							o'er Eternity<lb/> Whose bark drives on and on, and anchor'd ne'er shall be.</p>
						<p> This honoring of infinite mental freedom is of a piece with the thrust of major texts of European Romanticism, from
							Goethe's Faust to Wordsworth's Prelude, and nowhere moreso than in Byron's celebration of the artist's endeavors
							throughout his mature verse. Byron, however, is well aware—indeed, fashions Childe Harold's Pilgrimage around the
							supposition—that the rootless searcher for an infinitely receding ideal has an inverse double, which earlier in Canto III
							he had specifically demarcated, calling his antihero Harold "The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind" (III.20). </p>
						<p> As these terms might suggest and as his knowing quotation of Paradise Lost in Stanza 70 indicates, Byron is himself
							deliberately playing against an archetype he would expect his readers immediately to recognize. It is Satan's cohort
							Belial who ironically pays fulsome tribute to divine wandering, which is to say, the angelic intellectual inquiry he has
							unknowingly forfeited with his fall:</p>
						<p>     for who would lose,<lb/> Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<lb/> Those thoughts that wander through
							eternity,<lb/> To perish rather, swallowed up and lost<lb/> In the wide womb of uncreated Night,<lb/> Devoid of sense and
							motion?<lb/> -- II.146-51.</p>
						<p>Throughout the second book of his epic Milton plays upon the idea of wandering, equating it with the lost condition of all
							the Satanic legions. After Satan leaves Hell to scout out the new world, they are depicted as wholly unsettled in their
							new home:</p>
						<p>     the ranged Powers<lb/> Disband; and, wandering, each his several way<lb/> Pursues, as inclination or sad choice<lb/>
							Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find<lb/> Truce to his restless thoughts . . .<lb/> -- II.522-26</p>
						<p>As one group of fallen angels retires into philosophical discussion, they find their once divine assurance replaced by a
							fundamental uncertainty, expressed as "wandering mazes" of the mind.</p>
						<p>Others apart sat on a hill retired,<lb/> In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high<lb/> Of Providence, Foreknowledge,
							Will, and Fate—<lb/> Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,<lb/> And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.<lb/>
							Of good and evil much they argued then,<lb/> Of happiness and final misery,<lb/> Passion and apathy, and glory and
							shame:<lb/> Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!—<lb/> -- II.557-65</p>
						<p>In the meantime, their epitome Satan, reaching the gates of hell, confronts his daughter Sin and describes himself as on a
							"wandering quest" (II.830) across space in search of the newly created earth. Then, breaking out of hell and encountering
							the surrounding realm of Chaos, he again characterizes himself as "Wandering this darksome desert" (II.973). Satan's
							self-portrait may thus be seen to complete this series of references that connect the "wanderers o'er Eternity" celebrated
							by Byron and Belial with the darker Byronic avatar, the essentially Satanic "wandering outlaw of his own dark mind."
							Knowledgeable readers of Paradise Lost (and Mary Shelley proves herself such through out this novel's engagement with that
							prior text) might want, however, to recall the terms of its very end, where Adam and Eve depart Paradise "with wandering
							steps and slow" (XII.648), reminding us of how closely implicated in the idea of a fallen universe is the human condition
							we share with our mythic forebears.</p>
						<p>Of course, Mary Shelley's novel can stand on its own independent of such an elaborate literary cross-referencing. When we
							finally hear from Victor Frankenstein of the vicissitudes and despondency he has experienced in his arctic wanderings
							(III:7:21), we will have another, more immediately ironic context against which to view Walton's enthusiastic apostrophe
							to his new friend. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="158">
						<term target="#domafect">domestic affections</term>
						<p>This phrase carries rich connotations in Mary Shelley's time. The Domestic Affections, for instance, is the title of the
							first mature volume of poetry by Felicia Hemans (1812), a volume in which she first laid claim to speak as the central
							female voice of the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie. The mythos of the enclosed domestic space presided over by the "Angel
							of the House" had a compelling power for the new order that came into place after the defeat of Napoleon. Quietly, in the
							first two chapters of this novel, Mary Shelley has inscribed it as a nurturing space for the growth of the Frankenstein
							children and even for their neighbor Henry Clerval. A similar enclosed circle animated by the "domestic affections" will
							form the nuclear center of the Creature's narrative in the second volume. Much critical literature has concentrated on
							these seeming ideals, some seeing a counter to the male Romantic quest, some questioning just how far Mary Shelley
							actually goes in endorsing them. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="159">
						<term target="#domesaff">the amiableness of domestic affection</term>
						<p>Although no reader of Frankenstein, if asked to list its chief concerns, would be likely to narrow the range to the value
							of domesticity and virtue, we can discern in this emphasis a veiled attempt to steer potential critics away from an attack
							on the novel's political or religious implications. At the same time, the domestic affections are certainly of import for
							the novel, yet like many other themes encountered in its progressive development, their value becomes increasingly
							ambiguous.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="160">
						<term target="#domest1">our domestic circle</term>
						<p>The repetition of this phrase (I:1:13 and note) calls attention to what would appear an ideal family: close-knit,
							affectionate, mutually acculturating. Does it do so to establish such an ideal as a retreat from the sublime terrors of
							the novel? or to suggest that even such a model family could not be protected from ruination? or, with an underlying sense
							of irony, to stress that for all his nostalgia Victor never inculcated the values he honors as projected by the family?
							Similar questions surround the other "ideal" domestic scene of the novel, the De Laceys' cottage (II:3:15).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="161">
						<term target="#domestic">our domestic circle</term>
						<p>Here Mary Shelley introduces another theme that will continually surface through the course of the novel, what Percy Bysshe
							Shelley in his preface to the first edition termed "the amiableness of domestic affection" (I:Pref:3). Later, when Victor
							must confront how far as a student he strayed from bring content in his family circle, he will inveigh against his folly
							and even link it politically to the imperialistic exploitation of unoffending innocent peoples (I:3:12). As with a number
							of elements in this novel, however, the further one pursues the central value of the domestic affections in Frankenstein,
							the more ambivalent appears their representation. For example, there is no small irony in the fact that what makes Victor
							Frankenstein and Robert Walton interesting as characters and helps to bond their friendship is their inability to find
							satisfaction within such narrow limits of endeavor. And the same might be said in 1816 for the unsanctioned alliance of
							Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and Percy Bysshe Shelley.</p>

						<term target="#doomed">doomed by slavery to toil in the mines</term>
						<p>A prime example of what Blake, in "London," called "mind-forg'd manacles." Victor's emblem for himself reveals at once his

						<term target="#drawing">drawing</term>
						<p>Drawing was a customary component of a standard gentlewoman's education in the late eighteenth century: cf. Mary

							not a component of Mary Shelley's Godwinian education. On the other hand, perhaps we are to understand that this is Victor

						<term target="#dreaded">dreaded spectre</term>
						<p>The phrase demonizes the Creature, lending him the aura of an otherworldly existence. The overwrought language of this

					<item n="171">
						<term target="#educate">self-educated</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley is so insistent on this point that she has Walton repeat it to Victor Frankenstein (I:L4:6), whose formal

							or the essential importance, in a novelistic tradition one associates with Henry Fielding, of a good heart. But it is more

						<p>Although Mary Shelley finesses the scientific instrumentation of her novel—and she could hardly do otherwise in allowing

							secret of life Victor will discover is intimately connected to electricity as a "vital fluid." Her use of the term "spark

						<term target="#elizabe1">Elizabeth Lavenza</term>
						<p>In the 1831 edition Elizabeth Lavenza's consanguinity with Victor Frankenstein has been removed: she is no longer his

							curiously dehumanizing figuration of the first edition by having Victor now compare her to a chamois.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="177">
						<term target="#elizabet">Elizabeth Lavenza</term>
						<p>No critic has ever traced a protoype of the Lavenza surname, which is, in any event, a highly uncommon one. More

							comparisons to an insect, a bird, and a pet animal, implicitly dehumanizes Elizabeth. It is possible, though the textual

					</item>
					<item n="179">
						<term target="#enemy">a palpable enemy</term>
						<p>Victor's diction here reflects experiences to which we as readers have yet to become privy, experiences that have forced
							upon him a psychological condition that conceives of the world in terms of adversarial struggle. This is an example of the
							shrewd linguistic forecasting that we find everywhere in the early chapters of Mary Shelley's revised 1831 text. In this
							case we are alerted to how much those experiences have warped Victor's notion of reality into a series of antagonistic
							states. The "palpable enemy," which is here figured in spiritual terms, will become objectified in the Creature that he

						<p>Inevitably, language like this calls to mind the, by now, obligatory laboratory equipment so characteristic of cinematic

							not mere instrumentation but rather what we would now call a dynamo to infuse the creature with what she called at the
							close of the previous paragraph "vital warmth." Since the first successful electric generators were demonstrated only in
							the 1860s, Mary Shelley's vagueness ("some") reflects her sense that such an engine is a necessary technological

							itself, though seemingly innocent of allusive force, in the context provided by the diction of the ensuing paragraph takes

						<p>As in Walton's first letter (I:L1:5 and note) this may seem an innocent enough term, but accentuated through repetition

							echo of Satan's first speech in Paradise Lost is unmistakeable.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="185">
						<term target="#enterpr3">He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger</term>
						<p>There is no explanation for why Mary Shelley remakes Henry Clerval in so robust an athletic mode, replacing the dreamy,
							poetical (and Shelleyan) figure of the first edition. Perhaps it is Victor who renders the substitution, mindful of
							Walton's commitment to "enterprise," a word that, starting with the first sentence of the novel (1831:I:L1:1), he uses six
							times in his initial letters to his sister (see also 1831:I:L1:5, 1831:I:L2:1, 1831:I:L2:3 twice, and 1831:I:L4:20). (A
							context in Milton's Paradise Lost is noted in the latter.) Admittedly, it requires some stretching of the imagination and
							the text to force a Satanic context upon Henry Clerval: it may well be that by 1831 the original contextual referents for
							Mary Shelley have diminished or have been replaced by new emphases, in this case that of masculine heroism—the ardour so
							repetitiously invoked by her male protagonists. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="186">
						<term target="#enterpr4">scope for his spirit of enterprise</term>
						<p>This addition to the 1831 text is prepared for by a similar ambition stressed in Henry's youth (see 1831:I:2:2 and note)
							and may be generally accounted for by the importance the intervening decade and a half had attached to the growing eastern
							empire of Great Britain, not just in India but also in Afghanistan, on the edge of the Ottoman empire. It would have not
							seemed questionable to the author or her readers in 1831 that Henry Clerval would wish to distinguish himself as an
							imperialist. Mary Shelley would have been well aware that one of her former husband's closest friends, Thomas Love
							Peacock, though sharing Victor Frankenstein's privileging of the European classical tradition over "oriental" literature,
							had carved out a career in the East Indian Office, the bureaucracy that oversaw commerce with the imperial East. </p>

						<term target="#enthu">enthusiasm of success</term>
						<p>The coupling of "enthusiasm" and "ardent" in this paragraph seems to indicate an intention on Mary Shelley's part to
							underscore how associated are the two and how problematic they may be in that association. The two notions have already
							been mentioned in proximity in the previous letter (I:L1:2) and (I:L1:3). They will once again be linked in contiguous
							paragraphs by Victor Frankenstein, when he recounts the frenzied rush of discovery that accompanied his search for the

					</item>
					<item n="189">
						<term target="#enthus">enthusiasm</term>
						<p>Like "ardent curiosity" in the previous paragraph (I:L1:2), "enthusiasm" bears a double sense, both good and bad,
							throughout the novel. It will be taken over by Victor Frankenstein, who is gripped as a student by what he calls "an
							almost supernatural enthusiasm" (I:3:3), which he likens to the force of a hurricane (I:3:8). In the retrospect of years
							and their incumbent disasters he terms it first an enthusiastic frenzy (III:2:21) and, more starkly in the last moments of
							his existence, an enthusiastic madness (III:WC:28).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="190">
						<term target="#enthus1">enthusiasm</term>
						<p>As in Walton's first letter (I:L1:3) enthusiasm is a charged word. In this period it was as often a pejorative as an
							honorific word: fanatics of whatever stripe were said to be enthusiastic. This was particularly true of religious fanatics
							and self-proclaimed prophets. Such figures claimed to be directly inspired by God, to feel the presence of God within
							(which is the root meaning of the word in Greek). In an ironic twist on this meaning Mary Shelley presents Victor as a
							self-styled Ezekiel, wrought up not by a storm sent by God but in a mental hurricane of his own making as he endeavors to
							usurp the function of the deity.</p>
						<p>Johnson's 1755 Dictionary is highly suggestive in its implicit aversion to the idea of enthusiasm, defining it thus:</p>
						<p> 1. A vain belief of private revelation; a vain confidence of divine favour or communication.<lb/> 2. Heat of imagination;
							violence of passion; confidence of opinion.<lb/> 3. Elevation of fancy; exaltation of ideas.</p>
						<p>If anything, Johnson is even more severe on the practitioner than on the concept, defining an enthuasist as:</p>
						<p> 1. One who vainly imagines a private revelation; one who has a vain confidence of his intercourse with God.<lb/> 2. One of
							a hot imagination, or violent passions.<lb/> 3. One of elevated fancy, or exalted ideas.</p>
						<p>In, as it were, burying his third definition beneath the others, Johnson implies that such exaltation is spurious,
							ungrounded in reality. His dismissive "hot imagination" might similarly be taken as a synonymn for the "ardour" so
							conspicuously shared and honored by the protagonists of the novel. Quite clearly, the repeated use of "vain" and "vainly"

						<term target="#enthusi">enthusiasm</term>
						<p>Walton's "romantic" instincts, he realizes, are affecting his judgment. His language recalls his earlier self-analysis
							(I:L2:2), suggesting that what he would need in a friend like Victor Frankenstein is exactly the ability to curb such
							flights of fancy. In the next paragraph Victor will decide to perform that function, starting in on the narration of his
							career as a corrective and an admonition.</p>

						<term target="#epistle">LETTER</term>
						<p>Frankenstein is written in the mode of the epistolary novel, a form popularized in the eighteenth century by Samuel
							Richardson in his novels Pamela (1741) and Clarissa (1748) and expanded across class and social demarcations by Tobias
							Smollett in The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker. By the nineteenth century the epistolary form was something of an antique,
							its dynamics having largely been subsumed by other first-person narrative modes that allowed their authors greater
							flexibility. Mary Shelley's novel, which overtly advertises its modernity in a subtitle, is curiously, then, the last
							major example of the form in English fiction. The epistolary mode inherently stresses communication and process, major
							thematic concerns of the novel, and it accentuates a reliance on a variety of self-conscious narrators who are not easily
							subject to interrogation by one another nor the reader. Mary Shelley's stress on individual perspective and on its
							resulting narrative indeterminacy are conspicuous features of her novel.</p>
						<p>It is interesting to contemplate the fact that a principal account of William Parry's Arctic expedition of 1819, Letters
							Written during the Late Voyage of Discovery in the Western Arctic Sea (1821), is also couched in an epistolary form. This
							might indicate some of the same thematic associations, structurally speaking, that the form held for Mary Shelley, or,
							more immediately, it could reveal her sudden and striking influence on subsequent travel narratives into inaccessible
							reaches of the globe. </p>

					<item n="193">
						<term target="#equal">equal interest and utility</term>
						<p>That the inveterate Roman collector of superstitious lore could be thought by Victor to be as useful for the modern student
							as the man who, perhaps more than any other, stood as the foremost elaborator of Enlightenment natural science suggests
							that the level of this youth's scientific conceptions has yet to mature. In the next chapter he will embark upon his
							advanced education as an enthusiastic greenhorn.</p>

					<item n="194">
						<term target="#ernest">Ernest</term>
						<p>In revising her novel Mary Shelley totally changed Ernest's state of health but added nothing that would give him a reason
							for existing in the novel except to carry on the family name in obscurity. In both texts, however, Ernest serves as a foil
							to the overly abstract and abstracted mind of his brother Victor. As a farmer (1818) or a mercenary keeper of the peace
							(1831), Ernest's concern would be with the given order of things rather than with what underlies it conceptually. In both
							texts (but paradoxically more pronounced in the third edition, many years after Byron provided an immediate context for
							her writing), Ernest bears a striking similarity to the Chamois Hunter of Manfred, which Byron began after the Shelleys'
							departure in 1816 and is also set in Switzerland. See Act I, scene ii, and Act II, scene i.</p>

						<term target="#ernest2">Ernest</term>
						<p>Ernest is at this juncture in his seventeenth year, the same age that Victor was when he left his home to study in

						<term target="#evennow">even now she often reminds me of her</term>
						<p>This point is reemphasized two paragraphs on. Given the events subsequent to this chapter, one should stress the

							and gestures and to Elizabeth seems like her embodiment. That Victor can remain silent at her persecution will thus be a
							signal moral failing.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="198">
						<term target="#excellen">Excellent friend</term>
						<p>We will learn the reason for this rhetorical heightening through the vocative case as we move into the next chapter. This
							is the last serene moment that Victor will experience in his entire existence, but the address to Clerval in the past
							tense immediately shadows its expression of joy. In retrospect, the reader may consider Victor's happiness during this
							year as purchased by a willful blindness to the potential consequences of his actions.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="199">
						<term target="#exotic">to shelter her, as a fair exotic</term>
						<p>An exotic Johnson, in his 1755 Dictionary, defines simply as "A foreign plant." In modern parlance it would designate a
							tropical, or non-hardy, botanical specimen. As the succeeding sentences suggest, Caroline Frankenstein's fragile health,
							which will lead to her early death, justifies such care. Today's reader is likely to find such language offensive since
							intrinsically patronizing, but it was a common occurence in the fiction, and the society, of Mary Shelley's day and would
							have drawn no particular attention to itself. Yet, since gender roles are of continuing significance in the development of
							the novel, this early emphasis on the traditional frailty of the female physique is noteworthy.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="200">
						<term target="#extensiv">extensive usefulness</term>
						<p>Victor's account of his life, we should recall, begins with the pedigree of the male Frankensteins in the public life of
							the state (I:1:1). In his youth he was clearly inculcated with his obligation to follow in this family tradition. The
							issue bears as well for Walton's sense of purpose on his expedition (I:L1:2).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="201">
						<term target="#eyefixed">with my eyes fixed on a coach</term>
						<p>This strange intensity of gaze seems to combine the fixated obsessiveness in which Victor has passed the previous two years
							with an ominous foreshadowing of the destiny that he will come to feel has driven him to his destruction.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="202">
						<term target="#eyesinsn">my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature</term>
						<p>Victor is originally described by Walton as having a powerful feeling for nature (I:L4:28), which is certainly not the case
							here; nor is it, indeed, at many crucial points in his narrative. Although in this novel turning away from nature may be
							indicative of a moral lapse, it is true that in the present instance Victor is circumventing nature in his creation of
							another sentient being. Thus, it might be said that his insensitivity to the natural is perfectly in keeping with his
							commitment to a creative act independent of its limitations.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="203">
						<term target="#fainted">fainted</term>
						<p>Walton understandably credits Victor's condition to severe exposure; but Victor tends to react with extreme stress to the
							Creature's presence and more than once falls into a catatonic state: e.g., after the Creature's original escape (I:4:3),
							after the destruction of the second creature (III:3:24), and after the death of Clerval (III:4:10). This appears to be a
							psychosomatic corollary to his constitutional introversion.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="204">
						<term target="#fairenem">the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy</term>
						<p>The diction here is deliberately resonant with the conventions of a highly artificial poetry. The "fair enemy" is the lady
							to whom these seductive verses would be addressed, an "enemy" in the sense that she resists their appeal to abandon
							herself to the sensuousness they invite. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="205">
						<term target="#fairy">fairy tale</term>
						<p>Although Charles Perrault (1628-1703) is firmly a citizen of the seventeenth century, his Contes des fees, popularly known
							as Mother Goose Stories, had by late in the eighteenth century become staples of children's literature and had prompted
							many imitations. William Lane of the Minerva Press in London, publisher of numerous fictional pot-boilers, for instance,
							also brought out two-volume sets of fairy tales in 1788 and 1794. Closer to home, Mary Shelley's father, William Godwin,
							under his psuedonym of Edward Baldwin, in 1805 published a set of Fables Ancient and Modern for very young children that
							went through numerous editions; and the Juvenile Library, which he ran with his second wife Mary Jane Clairmont,
							specialized in children's books with useful morality appended. This series published the first English translation of
							Johann David Wyss's perennial Swiss Family Robinson in 1814. Mary Shelley was thus as a child uniquely conditioned by
							contemporary notions of children's literature, and she was also encouraged to become a writer at a very young age. The
							careful noting of Clerval's age (9) when he wrote his fairy tale indicates that Mary Shelley has in mind her own debut at
							the age of 11, in a satirical parody about an Englishman in France, Mounseer Nongtongpaw, that was published in January
							1807.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="206">
						<term target="#fangs">fangs of remorse</term>
						<p>With this phrase Mary Shelley insinuates a theme into her novel that will develop exponentially over its course. We recall
							that Victor expressed "the greatest remorse" for having kept Henry Clerval from his studies during his long illness
							(I:4:20): that diction, for all its hyperbole, was utterly conventional. Now, Victor is bitten by remorse as by a
							poisonous viper, and it will poison his system for the rest of his existence. For the later course of this poison where it
							results in agony, for instance, see the last sentence of III:5:8. This same poison infects the Creature as well, he
							bitterly admits to Walton (III:WC:37). The contemporary definition of remorse accentuated so painful a condition.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="207">
						<term target="#fastidio">somewhat fastidious</term>
						<p>This may appear a surprising choice of diction on Walton's part. Johnson's Dictionary defines the word pejoratively:</p>
						<p> Disdainful; squeamish; delicate to a vice; insolently nice.</p>
						<p>The Oxford English Dictionary somewhat refines the range of possible meanings:</p>
						<p> 1. That creates disgust; disagreeable, distasteful, unpleasant, wearisome. Obs.<lb/> 2.<lb/>    -- a. That feels or is
							full of disgust; disgusted.<lb/>    -- b. Full of pride; disdainful; scornful. Obs.<lb/>    -- c. transf. Of things:
							'Proud', magnificent.<lb/> 3. Easily disgusted, squeamish, over-nice; difficult to please with regard to matters of taste
							or propriety.</p>
						<p>The connotation of Walton's usage indicates that he is using the word in the third sense here, suggestive of a
							well-educated and highly refined sense of taste.</p>
						<p>What may be most interesting about this sentence is what it says about Mary Shelley's values. A woman who has been "tutored
							and refined by books" is still an uncommon being in eighteenth-century culture, often referred to contemptuously as a
							"learned lady." Here, in contrast, Margaret Saville is a paragon of judgment and the conduit through which this entire
							history, with its multiple internal narratives, flows. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="208">
						<term target="#fatal">fatal impulse</term>
						<p>It is probably no accident that Victor employs diction that could also be used to describe a massive jolt of electric
							current. His Creature will receive such a "fatal impulse" at the beginning of the fourth chapter (I:4:1), when Victor
							"infuse[s] a spark of being" into its flesh. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="209">
						<term target="#fate">fate</term>
						<p>Victor uses the term with a wholly different emphasis from that given to it by Walton in the previous paragraph. Walton's
							wish to "ameliorate his fate" refers to the despondency to which he thinks Victor has been driven by hard, but as yet
							undiscriminated, circumstances, a despondency that could be alleviated by time and compassion. Victor, on the other hand,
							as his narrative will begin to underscore, has come to see himself as a destined victim of these circumstances, one who
							can neither alter them nor their effect on his own condition. The disparity in usage is actually a window into character. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="210">
						<term target="#fateword">the words of fate</term>
						<p>As Victor underscores his sense of being wholly out of control of his destiny, he also suggests that, at least as a
							student, he had little knowledge of himself. At Ingolstadt he finds himself transformed before his own eyes, without an
							understanding of how or why this process should have happened. The lack of knowledge, of which he has just complained to
							Walton, thus extends far beyond the rudiments of science.</p>

						<term target="#feltnot">felt not as I did, such deep and bitter agony</term>
						<p>As earlier at the trial (I:7:11), Victor's egocentricity impels him to assert his prior claim as sufferer, even as he
							stands in the presence of the condemned innocent. His grounds seem to be that Justine, although surely a victim of
							injustice, has the integrity of her innocence to depend upon, whereas he, although powerless to alter the verdict, knows
							the grounds of its falsehood and stands morally self-perjured and divided.</p>

						<p>God is the final cause, and Mary Shelley would have been well aware that a great many people in England could purport to
							speak definitively on a subject from which Victor backs skeptically away. Victor is perhaps remembering that Newton in his
							last years wrote a two-volume commentary on the Book of Revelation, where the final cause, in the conventional teaching of
							Christianity, is cryptically revealed. The secondary and tertiary grades of causation would be, for example, the rationale
							behind the laws of the universe enunciated with such clarity by Isaac Newton. An example closer to the fictional point
							would be to understand why and how the Grand Unified Field operates, since both Victor Frankenstein and Robert Walton have
							been engaged in trying to fathom isolated aspects of it. See I:L1:2 and note.</p>

					<item n="217">
						<term target="#fixed">fixed as fate</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley here unobtrusively introduces another key concern of the novel, often invoked as "destiny," that broadly

					</item>
					<item n="218">
						<term target="#forced">forced to destroy</term>
						<p>The language of necessity here is curious and seems indicative of Victor's almost instinctive recourse to a sense of

							preceding paragraph, and equally heretical.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="219">
						<term target="#forebode">such evil forebodings</term>
						<p>This is a first indication that women and men do not generally see eye to eye in this novel. It will be replicated in
							Elizabeth's fears for the health and mental stability of Victor Frankenstein, and, like that analogy, suggests that the
							domestic tranquillity over which women conventionally preside is threatened by the sublime overreaching of male ambition.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="220">
						<term target="#forehead">An open and capacious forehead</term>
						<p>It would appear once more that Victor has read and inculcated the wisdom of one of his most celebrated countrymen in the
							eighteenth century, Johann Kaspar Lavater (1741-1801), whose Physiognomische Fragmente (1775-1778)—translated into English
							in 1789-1798 as Essays on Physiognomy— purported to show how character could be inferred from facial features and
							proportions. Here "open" carries moral connotations, indicative of the "frankness of disposition" with which this sentence
							ends. See I:3:1 and note for an earlier instance where physiognomy appears to enter into his discourse.</p>
						<p>Mary Shelley was aware that her own character had been predicted from her infant physiognomy by her father's close friend,
							the scientist William Nicholson.</p>
						<p>Nicholson (1753-1815), from an initial meeting in 1786, became one of William Godwin's closest friends, a major influence
							on the conception of his Enquiry concerning Political Justice, and his source during more than a quarter-century for
							up-to-date knowledge in the sciences. He and his wife were among the most attentive of friends during the fatal illness of
							Mary Wollstonecraft. On the infant Mary Godwin's nineteenth day, Godwin persuaded Nicholson to write a lengthy prediction
							of his daughter's character based on her physiognomy, according to the system popularized by Lavater.</p>
						<p>Nicholson's most important contribution to chemistry was the discovery of the process of electrolysis of water, using the
							new advances in electricity developed by Alessandro Volta and others. He discovered that the application of electrical
							currents to water causes the water to break into its component elements, hydrogen and oxygen — the first chemical reaction
							produced by electricity.</p>
						<p>In addition to being a practicing chemist, Nicholson was instrumental in propagating knowledge in the field. His
							introduction to Natural Philosophy (1781) was widely known. He founded The Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and
							the Arts in 1797, the first scientific journal not under the aegis of a scientific institution. And in 1809, he published
							the British Encyclopedia; or, Dictionary of arts and sciences. Comprising an accurate and popular view of the present
							improved state of human knowledge in six volumes, from which the extracts concerning galvanic experimentation in the first
							decade of the nineteenth century, a process of which he was among the major exponents, are invaluable. This consolidation
							of the contemporary scientific scene has long been understood to have been instrumental in making Percy Bysshe Shelley "a
							Newton among poets." What should be equally clear is that the acquaintance of Mary Shelley with this remarkable man, thus
							begun in infancy, would have amply provided her with a theoretical understanding of the scientific bases on which her
							novel purports to rest.</p>
						<p>As Nicholson's account emphasizes (C. Kegan Paul, William Godwin: His Friends and Contemporaries (London, 1876), pp.
							289-90), she, too, possessed a "capacious forehead." </p>

					<item n="221">
						<term target="#forgetfl">forgetful of herself</term>
						<p>This feminine ideal stands in sharp contrast to the masculine pursuit of glory (I:L1:6, I:1:18), and, as marked here, it
							will continue to resonate through the course of the novel. In some sense the theme has already been signalled in Walton's
							attendance on the exhausted Victor Frankenstein (I:L4:10).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="222">
						<term target="#frank">frankly</term>
						<p>Candor is an important character trait in the novel, and it is to Walton's credit that he so naturally evinces it. His
							openness will elicit a similar frankness from Victor Frankenstein, who for the first time in his existence will tell his
							entire story. But that narration, then, raises a serious problem. Not only are there many signs of instability in it, the
							major one being Victor's wish to revise it even as it goes along (III:WC:4 and note); but his earlier lack of candor with
							his family and friends is akin to dishonesty, which, if so common a practice throughout his mature life, must raise
							serious doubts about the truthfulness of the narration that comprises the bulk of this novel.</p>

						<term target="#friend">I have no friend</term>
						<p>The first embarkation on a major and, to some critics, puzzling feature of this novel, its all but exclusive emphasis on
							male bonding.</p>
						<p>If we consider novels that are contemporary with Frankenstein and have been accorded a similar canonical reputation, we
							might expect a woman novelist to emphasize the richness of female relationships (for instance, the sisters of Austen's
							Sense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice) and a man (the classic example might be Walter Scott in Ivanhoe) to
							concentrate on the representation of male competition and loyalties.</p>
						<p>Perhaps, however, we are overly conditioned by stereotypes. On the one hand, there is the fact that Frankenstein was
							published anonymously and was taken by at least one critic, Walter Scott himself, to be the work of a male author (see his
							review in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine). From this it could be argued that Mary Shelley might have wished to escape the
							preoccupation with female experience in contemporary "lady novelists." And on the other hand, from a feminist perspective
							it could likewise be argued that a women might have a very different take on that male competition and loyalty than a man.
							Inasmuch as masculine terms might be said to define the boundaries of a woman's existence, Mary Shelley might have thought
							an exclusionary male experience to be a province to which she had every right to demand access. This would have been
							particularly the case in 1816, after nearly a quarter century of almost continuous warfare in Europe. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="225">
						<term target="#friend1">friend</term>
						<p>The novel reverts once more to the importance of male bonding, already developed in Victor's narrative in the warm

					</item>
					<item n="226">
						<term target="#fright">Frightful must it be</term>
						<p>This sudden elevation of language should not be merely dismissed as a facile rhetorical heightening for effect. What Mary
							Shelley seems deliberately to be doing here is evoking a succession of elements and emotional states associated with the
							Sublime in eighteenth-century aesthetic theory. As the Creature in his coming to life is associated with the Sublime, so
							he is its avatar wherever he appears in the novel, either living within a sublime landscape (e.g. Mont Blanc or northern
							Siberia) or terrifying the human beings whom he encounters by his extra-human size and countenance.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="227">
						<term target="#frstein">Frankenstein</term>
						<p>Over the years in which Mary Shelley's novel was transformed into the stuff of legend, much speculation has centered on
							where she might have encountered the name of her protagonist. Unfortunately, none of the suggestions has moved beyond the
							level of speculation.</p>
						<p> It is conceivable that she heard the name of a ruined castle on the Rhine during the hurried trip that she, her
							half-sister Claire Clairmont, and Percy Bysshe Shelley took down that river in returning to England from the 1814 trip she
							memorialized in A History of a Six Weeks' Tour, a trip also quickly replicated in the third volume of Frankenstein
							(III:1:16). But this is unlikely, since none of the party spoke German, and Mary represents them as being rather
							standoffish to their fellow passengers during the trip.</p>
						<p>Similarly, there is no documentary evidence of a visit to the Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt. Indeed, had it happened,
							one would have expected it to have been noted either by P. B. Shelley in the Preface he wrote to the 1818 edition or by
							Mary Shelley herself in the retrospective history she penned for the Introduction in 1831. What the speculation has
							proven, however, is that the Frankenstein name is common enough not to have needed an actual prototype. The only real
							oddity about the family name, and one never broached in the text, is how so Germanic an appellation became attached to a
							French-speaking family in Switzerland. </p>

						<p>In this context Victor means a long passage-way, which was a feature of many older European residences. Such a gallery

						<term target="#galvanis">galvanism had given token of such things</term>
						<p>Galvanism is named after the inventor of the electric cell, Luigi Galvani, professor of medicine at the University of

							by making the legs of dead frogs move as if with life. Galvani's nephew, Giovanni Aldini (1762-1834), conducted
							experiments in London recounted in John Aldini, An Account of the Late Improvements in Galvanism, with a series of curious
							and interesting experiments . . . [and an] Appendix, containing the author's Experiments on the body of a Malefactor
							executed at Newgate (London: Cuthell &amp; Martin and John Murray, 1803). In the first canto of Don Juan, written

						<term target="#gazed">gazed on and execrated</term>
						<p>Trials were a form of spectator sport in the later eighteenth century, with criminals commonly being assaulted and

					<item n="232">
						<term target="#geneva">Geneva</term>
						<p>A city of about thirty thousand at the time of the novel, Geneva had long held an importance in central Europe
							incommensurate with its relatively modest size. John Calvin, arriving in this quiet city in 1536, transformed it into a
							center of the Reformation. In 1559, Calvin and Théodore de Bèze founded the University of Geneva to function as a center
							of Protestant intellectual inquiry. This orientation made a natural linkage between the University of Geneva and Oxford
							and Cambridge Universities in England that thrived throughout the later Renaissance.</p>
						<p>That early sense of kinship the English felt for the Swiss was reinforced during Mary Shelley's age by two factors. One was
							the invasion of this neutral, unoffending country by the French in 1798, which became a major focus of government
							propaganda in England and effectively ended all sympathy for the course of the French Revolution by its intellectual
							elite. The second, and for Mary Shelley a more immediate factor, was the inveterate hostility to Napoleon practiced by the
							leading citizen of Geneva's small suburb of Coppet, Germaine de Staël, who there surrounded herself with a significant
							circle of independent and generally democratic thinkers like A. W. Schlegel and J. C. L. Simonde de Sismondi. The daughter
							of one of the few untouchable supporters of the early revolution, Jacques Necker, who kept France financially afloat
							during its turbulent transition from monarchy to jacobin directory, Germaine de Staël was banned from France by Napoleon
							and through her travels enjoyed a pan-European renown. Byron met her in London in 1813, a year before his publisher John
							Murray brought out her important work On Germany.</p>
						<p>The circle surrounding Madame de Staël could be construed as an extension of the earlier source of independent intellectual
							energy provided by Geneva's most famous citizen in the eightenth century, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. During the 1816 summer,
							Byron and Shelley undertook a boat tour of the northern shore of Lake Geneva with the particular aim of visiting locations
							associated with Rousseau and his writings. Although Mary remained behind, she would have shared their enthusiasm for this
							last great figure of the French Enlightenment. It could not have been absent from her mind that to begin a first-person
							narrative account, "I am by birth a Genevese" (I:1:1) would automatically remind readers of Rousseau's Confessions, the
							fourth paragraph of which begins in a similar manner. Rousseau's spirit, indeed, might be said to hover over the entire
							novel, from its emphasis on a new "noble savage" to its concern with education, particularly in the formation of the
							Creature, to its antiestablishment political undertones.</p>
						<p>With such pronounced associations of relevance in both its past and recent history, Geneva stands as a perfect match for
							the other great center of the Enlightenment, St. Petersburg. As Chapter 1 issues, so to speak, from the voice of Victor
							Frankenstein identifying himself with the Swiss city, Letter 1 (I:L1:1) is dated by Robert Walton from the Russian
							capital. Together these figures and these cities represent the values of the Enlightenment that will be interrogated over
							and over in the subsequent pages of Mary Shelley's novel. </p>

						<term target="#gentle">your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses</term>
						<p>If we can take this tribute at face value, as an honest assessment of the rehabilitation presided over by Henry Clerval, we
							must then read a tragic irony into Victor's expression here. He has opened himself up once more to the generous humanity
							he had experienced in his domestic circle, a humanity that might have enveloped his Creature in far different
							circumstances from those attending his instant rejection at Victor's hands. As with other sentiments in these last
							paragraphs of the chapter, sentiments predicated on stable norms and humane values, we are given a last opportunity to

							far and wide around contemporary novels before finding a man who actually would employ such a term in like circumstances.
							The fact that Walton prizes "dauntless courage" (I:L2:1) may look like a stereotyped masculinist attitude, but combining

						<term target="#glory">glory</term>
						<p>However consonant with heroic endeavor or with an achievement beyond ordinary standards, glory is still a word with

							Margaret Saville views with such "evil foreboding." Within two sentences the word will become associated with the actual
							fountain of evil in western myth. Later, we will discover that Victor Frankenstein is exactly similar to Walton in

						<term target="#gnashes">gnashes his teeth</term>
						<p>If the reader can free this action of its melodramatic trappings, its intense physicality testifies to how seriously

					</item>
					<item n="240">
						<term target="#godraise">God raises my weakness</term>
						<p>In her revisions Mary Shelley somewhat mitigates the picture of institutional injustice so starkly presented in the first
							edition. In particular, she pulls back sharply from her earlier representation of the Church's place in this inhumane
							structure. The Justine of 1831 becomes much more conventionally pious and more tranquilly submissive to what she conceives
							to be the will of heaven.</p>
						<p>The reasons for this shift in tone may be many and complicated. One obvious one is that England was on the brink of the
							passage of the Great Reform Bill when her novel was republished in 1831, and the prelude to that sweeping legislation, the
							repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts in 1828, had opened an era of religious freedom and toleration in which such
							attacks would have seemed truly of another age and ungenerous, if not intolerant, in and of themselves. </p>

					<item n="241">
						<term target="#godwin">William Godwin</term>
						<p>William Godwin, 1756-1836, political philosopher and novelist, husband of Mary Wollstonecraft, and father of Mary Shelley.</p>
						<p>Godwin's works, including works of political philosophy (most importantly An Enquiry concerning Political Justice) and
							several novels (including Caleb Williams and St. Leon), advocate intellectual self-development through the rule of reason,
							personal freedom bordering on political anarchy, the dismantling of inherited institutions, religious liberalism, and
							disinterested justice.</p>
						<p>Political Justice emphasizes the deleterious impact of all systems of government on the ethical and intellectual
							development of individual human beings. In this systematically argued critique Godwin posits the ultimate perfectibility
							of mankind if freed from repressive social structures. In his novels Godwin obliquely underscores these same philosophical
							and social issues, adding to them a continuing gallery of portraits of male figures whose obsessions and self-regard are
							supported by the patriarchal institutions of modern civilization. Both his philosophical and fictional concerns are, in
							turn, strongly reflected in the characterization and the events of Frankenstein. </p>

					<item n="243">
						<term target="#greatdis">great dissimilitude in our characters</term>
						<p>The major dissimilitude in this description is between highly conventional notions of essential masculine and feminine

							issue. For readers concerned with Mary Shelley's feminist commitment or with the way gender destinctions are reflected by
							early nineteenth-century novels, Elizabeth's lack of self-assertiveness and her easy acquiescence in a traditional female

						<term target="#greatmon">great monarchies</term>
						<p>Prussia and Austria would be the obvious surrounding context for Switzerland, but two sentences later the reader is given

							thrust on Mary Shelley's part. The defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo had occured in June 1815, a little over a year before

							III:7:20 and note. See also III:7:24 and note.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="246">
						<term target="#guardian">the guardian angel of my life</term>
						<p>This seemingly strange shift in Victor's autobiography, without parallel in the account of his early education in the first
							edition, may be intended by Mary Shelley in her emendations to prepare us for, and make a logical link to, Victor's mental
							state just before he is rescued by Walton and his crew. In the last chapter of his narration (III:7:5) he accounts himself
							under the special protection of guiding spirits who guide his vengeance against the Creature.</p>
						<p>Coming as it does at the end of this chapter on his formative influence, this strong commitment to a guiding destiny
							testifies to a belief system through which Victor filters his entire existence, thus in effect rewriting it. Where a
							reader might wish to observe in Victor's behavior a normal adolescent lethargy or an understandable lack of assurance
							about the future course of his preparation for adulthood, Victor sees the hand of Providence. </p>

					<item n="247">
						<term target="#guest">guest</term>
						<p>In the last paragraph of the preceding entry (I:L4:23), written eight days earlier, Victor had still been a "stranger."

					</item>
					<item n="248">
						<term target="#guide">my want of a guide</term>
						<p>In her revisions Mary Shelley strengthens the similarities between Victor Frankenstein and Robert Walton. In this case,
							although Victor is about to undergo a systematic education, the 1831 text leaves him virtually as lacking in discipline as
							Walton represented himself to be in writing to his sister (1831:I:L1:2 and note). In the context provided by the terms of
							Walton's letter, where he remarks how much he needs a friend to help regulate his mind, Victor's lack of a close associate
							in these early weeks spent almost in solitude is ominous.</p>

					<item n="249">
						<term target="#guided">I was so guided by a silken cord</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley, though an only child, did not grow up like one, since there were four different parental configurations for
							the five children of the Godwin household. Yet, the venerated memory of her father's approach to her education is surely
							implicit in this "silken cord" by which Victor, led insensibly on for his own betterment, comes to enjoy his education. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="250">
						<term target="#hadtaken">had taken an irresistable hold of my imagination</term>
						<p>Once again, Victor yields his will to his passion. But the terms he uses seem to invoke something beyond the question of
							free will and determinism. Victor at this point recognizes that his imagination, the creative power of fantasy, is driving
							his pursuit of the unknown, which tends to implicate a faculty ordinarily privileged in British Romanticism. Something of
							the same order happened four paragraphs earlier, when the imagination was likewise cited (I:3:7).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="251">
						<term target="#halfmade">but half made up</term>
						<p>Given the erudition of her father and her husband, Mary Shelley would have known of Aristophanes' account, in Plato's
							Symposium, of the origin of love occuring when primitive man was split in two: thereafter one half was always yearning for
							the completion of the self in the other. (P. B. Shelley was to translate the Symposium in the spring of 1818.) Here she
							plays against the myth ironically, for, as we will see in the sequel, Victor Frankenstein and his Creature will pursue a
							course of adversarial antagonism that is as passionately intense as love. It is frequently figured in the imagery of
							doubling and mirroring.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="252">
						<term target="#heart">heart and soul</term>
						<p>This is the second time (see also I:3:10) that Victor uses this phrase in the chapter to indicate the totality of his
							commitment to his program of research.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="253">
						<term target="#heartles">heartless laughter</term>
						<p>Like so much of the diction in this chapter the phrase can be read in two senses: first, as laughter without cause, as
							though Victor's heart is not in it; second, as a cold, self-obsessed, or unfeeling discharge of nervous energy. Although
							the first meaning is the natural way to construe the diction, the second remains behind, like a sour aftertaste, to affect
							our later judgments. It is allied to the intimation of madness expressed by the wildness of Victor's eyes.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="254">
						<term target="#heartren">heart-rending eloquence</term>
						<p>Both Elizabeth and Victor, endeavoring to alter the verdict through a rhetoric that would move the judges' hearts,
							completely fail in their attempt. Once again, eloquence is placed at the center of the discourse and in a highly
							problematic light. Why it is so problematic might best be gauged by comparing this work to the major poem that Percy
							Bysshe Shelley was writing simultaneously with it, The Revolt of Islam. There the heroine Cythna so moves the hearts of
							her auditors through her eloquent appeals to their common humanity as to foment a radical revolution that overthrows the
							tyranny that has oppressed them. Although it is a conspicuous feature of Cythna's presence, Canto 8 of that poem is
							exemplary since it is entirely devoted to this process.</p>
						<p>In the Shelleys' household, then, eloquence holds a privileged place as a tool of non-violent political reform. Where it
							fails so grievously as here, the consequences may be very great. That Mary Shelley is herself aware of this dimension may
							be inferred from her letter of June 1 1816 where she calmly notes of the French "liberation" of Switzerland in 1798 that
							all "the magistrates . . . were shot by the populace during that revolution." It may give the reader pause to realize that
							one of those actual magistrates, were he still himself among the living, would have been Alphonse Frankenstein. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="255">
						<term target="#hehas">he has retired into himself</term>
						<p>As with other of his comments in this passage, readers may sense that what Walton signifies is conceptually broader than
							what he actually realizes he is saying: thus the value of his comment is more in alerting us to a problematic issue than
							in giving us a thumbnail sketch that will define Victor Frankenstein forever in our minds. Where Walton sees a
							praiseworthy self-containment in his friend's comportment, indeed, many critics remark the dangers of Romantic solipsism.
							In Victor's own account his introversion and obsessiveness will be stressed as character traits that were factors
							contributing to his downfall.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="256">
						<term target="#hell">become a hell</term>
						<p>As the Dante allusion in the previous paragraph suggests, hell is a mental state. Victor's words make a direct allusion to
							one of Milton's most famous passages in Paradise Lost, where Satan comes face to face with the responsibility for his own
							damnation:</p>
						<p>Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?<lb/> Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,<lb/> But Heaven's
							free love dealt equally to all?<lb/> Be then his love accursed, since love or hate,<lb/> To me alike, it deals eternal
							woe.<lb/> Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will<lb/> Chose freely what it now so justly rues.<lb/> Me miserable!

						<p>In Percy Bysshe Shelley's first major poem, Queen Mab (1813), the male friend (and author-surrogate) who awaits the

					<item n="258">
						<term target="#herguilt">every one else believes in her guilt</term>
						<p>Although Victor's jumping to conclusions about the guilt of his Creature indicates how widespread is the temptation to
							judge without evidence, the fact that Justine has been convicted in the popular mind before her trial even starts
							introduces a sinister element to the social dimensions of the novel. The class issues that will arise in the trial are
							highly complicated. The small detail of how the Frankenstein family was circumvented by its own servants, who were the
							ones to appeal to the magistrates (see I:6:34), is telling in its representation of how widespread has been the process of
							scapegoating that has eventuated in Justine's arrest. This detail may also suggest that the Frankenstein family has itself
							attempted to keep faith with Justine and thus, in some sense, may serve to mitigate the reader's own temptation to rush to
							judgment over the family's complicity in an exercise of injustice.</p>

					<item n="260">
						<term target="#hideous">my hideous progeny</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley has already used the word "hideous" four times in the Introduction to refer to both the being who was endowed

						<p>However much Mary Shelley may have known about Ingolstadt, she never visited the town and thus probably surmised from her
							general travels in Switzerland and Germany (or perhaps from her travels down the Rhine two years before in 1814) that it
							would have had such a steeple. The various towered constructions of Ingolstadt, however, are all built in brick. There is

						<p>Here, the invocation of imagination seems shadowed by no darker intimations, as it had been earlier (see I:3:7 and note;

					</item>
					<item n="264">
						<term target="#hislab">his labours</term>
						<p>The pronoun is pointed, an attempt to shield Mary Shelley from an attack on her as a female novelist. Attenuating this
							strategy, Percy Bysshe Shelley himself undertook all negotiations for the publication of the novel. The subterfuge worked
							at least to some extent. Walter Scott, reviewing the novel in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine identified Shelley as the
							author. Closer to the local scene, the Quarterly, inimical to Godwin, savaged the novel as the production of his daughter.
							Perhaps, this was exactly why the subterfuge was undertaken in the first place.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="265">
						<term target="#hispap">his father</term>
						<p>The sense of divergent perspectives between Victor and Alphonse Frankenstein encountered in the first chapter
							(I:1:15-I:1:16) here is extended to a neighboring father's shortsighted thwarting of all his son's ambitions. Given
							Victor's portrayal of Clerval as a poet, it is impossible not to feel the impress of Percy Bysshe Shelley's strained

					</item>

						<p>Throughout the novel, with the exception of Victor's interview with his Creature in Volume 2 (II:2:6), only the blind

						<term target="#howsweet">How sweet is the affection of others</term>
						<p>Sentimental as are Justine's remarks, it is important to realize how scrupulously they register such major themes of the

							when all else fails or their inadequacy to assuage a fundamental injustice is the question Mary Shelley carefully leaves
							up in the air.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="269">
						<term target="#humanben">human benevolence</term>
						<p>Human benevolence, or natural goodness (the quality stressed in the revised language of the third edition), is an attribute
							believed in deeply by both Mary and Percy Bysshe Shelley. At the same time, it cannot simply be assumed as a given in
							Frankenstein, for it is severely tested by the chain of events driving this novel. Even people who are nominally
							benevolent (Victor is the obvious example), act with questionable ethics. And those who are most committed to the notion
							of a natural benevolence (Elizabeth, for instance) would be hard pressed to show any evidence for it.</p>

					<item n="270">
						<term target="#humanfra">the structure of the human frame</term>
						<p>Although the first sentence of the preface to the original edition, which points to Erasmus Darwin, has generally been
							thought to specify his Temple of Nature, Victor Frankenstein's scientific concern with animal structures might suggest the
							relevance to the novel as well of Darwin's Zoonomia; or, the Laws of Organic Life, published in two volumes in 1794 and
							1796. The first volume, in particular, broadly considers the function of structure throughout the faunal species.</p>

						<term target="#husband">I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident</term>
						<p>A long critical history has sprung up around this statement. Now that all the extant manuscripts for the novel have been
							published in facsimile, it would appear, at least from the written evidence, that Mary Shelley's defence of her own
							artistry is accurate. Her husband read the manuscript with careful attention, here and there suggesting variations in
							phrasing that Mary Shelley incorporated into the final form of the novel. As the editor of the facsimile edition
							concludes, "A reading of the evidence in these Frankenstein Notebooks should make clear that PBS's contributions to
							Frankenstein were no more than what most publishers' editors have provided new (or old) authors or, in fact, what
							colleagues have provided to each other after reading each other's works in progress." For the full statement, see Charles

						<term target="#ialmost">I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was</term>
						<p>Here in an essential form is the crux of the similarity being subtly drawn between the conditions of Justine and the
							Creature. Not only has society cast her off as "guilty," but it has reinforced its verdict by classifying her as alien,
							beyond a human pale: thus, a "monster." Yet, since individual identity is itself so deeply subject to social construction,
							to find oneself termed alien is to undergo an immediate process of self-alienation. We will witness the same process as
							the driving force in the Creature's education as the next volume unfolds. </p>

					<item n="273">

					<item n="274">
						<term target="#iardent">I ardently desired</term>
						<p>The desire encapsulated in this phrase will be borne out linguistically when Victor begins his course of instruction in the
							next chapter. At that point various cognates of "ardor" will echo through the text (I:3:1) and note, also I:3:6). At this
							early point, however, it is sufficient for the reader to recognize that the very language Victor uses echoes Walton's in
							his review of the course of his self-education (I:L1:2).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="275">
						<term target="#ibegan">I began</term>
						<p>There are 29 first-person singular pronouns in this paragraph; similarly, there are another 29 first-person pronouns (26
							singular) in I:3:3, as well as 25 in I:3:6 (where Victor dissolves his egocentrism in pontificatory admonishment of
							Walton's ambition), and a full 40 such pronouns in I:3:9. Mary Shelley thus dexterously underscores Victor's total
							self-involvement in his scientific pursuit.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="276">
						<term target="#iconfessd">I confessed, that I might obtain absolution</term>
						<p>Justine has confessed in order to procure last rites and entry into heaven after death. Yet, as a false confession cannot
							truly absolve a sinner, either Mary Shelley's protestant prejudice is showing, revealing a bias against or actual
							ignorance of Roman Catholic theology, or, more probably, she is quietly deepening her social critique to implicate the
							immorality of those who, entrusted with the spiritual lives of humanity, sell them out to the advantage of their own
							authority or of state power. It is also possible that she emphasizes the Catholicism of the Moritz household to mark a
							subtle prejudice against Justine in the minds of the Frankensteins, who seem to reflect the austere moralistic
							Protestantism for which Geneva was noted.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="277">
						<term target="#icouldp">I could people the hours with creations</term>
						<p>If Mary Shelley's account of her childhood writing suggests affinities with her characterization of Clerval, the depiction
							of the Scottish idyll of her adolescence similarly encompasses her portrait of the young Elizabeth Lavenza, particularly
							her fondness for the "aërial creations of the poets" (see both 1818 (I:1:10) and 1831 (I:2:1) texts, and note).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="278">
						<term target="#ididnot">I did not speak</term>
						<p>This reticence about the Creature will come to have a self-perpetuating momentum that will cause widespread harm. In the
							case of Clerval, it would have been as easy for Victor to narrate his story as, later, it is with Walton. His holding-back
							is obviously an important plot device, but within the fiction itself it appears to reveal a deep, if unarticulated, sense
							of guilt on his part.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="279">
						<term target="#ifear">I fear, my friend</term>
						<p>Victor's interruption of his story reminds us of its fictive nature and reintroduces the problem of belief that will in
							numerous ways dominate the final pages of this first volume. It also quietly prepares us for a major shift in the plot. In
							terms of the novel's characterization, however, it might be read as Victor's way of reasserting an urbane control over a
							narration (as well as a narrator) evidencing signs of dangerous instability.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="280">
						<term target="#ifelt">I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly</term>

						<p>We have already witnessed this physical manifestation of deep psychological conflict in the cabin of Walton's ship, when

							thought of the Creature in II:1:6. When we next observe the phenomenon, it will be the Creature who gnashes his teeth in
							response to the frustration of all his hopes (III:3:13 and note). The prototype for this act is the Satan of Paradise

					</item>
					<item n="282">
						<term target="#ihaveend">I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions</term>
						<p>Even at this remove from the trial Victor unthinkingly puts his own claims to the fore, reminding us of his skill as a

						<p>For whatever reason of self-presentation or nostalgia, Mary Shelley here magnifies her love of and accessibility to an
							untrammelled natural environment. Her Scottish experiences occupied less than two years of her early adolescence. Prior to
							that time she was brought up in Somers Town, in that day located on the edge of the London metropolis, where she could
							divide her interests between the countryside to the north, upon which her father's house looked out, and the attractions
							of the city. Godwin's house itself was anything but rural, maintaining an intensely urban and intellectually sophisticated
							ambience throughout Mary Shelley's youth. There, as a child, she came into contact with dozens of the principal luminaries
							of British culture at the beginning of the nineteenth century. One of these was Samuel Taylor, whom she heard recite "The
							Rime of the Ancient Mariner," a poem of particular resonance for Frankenstein, where it is quoted twice—(see I:L2:6 and
							I:4:7)—and frequently functions allusively.</p>

						<term target="#ilovedhm">I loved with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds</term>
						<p>This reticence is exactly what friendship is intended to transcend, if we take Walton's notion of its value as a benchmark.
							He looks to an ideal friend "to regulate [his] mind" (I:L2:2). Even Victor, in the revised text, conceives the value of a
							friend as being "to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures" (I:L4:23). Victor's reserve, however, negates this function
							of friendship, suggesting a limit to how far it is able to surmount the barriers of what a later time might call
							ego-defences.</p>

						<term target="#imaginar">a succession of imaginary incidents</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's language here is resonant with the terms by which she describes the educational milieu within the
							Frankenstein circle. Thus, it cannot be accidental that she draws an implicit comparison between her own youthful career
							as a writer and that of her most imaginative character, Henry Clerval, who is described as smitten with a world of romance
							in both the 1818 (I:1:11) and 1831 (I:2:2) editions of the novel.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="287">
						<term target="#imaginat">My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me</term>
						<p>With an uncanny artistry that must be considered deliberate, in this and the next paragraph Mary Shelley internalizes
							within her own writing the imaginative process by which Victor Frankenstein is first swept along by his scientific
							advances ("my imagination was too much exalted," I:3:7 and note), then becomes concerned by their obsessiveness ("[it] had
							taken an irresistible hold of my imagination," I:3:11 and note), and finally finds himself haunted by his own terrifying
							creation ("I imagined that the monster seized me," I:4:15). Throughout the novel, although the power of the human
							imagination is universally underscored, its uses or effects are as much deeply questioned as they are celebrated.</p>
						<p>In her introduction Mary Shelley appears to be purposefully collapsing the customary distinction between the curiosity of
							the scientist and the creative afflatus of the writer, a design we see carried out as well in the novel itself. Following
							these introductory materials, we will turn immediately, as yet a third example of the same elemental process, to the
							imaginative enthusiasm with which Robert Walton foresees his polar explorations (I:L1:2). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="288">
						<term target="#imagine">a point of view to the imagination</term>
						<p>This diction, like the subtitle and the epigraph, is meant to drape Frankenstein with a seriousness of purpose not
							customary among popular gothic novels. To students of British Romanticism, it is language that is characteristic of Percy
							Bysshe Shelley's own practices in the prefatory matter to his poems. He frequently accentuates his attempt to transcend
							through imaginative means the normative, or "ordinary," thoughts and passions of humanity. See, for example, the first
							paragraph of the Preface to "Alastor" (published in March 1816) or his explanation of the use of dramatic imagery in the
							Preface to The Cenci (1820). The reader will discover that the uses of the imagination are likewise to become a recurring
							theme in the novel.</p>

					<item n="289">
						<term target="#inaction">spent in inaction</term>
						<p>Beaufort's introverted withdrawal is of a type similar to further and more conspicuous examples we will encounter later in

					</item>
					<item n="290">
						<term target="#incompreh">incomprehensible to me</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's point seems to be that, whatever Victor's enthusiasm for the sciences, at this point in his adolescent

					</item>
					<item n="291">
						<term target="#increase">increase of misery</term>
						<p>Although the discussion may seem to have moved far from the structural center of the novel, the resonance of this phrase
							reminds us of the glorious ambitions driving both Walton and Victor Frankenstein and of how Victor's aspiration that "many
							happy and excellent natures would owe their being to" him (I:3:8) has been disastrously subverted into a murder and
							miscarriage of justice implicating both his Creature and himself.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="292">
						<term target="#indeed">indeed every human being</term>
						<p>Victor here openly deprives the Creature of a human essence and thus of the requirements of human sympathy. In other words,
							even as he upholds Justine's innocence against a legal system that indicts her on circumstantial evidence, he himself
							embodies the fundamental principles of a dehumanized injustice against which he will inveigh.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="293">
						<term target="#inexorbl">inexorable fate</term>
						<p>As at other key points in the revision of the novel, Victor's inflation of rhetoric as he invokes fate calls attention at
							once to his self-pity and his sense that he lacked any options that could have altered his destiny. As we turn to the
							second of the three parts of Frankenstein, that conclusion will be seriously interrogated.</p>

						<term target="#ingolst">Ingolstadt</term>
						<p>Ingolstadt, Germany, lies on the Danube and Schutter Rivers, 45 miles north of Munich and 30 miles south of Regensburg.</p>
						<p>Records of this cultural and commercial center of Bavaria go back to the beginning of the 9th century C.E. The city is
							surrounded by fourteenth-century walls, and is distinguished by a ducal castle (1420), the Cathedral of Our Lady
							(1425-1500), the Church of Maria de Victoria (1732-36). For centuries it was the seat of the Dukes of Bavaria, who
							transferred to Munich only in 1800, leaving Ingolstadt a relatively small provincial city (current population c. 90,000).
							The brief account in the 4th edition of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica (1797), written before this event and roughly
							contemporary with the timeframe of the novel, gives no hint of the town's impending displacement.</p>
						<p>A university was founded there in 1472, although it was moved to Landshut in 1800 and then to Munich in 1826. At the height
							of its importance in the Renaissance the city and the university were a stronghold of Counter-Reformation orthodoxy.</p>
						<p>In the eighteenth century an intellectual fervor of an opposite sort was centered there, when a secret society, an offspin
							of the Masons self-styled the Illuminati, was formed in Ingolstadt to consider the means to a revolutionary reconstruction
							of European society. Although their actual effect was small, they constituted an easy target for reactionary agitators who
							traced the debacle of the French Revolution to this improbable source. The main purveyors of this reactionary propaganda
							were John Playfair's Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe (1797) and the Abbé
							Augustin Barruel's Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire du Jacobinisme (1797). The latter volume was read by both Mary and
							Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1814-1815.</p>
						<p>These and other similar works were the basis for a novel, with a long episode set in Bavaria and drawing upon the secret
							society of Illuminati, written by Thomas Jefferson Hogg, Shelley's roommate at Oxford, Memoirs of Prince Alexy Haimatoff
							(1813). Shelley wrote the notice of the novel that appeared in the Critical Review in December 1814. It is thus impossible
							for Mary not to have been well aware of the political contexts in which she inserts her youthful protagonist.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="295">
						<term target="#injunct">father's dying injunction</term>
						<p>To disobey such an injunction, with its almost institutionalized cultural sanction, is to commit a transgression of
							substance, preparing us for other instances of conflicting goals between son and father—Victor and Alphonse Frankenstein,
							Felix De Lacey and his blind father—on other narrative levels of the novel, as well as other, much greater transgressions
							for the sake of knowledge. The fact that Walton is orphaned at a young age introduces yet another common theme of the
							novel.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="296">
						<term target="#inspired">inspirited by this wind</term>
						<p>What Wordsworth calls the "correspondent breeze" (The Prelude, I.35), the dynamic response of the human imagination to
							natural or divine inspiration, is a frequent theme among the first generation of English Romantic poets (particularly
							Coleridge and Wordsworth) and has been much discussed by critics (see, for example, M. H. Abrams, "The Correspondent
							Breeze: A Romantic Metaphor"). Closer to home, the same correspondence will become the motivating force in Percy Bysshe
							Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind" in 1819. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="297">
						<term target="#instead">instead of doing harm</term>
						<p>This phrase is inserted in so unobtrusive a manner as to pass almost without a reader's comprehension of its drift. The
							unmistakeable suggestion, however, is that the course of Victor's and his family's lives might have been altered if he and
							Clerval had been candid about the depth and cause of his illness. Yet, Clerval is at no fault, since he, too, is kept in
							the dark. Only Victor at this point could alter the narrative logic he has set in motion: among its other aspects, his
							illness constitutes a deep refuge from both reality and his responsibility for its nature.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="298">
						<term target="#insurrec">a state of insurrection and turmoil</term>
						<p>As with many of her interpolations in 1831, Mary Shelley here seems intent on an early establishment of a pattern that will
							reappear and become more intense in its significance as the novel progresses. Such psychological turmoil will produce a
							state of nightmare and half-sleep on the night after the Creature is created (I:5:3) and will reveal itself in Volumes 2
							and 3 by a chronic and, in the end, debilitating fever.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="299">
						<term target="#intimate">intimate friend of my father</term>
						<p>This is the second close male friendship in as many lines (see the note to "friend"). Since friendships reflect character
							in this novel, the intimacy Alphonse Frankenstein feels for Beaufort (I:1:2) and the elder Clerval (I:2:5), both of whom
							share a sternness of resolve and a narrow preoccupation with business success, may suggest a comparable rigidity, or at
							least a stiffness and lack of flexibility, in Victor's father. Victor will himself shortly note these traits in respect to
							how his father oversees his development (I:1:16). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="300">

						<p>Simple etiquette might dictate Victor's withdrawal, so as not to intrude his relatively unfamiliar presence on Justine's

							of his personality as is the egotism that enfuses his private meditation. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="305">
						<term target="#iseeby">I see by your eagerness</term>
						<p>Victor's highly conscious sense of the effect of his narrative, from now on, will become a continuing motif (see also, for
							instance, I:3:13). That he is self-conscious as an artist may be thought a normal attribute of Romantic texts. But Mary
							Shelley may have a more specific object in mind that that of fitting smoothly into her culture's expectations. Victor's
							conscious manipulation of his reader (Walton and, beyond Walton, us) continually intrudes on the supposition of its truth. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="306">
						<term target="#iseethem">I see them still</term>
						<p>What is it Mary Shelley sees? The plural suggests that the antecedent is "realities." But the realities she remarks are
							those of Victor's bedchamber as well as her own. Like hers it is described as barely illuminated "by the dim and yellow
							light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window-shutters" (see I:4:3). As in the previous paragraph, the
							novelist seems deliberately to conflate her experiences with those of her fictional protagonist. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="307">
						<term target="#italian">an Italian gentleman</term>
						<p>The shadowy presence of Italy behind this narrative has not been explained. It may reflect discussions about moving there
							that Mary and Percy Shelley were having while she was writing the novel: shortly after its publication they did, indeed,
							emigrate to Italy. On a less personal note, however, the presence of Italy does extend the geographical bounds of the
							pan-European setting to the south, just as the opening in Russia extends them far to the north. Safie, it should be noted,
							also travels north from Italy (Leghorn-Livorno), to the De Lacey's cottage in Germany, but without male protection
							(II:6:19). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="308">
						<term target="#itwason">It was on a dreary night of November</term>
						<p>This was the first line Mary Shelley wrote in the composition of the novel, according to the account she gave of its

					</item>
					<item n="309">
						<term target="#itwasona">It was on a dreary night in November</term>
						<p>This is the opening of the fourth chapter (I:4:1) in the original edition, which lends weight to one's sense that what Mary
							Shelley describes as her "waking dream" bridges the room in which she conceived her horror story with the bedroom in which
							Victor encounters his living Creature in terror. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="310">
						<term target="#iwasawre">I was a wretch</term>
						<p>The connotations of wretchedness for Victor are markedly different than they are for Justine, who has similarly called
							herself a wretch five paragraphs earlier (I:7:29). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="311">
						<term target="#iwasled">I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced</term>
						<p>Victor's choice of language—passive verbs—suggests once again that he believes (or hopes to convince Walton) that some
							force other than his own volition guides his investigation. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="312">
						<term target="#iwasnow">I was now alone</term>
						<p>A sentence with an ominous sound, resonating throughout the novel, back to Walton's sense of isolation in Archangel,
							(I:L2:2), his ice-bound ship (I:L4:2), the discovery of Victor marooned on an ice-floe (I:L4:6 and note) and to the
							enforced isolation in which his Creature is forced to pass his entire existence (II:3:1 and II:8:4). Of particular weight
							in this diction is its reflection of famous lines in Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" to which Walton has already
							referred suggestively. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="313">
						<term target="#iwept">I wept like a child</term>
						<p>Victor's account of himself in these paragraphs testifies to a person on the brink of becoming unhinged—almost paralyzed,
							needing two days at Lausanne to recover a sense of purpose, invoking his native landscape in effusive tears. Such immature
							behavior could be a sign of the fears he has repressed for a year and a half, and certainly for the reader their emotional
							heightening portends some new disaster about to reveal itself. At the same time, if we wish to assume that this is a novel
							with pretensions to being realistic, and not merely gothic in its representation, we might wish here to turn our attention
							from the ominous to the psychological. These are all symptoms of a personality that has barely survived its breakdown. The
							year of convalesence has offered tranquillity, but does not appear to have altered the essential trauma Victor has
							suffered in the Creature's birth. Throughout the rest of the novel, Mary Shelley adroitly poises her protagonist on the
							edge of madness, and the readers of his behavior (a class that should include Walton as well as us) can never be quite
							sure on what side of the line he stands. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="314">
						<term target="#joinenem">join with my enemies</term>
						<p>In the courtroom (I:7:7) Justine had surmised that she had no enemies on earth. After a verdict that is untrue to her
							character and her actions, she sees nothing but enemies around her. The norms of her world are now wholly upended. The
							diction accentuates the extent to which the social constructions upon which we depend for our well-being are arbitrary and
							at the same time fragile. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="315">
						<term target="#judge">through his interest he might become a judge</term>
						<p>This inconspicuous detail seems carefully planted by Mary Shelley to reveal how closely tied-in Alphonse Frankenstein is to
							what will soon reveal itself to be a corrupt system of justice in Geneva. It also subtly suggests how the governing elite
							in the patriarchal Genevan society protects itself, a situation already alluded to at the beginning (I:1:1) of Victor's
							narrative. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="316">
						<term target="#june">June</term>
						<p>The summer months will allow Walton to proceed north with expedition under the midnight sun and with less fear of
							obstruction by ice masses than might be the case at an earlier point in the year. As we are soon aware, however, if Walton
							in his romantic enthusiasm hopes for easy passage he has radically miscalculated the treacherous conditions of the Arctic. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="317">
						<term target="#justice">a sense of justice</term>
						<p>We are to recall that the Frankenstein family tradition has been to enter into public service, most particularly acting in
							the capacity of syndics, or magistrates (I:1:1). Thus Alphonse Frankenstein's sense of rectitude may be advanced here as a
							standard whereby to measure that of his son, also that of his society. At the same time, as a man who is so completely
							bound by the system he has served that he cannot conceive that it might act wrongly, or who is so unprepared to recognize
							injustice as a potential outcome of the weighing of purely circumstantial evidence, Alphonse Frankenstein, the
							representative citizen of Geneva, may have so narrow a perspective on truth that, even were it to appear self-evident, it
							might still never be wholly just. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="318">
						<term target="#justice1">the justice of our judges</term>
						<p>Alphonse Frankenstein's complacency stems from his sense of a professional brotherhood with these men, for, it must be
							remembered from the beginning (I:1:1) of Victor's narrative, that Alphonse too has sat in the syndic's chair, as had his
							ancestors before him. Mary Shelley stresses not only the tight-knit patriarchy of Genevan society, but also, more
							narrowly, the ease with which the system can implicate all its members in an act of injustice, even when, as is the case
							with the Frankenstein family, they are convinced of the innocence of the accused. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="319">
						<term target="#justinil">Justine was very ill</term>
						<p>As Caroline Frankenstein contracted scarlet fever from tending Elizabeth, so it would appear that Justine contracted it
							from her but because of her youth survived. The selflessless of feminine minstration is quietly underscored. So is the
							general vulnerablity of human beings, which should remind the reader that it is this susceptibility to disease and
							dissolution that Victor had sought through his researches to ameliorate. </p>

						<term target="#knowledg">knowledge</term>
						<p>In explicitly linking in the same sentence the idea of knowledge with a serpent's venom, Mary Shelley seems to be

						<p>Percy Bysshe Shelley, feigning the author's being abroad, handled the negotiations for a contract to publish Frankenstein,

							himself suggested such an avenue to the Shelleys. Whatever the case, Murray declined the manuscript, upon whose refusal
							Shelley reverted to his own publisher Charles Ollier. When Ollier, too, declined to accept the book, the Shelleys were in
							something of a quandary. They resolved it by turning to a publishing house—Lackington's—that had a large inventory and
							specialized somewhat in sensational materials. In the two-page advertisement sheet accompanying the novel when it was
							published in 1818 are representative works that the Lackington firm apparently thought might interest the reader of the
							novel: these include Francis Barrett, The Magus; or Celestial Intelligences; a complete System of Occult Philosophy, being

						<term target="#lakecomo">on the shores of the lake of Como</term>
						<p>Today, Switzerland and Italy share access to Lake Como as they do to the larger Lago Maggiore somewhat to its west. The
							Shelleys and Claire Clairmont stopped at Lake Como in the spring of 1818 and, they claimed, would have settled there had
							they been able to find suitable lodgings. In the event, their fortunes led them further south, and Mary Shelley herself

						<term target="#language">acquainted with more languages</term>
						<p>Walton's inability to speak other languages would presumably magnify his sense of isolation after almost four months in
							Russia. Generally speaking, in this pan-European novel Mary Shelley conveniently allows her characters, wherever they come
							from or are educated, to communicate freely across national borders. The exception is the Arab Safie, who must be taught
							by the De Laceys to speak their language. Since the book chosen for that end is Volney's Les Ruines, ou meditations sur
							les revolutions des empires (II:5:14), she and the Creature who secretly participates in her lessons are educated in
							French. French is likewise the language of the Frankenstein household, but Victor, in I:1:12, recounts his education in
							Latin, Greek, English and German: he receives his scientific education in German, in the heart of Bavaria at Ingolstadt,
							and is adept enough in English to negotiate his way around Scotland and the Orkney Islands. While in prison there his
							delirious ravings revert to French, which only Mr. Kirwin the magistrate is able to understand (III:4:11). When he hails
							Walton, the mariner will tell his sister in I:L4:7, Victor does so in English "although with a foreign accent." By the
							time the Creature and Walton meet one another, however, Mary Shelley finesses her otherwise careful observation of
							linguistic difference in favor of an unimpeded confrontation; yet Victor's concern that his narration be faithfully
							recorded (III:WC:4) and his warning that the Creature's eloquence should be distrusted (III:7:25) emphasize radical
							instability and the problematic of translation as inherent in language. </p>

							eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Although Erasmus Darwin's scientific take on the linkage—that it is somehow to
							be explained by basic chemistry rather than the mechanics of physics—is wrong, what impels it is not. Indeed, though it is
							pedestrian in manner, the lengthy twelfth note to The Temple of Nature is nothing short of visionary. There Darwin first
							extensively expounds the dynamics of electricity, then turns to the similar processes of magnetism, bifurcated
							figuratively between arctic and antarctic poles, and in the end links the two with a rudimentary conception of atomic
							physics (only to be expounded by John Dalton in the decade after Darwin's death), and with the third component of the

						<p>The sexist stereotypes in which this tribute is expressed can be (as they have been) laid at Mary Shelley's doorstep. But

							out of its way to separate the author from her characters (I:Pref:2).</p>
						<p>Leaving Victor's perspective to the side, we may, as readers, surely honor the affectionate warmth with which Elizabeth
							assumes her nurturing domestic role and melds her small community together. We might wish, however, to suspend judgment on

						<p>Perhaps, however, there is an alternate, less dire, way of reading this condition, as reflecting Mary Shelley's own

						<term target="#lovedbea">My father loved Beaufort</term>
						<p>The reader cannot help noticing how insistently this theme returns to the surface of the text. In the abstract it is almost
							an epitome of the way in which Mary Shelley creates the structure of her novel as a nest of Chinese boxes (or Russian
							dolls). Here, Victor Frankenstein begins a narrative about his life by emphasizing his father's profound affection for
							another man, an account he gives to a young explorer whose deepest emotional need is for such a friendship. Walton, in
							turn, feels he has found the fulfillment of this need in Victor, and Victor himself tells this narrative out of a sense of
							duty to that friendship. Duty likewise drove his father in his attempt to discover and rescue Beaufort. At the periphery
							of this replicated order is the central location in which the narrative unfolds, a ship isolated in treacherous northern
							waters where the all-male crew stands on its duty on behalf of one another. In the end harsh circumstances will force
							Walton to respond against his will to his own duty to those men. </p>

						<term target="#magnet">secret of the magnet</term>
						<p>A major hazard of navigation in polar regions was a wholesale distortion of magnetic instruments caused by the proximity of

							which to adjust for such distortion. In 1831 Sir John Ross for the first time located the magnetic pole, which is distinct
							from the actual geographical pole, in the far northern reaches of Canadian territory. His account of his supposed
							discovery bears an enthusiasm and rhetorical inflation little different from the tone Walton adopts here. From the
							evidence gathered in the Parry and Ross expeditions of 1827 and 1829-31, respectively, Michael Faraday was, indeed, to do
							just that, as promulgated in what became known as Faraday's Law. A different desire seems to be drawing the novel's second
							searcher for the north pole, and the one who will presumably discover its exact site a full century before Commodore
							Parry, Victor Frankenstein's Creature. In Walton's fourth letter to his sister (I:L4:3) he innocently recounts being
							passed by this figure on his way to the pole. See also "wondrous power" above. </p>

							more directly engaged in increasing the actual store of happiness in the world, whereas the men in general attach
							themselves to a theoretical concept that rules their destiny with often destructive results. Justine's emphasis on a

						<p>Why Mary Shelley should begin the chapter by deliberately obliterating all suspense is a good question not easily answered.

							of the polity of Geneva. Since Geneva's republican government (I:1:1 and note) and its softening of class hierarchies
							(I:5:3 and note) have already been admiringly stressed, we might expect from Mary Shelley's political allegiances to
							witness a trial conducted in ideal circumstances. But that is far from being the case. Instead of a jury of peers, a panel
							of male magistrates decides Justine's lot, and to exonerate a verdict reached by only circumstantial evidence they employ
							the coercive power of the church to extort a false confession. Victor's private denunciation of these proceedings does not
							indict his own society or consider the extent to which his own family, that long line of syndics, is complicit in an

						<term target="#moral">the moral relations of things</term>
						<p>In distinguishing so sharply between scientific and moral arenas of thought, or between metaphysics and ethics as branches

							responsibility for knowledge. His abstract nouns are themselves revealing: he is engaged by the "substance" or the
							"spirit," whereas what impels Clerval are the "relations" of things. Clerval implicitly looks at the universe in terms of
							communities, which is to say, in the largest sense, as political relations; Victor concentrates on individual matters in

							elopement with the married Percy Bysshe Shelley not long after her return from this second residence ruptured her

						<p>Here Victor has not only demonized his Creature but has cast him in an adversarial role, not acknowledging at this point

							consequences from this trait before we have sufficient information to corroborate his view or, alternatively, to question
							how well his potentiality for violence has been displaced into other pursuits. As he speaks, after all, he is still on a

						<p>The major symptom of a nervous fever in the eighteenth century is a total want of strength. Thus, Victor's confinement to

							written, it is not easy to transpose Victor's disorder into a modern equivalent. Certainly, it would seem to originate in

						<p>This seemingly offhand sentimentalism is in actuality an exceedingly subtle move on Mary Shelley's part, suggestive of how

							Victor Frankenstein, deeply aware from his scientific experiments that electricity achieves its dynamic energy from the
							interplay of polarities, here sees in the heavens an example of that polarity writ large and, as it were, iconically—as
							elemental warfare. He will almost immediately transfer that icon into an earthly counterpart, a permanent struggle between
							positive and negative poles, by which he respectively denominates himself and his Creature as good and evil, as figures of
							God and Satan. Thus, almost unconsciously adopting a quasi-divine sign, Victor reinforces the animosity that allowed him
							conveniently to categorize, externalize, and thus alienate as Other the Creature whom he brought to life and then left to

						<p>This is, indeed, the case, and this fact deeply complicates the novel. The Creature incriminates Justine not because he

							sympathies, he presumes, would be blocked in his presence. Without thinking, he too victimizes Justine, and he does it on

						<term target="#nogeneva">I paid no visit to Geneva</term>
						<p>The trip home, as Victor testified in the preceding chapter (I:2:8), would doubtless be long and arduous, but his passing

					</item>
					<item n="405">
						<term target="#nonebut">none but the devil</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley characteristically complicates the moral lines here. Even as Justine is called a "monster," she resorts to her

							terminology as Victor does is a nice irony. But if we then seriously accept his own claim of ultimate responsibility for
							this debacle, Justine's invocation of the devil is tantamount to an ironic accusation against Victor, implicitly inverting

					<item n="406">
						<term target="#noneever">the misery that I then endured</term>
						<p>In contrast to the shared grief and affection of Elizabeth and Justine, Victor has immured himself in a barricaded

							the complementary, though ironic text, in Satan's desire to escape what he considers a necessitated, automatic response to
							God's genesis of spiritual and corporeal being: </p>      lifted up so high<lb/> I sdeined subjection, and thought one

						<p> In 1812, three years before the summer in which Frankenstein was conceived, Percy Bysshe Shelley published the first of

						<term target="#ownspirt">my own spirit</term>
						<p>The doppelgänger or double is a feature of gothic tales throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century. As a literary
							type, however, the double can have more than sensational uses. Within a year of Frankenstein's publication, for instance,
							Percy Bysshe Shelley incorporated the figure within the first act of Prometheus Unbound, where the Earth tells Prometheus
							of a second realm of potentiality that shadows the actual world: </p>
						<p>     Ere Babylon was dust,<lb/> The Magus Zoroaster, my dead child,<lb/> Met his own image walking in the garden.<lb/> That
							apparition, sole of men, he saw.<lb/> -- I.191-95</p>
						<p>Mary Shelley, too, is concerned with potentiality, both its development and its thwarting, which she pursues on a number of
							different levels in this novel, projecting the doubling on moral and psychological, but also on mythic and theological,
							grounds. Up to this point in the novel the theme of doubling has been only hinted at in the intensities of male friendship
							we have encountered. Here, in directly introducing doubling as a psychological condition, her basic stress is on the

						<term target="#paracels">Paracelsus</term>
						<p>Paracelsus, pseudonym of Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493-1541, physician, alchemist, and mystic.</p>
						<p>Little is known of Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, who took the name Paracelsus for himself. He was the son to a
							physician, and at the age of sixteen entered Basel University where he studied alchemy. He later worked in the mines at
							Tirol, where he gained first-hand knowledge of the properties of metals.</p>
						<p>By his early thirties he had become famous as a physician in Basel, where he gave lectures on medicine. His disputes with
							the authorities in 1528 were symptomatic of his abrasive and arrogant disputing style, and led to his expulsion from
							Basel. In the last year of his life he settled in Salzburg.</p>
						<p>He argued that human life could be created through alchemy, and believed in the long-sought-after elixir vitae as a means
							of infinitely prolonging life free from disease. His lasting contribution to science is the rejection of Galen's humoral
							theory of illness.</p>
						<p>Percy Bysshe Shelley listed Paracelsus (along with Agrippa) among his favorite writers in a discussion with Godwin in 1812. </p>

						<term target="#passage">passage near the pole</term>
						<p>The Northwest Passage, and (to a lesser extent because less practicable) the Northeast Passage, were major objects of
							exploration in the later eighteenth century, renewed after peace returned to Europe in 1815 with the strong backing of the
							British government as seemingly being crucial to Britain's domination of the seas and to the commerce that held together
							the Empire. As with other scientific aspects of Mary Shelley's novel, this ambition of Walton's has a large cultural and
							political resonance.</p>
						<p>Before the creation of the Suez Canal (completed in 1869) and the Panama Canal (begun 1882, completed 1914), navigation
							between the hemispheres was a complicated process, involving lengthy trips around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa or
							the Cape of Horn in South America, both notoriously difficult to navigate. Explorers turned their attention to the north,
							in the hopes of finding a means of sailing from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Two major paths, a Northeast Passage and a
							Northwest Passage, were sought for centuries, with minimal success. Northeast Passage The searches for a Northeast Passage
							-- one from the north of Scandinavia, into the Arctic Basin, and along the north coast of Asia -- began in the late
							sixteenth century. In 1596, fifteen Dutch sailors, led by Jacob van Heemskerck and Willem Barents, tried to complete the
							Northeast Passage, only to be trapped in June near the northcape of Novaya Zemlya. The sailors were trapped there for
							months in an ad-hoc dwelling built from driftwood they called Het Behouden Huys (the Saved House; the site was discovered
							in 1871). Their ordeal was described in print by one of the sailors, Gerrit de Veer, in 1598.</p>
						<p>Most of the searches for a Northeast Passage, though, were carried out by Russia, which hoped to increase the profitability
							of its fur trade by finding a more direct route from the Atlantic to the Pacific. By the end of the 16th century the
							Russians had established a commercial route via the Arctic to the fur-trading centre of Mangazeya on the Taz River in
							western Siberia. But a polar passage was still greatly desired. Several archaelogical digs in Taymyr in the 1940s provide
							evidence of an unsuccessful Russian mission to sail the Northeast Passage in or shortly after 1619.</p>
						<p>By 1645, Russian trading vessels were routinely sailing between the Kolyma and Lena Rivers along the Arctic coast. In 1648,
							Semyon Dezhnyov, a Cossack, was the first European to sail what is now called the Bering Strait. He sailed east from the
							Kolyma toward the Anadyr basin, believed to be rich in furs. Although several of his ships were destroyed, Dezhnyov
							reached Cape Olyutorsky, from which he traveled overland to the north to the Anadyr.</p>
						<p>Dezhnyov's voyage aroused interest in exploration in Russia. In the 1720s, Peter the Great authorized a number of voyages
							to the area he had first sailed. It was Vitus Bering, an officer of Danish birth who served in the Russian navy, who made
							the most important discoveries. In 1728 he discovered St. Lawrence Island and sailed through the Bering Strait (named for
							him) and well into the Arctic Ocean, although, because he did not see Alaska, he did not realize how far he had in fact
							sailed. Four years later, two Russians, Ivan Fyodorov and Mikhail Gvozdev, were the first Europeans to see Alaska.</p>
						<p>The discovery of a passage to the Pacific led to the greatest operation in the history of polar exploration, the Great
							Northern Expedition, which began in 1733 and continued through 1743. Vitus Bering led the expeditions, carried out by
							nearly a thousand men, many of whom died from cold, scurvy, or other accidents. Such setbacks caused the Russian
							government to withdraw its support, but the mission was successful in producing sixty-two maps of the Arctic coast from
							Archangelsk to Cape Bolshoy Baranov. The only other Russian expedition in the next few decades was carried out by Nikita
							Shalaurov, a trader without government support, whose party was killed by the cold in 1764.</p>
						<p>After Captain James Cook sailed from the Pacific north through the Bering Strait as far as Cape North (now Cape Shmidt),
							Catherine the Great renewed Russian interest in polar expeditions. Catherine hired Joseph Billings, a member of Cook's
							crew, to travel overland from St. Lawrence Bay to Nizhnekolymsk in the search for a gap between Chaun Bay and the Bering
							Strait. The gap was not discovered, however, until 1823, when Lieutenant Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel successfully
							navigated and surveyed Kolyuchin Bay. Northwest Passage Only five years after Columbus discovered the Americas, England's
							Henry VII sent John Cabot in search of a northwest route from Europe to the Orient. Jacques Cartier and Gaspar and Miguel
							Corte-Real similarly explored Canada in hopes of discovering such a passage.</p>
						<p>Navigators began searching in earnest for a water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific in the sixteenth century with Sir
							Martin Frobisher (1535-1594); subsequent explorers included John Davis, Henry Hudson (who in 1609 explored the New York
							river and Canadian bay that now bear his name), and William Baffin. In 1768, Samuel Hearne set out on a two-year walking
							expedition, which took him as far as the shore of the Arctic Ocean, but he found no passage.</p>
						<p>With the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, England, in an attempt to secure its naval superiority and the enormous
							commercial advantage that came with it, began what eventually became a decades-long endeavor to discover the Northwest
							passage. The Passage eluded explorers through Mary Shelley's lifetime; as late as 1845, Sir John Franklin set out on an
							expedition that ended in the loss of the entire expedition of 129 men. The Passage was discovered only in the 1850s by Sir
							Robert McClure, who led one of the forty search parties that sought information on Franklin's expedition. McClure's
							expedition was icebound for nearly two years, and was rescued by Captain Henry Kellett; Kellett's ship was in turn
							icebound for another year.</p>
						<p>The Passage itself runs through the Arctic Islands of Canada some 500 miles north of the Arctic Circle, only 1,200 miles
							from the North Pole. The 900-mile east-west water route runs from Baffin Island to the Beaufort Sea through a field of
							thousands of icebergs, and thence into the Pacific through the Bering Strait, which separates Siberia from Alaska.</p>
						<p>Even after the Passage was discovered, it took another half century for a single ship to sail through it: the Norwegian
							explorer Roald Amundsen made the passage between 1903 and 1906. Although the centuries-long search for the route was
							inspired by the desire for a more efficient trading route, the first successful commercial navigation came only in 1969,
							after the discovery of oil in Alaska. </p>

						<term target="#physiogn">Physiognomy</term>
						<p>Physiognomy is a pseudoscientific discipline that purports to find correspondences between psychological attributes and

							Magnus wrote extensively about physiognomy and the mixture of humors in the body and mind. As Mary Shelley would have been
							well aware, this discipline was resurrected in the later eighteenth century by a countryman of Victor Frankenstein's,
							Johann Kaspar Lavater (11 November 1741 - 2 January 1801), a resident of Zurich. His Essays on Physiognomy (1775-1778;
							translated into English in 1789-1798) made him world-famous, inspiring many a quack psychologist of his day, and many
							further days across the ensuing century. More seriously relevant for the context of Frankenstein might be the title of an
							earlier work of Lavater's, Geheimes Tagebuch von einem Beobachter seiner selbst (1772-73), which was translated into

						<p>Elizabeth's conformity to her female lot, staying in Geneva rather than traveling to Ingolstadt to care for Victor,
							spreading contentment around her, being content herself with "trifling occupations," has been a source of irritation to
							many critics who, from this and similar evidence, see the novel as enforcing a mindless domesticity as the only
							alternative to the overreaching of the male protagonists. Yet, to take this passage at face value as the expression not of
							Elizabeth but of Mary Shelley, is not really defensible as a critical reading. Elizabeth's blandness is an aspect of her
							character. Her satisfaction with, broadly speaking, the beautiful is certainly an aspect of the female role in this
							period, but in no way does her author resemble her in this narrow predeliction. Nor does the novel unquestionably
							reinforce it. After all, the first direct view we as readers have had of this serene landscape was as a violent
							thunderstorm burst from over the Jura mountains (I:1:22). When in the second volume Victor enters into, instead of gazing

						<p>Pliny the Elder was the author of Historia naturalis, the principal compendium of scientific knowledge for the original

							translated the encyclopedic work on metallurgy, pharmacology, zoology, anthropology, and psychology into English.</p>
						<p>The Natural History is the only one of Pliny's seven writings to survive antiquity entire. That work in thirty-seven books
							was an attempt to survey all natural knowledge systematically in an unadorned style, and his methodical approach and
							careful regard for citation make it a model of ancient scientific research, in spite of Pliny's superstitious beliefs in
							magic. Book 1 is an introduction to the entire work. Book 2 addresses cosmology and astronomy; books 3 through 6 are on
							geography. The next thirteen books treat biology: zoology in books 7 through 11, botany in books 12 through 19. Books 20
							through 22 address medicine; books 23 through 37 are concerned with metals, minerals, and precious stones.</p>
						<p>Pliny's authority was comparable to Aristotle's throughout the Middle Ages; only in 1492 did he come under attack in
							Niccolò Leoniceno's catalogue of his errors. From then on its influence waned by degrees, and few regarded it seriously as

						<term target="#polidori">John William Polidori</term>
						<p> John William Polidori (7 September 1795-24 August 1821) was the son of Gaetano Polidori, a Tuscan man of letters and at
							one point secretary to the dramatist Vittorio Alfieri, who had emigrated to England where he married a Miss Pierce and
							settled in London as a teacher of Italian. John was educated at Ampleforth, Yorkshire -- a Roman Catholic school -- and
							subsequently matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied medicine, writing a dissertation -- Dissertatio
							medica inauguralis, quaedam de morbo, oneirodynia dicto, complectens ...  -- on the highly romantic subject of
							sleep-walking and receiving his medical degree at the remarkably young age of 19. The next year, still not yet legally an
							adult, he accompanied Lord Byron on his excursion to Geneva. That Byron quickly tired of his protege's immaturity is well
							known, but Polidori was, indeed, quite young and inexperienced to be in such company.</p>
						<p>Polidori left Switzerland for Italy in September 1816, where he traveled for nearly a year, returning to England the
							following spring, at which point he sought to practice medicine in Norwich. But he was unhappy in his profession and
							thought, instead, of turning to law. In the meantime, perhaps as his own response to the heady literary summer he had
							passed on the continent, he began a short, but productive literary career. His first work was an extension of his interest
							in psychology, An essay on the source of positive pleasure (1818). The following year came a volume of poems -- Ximenes,
							the wreath: and other poems -- the novel Ernestus Berchtold, and the short story, "The Vampyre," which, unfortunately, was
							passed off as the production of Lord Byron when it was published in the New Monthly Magazine. When he found the work being
							published under a separate imprint, Polidori went to some lengths to claim the work as his own, but the scandal of
							imposture dogged him thereafter. His final work, Sketches Illustrative of the Manners and Costumes of France, Switzerland,
							and Italy, was published in 1821 under the pseudonym of Richard Bridgens. That August, purportedly as the result of
							contracting a gambling debt he could not honor, he committed suicide by drinking prussic acid. He was 25 years old. </p>

							second of these strands in the section on Prometheus he wrote for his children's book, The Pantheon, or, Ancient History
							of the Gods of Greece and Rome, which he published under the pseudonymn Edward Baldwin in 1806. Mary Shelley's novel
							unifies all strands of the myth in a complex, multifaceted form. Its "modernity" for the second decade of the nineteenth
							century may apply broadly to revolutionary developments in political and scientific arenas over the previous generation

						<p>The language, tinged with eroticism, is suggestive of the narcissistic dimensions of Victor's preoccupation with his
							knowledge and the power that might stem from it. Johnson, in his 1755 Dictionary, becomes loquacious in his definition of

						<p>Once again, as in the previous chapter (see I:6:25), the question is raised of how one can objectively measure sanity in

						<term target="#regulate">regulate my mind</term>
						<p>This diction may appear strange to modern ears, implying a notion of education as constriction. Probably, however, it would
							not have touched a contemporary in such a way. In Mary Shelley's day such regulation would have been construed as an
							adherence to a disciplined, systematic method of education. Still, regulation must be a means to a perceived end. In this
							respect, we may take the contrasting image of Victor Frankenstein—"Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my
							fate (I:1:15)—as quietly but insistently ironic. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="461">
						<term target="#remorse">the greatest remorse</term>
						<p>Surely, the reader wonders that Victor's remorse should be at this point so limited in its focus. Mary Shelley's exposing
							of his naivete seems intended to plant anticipations of a dramatic irony, with a concomitant enlargement of the field of
							Victor's guilt, yet to be revealed. </p>

						<term target="#repub">republican institutions</term>
						<p>As at the beginning of the first chapter (I:1:1), the democratic institutions of Switzerland serve Mary Shelley as a foil
							to those of her own country. Especially at this time, under the reactionary rule of its Tory government, "republican" was
							a pejorative term. Mary Shelley shrewdly mitigates her affront to the current critical climate at home by tying the term
							to the respectable context of Switzerland. Still, in its quiet way, the word is an affront. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="464">
						<term target="#republic">republic</term>
						<p>Switzerland was the single self-governing democracy in Europe in the later eighteenth century. Although England sported
							liberal political ideals as a factor distinguishing the nation from the rest of Europe, in practice its long battle
							against the French and Napoleon had fostered a conservative reaction in which "republican" and "jacobin" were virtually
							synonymous terms of opprobrium. This was particularly the case in the years after Waterloo when, without an external enemy
							by which to rally the nation and, experiencing a severe recession as a result of its rapid and radical demobilization, the
							government was fearful of any expression of political dissent and began to prosecute broadly to suppress it. Although
							Victor's emphasis on his family distinction seems a gesture toward the familiar hierarchical structures of English
							society, the fact that the first sentence of the novel as it presents itself ends with so defiant, if understated, an
							assertion of liberal political values indicates the presence of a submerged political viewpoint that observant readers
							will be able to detect throughout the novel. That its contemporary readers would have recognized this aspect of the novel
							is indicated by how strongly politics influenced its reviews, particularly the one that appeared in the conservative
							Quarterly Review. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="465">
						<term target="#resolute">resolution</term>
						<p>As with "courage," the martial virtue to which Mary Shelley here yokes "resolution," this word also evokes the
							characteristic diction of Milton's Satan. In arising to call his forces to assemble, he marks his agenda: </p>
						<p>     how we may henceforth most offend<lb/> Our enemy, our own loss how repair,<lb/> How overcome this dire calamity,<lb/>
							What reinforcement we may gain from hope,<lb/> If not what resolution from despair.<lb/> -- I.187-191</p>
						<p>When Satan ends the assembly by having his fallen legions endorse his plans to corrupt the garden of Eden, Milton's
							language emphasizes the force of his resolution.</p>
						<p>          Thus saying, rose<lb/> The Monarch, and prevented all reply;<lb/> Prudent, lest from his resolution raised,<lb/>
							Others among the chief might offer now,<lb/> Certain to be refused, what first they feared.<lb/> -- II.466-470</p>

					</item>
					<item n="466">
						<term target="#resolved">I resolved to remain silent</term>
						<p>As understandable as this resolve is (and, perhaps more important to the reader, as necessary to the plot line as it may
							be), still Victor's silence is fundamentally problematical on moral grounds, constituting a denial of his own
							responsibility and, through an absence of candor on both private and public levels, a failure of essential human sympathy
							and justice. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="467">
						<term target="#respectb">respectable parent</term>
						<p>Even as he honors Alphonse Frankenstein, Victor does so in terms that distance his father into something of an icon for the

						<term target="#restored">restored me to life</term>

					</item>
					<item n="469">
						<term target="#retribut">retribution</term>
						<p>This long passage, almost a tirade, was omitted from the third and later editions. It is one of the clear occasions where
							Mary Shelley reveals herself as her father's daughter, justifying the Quarterly Review's attack on her novel for its
							Godwinian politics. For Godwin's treatment of retribution, see Political Justice, Book VII ("Of Crimes and Punishments"),
							particularly Chapter 4, "Of the Application of Coercion." </p>

					</item>
					<item n="470">
						<term target="#returnig">I thought of returning</term>
						<p>Victor's life, as he narrates its events, is full of good intentions, roads not taken, and fatal postponements. A more

						<term target="#robert">Robert Walton</term>
						<p>Whether intentionally or from her inexperience as a writer of fiction, this is the only occasion in the entire novel where

							sea to take advantage of encountering a ship on its return to England, is simply initialed "R. W." Thereafter, he does not

						<p>Children's books on the subject of Robin Hood are common in the first two decades of the nineteenth century in England, and

							with his libertarian and populist associations, also retains a political connotation for Mary Shelley's culture,
							particularly in the representation of the eccentric antiquarian Joseph Ritson (1752-1803), whose Robin Hood; a collection
							of all the ancient poems, songs, and ballads now extant, relative to that celebrated English outlaw: to which are

						<term target="#roncesva">the heroes of Roncesvalles</term>
						<p>Why Mary Shelley felt it important to alter the legendary materials loved by Clerval is unknown. It may simply be dictated
							by a change in the conditions of her culture. Although Roland, the hero of Roncesvalles, is identical with the title
							character of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (one of the books specified in 1818), in this rendering Clerval's interest in him

						<term target="#scarlet">scarlet fever</term>
						<p>A highly contagious disease, usually encountered in childhood, caused by hemolytic streptococus. It is spread through the

							and gamma globulin have made it much less common in the twentieth century.</p>
						<p>Scarlet fever's onset is sudden (typically two to seven days after exposure), beginning with a sore throat, shivering, and
							a headache. It develops on the second day into a rash behind the ears, which spreads to the arms and legs. Thomas
							Sydenham, a physician of the late seventeenth century, describes its symptoms thus: "The skin is marked with small, red
							spots, more frequent, more diffuse, and more red than in measles. These last two or three days. They then disappear,
							leaving the skin covered with brawny squamulae [scales], as if powdered with meal." Scarlet fever leaves the glands
							swollen and often sensitive; in some cases, the squamulae on parts of the patient's skin peel off.</p>
						<p>The greatest threats arise from complications. Sinus infections, abcesses of the ear, and mastoiditis are common. In a few
							cases, scarlet fever leads to arthritis, rheumatic fever, or kidney failure.</p>

						<term target="#schiavi">schiavi ognor frementi</term>
						<p>Slaves forever in a rage. In her revisions Mary Shelley is betrayed into a historical anachronism, for it was only with the
							Congress of Vienna of 1814-15 that Austria, already given the northeastern section of Italy in 1797, additionally was
							ceded Lombardy. Its capital, Milan, was thereafter a center of subversive unrest, and many of its leading citizens in the
							1820s were convicted of sedition and incarcerated in the infamous Austrian prison of Spielberg. Silvio Pellico's account,
							Le mie prigioni (My Prisons) was published in 1832, the year after the third edition of Frankenstein, and became a
							European best-seller. In the decade and a half following the Congress of Vienna, Britain became a center for exiles from
							the Milanese intelligentsia, among whom was Gabriele Rossetti, father of Christina and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.</p>
						<p>As contemporary English readers might be anticipated almost automatically to sympathize with the plight of a Milanese
							exile, so they would respond to the essentially imperialist ethos of this description of the blond beauty distinguished as
							a "rose among dark-leaved brambles." Both Elizabeth's aristocratic background and her fair northern beauty play to the
							expectations of the main line of British fiction in the early 1830s, what because of its high-bourgeois conventions has

						<term target="#secret">secret stores of knowledge</term>
						<p>This language resonates beyond the fictional world of this novel and links in complex ways with the concerns of Percy

							and the Poet whose story he tells are obsessed with uncovering secret lore; in the "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," stanza
							5, where Shelley recounts his own youthful investment in the supernatural; and in "Mont Blanc," esp. ll. 139-41, where the
							mountain itself is represented as holding secrets the poet would penetrate. "Alastor" was published in March of 1816, and
							the other two poems were written that summer. In addition, the theme is continually sounded in The Revolt of Islam, the
							long narrative poem he composed while Mary Shelley was simultaneously writing Frankenstein: (see esp. Canto II, sts.
							11-12, 20; Canto IV, sts. 3, 6-8, 12). There Shelley gives a strong political tilt to the notion of suppressed knowledge. </p>

						<p>The terms of Walton's education are provided in I:L2:2, where he laments his neglect of systematic preparation in his
							youth. It will remain to be seen in the course of the novel whether Victor Frankenstein's more formal education served him
							better than did Walton's autodidacticism.</p>
						<p> The question of self-education would have resonated strongly in the Shelley household. Mary Shelley did not attend school
							and was largely educated by her father, who in his early years had tried to read everything that was written and therefore
							was presumably qualified in the highest terms to direct his daughter's intellectual development. Though her husband
							attended the finest of preparatory schools, Syon House and Eton College, P. B. Shelley was expelled from Oxford in his
							second term at the university and thereafter amassed his considerable learning on his own. Mary, it should be stressed,
							embarked on a similar reading program as her husband and, if still only eighteen when she began Frankenstein was, by the

						<p>The description of Elizabeth, needless to say, is taken from stock; but it is likewise defining of her later personality.

						<term target="#sharemy">Do you share my madness</term>
						<p>As with other additions made by Mary Shelley in the early pages of her novel, this renders more explicit the extent to

							really superficial, accounted for by the terrible cost experience has wrought on Victor and the sheltered innocence in
							which Walton has been protected. Mary Shelley here likewise strengthens her plot line, giving Victor Frankenstein a strong
							reason for bestowing the terrible moral of his autobiography upon the enthusiastic explorer, allowing him, too, to be the
							first to indicate that he might be mad. By questioning Walton's sanity as well, he opens up large problems of reliability

							cut adrift from family protection not by death, but by a lack of human responsibility for his nurture. Born in abnormal

						<p>In a novel so concerned with education this emphasis on Justine's advancement testifies to Mary Shelley's belief in its

							published in 1816 and read that summer in the Geneva circle as Mary Shelley began writing Frankenstein. A strongly ironic

						<p>No other account of the writing contest verifies this bizarre project as Mary Shelley outlines it. Polidori himself, in the

						<p>Although the description here is intended to be amusing and to reflect an adolescent student's viewpoint of his elder,

							perspectives are implicitly molded by aesthetic criteria. By this standard the Creature whom Victor will create in his
							laboratory becomes a proof text for every figure who depends upon sight for knowledge. Even if familiarity, in the case of
							Victor Frankenstein, allows him in time to overlook the ugliness of Professor Krempe or of the Creature while in the

						<term target="#stpeters">St. Petersburgh</term>
						<p>In the opening decade of the eighteenth century Czar Peter the Great decided to build a new capital city for imperial
							Russia and picked for his site the swampy estuary of the Neva River where it flowed into the Baltic Sea. There he built
							the city named after his patron saint, officially establishing it as his capital in 1712. The extraordinary dimensions of
							this achievement were still retailed with awe by the end of the century when the 4th edition of the Encyclopaedia
							Brittanica (1797) dwelt at length on the founding of St. Petersburg. Only in the second half of the century, however, did
							it achieve the grandiose dimensions we now associate with the city. The major impetus to its development was the building
							of the Winter Palace, the official home of the Czars of Russia, begun by Peter III in 1754. In a palace coup that seems to
							have been universally praised, the Czar's wife Catherine seized power from Peter III in 1762, inaugurating the development
							of Russia into a modern and formidable nation. German by birth, Catherine aspired to make her country not just a major
							European political power but, more, one of its principal cultural centers. In her thirty-four years on the imperial throne
							she amassed an extraordinary collection of art to supplement and eventually supplant the Dutch-Flemish collection of Peter
							the Great: beginning in 1764. She had the fancifully named but grandly outfitted Hermitage built to house these treasures.
							Likewise, she gathered a major library of over 30,000 books, whose crowning glory was the acquisition of the entire
							library of Voltaire after his death in 1778. In his later years he had been a frequent correspondent with Catherine, as
							was Denis Diderot, the leading figure in creating for the French Enlightenment a compendium of all that was known, the
							Encyclopédie. Diderot became her chief advisor on the acquisition of art and in 1774 was himself persuaded to remove to
							St. Petersburg where he had the singular duty of providing Catherine with an hour of learned conversation every afternoon.
							Autocrat that she was, by the end of her life in 1796 Catherine had repented of her patronage of the leading philosophical
							forces that had spawned the French Revolution.</p>
						<p>That the novel is first set in St. Petersburg may be, then, not a mere curiosity, but a careful signal of its intellectual
							and cultural dimensions. Through it the reader of Mary Shelley's novel is to understand that it begins intellectually
							where it stands geographically, in the shadow of Catherine's enlightenment vision of a modernized culture. Robert Walton's
							thrilling sense of scientific discovery, detailed throughout this first letter, and Victor Frankenstein's endeavor to
							create a new being both share that ambience. The open question subtly articulated by this initial postmark is whether the
							dream of the new city or of the new human can alter the conditions that have determined the old. Will the novel, like

							contrast to Victor's nostalgic memory of an indulged childhood, the Creature experiences no parental kindness whatsoever
							and must begin life from an existential nadir. In doing so, he is forced to educate himself exactly in the elements of

						<p>Although it is not said explicitly, this is a poetry defined by conventional feminine concerns. Thus, Clerval's interest in
							it may implicitly suggest that realms exist that allow a man to identify himself without simultaneously excluding the

						<p>This seems an innocent-sounding phrase, but if read carefully, it manifests what the final chapter of Volume 1 will

						<p>Doubtless, this will seem only a natural human reaction, but once we have experienced Victor's narration of the agon

						<p>In the Genevan political system, according to the account in the 4th edition of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica (1797), there

						<p>Walton's highly refined sense of good manners here keeps him from inquiring about what had brought Victor to this desolate

							tone here, as there was in his earlier description of the sailors with whom he had to consort (I:L2:3, I:L2:4). Of course,
							it might be argued that the class system that so rigidly divided a ship's officers and its crew resulted in just such a
							dichotomy: it is not to the crew that Victor will retail his painful autobiography, but rather to a person of social
							breeding and intellectual ambition, if not education, comparable to his own. On the other hand, it could be maintained
							that the tone here is wholly unintentional, an unwitting reflection of the residual bourgeois tonality that Mary Shelley

						<p>Philosophy, impatient as it may be to build, has much work yet remaining as pioneer* for the overgrowth of ages. It makes
							one step towards this object; it destroys error, and the roots of error. It leaves, what is too often the duty of the
							reformer in political and ethical questions to leave, a vacancy.# It reduces the mind to that freedom in which it would
							have acted, but for the misuse of words and signs, the instruments of its own creation. —By signs, I would be understood
							in a wide sense, including what is properly meant by that term, and what I peculiarly mean. In this latter sense almost
							all familiar objects are signs, standing not for themselves but for others, in their capacity of suggesting one thought,
							which shall lead to a train of thoughts. —Our whole life is thus an education of error. (Reiman-Powers, eds., Shelley's

						<p>Mary Shelley here suggestively reveals that Victor's self-education involves no sense of social responsibility for the

						<p>This unattractive portrait of Henry Clerval's father relies on common prejudices of British society in the early nineteenth

						<term target="#univers">University of Ingolstadt</term>
						<p>The University of Ingolstadt was opened on 26 July 1472 under the patronage of the Duke of Bavaria, Ludwig the Wealthy. For
							centuries its various faculties—humanistic, scientific, theology, law, and medicine—were contained in the Hoheschule (High
							School). By the end of the seventeenth century plans were elaborated for new university buildings, but these were never
							realized. Nonetheless, during the ensuing century the University was forced to expand. In 1760 George Ludwig Claudius
							Rousseau was appointed demonstrator of Chemistry, and in 1778 a separate laboratory was constructed for him near the
							Hoheschule. Given the time scheme of Frankenstein, it seems likely that Victor would have pursued his studies in that
							location.</p>
						<p>But Ingolstadt was also very well equipped to support Victor's more elaborate scientific ambitions. From the first, the
							University possessed a medical school of stature. In 1722 its faculty acquired a site for a projected school that would
							incorporate an anatomy theater, botanical garden, and chemistry laboratory, and construction was begun early in 1723
							though, for want of money, it was not wholly finished until 1736. A major botanical garden was attached to the school to
							support its experiments and treatments. By 1755 the demonstration hall in the central atrium had been converted into a
							two-story anatomical theater, with a dissecting table on the ground floor, a gallery for student observers above, and a
							glass ceiling allowing overhead illumination. In the later eighteenth century it was considered to be one of the finest
							such theaters in Europe. Obviously, such a theater would have had ample provision for the specimens required for teaching
							purposes—or for clandestine experimentation. </p>

						<p>Later Walton calls Frankenstein's eloquence "forcible and touching" (III:WC:6) and just three weeks after the present

							Victor himself, somewhat earlier, evinced himself as distrustful of mere eloquence, warning Walton against the power of
							the Creature's speech and suggesting that it might mislead him (III:7:26).</p>
						<p>Eloquence as a concept implicitly assumes multiple perspectives and an underlying uncertainty as to where truth resides. It

						<term target="#unremit">unremitting ardour</term>

					</item>
					<item n="570">
						<term target="#unsocial">Study had . . . rendered me unsocial</term>
						<p>Since study is itself customarily thought to be a passive occupation, Victor's employment of the passive mood here calls

						<term target="#until">until the decline of life that he thought of marrying</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley seems to have an adolescent's sense of what constitutes the "decline of life." When we are introduced to
							Alphonse Frankenstein, a man who remained unmarried for at least another two years after his decision to wed and and who
							then had three children across a timespan of sixteen years, he seems as yet not to have begun the decline attributed to
							him here. His delay in marriage is shared by Victor who finds numerous reasons for postponing his nuptials with Elizabeth
							Lavenza. That this is a family trait Mary Shelley wishes to accentuate rather than the reflection of some antiromantic
							convention of her own or of her time is indicated by the case of Felix De Lacey, who falls deeply in love at a young age. </p>

					<item n="572">
						<term target="#unwillin">an unwillingness to leave Clerval</term>
						<p>At this point Clerval has been in Ingolstadt for a full year. Some months earlier, as the previous paragraph indicates, he

							quietly underscores the ease with which Victor shirks his family duties. </p>

					<item n="573">
						<term target="#vacancy">vacancy</term>
						<p>There is an unmistakeably strong resonance here of the final lines of Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Mont Blanc," lines 139ff.,
							written during the summer of 1816 when Frankenstein was begun. Since the early chapters were conceived at this time, the
							reflection of this particular poem would seem purposeful. That the greater part of Volume 2 of the novel takes place below
							Mt. Blanc should reinforce the sense one has of a thematic kinship between these two works. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="574">
						<term target="#vampire">my own vampire</term>
						<p>So entwined are the fortunes of Victor Frankenstein's Creature and vampires in twentieth-century popular culture, that to
							many it comes as a shock to realize that Bram Stoker's Dracula dates from three-quarters of a century after Mary Shelley's
							novel. And yet, the subject matters were entwined from the beginning. The story that Lord Byron vowed to produce for the
							Gothic competition of the summer of 1816 was to be called The Vampyre. In the end he dropped it, and the account was
							picked up and finished by John Polidori, Byron's personal physician during this summer, who then published his novella
							with the same title as that used by Byron so as to increase its circulation.</p>
						<p>Vampires were rather new on the literary scene at this point: general legendary knowledge about them actually stemmed from
							a single source, the incorporation of a vampire in Robert Southey's exotic and very popular oriental romance, Thalaba the
							Destroyer (1801). Although the figure appears in only one stanza, it afforded Southey the opportunity to show off his
							learning in a ten-page note. Since Percy Shelley was greatly enamored of this poem, even reading it aloud to Mary and
							Claire Clairmont on successive evenings in September 1814, there is little doubt that Mary had this account in mind in
							drawing upon vampire imagery for Frankenstein. </p>

						<term target="#vaults">vaults and charnel houses</term>
						<p>Johnson in his 1755 Dictionary defines a charnel house as "The place under churches where the bones of the dead are

							distinguish a mausoleum. Body-snatching or grave-robbing, a means of supplying cadavers for medical experiments and

						<p>This constitutes something of a misreading of the kinds of experiments Erasmus Darwin recounts in the first of his

							taking figuratively, as a kind of macaroni, the literal meaning of "vermicelli," tiny worms—what Darwin calls "microscopic
							animalcules." Still, although she humorously exaggerates the kind of spontaneous generation that drew scientific
							speculation in the early years of the nineteenth century, it is important to recognize how seriously such experiments were
							taken. Here, for instance, is the initial sentence of Darwin's "Conclusion": </p> {8} There is therefore no absurdity in
						believing that the most simple animals and vegetables may be produced by the congress of the parts of decomposing organic

							pattern of causality than Victor might like to believe in, one in which from the first he bears responsibility. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="586">
						<term target="#wasdestin">I was destined</term>
						<p>This phrase is accentuated by being repeated in adjoining sentences. Yet, for all its unusual emphasis, the phrase

						<term target="#wealth">wealth</term>
						<p>In order to place Walton's expedition in an objective perspective, the reader should reflect on what it would cost for a

						<term target="#whatinte">what interest and sympathy</term>
						<p>That this is secondarily a puff for the narrative that follows, openly charging us as readers to respond to it with

							paragraph before and its honoring of the essential human link inherent to fellow-feeling. That Walton's sympathy for
							Victor Frankenstein should extend to the reader's sympathetic reaction to them both is a fundamental tenet of Mary
							Shelley's notion of the value of, the purpose for, writing. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="590">
						<term target="#whosehan">whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt</term>
						<p>The phrase suggests the powders used in chemical analysis. Victor will be so converted to modern scientific research as to
							lose his earlier aversion to such mundane and messy experimentation. What he later calls his "workshop of filthy creation"
							(I:3:9 and note) seems to reflect this diction. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="591">
						<term target="#whosemis">nature </term>
						<p>In keeping with the tenor of this paragraph, the sentence bears a double freight. On the one hand, one could see Elizabeth
							as wishing to hide from the darker realities of the world and therefore as the embodiment of a kind of bland domesticity.
							On the other hand, as we have witnessed in the previous two chapters, a human being can become so inured to those darker
							realities as, like Victor Frankenstein, to lose perspective and a due sense of social responsibility. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="592">
						<term target="#whtglory">what glory</term>
						<p>Victor, like Walton (I:L1:6), foresees glory as crowning his scientific investigations. The same unexamined connotations of

						<p>The modern locution might be "like a horse in a pasture." A "common" was the common ground set aside or simply taken over
							by a community for pasturage of the small flocks and other animals belonging to its individual members. In the two
							generations previous to the writing of Frankenstein commons had all but disappeared in the British Isles as a result of
							their "enclosure" by landlords. The effect was enormously disruptive of rural stability, as Oliver Goldsmith's well-known

						<p>Although the prolonged illness that is to follow for Victor will justify this look as symptomatic of his physical debility,

						<term target="#wonder">wondrous power</term>
						<p>The "wondrous power" is magnetism. Mary Shelley, working within the accepted scientific discourse of her time, in this
							second paragraph of her novel, is carefully establishing a conceptual—the term in her time would have been
							"philosophical"—base for it in physics. The key is provided by Percy Bysshe Shelley's citation, in the opening sentence of
							the Preface (I:Pref:1), of Erasmus Darwin, to whom the reader may turn for further elucidation of the scientific grounding
							of the novel. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="601">
						<term target="#workshop">my workshop of filthy creation</term>
						<p>This phrase recurs with frequency in the critical literature about the novel, partly because it stands in such contrast to
							the almost divine attributes with which Victor has up to now been honoring himself and his discovery. In the phrase there
							is not only a sense of the irreducibly brute physical reality of what would have actually constituted a butcher-shop but
							as well a decided undertone of self-loathing. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="602">
						<term target="#worthy">worthy of my parentage</term>
						<p>However odd this may sound to contemporary ears, it is certainly true that Percy Bysshe Shelley deeply romanticized Mary's
							origins, seeing her as singled out by her birth for great literary accomplishment. He pays tribute to her in these terms
							in his Dedication to The Revolt of Islam, the epic-romance he wrote simultaneously with her composition of Frankenstein.
							Although some commentators have seen the pressures to write to which her lover/husband subjected Mary Shelley as
							pernicious, it did not originate with him so much as in the milieu in which Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin was raised. There,
							writing (William Godwin) and publishing (Mary Jane Clairmont, his second wife) was what one did. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="603">
						<term target="#wretch">wretch</term>
						<p>The Creature has been "named" once before by Victor, in the prologue, as "daemon" (I:L4:16). The nomenclature in which he
							is vested confers an initial identity upon him that will shift overnight from this enigmatic term of alienation—meaning
							either being unhappy or vile (from the Old English word for "exile")—to the wholly out of bounds, the monstrous (I:4:3). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="604">
						<term target="#wretchdy">wretchedly</term>
						<p>Here we encounter the first, ironic sign of Victor's bonding with his Creature. He first called him a "wretch" in the
							second paragraph of this chapter (I:4:2), and has just reiterated the epithet two sentences before this. Victor's adverb
							may seem innocent enough, but when juxtaposed with the many instances later in the novel in which he and his Creature will
							exchange places or nomenclature, it functions as a clear opening signal of the complex narrative patterning to come. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="605">
						<term target="#wretched">wretch—the miserable monster</term>
						<p>Here what had been ambiguous in the earlier use of the word "wretch" (I:4:2) hardens into monstrosity, a condition beyond
							the realm of the human. By the end of the paragraph the Creature, in Victor's view, will once more transmogrify into a
							further dimension of estrangement, the supernatural. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="606">
						<term target="#youngirl">a young girl</term>
						<p>Age is always relative. Mary Shelley was some two months shy of her twentieth birthday when she began writing Frankenstein
							and well past twenty-one when the novel appeared in print. Moreover, before she began the novel toward the end of June
							1816, she had registered experiences highly unusual for a young woman in the constrained environment of Britain, including
							eloping with a married man and twice giving birth. That said, it is true that the author was in years yet an adolescent
							when she wrote this novel and that, historically speaking, most of its readers have been struck by a range of knowledge,
							maturity of conception, and intellectual ambition unusual in one so young. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="607">
						<term target="#yourgent">your gentle and feminine fosterage</term>
						<p>This addition to the text seems motivated by a wish to make Margaret Saville a less shadowy presence behind it. The
							implicit suggestion is that she is sufficiently older than her brother to have cared for him when they were orphaned,
							though, considering the twin facts that she has children in her own family and Robert is now 28 years old, we must assume
							that the difference in age would amount to something like a decade (III:WC:11). The added phrase also emphasizes the role
							of feminine nurturer assumed by all the prominent women of the novel. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="608">
						<term target="#youwill">you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own hand-writing</term>
						<p>However varied the reasons might be for the phenomenon, Frankenstein continually reverts to the importance of documentary
							evidence to substantiate the truth of its events or assertions. This will be seen as crucial in the case of the Creature's
							existence and experiences (see II:6:7), of Victor's rectitude as a narrator (see III:WC:2), even of Walton's day-to-day
							account of his voyage (likewise contained in letters "in [his] own handwriting"). The pattern suggests that what is at
							stake here is the underlying truth of all fictions. </p>

					</item>
				<item n="609">
						<term target="#abhorred">abhorred devil</term> The repetitiousness of Victor's diction—it was "abhorred monster!" at the
						beginning of this interview (II:2:8)—seems fitting in circumstances where so many mirrored prisms are being deployed
						simultaneously by Mary Shelley. </item>
					<item n="610">
						<term target="#abject">the submission of abject slavery </term> This is a phrase that will resonate through the final third of
						the novel as the Creature and Victor Frankenstein vie for mastery over the other's will. Although fundamentally psychological
						in its formulation, the contention, as this phrase stresses, carries political overtones as well. </item>
					<item n="611">
						<term target="#adam">like Adam</term> Although the Creature here alludes to Adam's instruction by Raphael, which occupies the
						central third of Milton's epic, the imprecation on his creator that follows in the next paragraph bears comparison with the
						fallen Adam's indictment of God and lament that he was ever born (X.720ff). Like Adam, although physically he does not bear
						the imprint of his Creator, the Creature is indissolubly bound to Victor Frankenstein, as is indicated by his frequent
						unconscious doublings in language or gesture. </item>
					<item n="612">
						<term target="#aduty">a duty</term> As he has before, Alphonse Frankenstein raises before Victor the notion of duty as a
						contractual obligation between individual and family or state (I:1:1, I:3:10). </item>
					<item n="613">
						<term target="#affect">the affections of a sensitive being </term> This antiquated terminology bears pausing over. "Sensitive"
						in this context implies both "vitality, "human feeling," and an "independent will." The reciprocity of sensitive beings is the
						foundation of all social interchange; thus, the key to creating a society. </item>
					<item n="614">
						<term target="#affright">disgust and affright </term> The explicitly sensual terms with which the Creature characterizes
						Caroline Frankenstein, unknown to him the mother of his creator-father, recalls his reaction to the first sight of Safie
						(II:5:4 and note). Clearly, Safie is in his mind when the paragraph ends with the anticipated aversion of a beautiful woman to
						his form. </item>
					<item n="615">
						<term target="#again">again, with a lessened form</term> That is, the moon has disappeared totally, then has just reappeared

					<item n="616">
						<term target="#agentle">A gentle light</term>
						<p>The moon, which appears from details that follow in the narrative to be in its full phase. It is so bright, in Victor's
							narrative of the night of the Creature's birth, that "it forced its way through the window-shutters" (I:4:3), allowing him
							sufficient light to discern the features of the Creature as he opened the bed curtains to discover Victor. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="617">
						<term target="#ahell">a hell of intense tortures</term> Again, the stress is on hell as a mental state that Victor bears
						within himself. As demonstrated earlier at I:4:5 (and note) and I:7:30 (and note), Victor's internalization of the pangs of
						hell-fire is a clear allusion to the misery of Milton's Satan in Paradise Lost, especially IV.66-75. </item>
					<item n="618">

					<item n="619">
						<term target="#alady">a lady</term> With the arrival of this enigmatic stranger Mary Shelley essentially completes the cast
						of characters—which is to say, the balance of human and social elements—that compose her novel. That Safie is herself an
						outsider makes her curiously similar to the Creature who observes her entrance on the scene. </item>
					<item n="620">
						<term target="#alblast">All was blasted</term>

						<p>The language seems intended to invoke the "blasted stump" (I:1:22 and note) that is left after lightning strikes the tree
							near Bellerive, a manifestation of the power of the "vital fluid," electricity, that can at once create and destroy. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="621">
						<term target="#aleague">A league</term>
						<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines this unit of measurement as follows: </p>
						<p>LEAGUE: </p>
						<p> league lig, sb.1 Forms: 4-5 leghe, 4-6 lege, leuge, (4 lewge, 5 lewke, leuke, leeke), 5-6 leege, 6 legge, le(a)que, Sc.
							lig, 6-7 leag(e, 6- league. Late ME. leuge, lege, leghe, etc., ad. late L. leuga, leuca (= late Gr. leu'gh, leu'kh),
							according to Hesychius and Jordanes a Gaulish word; hence OFr. liue, liwe (mod.Fr. lieue), Pr. lega, legua, Cat. llegua,
							Sp. legua, Pg. legoa, Ital. lega.</p>
						<p> a. An itinerary measure of distance, varying in different countries, but usually estimated roughly at about 3 miles; app.
							never in regular use in England, but often occurring in poetical or rhetorical statements of distance.</p>
						<p>MARINE LEAGUE</p>
						<p>marine league: a unit of distance = 3 nautical miles or 3041 fathoms. Although the league appears never to have been an
							English measure, leuca occurs somewhat frequently in Anglo-Latin law-books (Bracton, Fleta, etc.); it is disputed whether
							in these works it means one mile or two.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="622">
						<term target="#allbound">All bounds of moderation</term>
						<p>Although Victor had earlier moralized against letting the pursuit of knowledge run away with one's sober judgment (I:3:12),
							here he portrays himself as indulging his hatred with the kind of impulsiveness and lack of restraint he had displayed in
							Ingolstadt. It is clear that what Alphonse Frankenstein had termed "immoderate grief" three paragraphs earlier (II:1:3) is
							not Victor's problem. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="623">
						<term target="#allpleas">All pleasures . . . life</term>
						<p>This is a remarkable sentence, redolent of all of Victor's earlier obsessiveness but now transposed into a kind of
							psychotic state. It is surely tied to earlier questions about the unhealthy products of the human imagination. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="624">
						<term target="#allthe">all the light I enjoyed came through the stye</term>
						<p>This is not easy to visualize, but Mary Shelley twice emphasizes the presence of this stye. She appears to do so for
							several interrelated reasons: in order to have a natural bulwark against the Creature's being detected by the cottagers;
							to place the Creature symbolically as close to the natural order as to human beings; and to reveal, against our visceral
							repugnance at the accompanying noise and stench (if the De Lacey household had been able to afford to keep a herd of
							swine), the level of subsistence to which necessity has reduced this being after six weeks or so of his existence. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="625">
						<term target="#alone">I am alone, and miserable</term>
						<p>In the 1818 edition the last noun of Volume 1, in Victor's narration, is "misery" (I:7:33), and the second volume opens on
							a scene in which he draws further into himself and his despair (II:1:1). Given the technical mastery of Frankenstein, it
							is thus perhaps only to be expected that the Creature's autobiographical account should conclude with the Creature in the
							exact condition of his Creator, sharing an existential misery compounded of solitude and guilt. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="626">
						<term target="#america">I will go . . . America</term>
						<p>Although there was relatively little Swiss (or German) emigration to the New World by the time this novel was written,
							there was of course a great amount of it from the country in which Frankenstein was published. Indeed, Percy Bysshe
							Shelley's grandfather had been born in the British Colonies of North America (in Passaic, New Jersey), whence he
							reimmigrated to Great Britain. The closest parallel for the Creature's plan, and probably one that would be uppermost in
							the minds of a contemporary reader, was the British penal colony established in 1788 at Botany Bay in Australia. There
							hardened convicts were transported so as to rid honest citizens from their threat to the common welfare. Over time, of
							course, these outcasts "civilized" a new continent. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="627">
						<term target="#anger">anger and hatred</term>
						<p>It may be difficult for the reader to suspend prior knowledge of the plot at this point and recall that Victor's one
							sighting of his Creature in the vicinity of Geneva does not constitute proof that he has done anything transgressive, let
							alone has accomplished the murder of William and the framing of Justine. Given what Victor actually knows of his Creature,
							this first greeting of him would seem to testify to a psychological disturbance, if not a real derangement. Certainly, he
							does not treat him as the prodigal son returning to his rightful father. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="628">
						<term target="#anticip">anticipations of joy</term>
						<p>The diction seems deliberately intended to evoke the end of Chapter 5 of Volume 1, where a full year later Victor and
							Clerval return from their walking tour around Ingolstadt—"with feelings of unbridled joy" (I:5:19)— to be greeted by a
							letter from Victor's father announcing the death of his brother William. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="629">
						<term target="#appear">appearance, different from any I had ever before seen</term>
						<p>The Creature had, of course, seen Victor before, but it was by dim moonlight, with Victor first in bed, then rushing
							hastily from the room (I:4:3). This is his first conscious encounter with another human being, whose mundane business is
							wholly disrupted by this unanticipated and sublime intrusion. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="630">
						<term target="#arbiters">arbiters of my future destiny</term>
						<p>The Creature's sense of his destiny stands in marked contrast to Victor's. Whereas the scientist sees himself as passively
							compelled by his destiny within an obsessive solitude, whether in his experiments with the principle of life or, later, in
							pursuit of the being that is its result, the Creature conceives of himself instinctively within a domesticated social
							context where he will be guided by others toward his self-realization. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="631">
						<term target="#archen">my arch-enemy, because my creator</term>
						<p>In Paradise Lost Satan bears this designation (I.81)—or is named Arch-foe (VI.259)—but it is ironically reversed here to
							apply to the figure who stands in place of God. Yet, to contemplate the phrase in isolation is to discern serious
							implications about the relation between sire and scion of a type that have greatly concerned modern psychoanalytic
							discourse. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="632">
						<term target="#ardently">I ardently desired</term>
						<p>Here the Creature joins the other principal male figures of the novel in the diction of burning intellectual ambition,
							repeating the phrasing earlier uttered by Walton and by Victor Frankenstein: see I:L3:1 and I:2:7.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="633">
						<term target="#artlang">the art of language</term>
						<p>Although Mary Shelley in this chapter seems deliberately to be emphasizing the Creature's "ardour" to place it within the
							context of the ambitions driving both Walton and Victor Frankenstein (see paragraph 9 above and note), she is effectively
							contrasting them. In the Creature's education language has a moral function, allowing communication among beings and
							operating as an instrument by which they may think and feel in common. True sympathy, the object of his utmost desire, is
							thus dependent upon language. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="634">
						<term target="#arve">the river Arve</term>
						<p>The Arve is fed by the glacier called the Mer de Glace (Sea of Ice), where the remaining chapters of Volume 2 will take
							place: the river descends from the mountain through the Chamounix Valley, turns to the east, and joins the Rhone river in
							its progress toward Lyons. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="635">
						<term target="#arveiron">the Arveiron</term>
						<p>The Arveiron is a glacial tributary the Shelleys visited on their excursion to Mont Blanc. Their visit is described in the

					</item>
					<item n="636">
						<term target="#asbelong">as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings</term>
						<p>The simile is telling here. We will discover in the next chapter that the Alps can, indeed, support another "race" of
							beings. Yet, however much human imagination may discern in these altitudes the possibility of a transcendence of the human
							condition, neither a human nor another kind of being can effectually manage to do so. Moreover, "another race" of beings,
							if brought down from an imaginary conception to the solid ground of normative human existence would be considered, like
							Victor's Creature, alien and hounded from human society. The conflict between the unrestricted imagination and human
							society is total. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="637">
						<term target="#aspan">as Pandæmonium appeared</term>
						<p>This is the Creature's second knowing reference to Milton's Paradise Lost (see I.670ff. and X.418ff.): the first was when
							he remarked that Victor, in creating him, had cast him as Satan rather than Adam (II:2:11). The oddity of these learned
							citations goes unremarked for now, but will be explained five chapters later (II:7:7). </p>

						<p>Even in social circumstances like this family outing Victor's separation of himself from his companions is conspicuous. The

						<term target="#beast">I was like a wild beast</term>
						<p>The language once again affirms the Creature's affinity with nature and natural forces: his atavistic rage is a sublime

							the previous chapter (II:7:38). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="645">
						<term target="#beautif">beautiful</term>
						<p>The beautiful, in this formulation, would seem to be a characteristic understood only within a human context. That is to
							say, until the Creature can identify himself with human concerns and human emotions, he cannot distinguish the beautiful.
							The corollary of this, however, may not be so honorific to humanity. The birds with whom the creature first identified in
							paragraph four above seem wholly unconcerned with the sublime; but all humans are terrified of it and flee. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="646">
						<term target="#beauty">I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty</term>
						<p>We have no comparable description of Elizabeth Lavenza from Victor, whose appreciation of her virtues overshadows the few
							physical details he gives of her upon his return to his family at the end of of the first volume (I:6:40). In the
							unself-conscious innocence of the Creature, in contrast, not only do we realize that he has a nuanced appreciation for the
							beautiful, but we also comprehend that strong romantic desire—not a subject in which Victor seems particularly adept—is an
							aspect of his makeup, perhaps to be considered normal for a human being, but in the Creature's circumstances deeply
							problematical. Mary Shelley's delicate handling of the Creature's awakening to desire is an index of the complexity with
							which she endows his character. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="651">
						<term target="#benev">benevolence</term>
						<p>It is a remarkable achievement of Mary Shelley's that by this point in the Creature's narrative, this word (and its
							derivatives) have become fully ironized. Continually repeated as it is (see, for instance, II:7:2 and II:7:9), this
							Enlightenment concept stands in a kind of verbal isolation, unsupported by any examples that might convince us of its
							dynamic, positive value, or even (outside the Creature's own actions) that active benevolence exists. Thus the Creature's

					<item n="652">
						<term target="#benev2">benevolence</term>

					</item>
					<item n="653">
						<term target="#benevole">benevolent dispositions</term>
						<p>The Creature has been repeating this adjective (and the noun "benevolence") in seeming insistence on the unquestionable
							virtues of the cottagers. Now, the intrusion of the ensuing phrase ("I persuaded myself") and a next sentence in the form
							of a question artfully raises the doubts his narrative has suspended. The entire paragraph, indeed, evokes a litany of the
							high ideals of Enlightenment virtue gleaned by the Creature from his reading and quietly interrogates their efficacy for
							"a wretched outcast." </p>

					<item n="654">
						<term target="#berries">berries, nuts, and roots</term>
						<p>Although it might seem eccentric to some readers, a crucial aspect of the Creature's bonding with the De Lacey family comes

					</item>
					<item n="655">
						<term target="#bestowed">Why . . . so wantonly bestowed</term>
						<p>This is the third time this phrasing has been heard in the volume. The first is at its very beginning where Victor
							confesses that he "ardently wished to extinguish that life which [he] had so thoughtlessly bestowed" (II:1:6). The second
							occurence takes place during the encounter on the Mer de Glace, where under the intensity of the experience Victor adds to
							his weight of guilt, vowing to "extinguish the spark that I so negligently bestowed" (II:2:8). The Creature thus taunts
							Victor with his own words and desires, but stresses the character of the negligence involved: his life, he asserts, has
							been "wantonly bestowed," which returns him to his earlier line of attack: "How dare you sport thus with life?" (II:2:7). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="656">
						<term target="#books">books</term>
						<p>The novel's continuing self-reflexiveness is quietly underscored here, but so is the idea of a personal library. A further
							step in the Creature's education and his exploration of his identity, reading books, rather than just overhearing them
							being read, frees him from another's tutelage, increasing his own sense of responsibility and maturity. Whether such books
							can make him happier is another question entirely. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="657">
						<term target="#bound">bound by ties</term>
						<p>As Alphonse Frankenstein continually speaks from the vantage of patriarch of the family, asserting an almost tribal sense

							from the first spurned. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="658">
						<term target="#burning">burning passion</term>
						<p>There is an unmistakeable erotic charge to the language of these paragraphs, but it is almost metaphysical in its
							conception. The Creature suggests that the rage awakened within him, which is fired by his rejection and desperate
							solitude, can only be slaked by being converted into a psychologically and socially constructive alternative, which is to
							say love. There are ramifications here as well for the "ardent" pursuits of both Walton and Victor Frankenstein. </p>
						<p>Although the notion of channeling libidinous forces into socially beneficial relationships might be thought particularly
							suited to a woman's perspective on modern culture, the conventions of the age kept most women authors from a direct
							engagement with issues of sexuality and its repression or displacement. A notable exception is Mary Wollstonecraft. Here
							one senses a true family resemblance. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="659">
						<term target="#burstall">burst all bounds of reason</term>
						<p>The Creature unconsciously echoes the very language Victor (II:1:6 and note) had used to express his violent aversion to

					</item>
					<item n="660">
						<term target="#bythesun">by the sun . . . heaven</term>
						<p>Given the richness of context provided by Milton's representation of the Judeo-Christian Genesis in Paradise Lost, one

					</item>
					<item n="661">
						<term target="#cause">cause should produce such opposite effects</term>
						<p>Twice in the paragraph stressing the word "cause," the Creature learns that pleasure and pain proceed from the same force,
							a considerable development in his education and mental sophistication. If this is the groundwork of morality, however, it
							is important to recognize that it shares a common bond, as the earlier quotation from Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Mutability"
							may remind us, with the scientific systems that form so conspicuous a context for the novel (see II:2:3 and note). There
							are other elements emphasized in the novel that likewise exist on a neutral ground that can result in either good or ill:
							curiosity is an obvious case in point (II:2:16). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="662">
						<term target="#causfear">I will cause fear</term>
						<p>In this phrase the Creature encapsulates what will become the dynamic force of the third volume, an intense desire turned
							inside out and thus ironized, so that hatred is pursued with the single-minded obsession of passionate love. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="663">
						<term target="#cenis">across Mont Cenis</term>
						<p>This was the easiest route into Italy, across southeastern France from Chambery to Turin in northwestern Italy. The Mont
							Cenis Pass rises to only 6825 feet. This was Napoleon's invasion route to Italy in 1796, and thereafter the post-road was
							improved to allow uninterrupted traffic between the two countries. It was this road, indeed, that the Shelleys themselves
							would take shiortly after publication of the novel, in March 1818, on their trip to Italy. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="664">
						<term target="#chain">the chain . . . excluded</term>
						<p>The reference seems again to be to Paradise Lost (IV.49-53), and specifically to Satan's attempt to break the chain with

					</item>
					<item n="665">
						<term target="#companio">his companion</term>

					</item>
					<item n="666">
						<term target="#compass">thy compassion</term>
						<p>In effect, the Creature asks Victor to look the other way and listen to his story. We will recognize the similarity of this
							plea to that made to the blind De Lacey when the Creature first attempts to establish human community later in the volume
							(II:7:15). Throughout Frankenstein sound, rather than sight, is the means by which human sympathy is evoked. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="667">
						<term target="#compass3">compassion</term>
						<p>An appeal to justice must necessarily depend on compassion, fellow-feeling. This is the only occasion in the Creature's

					</item>
					<item n="668">
						<term target="#condemn">He was tried, and condemned to death</term>

					</item>
					<item n="669">
						<term target="#controul">I did not strive to controul them</term>
						<p>The power of the Creature's rage is shocking, perhaps as well to himself after having spent an entire year in isolation and
							under a regimen of strict and carefully enforced self-control. The infinitive, however, reminds us how severely that
							control has been earlier exercised by him. It might likewise call to mind the lack of restraint with which Victor
							Frankenstein pursued the researches that resulted in the Creature's birth (I:3:3). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="670">
						<term target="#converse">conversed with my family</term>
						<p>Such incongruity of tone can have its value (though Mary Shelley did decide in the third edition to remove the family
							presence altogether from Victor's excursion to Mont Blanc). We will shortly be reminded that there is another part of
							Victor's family he has assiduously avoided and to whom, unlike his conventional family, he has given no solicitude
							whatsoever. The oddity of tone here, quickly rectified by the gloomy weather of the next morning, almost unconsciously
							prepares us for the conversation so feared and so long postponed but now, given the state of Victor's psychological
							condition, clearly urgent. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="671">
						<term target="#cottager">names of the cottagers</term>
						<p>The naming of the cottagers depends not just on their individual identities but also on their family, i.e., their social,
							relations. That they thus have several different names, depending on which aspect is being emphasized, constitutes a new
							level of awareness on the Creature's part. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="672">
						<term target="#countena">his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity</term>
						<p>The nouns here are all associated with Satan and the Satanic in Paradise Lost: e.g. "anguish" (II.568; VI.340); "disdain"
							(I.98; II.680; V.666); "malign" (III.553; IV.503; VII.189). And yet, the framing language forces us to consider
							perspective: "bespoke" is not the same as "constitutes" in its implicit representation of reality; and if Victor, even as
							he articulates it, openly remarks that he "scarcely observed this," where, then, might his terms come from? As we will
							learn from the Creature himself (II:7:7), it is easy to insert oneself (or others) into the mythic texture of Paradise
							Lost: thus it might appear, as it were, that Victor does so first, here defining the Creature as Satanic not from sharp
							empirical observation but from literary—that is to say, cultural—convention. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="673">
						<term target="#create">you must create</term>
						<p>The change in verb form to a command is rhetorically powerful, but it also signals a shift in, broadly speaking, the
							political dynamics of the novel. Victor's power, a symbolic extension of that of his father and family, is no longer
							absolute, but can be successfully challenged by the figure who stands in the position of his son and who can command
							superior strength and tenacity. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="674">
						<term target="#creatsen">a creature of fine sensations</term>
						<p>Along with his acknowledgement of justice, Victor appears at last to have recognized what a masterpiece of work he created
							only to abandon. Even if he is not reminded of his original ambition to create "a new species," we certainly may be (see
							I:3:8). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="675">
						<term target="#cursed">Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you</term>
						<p>Under the creature's unrelenting accusation, the self-destructive nature of Victor's hatred and its manifestation in the
							Creature-as-double are here at last openly admitted by him. Percy Bysshe Shelley will use the same formula a year later in
							writing the first act of Prometheus Unbound, where Prometheus summons the Phantasm of Jupiter, the specter of his enemy,
							to repeat the self-enchaining curse Prometheus had once pronounced upon Jupiter (see 1.258). There, too, the strong echoes
							of Paradise Lost suggest a reading of God and Satan in the manner represented in his "Defence of Poetry," as
							co-complicitous doubles. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="676">
						<term target="#cursed2">Cursed, cursed creator!</term>
						<p>This chapter begins with a remarkable series of linguistic echoes in which the Creature echoes the language of Victor
							Frankenstein, in part to indicate that comparable experiences have produced comparable misery, but also to underscore the
							affinity of creator and creation. The first element is this imprecation, a repetition of the curse Victor pronounced on
							himself at their meeting on the Mer de Glace (II:2:14 and note). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="677">
						<term target="#dante">Dante's iron . . . hypocrites</term>
						<p>The reference is to Inferno 23.58ff. Here at the end of the volume we are recalled to the "hell of intense tortures" with
							which it began (II:1:1). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="678">
						<term target="#dareyou">dare you sport thus with life</term>
						<p>The moral power of this verb stands out against Victor's ineffectual name-calling, reminding us that in some sense
							"curiosity" (a word with considerable resonance in the first volume) is sport, as are all open-ended intellectual
							endeavors associated with the imagination. The pejorative sense of the word as used here against Victor is, appropriately,
							the sense invoked by Victor himself in silently indicting the Creature during the trial of Justine (I:7:11). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="679">
						<term target="#dayuse">daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society</term>
						<p>Unlike his son (or, for that matter, Robert Walton), Alphonse Frankenstein shares Justine Moritz's sense, uttered as her
							last words (I:7:31 and note), of the value embodied in a humble, quotidian usefulness. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="680">
						<term target="#declared">I declared everlasting war . . . me</term>
						<p>The emphasis here is on the psychology of alienation, as centered in the antagonism between Satan and God in Paradise Lost
							(I.105-24). There, as Mary Shelley interprets the emotional dynamics, a cycle of destruction results from God's rejection
							of Satan. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="681">
						<term target="#deepdark">deep, dark, death-like solitude</term>

						<p>The language seems intended to invoke both hell and the grave as being synonymous with Victor's sense of himself, in the
							previous paragraph, as an "evil spirit." Behind this language a reader may sense the solitude of Coleridge's Ancient
							Mariner, won by Life-in-Death and obsessively reenacting his guilt. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="682">
						<term target="#deeprev">a deep and deadly revenge</term>
						<p>On an uncomplicated psychological plane Mary Shelley is representing the simple dynamics of the Creature's alienation. With
							no other presence to balance or feel for this injustice, in his solitude he works himself into a confirmed opposition to
							the world that has rejected and threatened him. The Enlightenment virtues of benevolence and sympathy, were they ever to
							be encountered by the Creature, would by their very nature undercut his introverted and exclusionary mental state and
							enforce a social communion. Once again, as in Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Alastor; or, the Spirit of Solitude," published in
							March 1816, we recognize that solitude constitutes an evil spirit leading one to ill. The opening paragraph of Volume 2,
							in which Victor Frankenstein reveals himself similarly introverted and plotting revenge as a means of assuaging his
							self-hatred is, indeed, an appropriate introduction to this dynamic that arches across the volume (see II:1:1 and note). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="683">
						<term target="#deformed">one as deformed . . . deny herself to me</term>
						<p>As at the beginning of this chapter, so at its end the Creature is willing to repress his own desires to accord with the
							normative expectations of humanity. Although human beings cannot endure his sight, he will inure himself to make ugliness
							aesethetically acceptable to his eyes. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="684">
						<term target="#delacey">the family of De Lacey</term>
						<p>The marmoreal cast of this sentence throws the emphasis on the family unit. Whereas before the Creature had seen a
							patriarchal family as nurturing civilized values (II:7:6), here he has reason to interpret it from a contrasting
							perspective, as harboring the equivalent of ethnic prejudices on a small, tightly formed, and exclusionary scale. With
							that perspective in mind one might return to the family unit that Victor Frankenstein left a few hours back to consider
							how little different is its underlying ethos (II:1:3). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="685">
						<term target="#delicate">Felix was too delicate to accept this offer</term>
						<p>There is a marked similarity here between the sense of honor of Felix and that of Alphonse Frankenstein after rescuing the
							daughter of his old friend Beaufort from poverty (I:1:5). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="686">
						<term target="#delights">Chief delights</term>
						<p>The Creature implicitly reaffirms his part in a natural order and his own affinity with nature. Once again, we are reminded
							that in his composition there are non-human creaturely attributes (see I:3:9 and note) that fit him for the wild. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="687">
						<term target="#deprived">deprived of his wealth and rank</term>
						<p>Given the nature of the injustice visited upon Felix and his family, it is especially fitting that Volney's Ruins should
							form the basic educational text in the cottage. We should recall that it is from that book that the Creature learns, and
							Felix and Safie are bitterly reminded, of the necessities of wealth and rank (II:5:16). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="688">
						<term target="#descend">I believe, descended</term>
						<p>Victor's workshop, he reported earlier (I:3:9), was a cell at the top of the house, separated in a complex way from the
							main part of the edifice. Presumably, the bedchamber to which he fled at the awakening of the Creature (I:4:3) was on a
							floor below. There the Creature wandered and awoke Victor who then in terror plunged outside. By some means unknown to
							Victor and unremembered by the Creature, the newly created being made his way from the house to the streets outside the
							courtyard, where Victor spent the night, and thence into the countryside surrounding Ingolstadt, where at last he fell
							asleep. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="689">
						<term target="#desert">desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge</term>
						<p>"Desert" here means "of the wilderness" (cf. III:3:1 and note). This account, then, exactly fulfills the prescription
							innocently thought by Victor as he approached the alpine range, that these mountains might be "the habitations of another
							race of beings" (II:1:12). Since Mont Blanc was first scaled only in 1786, the fact that the Creature has taken up his
							abode there indicates just how superior to conventional human endurance Victor has made him. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="690">
						<term target="#deserved">deserved better treatment</term>
						<p>This would appear a premonition of the Creature's own experience with the De Lacey family. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="691">
						<term target="#desire">the greater became my desire</term>
						<p>The Creature's intensity, like the suddenness of his admiration for Safie (II:5:4 and note), has the ring of adolescence to
							it. It is not, then, utterly surprising that it should remind us of the diction of the two "ardent" men whose youthful
							discourse we have already overheard: Walton (see I:L1:2 and I:L2:2) and Victor Frankenstein (see I:2:7, I:3:1, and I:3:6).
							Burning desire is a characteristic all three share. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="692">
						<term target="#desolate">my desolate state</term>
						<p>Desolation is, indeed, the appropriate term for a condition in which the Creature is so alienated from his original state
							that he feels the rebirth of spring as an ironic counterforce to his internal degeneration. Mary Shelley carefully marks
							the inherent "unnaturalness" and thus self-destructiveness of such a psychological condition. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="693">
						<term target="#detest">a destable monster</term>
						<p>None of the cottagers, of course, has as yet to lay sight on the Creature. It is a mark of how self-alienated his education
							has made him that he can presume such a reaction without having to put it to the test. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="694">
						<term target="#devcott">the devoted cottage</term>
						<p>That is, reserved for destruction, the same usage as in the encounter with Victor on the Mer de Glace (II:2:11 and note.) </p>

					</item>
					<item n="695">
						<term target="#devil">Devil!</term>
						<p>This is the first word that Victor utters to his Creature. Perhaps, as the allusions to Satan in the previous paragraph
							suggest, it is already in his mind. But, there is a dimension to this epithet beyond its effectiveness as an index to
							Victor's mental state, a timeless and mythic dimension. Although rigorously suppressed wherever organized Christendom
							extended its arms into secular society, the writings of heretical theology, particularly from Gnostic sects, continually
							revert to the concurrence of creation and the fall as two aspects of a single event. Thus to create is to cast out, on a
							universal level as well as, literally so, in childbirth. The cast-off in this case functions as Satan in a dual sense—as a
							disrupter of the putative unity of God and his coextensive creation, and—from the Hebrew root—as the accuser, who here
							immediately upbraids Victor Frankenstein for not doing his duty by his creature.</p>
						<p>Note how carefully Milton embeds this coincidence, without heretically stressing a linkage, in the moment where God divides
							himself so as to function on a second level, as a Creative Word, the Logos that will render God's conceptual blueprint for
							the universe into a workable reality (Paradise Lost, V.594-617). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="696">
						<term target="#devoted">my devoted head</term>
						<p>Johnson's 1755 Dictionary offers us the appropriate definitions for this period, definitions virtually lost to modern
							English usage:</p>
						<p> To addict; to give up to ill.<lb/> To curse; to execrate; to doom to destruction.</p>
						<p>For the second meaning Johnson helpfully cites the Satanic legions in Paradise Lost, V.890.</p>
						<p>The phrase "devoted head" is so common a usage as to appear to be a customary eighteenth-century idiom.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="697">
						<term target="#doomed">doomed to waste his powers for . . . few</term>
						<p>This suggests a different kind of determinism from that continually evoked by Victor Frankenstein, a social and economic
							form of destiny, what Marx was to denominate as wage slavery. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="698">
						<term target="#dream">But it was all a dream</term>
						<p>As the preceding paragraphs have made clear, the more the Creature reads the more he becomes conscious of alternate plot
							possibilities, of disparities between the worlds conjured up by desire and the imagination and the inescapable reality of
							his condition. Rather than find solace in his imaginative life, he experiences an increasing desperation. </p>

						<p>This is only the second occasion in which the Creature has shed tears, the other being on the first night of his existence
							(II:3:2). Yet how different is this repetition, another sign of the growing refinement of his emotional life. His
							oxymoronic response to music (and perhaps to Safie as well) is a further example of how his education proceeds by
							encompassing opposites (see II:3:6 and note). </p>

					<item n="703">
						<term target="#enkindle">enkindled</term>
						<p>The diction reminds us of the numerous uses of "ardent" and its derivatives (from Latin ardere, 'to burn': see definitions)

						<term target="#epithets">loaded me with epithets</term>
						<p>That it is to stop a child's naming that impels the Creature almost accidentally to kill him is significant in several
							ways. Most importantly, the Creature is existentially unnamed, lacking an identity that denominates a particularized
							selfhood and a socialized connectedness, the sort of implicit identity by which William himself immediately commands
							authority. It was Victor Frankenstein's initial duty as his creator to accord him that name but he fled from the
							responsibility. Thus, everywhere else in the novel, with Victor from his distance actively participating in the process,
							the Creature is identified, not by a name but through epithets, as being outside a human sphere. In a symbolic sense at
							least, William dies for his naming, for taking on a function only his brother has the right to perform. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="706">
						<term target="#evil">I looked . . . evil</term>
						<p>The "as yet" introduces an ominous tone into this account, but it also reminds us that the Creature as a voyeur hiding from
							the world, experiences that world only vicariously. That his retreat is fragile and his faith in the future tentative are
							all that he can be sure of. Elizabeth Lavenza, expressing a similarly impossible desire to escape the world, had
							articulated similar sentiments at the beginning of this volume (II:1:9). </p>

						<p>Victor, with something like a Genevan Calvinist's sense of original sin, cannot bring himself to think of his Creature as

					</item>
					<item n="708">
						<term target="#evilspir">an evil spirit</term>

						<p>Mary Shelley seems deliberately to invoke the terms of Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Alastor: or, the Spirit of Solitude,"
							published in March 1816 a few months before the summer trip to Geneva. The title was suggested by their friend Thomas Love
							Peacock, poet and novelist, and an autodidact in classical Greek, who conveyed to Percy Bysshe Shelley the aptness of
							using the Greek word for a kakodaimon, "alastor," as the governing term for his poem. The word kakodaimon translates
							exactly into the "evil spirit" invoked here by Victor Frankenstein, and its association with solitude is manifest in these
							circumstances as well. At the same time, a sensitive reader cannot help observing the likeness of this term to the diction
							Victor commonly uses to describe his Creature, which he now, without recognizing the similarity, applies to himself. </p>

						<p>Mary Shelley's insistence on the deference of daughters to fathers might be logically connected with her dedication of this
							novel to her own father; at the same time, it is rather at odds with her mother's views, and particularly with her running
							argument against Rousseau's views on female education in Book 5 of her Vindication of the Rights of Woman. What is odd in
							the present case is the fact that Felix does not mirror Agatha's reaction. His stance suggests something of the distance
							between son and father already accentuated in the case of Victor and Alphonse Frankenstein. </p>

						<term target="#exile">a perpetual exile</term>
						<p>The status of persona non grata, if somewhat unusual, was certainly not unheard of in France either before, or after, the
							Revolution. Napoleon, in fact, became famous for sending those who displeased him into exile. With one of these, Germaine
							de Staël, he got more than he bargained for: resentful of her criticism of his authoritarian rule, he banished her forever
							from French dominions, whereupon she set out on a long tour of Europe, speaking out against the Emperor of France and
							attracting legions of admirers wherever she went. One reason that she established herself at Coppet and gathered around
							her a set of pan-European intellectuals was that she could not return to Paris. Mary Shelley, in the ambience of Geneva in
							the summer of 1816, would have well aware of this record. Madame de Staël's last book, published posthumously in 1820, was
							called Ten Years of Exile. Whether Napoleon was afforded a copy on St. Helena, his island of exile in the middle of the
							Atlantic Ocean, is unlikely. Nonetheless, Germaine de Staël decidedly had the last laugh. </p>

						<term target="#falofsnw">fall of snow had taken place</term>
						<p>It would appear that a month or more has passed since the Creature's birth, and with autumn's end he is experiencing the

					</item>
					<item n="713">
						<term target="#feelings">feelings which . . . have made me what I am</term>
						<p>Up to now the Creature has been remarking seasonal changes and their reflection in the landscape. Here, suddenly, the sense
							of internal divorce and self-alienation already present in the previous chapter (II:4:4, II:4:13) opens out into a split
							between past and present selves equivalent, as the emphatic language might suggest, to Adam's fall from paradise. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="714">
						<term target="#feltcold">I felt cold also</term>
						<p>Victor Frankenstein has already supplied additional details to elucidate the weather being experienced here. The Creature,
							he recounts, was born "on a dreary night of November," and the next morning dawned "dismal and wet," with rain pouring
							"from a black and comfortless sky" (I:4:6). Although, if we then follow the Creature's account, it subsequently cleared
							sufficiently for the light to seem oppressive to him, later that night, the time to which he is referring in his
							narrative, it reverted to a seasonably cold temperature. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="715">
						<term target="#fiend">the fiend that lurked in my heart</term>
						<p>As with the double resonance of "wretch" at the end of the previous paragraph, here Victor applies to himself the term he

					</item>
					<item n="716">
						<term target="#fiend1">the fiend with an air of exultation</term>
						<p>Nothing in the Creature's statements in the previous paragraph—particularly given the stark alternatives he lays before
							Victor at its end—suggests that he is exulting at this point. Rather, the remark along with the epithet convey Victor's
							intrinsic sense of superiority and of his right to wield a power capable of affording satisfaction to an underling.
							Whatever Victor may regard as "the duties of a creator," they do not yet forestall him from calling his creature a "fiend"
							and regarding him as "odious." </p>

					</item>
					<item n="717">
						<term target="#fiend2">fiend</term>

						<term target="#fool">I was a fool</term>
						<p>This calm reconsideration of his actions attests to the analytical capacities of the Creature and pictures him once again

							Other and of reifying a concept of normative reality in which he lacks any secure place. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="720">
						<term target="#forcesol">forced solitude</term>
						<p>Where Victor hedges, the Creature counters: as "evil passions" the phrase Victor employed four paragraphs before, will
							disappear within an ambience of sympathy, so (as "vices") they are the product of solitude. Again, we hear the resonance
							of the title of Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Alastor; or, the Spirit of Solitude," published a few months before Frankenstein
							was begun (see II:8:21 and note). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="721">
						<term target="#french">are you French</term>
						<p>In ordinary circumstances this would not seem so absurd a question. The fact that the Creature lacks a national identity,
							however, throws into relief how deeply embedded are national prejudices even among the enlightened. We have already
							witnessed in the French reaction to Safie's father (II:6:3) and in his abuse of Felix's kindness (II:6:12) how
							mean-spiritedness is served by national identity. Part of Volney's aim in Les Ruines is to eradicate such defining
							ideological concepts. That the Creature is thus born without them indicates his superiority and, ironically, is a further
							example of how he does not fit into normative human society. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="722">
						<term target="#friend">a feeling and kind friend</term>
						<p>Up to this point all the expression of sympathy has come as a surmise of the Creature's about the cottagers. This assertion
							reminds us that for something like a year the Creature has intervened actively to assist the cottagers in their daily
							existence. His fellow-feeling has, indeed, extended into kind actions on their behalf. The heavy irony behind this scene
							is that all the Enlightenment virtues the Creature has presumed to be attributes of the cottagers have been employed by

						<term target="#greedily">I greedily devoured the remnants</term>
						<p>Although on the face of it this appears like stealing, the Creature makes no distinction between this human fare and the

						<p>Unknowingly yet shrewdly, throughout this speech the Creature touches Victor Frankenstein on his most sensitive moral

					</item>
					<item n="737">
						<term target="#hellish">hellish triumph</term>
						<p>The Creature has internalized the dynamics of Paradise Lost, setting himself as a reactionary force to undo the world of

							well understood by Mary Shelley, yet to be learned by the Creature. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="738">
						<term target="#hellwith">I, like the arch fiend, bore a hell within me</term>
						<p>His limited reading immediately calls to his mind the mythic model for his profound alienation, Milton's Satan,
							establishing a new line of psychological congruence between the tormented Creature and Victor Frankenstein, who used the
							identical expression at the end of Volume I (Chapter 8 in the 1831 edition): see I:7:30 and note. Victor also makes
							similar statements in I:4:5 and II:1:1 (and note). The allusion is to Satan's soliloquy upon Mount Niphates: Paradise

					<item n="739">
						<term target="#hethus">He thus began his tale</term>
						<p>We enter here into a third level of narrative, one that is embedded within Victor Frankenstein's autobiography, which is
							itself being transcribed by Walton each night of its recounting for his sister's future perusal. Issues of the authority
							and even the reliability of any particular level of the narrative thus abound and have raised serious debate in the
							critical literature on the novel. As the Creature twice in these two paragraphs speaks of his "tale," so Victor refers to
							his narrative as a "tale" as well (see I:L4:30 and I:3:13). The underlying question is how true is any tale. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="740">
						<term target="#hideous">Hideous monster!</term>
						<p>The combination of terms here may be accidental, but is wonderfully encapsulating of the dynamics of the novel thus far.

						<p>This could mean, narrowly, that Felix had been educated for the French diplomatic corps or, more broadly, to function in

					<item n="743">
						<term target="#howmove">How can I move thee</term>
						<p>As Victor is self-conscious about the shape and impact of his narrative (see I:7:13 and note), so is his Creature. His
							question also curiously echoes Justine Moritz's recognition that facts alone are not sufficient to exonerate her (I:7:5
							and note); if she is to establish her claim to innocence she must move her auditors. Aside from such thematic continuities
							within the novel, this issue is likewise very much alive in the poetry that Percy Shelley was writing contemporaneously,
							particularly in The Revolt of Islam, where Cythna's eloquence is an important element in spreading political and cultural
							enlightenment: see particularly Canto 8. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="744">
						<term target="#hut">the hut upon the mountain</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley knows from experience of what she writes. There were actually two such huts on Montanvert above the Sea of

							Desportes, in the year 1795 (Charles Edward Mathews, The Annals of Mont Blanc [Boston: L.C. Page, 1900]).</p>

					</item>
					<item n="745">
						<term target="#ialone">am I not alone, miserably alone?</term>
						<p>Not only does the Creature's terrible solitude remind us of the mental isolation into which Victor Frankenstein finds
							himself plunged, but it also takes us back to the original scene in which this narrative is being recited, upon a ship in
							the midst of the Arctic Ocean, remote from either land or other human beings. As in Walton's letters (Letter I and Letter
							II), so here one cannot fail to hear the echo of Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner": "Alone, alone, all, all
							alone,/ Alone on a wide wide sea!" (line 232-3). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="746">
						<term target="#iard2">I ardently desired to understand them</term>

					</item>
					<item n="747">
						<term target="#iardent">I ardently wished to extinguish that life</term>

						<p>Heavy irony attends this choice of diction. Not only are we reminded of the "ardent" desire with which, when young, Victor
							(I:2:7) (and Walton—I:L1:2) eagerly pursued scientific knowledge, but we can associate with that innocent desire the more
							complicated ardency driving Victor obsessively toward the scientific breakthrough that was the birth of this Creature: see
							I:3:1 and note. This is the point in the novel when the language of intense love first is used to embody the designs of a
							passionate hatred. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="748">
						<term target="#iexclaim">I exclaimed</term>
						<p>It is a curious coincidence that the last time Victor called upon the heavens (I:6:22) he instantly beheld his Creature. If
							Mary Shelley intended to signify something through this coincidence, she certainly left no hint, and it has not been
							explained by commentators. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="749">
						<term target="#ignashed">I gnashed my teeth</term>
						<p>The same characteristic has been the subject of our recent focus, as Victor's anguished frustration in Justine's prison
							cell issues in this extraordinary physical reaction (I:7:27). Earlier we witnessed the same phenomenon when Victor was
							brought aboard Walton's ship (I:L4:10 and note), which, since it is an event almost contemporary with his present
							narrative account must give us a sense of how habitual this reaction has become; also how revelatory of psychological (and
							moral) disturbance it is. Two other characters engage in the same passionate behavior: the Creature (III:3:13) and
							Milton's Satan. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="750">
						<term target="#imagine">the imagination</term>

						<p>As has already been evident in earlier chapters, in Mary Shelley's perspective the imagination is a power at once of great
							dynamic force and ethically neutral in its operations, leading to good or evil ends depending on the psychological
							framework in which it exists. The darker side of this mental attribute has been especially invoked as events in the novel
							have taken a tragic turn: see, for instance, I:3:7 and note, I:4:18 and note, I:6:27 and note. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="751">
						<term target="#immense">immense mountains and precipices</term>
						<p>The reader observes a carefully registered journey from the beautiful into the sublime, from what Elizabeth has proposed as
							a domestic enclosure, warding off the unimaginable and protecting the family unit from threat, into another confrontation,
							at least for Victor, with elemental nature, with destruction and with fresh creation. The transitional point of this rite
							of passage is marked by the village of St. Martin in the Shelleys' account of their excursion to Chamonix in History of a
							Six Weeks' Tour. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="752">
						<term target="#imperfct">an imperfect and solitary being</term>
						<p>The Creature's enforced loneliness has been physically brought home to him, but that he should already conceive of himself

							exactly liberating stage of self-consciousness. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="753">
						<term target="#improved">I improved more rapidly</term>
						<p>This is a nice detail in itself but not wholly devoid of further import. However boastful the Creature may be about his
							advancement, the important point, and one that has been slowly dawning on the reader, is that he is extremely intelligent.
							Like his "father," he is superior to his fellow-students (I:3:2). With his great stature, his exquisitely fine feelings,
							and his mental quickness, he should have been equipped, in Victor's early aspiration, to be a "new species" (I:3:8) of
							superhuman being. Instead, he has been spurned. </p>

					<item n="754">
						<term target="#impulses">If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free</term>
						<p>Although Victor cannot know yet what is fully involved in his philosophical opinings, the questions of what constitutes

							the previous sentence, Victor is here in the process of unconsciously setting the stage for a major development in his
							education. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="755">
						<term target="#inclemen">the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man</term>
						<p>The Creature, who appears to educate himself by a process of progressive binary distinctions, here broaches his master

					<item n="757">
						<term target="#inhabits">the hapless fate of its original inhabitants</term>
						<p>The Creature and Safie alike bemoan the conquering of native Americans of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres by the
							various European imperial powers, who in many cases reduced the natives to a condition of slavery. The Creature's
							emotional identification with their fate is unself-conscious at this point, but the progress of his education is leading
							him to understand an fundamental similarity with their abjectness (see, for instance, II:9:5 and note). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="758">
						<term target="#injust">injustice</term>
						<p>There is a qualitative difference between this sense of injustice and what the Creature has felt earlier. Here, after doing
							a good deed, he has been been judged undesirable in a preemptive manner and physically punished. Thus, what festers
							mentally as well as physically is that a simple action to save a life has been met with a violent, life-threatening
							reaction from the larger society of human beings. He feels no longer merely rejected by this world but actively menaced. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="759">
						<term target="#insanity">a kind of insanity</term>
						<p>Victor will exactly echo this language at the very end of Volume 2 (Chapter 17 in the 1831 edition), in II:9:23. </p>
						<p> As he is superior to other human beings in stature and endurance, and finely tuned both emotionally and intellectually,
							perhaps we should not be surprised at the sublimity of the Creature's emotional outburst. Or, at least we should be no
							more surprised than we are at the inarticulate ranting of Victor Frankenstein when they meet on the Mer de Glace (II:2:6)
							or at the fury of Felix De Lacey (II:7:38), both of whom are the products of cultivated families and refined educations. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="760">
						<term target="#instinct">instinctively, finding myself so desolate</term>
						<p>In contrast to Victor, who through his intellectual obsession at Ingolstadt virtually sequestered himself from both family

					</item>
					<item n="761">
						<term target="#instruct">She instructed her daughter . . . religion</term>
						<p>As with the condescension to Justine's Catholicism (I:5:6, I:7:21), this ostensible religious bias needs to be placed
							within the conventions of English publishing and religious attitudes. It is unlikely that Mary Shelley herself subscribes
							to them. Indeed, if in this chapter one reads in the attitudes of Turks to women some sense of reflection on contemporary
							English attitudes, then, Mary Shelley would appear to be playing something of her mother's game. And the mother-daughter
							relationship here certainly testifies to that which Mary Shelley derived from the frequent perusal of her mother's
							writings, an inculcation of ideals of independence on which, like, Safie she was not afraid to act. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="762">
						<term target="#instrumt">an instrument</term>
						<p>This will be named as a guitar (II:5:3), when the Creature is sufficently educated in human ways to know the word for it. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="763">
						<term target="#intercha">interchange of kindness</term>
						<p>That the Creature's argument is wholly based on Englightenment premises about the function of virtue makes them practically
							irresistible. Here he invokes the golden rule as the single desire of his existence. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="764">
						<term target="#iought">I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed</term>
						<p>The Creature delivers a sudden telescoping and radical interpretation of the mythic text that stands behind this entire
							narrative, Milton's Paradise Lost. The point behind the Creature's distinction is that Adam fell by knowingly commiting a
							sinful deed, whereas Satan, in contrast, in this reading was intended to fall from heaven as an intrinsic part of the
							conception of God's new creation. Most readers of Milton's epic would not countenance a reading of Satan as more sinned
							against than sinning, but it is the general interpretation that Percy Bysshe Shelley offers in the famous passage of his
							"Defence of Poetry" devoted to the poem. Since that document dates from 1821, five years after the beginning of
							Frankenstein, however well it glosses the antagonism of Victor and his Creature, it ought not to be read in retrospect as
							explaining this usage. One might, however, wish to argue that the representation in Mary Shelley's novel either influenced
							her husband's interpretation or was worked out as a reading in tandem with him. Whatever the case, the emphasis is
							unmistakeable here, that the Creature sees himself as like Satan, "irrevocably excluded" from bliss, which—although Milton
							(in Satan's soliloquy on Mount Niphates, IV.32ff.) tries to finesse the issue—is how received theology forced him to
							represent the fallen archangel in his epic. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="765">
						<term target="#ipersuad">I persuaded myself</term>

						<p> Whatever self-examination Victor undertakes, he cannot appear to see what the reader does, that the same habitual
							obsessiveness regulates his thoughts, turned now, not on a scientific experiment, but on the inner landscape of the mind
							over which he pores with a customarily intense scrutiny. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="767">
						<term target="#ireliev">Thus I relieve thee</term>
						<p>Although the Creature here gains the bitter satisfaction of forcing Victor to confront his own responsibility for having
							created a being of such surpassing ugliness that he himself cannot bear his sight, at the same time this aggressive
							gesture imposes the threat of his great physical power upon his weaker creator. It sharply emphasizes the aesthetic
							problem he poses for human beings; but this gesture does not by any means seem limited solely to that end. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="768">
						<term target="#isatdown">I sat down and wept</term>
						<p>As in the infant grin with which the Creature greeted Victor after his birth (I:4:3) here again we are suddenly reminded
							that he is a newborn, signalling his wants by crying. But, cast off by his creator and forced to make his way into the
							world in utter solitude, his wants are so enormous that here we are perhaps intended by the similarity of diction to
							recall the timbres of one of the most famous songs of exile (Psalm 137) in the Western tradition. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="769">
						<term target="#isoard">I so ardently desire</term>
						<p>The same phrasing was used by the Creature to describe his obsession with learning to speak (see II:4:9). After all the
							variants on the term, applied to and linking the intellectual passions of Walton, Victor, and the Creature, the reader is
							hardly prepared to encounter it here in its primary sense, as an expression of uninhibited and undeflected sexual
							instinct. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="770">
						<term target="#italian">the Italian state which they inhabited</term>
						<p>From 1796, when Napoleon invaded Italy until 1814 when he was exiled to Elba, in fact, most of Italy was either under the

						<p>With telling artistic assurance Mary Shelley has the Creature, who up to this point has referred to himself only by

							himself as what King Lear calls "the thing itself . . . unaccommodated man" (III.iv.100). Perhaps, indeed, Mary Shelley

						<p>By this point in the novel, after two trials and an education in ancient and modern political science, this word may be

						<p>Perhaps the Creature comprehends that is he talking to a person from a long line of civic magistrates, or perhaps his plea

							consistently been touching on the nerve from which he at last gets a response. For the first time in his dealings with the

						<term target="#knowfeel">I know, I feel</term>
						<p>A highly resonant shift of language. Elizabeth is forced back on intuition in the same manner as Victor had been on his

							circumstantial logic, Elizabeth's intuitive knowledge of the heart seems a preferable means by which to organize—or to

						<p>This is the major departure from the 1818 text, indicative of Mary Shelley's wish to keep her novel concentrated not on

					</item>
					<item n="792">
						<term target="#lessons">the lessons . . . sanguinary laws of man</term>
						<p>The Creature means that the story of Felix's efforts on behalf of Safie's father and the ruination suffered by the De
							Laceys as a result have taught him how to manipulate the judicial system. Thus, his framing of Justine Moritz is
							deliberate. There is a further sense in which he has also framed the magistrate Alphonse Frankenstein to become
							complicitous in a grave injustice, but that solid upright citizen is never aware of it.</p>
						<p> A particularly brutal aspect of the "sanguinary laws of man" that the Creature did not learn from Felix but has discovered
							on his own is how to victimize women. In the 1831 text (II:16:35) Mary Shelley stresses that Justine is framed because she
							represents the type of Safie who fled in fear from his presence. In the revised text, then, the planting of the picture is
							a symbolic form of rape. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="793">

						<p>If the scene were less highly charged emotionally, this repeated challenge would bear comic undertones. That Mary Shelley

						<p>The Creature is an adept rhetorician, countering Victor's supposition about his original sin with a strict causality: evil

						<term target="#miserabl">miserable head</term>
						<p>In her customary way Mary Shelley plays on two meanings of the word. Victor uses it in a derogatory manner, denoting the

					</item>
					<item n="808">
						<term target="#misery">misery made me a fiend</term>
						<p>The Creature picks up the name Victor has just hurled at him and subtly recasts its point. From the first Victor has looked
							upon his Creature as essentially depraved, that is to say, evil in his very nature. The same issue hovers over the
							treatment of Justine Moritz, particularly by members of the Frankenstein household, in Chapters 6 and 7 of Volume 1. The
							Creature's rejoinder is constructivist: which is to say, that a sentient being is molded by material conditions. It is a
							position stoutly argued by William Godwin throughout Political Justice (1793). In terms of contemporary criticism of
							Frankenstein, this issue has a high visibility in all gender criticism. Beyond literary criticism per se, the terms in

						<term target="#mixture">a mixture of pain and pleasure</term>
						<p>This is a step in the Creature's education, related to his encountering pain and pleasure from a single source in fire

						<term target="#monsters">monsters thirsting for each other's blood</term>
						<p>The echo here is pronounced. Only two paragraphs earlier Victor had recounted his fear "lest the monster whom I had created
							should perpetrate some new wickedness." In Elizabeth's perspective, on the other hand, there is no alien being to consider
							as a scapegoat and in whom to localize and therefore objectify evil. Instead, the potentiality for monstrousness exists in
							all human hearts, and in their collective aggregate that is human society, as Justine's fate demonstrates, this
							monstrousness can be institutionalized as an underlying, unrecognized and therefore dangerous formation. In other words,

						<p>Like his Creator, the Creature is highly conscious of rhetorical effect. By this locution he may mean that he will now
							explain the ways in which his emotional involvement with the cottagers intensified, but he is also setting a signpost for
							our own engagement as readers with his text, as Victor has done before him (I:3:13) and will again attempt to do after
							completing his narrative (III:Walton:4). Through his contemplation of his effect, he raises anew the questions concerning
							truth and eloquence that are never far from from the novel's surface. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="815">
						<term target="#multipli">multiplicity of sensations</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley posits the Lockean notion that at first one's natural condition is that of synaesthesia, an indiscriminate
							intermingling of sense experience: only when the intellect begins consciously to analyze sensory data are they broken down
							according to the five diverse senses. The physiological basis for this development had been posited in the mid-eighteenth
							century by the French materialist philosopher Condillac, in his Traité des sensations. </p>
						<p>Deliberate synaesthesia is an artistic ploy often to be found among the English Romantic poets, in none more than Percy
							Bysshe Shelley: see, for instance, his poem of 1818, "Lines Written among the Euganean Hills," esp. line 285 ff. </p>

						<term target="#multitud">If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my

						<p>Thus, the Creature explicitly remarks what the experience of Justine's trial and execution had conveyed to Elizabeth, that
							men are universally "monsters thirsting for . . . blood" (II:1:8). This is exactly antipathetic to the tenets of
							disinterested benevolence Godwin had championed in his public writings (see Political Justice Book IV, Chapter 8 and
							elsewhere in that treatise) and in the instruction of his children. </p>

						<term target="#mutabili">mutability</term>
						<p>The third and fourth stanzas of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem, "Mutability," published in the Alastor volume in March 1816.</p>
						<p> The fairly conventional notions of her husband's poem seem at first to have little direct linkage with the circumstances
							into which Mary Shelley has thrust Victor at this juncture. But if one looks back over the landscape of the first volume,
							the operations of mutability as a force of destruction are everywhere evident—from the fearsome movements of sea and ice
							in Walton's letters, to the sudden deaths in the Frankenstein and Moritz households, to the unmerited reversal of
							Justine's fortunes. But mutability is also the very stuff of life. Perhaps then, most of all, the subject of the poem
							applies to the scientific paradigms that govern the development of the volume—in ancient alchemy (from the various
							transmutations it would apply to base metals to its search for a means of suspending mutability itself in the elixir of
							life); or in modern chemistry, which increasingly saw organic changes in terms of chemical transformations; or in
							contemporary electrical theory, where dialectical tensions between opposing poles were held responsible for the essential
							energy of life. A later poem of Percy Bysshe Shelley confronts these ambivalences more subtly and more directly, embedding
							them in a single symbolic force that is at one and same time both "Creator and Destroyer," the "Ode to the West Wind,"
							written in 1819. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="818">
						<term target="#mutual">mutual bonds</term>
						<p>Here one begins to get a glimmer of the impact of Safie's arrival on the Creature's thoughts, as he ponders his own need
							for a mutuality of feeling. The novel powerfully demonstrates that where there are not such mutual bonds, a form of
							bondage is substituted instead. Neither Victor nor his Creature is able to break away from the other, even if all that
							holds them together is their antagonism. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="819">
						<term target="#mycreatr">my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature</term>
						<p>The Creature's logic is direct and unambiguous, starting from a premise of obligation that Victor had totally expunged from
							his mind. Continuing the process by which he picks up on Victor's language and wholly recontextualizes it, now he asserts
							his right to be considered in the place of Adam, not, as Victor had tried to cast him in the previous paragraph, as Satan. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="820">
						<term target="#myfate">which would decide my fate</term>
						<p>The Creature's growing obsession with revealing himself to the cottagers may lack an external instrumentation, but

							his future in terms of destiny likewise echoes the discourse of the novel's other protagonists. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="821">

					</item>
					<item n="822">
						<term target="#myform">my form is a filthy type of your's</term>
						<p>There are occasions in this novel where the subtlety of the verbal patterning may leave readers shaking their heads. The
							Creature, alluding to the journal in which Victor describes the process of his creation, appears deliberately to echo the
							ugly language with which Victor had earlier, in marked aversion, recounted that experience to Walton. We are thus to
							suppose that Victor has been reusing phrases from that journal in his narrative. For his "workshop of filthy creation,"
							see I:3:9 and note. For his further reference to the Creature as "the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life,"
							see I:6:22. At the end of this interview Victor will revert to the adjective to characterize him once again (II:9:12), and
							the word then appears in the penultimate sentence of the 1818 volume translated into nightmarish proportions (II:9:23). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="823">
						<term target="#myimag">my imagination</term>
						<p>At first sight this appears to be an evocation of the imagination more in line with the normative practices of British
							Romanticism than earlier ones have been: the Creature in his isolation takes refuge in an innocent, even utopian world of
							his own making, one provided by the creative power of his imagination. This characteristic, almost more than any other so
							far encountered in his educational process, testifies to his fully human sensibility. From a more analytical perspective,
							however, such a refuge of the creative imagination shares the main attributes of Victor's introverted retreat at
							Ingolstadt, even to the point of opening the way to a sudden, disastrous reversal. </p>

						<term target="#names">I discovered the names</term>
						<p>The first definitions are of discrete things, which happen also to be the necessities of life. The Creature's education

						<p>Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him."</p>
						<p>So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to
							see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.</p>
						<p>The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for the man there was
							not found a helper fit for him.</p>
						<p>The last phrase of the Genesis text we will soon see applies to the Creature as much as it does to all of God's creation. </p>

						<term target="#nolonger">no longer that happy creature</term>

						<p>Elizabeth's sudden plunge into a maturity born of despondency was indicated in the last chapter of Volume 1 (I:7:25). Not

						<term target="#noonelov">No one could love a child more than I loved your brother</term>

						<p>For all Alphonse's attempt to console Victor, his being exactly wrong about the source of Victor's grief must be indicative
							of some narrowness or shortsightedness of his own. His son William is his only concern, and he assumes the same family
							priorities for Victor; but Victor knows that Justine has been murdered, too, and that more than tribal loyalty is at
							stake. That the father's commitment to the "public situations" (I:1:1) in which he has passed his mature years extends so

						<term target="#nopower">no power</term>
						<p>Victor's habitual passivity reasserts itself with a sharp irony that reminds one of the physical deterioration he suffered

						<term target="#noright">I had no right to claim their sympathies</term>

						<p>Given the novel's insistence on sympathy as an essential moral attribute of an individual human being and a just society,
							Victor's drawing away so wholly from normative family intercourse is an alarming event. That he is scarcely able to speak
							to his family suggests a psychological condition that in modern parlance would seem to border on psychosis. It is ironic
							that the Creature's passionate demand for an end to his solitude should result in Victor's own recoil into a solitude

						<term target="#notconsnt">I could not consent to the death of any human being</term>
						<p>As this sentence might suggest, Mary Shelley was opposed to all forms of capital punishment, a sentiment she shared with

						<term target="#notenter">I dared not enter it</term>
						<p>If it occurs to a reader to wonder why the De Lacey family did not hear of such a fearsome apparition in the nearby

						<p>To a later reader accustomed to the 1818 edition or to the customary biographical terrain of Mary Shelley's family

							seem to ring true to the general distance kept thus far between the characters and conventional religious expression. The
							reader has the choice of construing this interpolation as a sign of a shift in Mary Shelley's rhetorical palette to
							accommodate an early Victorian religious sensibility (which has been asserted by some critics). On the other hand, this
							could be interpreted instead as an attempt on her part to prepare us for the deep, if primitive, religious faith that will
							eventually be invoked by Victor to sanction his single-minded pursuit of revenge against his Creature. In other words, not

						<term target="#original">the original æra of my being</term>
						<p>To compare the creature's sense of his original identity with that contained in the opening sentence (I:1:1) of Victor

						<p>Although we have no guide to Mary Shelley's thought processes as she wrote this passage, it is probable that the stanza
							from Percy Shelley's poetry she quotes at the end of the paragraph caused her to think of another from the volume in which
							it was published (or the causality might have been reversed, with that other passage first coming to mind and prompting
							the remembrance of this stanza): whatever the case, this description of mountain conifers strongly resembles the desolate
							final scene, actually drawn from Shelley's experiences in Wales before he met Mary, of his poem "Alastor" (see lines
							550-70). An early sketch of this same subject is contained in a poem in the early notebook known as the Esdaile Notebook,
							a poem Shelley wrote in 1811 and never published, called after its first line "Dark spirit of the desart rude." </p>
						<p>On the other hand, the scenery of Switzerland, far more sublime than that of Wales, afforded ample opportunity for Mary
							Shelley to observe the desolation that alpine storms and glacial movement could visit on the pine forests of the
							mountains. There is a description of such shattered trees in Letter 4 of A History of Six Weeks' Tour. Byron offers
							another such passage in the second scene of Manfred, I.ii.66-74, which, though begun later than Frankenstein, indicates at

						<term target="#pl">Paradise Lost</term>
						<p>Paradise Lost, John Milton's epic poem, was originally published in 1667 in ten books, then revised by its author into the

							Europe, its impact on Frankenstein is major and discernible from beginning to end. In the immediate context of the
							Creature's discovery rather than of Mary Shelley's intertextual conception of her novel, however, what is most significant
							is how he reads the epic as a key to his self-understanding, even perhaps his self-fashioning. </p>

						<term target="#property">I possessed no money . . . property</term>
						<p>In England at this time a man without property had no vote: thus the very idea of citizenship, of having a "stake" in the

						<p>Again, the creature seems to echo Victor Frankenstein (though, since Victor's narrative to Walton postdates the Creature's

							foundation for its truth, we discover both Victor and the Creature seeking to establish the evidence that will verify
							their accounts and using almost identical language to do so. One may thus compare this utterance with those of Victor to
							Walton at the beginning (I:L4:30 and note) and end (III:Walton:2) of his narrative. That the "evidence" comes from the
							centrally embedded narrative, the story of Safie, is thus taken to lend credibility to all narrative strands that subsume
							it. But, of course, these putative copies of letters depend entirely on the Creature's word for their authenticity: so
							there is actually no documentary foundation whatsoever for the "truth" of any of these fictions. Still, it is indicative

						<p>Mary Shelley had herself to have been highly conscious of these attributes. Byron, even if he inherited his title almost by

							although somewhat down the hierarchical list of aristocracy, was the elder son of a baronet and would therefore have
							expected to inherit the title of his father, Sir Timothy Shelley. His family had an illustrious "descent," with Sir Philip

						<p>A remarkable difference exists, we must realize with something of a jolt, between the Creature's silent meditations in his

						<term target="#revenge">revenge</term>
						<p>With characteristic understatement, Mary Shelley places the two cousins in total contrast: Elizabeth through her sympathy

					</item>
					<item n="879">
						<term target="#right">as a right</term>
						<p>This is a distinction worth pondering. In general terms throughout the novel we have been allowed to relax in the notion of
							sympathy as a private, even domestic virtue, commensurate with compassion and affection. Questions of justice have been
							largely raised within public arenas or as involving the legal rights of individuals. Here, however, the larger issues of
							late Enlightenment democratic enfranchisement merge with private desire, as to an important degree they also do in the
							Constitution of the United States of America (1787), particularly as amended by the Bill of Rights (1789), or the
							Declaration of Rights of the French Constituent Assembly (1789) or that proposed by Maximilien Robespierre (1793) or,
							indeed, the radical Declaration of Rights written by the young agitator Percy Bysshe Shelley for distribution among the
							Irish in 1812. Sympathy thus has a political component to it. In the Creature's formulation God, or one who would assume

						<p>Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) by Constantin François Chasseboeuf, comte de Volney
							(1757-1820) is one of the geniunely radical documents produced in the early years of the French Revolution, a work that
							severely critiques all the reigning ideologies of the world—whether political or theological—and proposes their abolition.
							That the Creature should get his principal education into the institutions of modern culture from such a profoundly
							antiestablishment work must have a significant influence on his own subsequent distaste for human culture. But there is an
							ironic side to it as well, for Volney's attempt to create the blueprint for the new revolutionary man here falls on the
							ears of a uniquely revolutionary and wholly dispossessed individual. The first English translation of Les Ruines,
							published as The Ruins, or a Survey of the Revolutions of Empires (London: Joseph Johnson, 1792) was done by Godwin's
							close friend James Marshall. Volney himself thought the translation too tame and in 1802 oversaw a new English version
							published in Paris, which was reprinted frequently and became the standard conduit for his ideas throughout the

						<p>Although Mary Shelley puts no extra emphasis on this point, still it is significant that Safie, a woman with ambition and a

						<p>The crucial place of language in the Creature's education and in his growing sense of identity is a significant sign of the

							the novel, as the child, wife, and associate of other major authors of the age. And yet it is always shadowed by the dark

						<p>In his brief course of reading the Creature has encountered a surprising number of examples of alienation, martyrdom, and

						<p>The Creature's imagery tends to be poetic and generally, as is the case here or in his description of Safie's singing three

							interestingly, to be something of a cross between Elizabeth, with her love of nature, and Clerval, with his refined poetic

						<p>The reference is to the famous last lines of Paradise Lost in which Adam and Eve forever depart Eden (XII.646-49). That the

						<term target="#stifle">I tried to stifle these sensations</term>
						<p>The issue of self-control that has been an undercurrent throughout this volume here near its end surfaces as an important

						<term target="#strange">the strange system of human society</term>
						<p>However unthreatening such language may sound today, in 1818, with England racked by unrest and governed by reactionaries,
							these were what we might today call fighting words. They certainly signaled the anonymous author's radical sympathies to
							readers—and reviewers. This is the point in the novel where discerning readers, not knowing who the author was, would
							comprehend the significance of the dedication to William Godwin, whose Enquiry Concerning Political Justice of 1793
							remained the most radical analysis of "the strange system of human society" for the generation of his daughter. This work,
							rather than the more tempered redaction of 1798, when the extreme antiestablishment perspective of the original might have
							been taken for treason, in many respects underlies the Creature's sense of alienation, his understanding of the structured
							injustice that allows him no place in human society, and his recognition of endemic restraints upon individual
							self-fulfillment. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="913">
						<term target="#suchlove">such lovely creatures</term>
						<p>However this veneration of an ideal to which he might aspire testifies to the underlying human sensibility of the Creature,

						<p>The reiteration of this epithet, which has been applied to Justine (see I:7:29 and note) but also, in the sense that

						<term target="#survive">surviving brother</term>

						<term target="#sympath">I sympathized</term>
						<p>In accordance with Enlightenment social thought, notably the writings of the Earl of Shaftesbury and his many followers,

					</item>
					<item n="920">
						<term target="#sympath2">I sympathized</term>
						<p>Although the later writings of Percy Bysshe Shelley cannot be cited as indicating his influence here, still his Defence of
							Poetry is continually concerned with the moral impact of literature on its readers. There is one passage, in particular,
							that appears to gloss the psychological operations the Creature is experiencing in this first endeavor to enlarge his

					</item>
					<item n="921">
						<term target="#sympnec">sympathies necessary for my being</term>
						<p>The Creature's experiences have given a nuanced sense of the meaning of sympathy. It is not a superficial kindness or

					</item>
					<item n="922">
						<term target="#syndic">My papa is a Syndic</term>
						<p>The capacity to name, or abuse by naming—and to judge, or misjudge—are intimately allied throughout this novel. This is
							even truer of the stance one takes to the object of naming and judging. As William confidently assures the Creature, his
							father has been accorded the power to punish by this society: William adopts the same tone and attitude of natural
							superiority. Perhaps it was implictly present from the family expectations underscored in the first sentence of Victor's
							narrative (I:1:1) as well. Given the emotional chords that have resonated from William's death for eleven chapters and the
							epithets with which he has been honored ("little darling William" by Elizabeth [I:5:7], "that sweet child . . . who was so
							gentle, yet so gay" by Alphonse [I:6:3], "dear angel" by Victor [I:6:25]), his sheer childish nastiness surprizes us and,

					<item n="924">
						<term target="#tears">What did their tears imply?</term>
						<p>The logic of desire is played out through this paragraph to such an extent that, in the abstract at least, the answer to
							the question is already implicit in the disparity the Creature feels between himself and the De Lacey household. The
							thirst for perfection and incumbent awareness of personal inadequacy is a theme often encountered in the poetry of Lord
							Byron (e.g. Childe Harold's Pilgrimage Canto 4, 122ff.) and Percy Bysshe Shelley (e.g. "Lines Written among the Euganean

						<p>In a boating accident during the summer Percy Bysshe Shelley, who could not swim, fell overboard and sank to the bottom of

					</item>
					<item n="926">
						<term target="#terms">signification of those terms</term>
						<p>Here one senses the imprint of Godwin's method of progressively discriminating the necessary components of abstract ethical
							concepts. Virtue, and to a less degree vice, are repeatedly used as markers for social justice in the Enquiry concerning
							Political Justice, whose extended title continues as "and Its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness." Particular
							attention is paid to these concepts in Book I, Chapter 3 ("The Moral Characters of Men Originate in their Perceptions"),
							Book 4, Chapter 6 ("Inferences from the Doctrine of Necessity"), Book 4, Chapter 8 ("Of the Principle of Virtue"), Book 4,
							Chapter 9 ("Of the Tendency of Virtue"), and Book 5, Chapter 2 ("Of Education"). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="927">
						<term target="#thatcoul">that could not be</term>

						<p>This phrase carries a significant freight. Although it might be read as one more occasion in which Victor yields up his
							distinctive identity, substituting an obscure destiny in the process of fulfillment for his innate responsibility for
							events, in fact this necessity is driven by his own remorse, which is so acute that it can never be assuaged. Although he
							seems unaware of what he is doing, he is actually claiming responsibility for that destiny. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="928">
						<term target="#thaweful">the awful and majestic in nature</term>
						<p>The modern descriptive term for Victor's experience would be awesome. Although he dwells on how satisfying is this kind of
							response to nature (and in the third edition it is particularly accentuated), it is probably so because of its reliable
							alterity from his own situation. In a few paragraphs, with startling irony, he will have that dependability rudely broken,
							and the sublime will come directly home to the human who, thinking to master it, had fled from its tremendous power. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="929">
						<term target="#thedutys">the duties of a creator towards his creature</term>

						<term target="#thefiend">the fiend</term>

						<p>This is a new term for the Creature, in its extremity indicating how far beyond "all bounds of moderation" (as Victor puts

							paragraph. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="931">
						<term target="#themonst">the monster</term>

						<p>Although Victor continually flagellates himself for the deaths of William and Justine, yet the hardening of his language as
							a means of self-exculpation and displacing his guilt continues. As he interchanges "fiend" and "monster," he combines the
							diabolic and the unnatural to objectify and distance his Creature from the norms he accords his family. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="932">
						<term target="#thewret">the wretch</term>
						<p>Victor reverts, as if by instinct (or psychological regression), to the nomenclature in which he first invested his

					</item>
					<item n="933">
						<term target="#theyshar">they shall share my wretchedness</term>

						<p>Since this noun and its derivatives tolls like a bell through the novel after it is first used by Victor to name the

					</item>
					<item n="934">
						<term target="#thisfreq">This frequently took place</term>
						<p>It is now early spring, the first spring for the Creature, and he observes its characteristics without any previous example

						<term target="#thought">I thought him as beautiful as the stranger</term>
						<p>The additional element that Safie brings to the emotional dynamics by which the Creature learns what it is to enjoy a full

						<p>As earlier, Victor's histrionic sputtering, even as it testifies at once to the explosion of long repressed emotion and to
							his incapacity to handle the situation with which he is suddenly confronted, is also revelatory on a conceptual level. His
							mind is totally bound by the binary opposition of God and Satan in which he assumes not just creative godhead but also the
							right of judgment and particularly that of damnation, appointing this "fiend" and "devil" to the "tortures of hell." </p>

					</item>
					<item n="940">
						<term target="#toutter">to utter sounds</term>
						<p>Only at this point, at the end of the chapter, do we become aware that the Creature has, up to now, no ability to relate
							linguistically, that he is still operating on the non-verbal level of the sparrows and thrushes whose sounds he first
							discriminated (paragraph 4 above). Although presumably the De Lacey family speaks during the ongoing business of the day,
							except for the "few sounds" (paragraph 14 above) that were uttered by the young man outside the cottage and by the old man
							when his music elicited tears, this account is, as it were, rendered against a backdrop of total silence except for the
							interlude of music. Mary Shelley's artistic refinement in rendering this silence intensifies, in contrast, the importance
							of words and of communication for the world of her novel. </p>

						<term target="#transpor">in a transport of fury</term>
						<p>This phrase stands with a startling contradictory purity against the elder De Lacey's amiable platitudes concerning

							intellectual command by which he has restored his family's happiness and tranquillity. In a pinch Volney's ideal of an

						<p>This is the Creature's first sense of how he appears as a figure within a natural order. It is not a pleasant discovery to

						<p>As with her earlier treatment of Justine Moritz, Mary Shelley seems unable to keep a certain class bias from entering her

						<term target="#vacancy">blind vacancy</term>
						<p>The last word of Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Mont Blanc" is vacancy. In that poem the mountain is a "blank" slate upon which

							her beauty when, newly born, she happens to catch sight of her perfect form mirrored in a pool (IV.449-88). In both the
							novel and epic, though the effect is differently pointed in each, we read ironically against Ovid's account of the myth of
							Narcissus in Book III of the Metamorphoses. </p>

						<p>Although the Creature cannot interpret the subject of this conversation, the gestures should be sufficient for his

					<item n="959">
						<term target="#violent2">violently</term>
						<p>A few paragraphs before, the Creature was reintroduced to human society through observing "violent gesticulations." Now
							Felix is seized by what is clearly an instinctive and uncontrollable violence. This is the same youth who, inspired by the

						<term target="#virtue">that . . . virtue</term>
						<p>These lines, repeated by the Creature to Victor, apply directly to his conduct, indicting his lack of both foresight and

							mission fails. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="961">
						<term target="#virtues">the virtues that I once possessed</term>
						<p>The Creature acknowledges his fall from an original state of grace: "virtues" seems to be deliberately Miltonic diction,
							invoking Satan and Adam (and Eve). The Biblical context aside, this claim to a prelapsarian perfection is intended to
							remind Victor of his own high ambition (see I:3:8) and to affirm how well, on an internal if not external plane, it was
							realized. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="962">
						<term target="#wanderng">wandering beggars</term>
						<p>This is the Creature's first observation of human society rather than the life of nature, and it does not exactly accord
							with our normative sense of the civilized. Yet, a wandering beggar himself, he accepts this without wondering why it
							should be, leaving that question to the logical instincts of a reader with greater command over social institutions. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="963">
						<term target="#wanton">wantonness of power</term>
						<p>The Creature knows about the effects of unchecked power through the account of Safie's father's persecution (II:6:3) and
							the De Laceys' ruination (II:6:14), and he may have gleaned something of its underlying assumptions from William
							Frankenstein's instinctive reliance on his father's ability to punish arbitrarily (see II:8:27 and note). Yet, it is to
							Victor that the Creature speaks, and, since he has used a derivative of "wantonness" in his earlier condemnation (II:8:1
							and note), it is perhaps to that particularized sense of irresponsibility that he reverts here. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="964">
						<term target="#wasbene">I was benevolent</term>
						<p>This appears a deliberate echo of Victor's self-exculpating claim, "I had begun life with benevolent intentions," in the

					</item>
					<item n="965">
						<term target="#wasmonst">Was I then a monster</term>
						<p>Even to be able to ask the question suggests the extremity of alienation in which the Creature exists and the extent to

							force of logic that excludes the Creature from a recognizable place in the world. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="966">
						<term target="#weighed">weighed down by horror and despair</term>

					<item n="967">
						<term target="#werter">Sorrows of Werter</term>
						<p>Die Leiden des Jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of the Young Werter) by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) was originally
							published anonymously in Leipzig in 1774. Almost instantly it became a best seller, catapulting its young and unknown
							author into fame and a major literary career that would span more than half a century. By the end of the decade the novel
							had been translated into the other European languages, attaining a pan-European success that continued well into the
							nineteenth century: as late as 1892 it afforded Jules Massenet one of his greatest musical triumphs at the Paris Opera.</p>
						<p>The first French translation was published in 1777 as the work of C. Aubry, a pseudonym for Friedrich Wilhelm Karl, Graf
							von Schmettau (1742-1806), and it was frequently reprinted in that language. The first English version, by Daniel Malthus,
							was published in 1779 as The Sorrows of Werter, using the French text, rather than Goethe's original, as its base. </p>
						<p>The novel coincided with what has come to be known as the Age of Sensibility, whose flames it helped to fan. It is an
							epistolary novel, told in Werther's voice and from his perspective, and there is little in the way of plot. Charlotte, the
							oldest of six children, is left an orphan by the sudden death of her mother, and she marries the sensible, if somewhat
							plodding, Albert as a means of holding the family together. Onto the scene comes the young student Werther who is
							befriended by the couple but then falls passionately in love with Lotte. His infatuation progressively deepens to a point
							of desperation in which he commits suicide. The novel was said to be responsible for making suicide fashionable among the
							young men of Europe.</p>
						<p>What the Creature responds to are less the episodes of the plot or even the dynamics of infatuation than the sense of moral
							emptiness that Werther finds in the world and from which he turns for refuge to the somewhat maternal Lotte. Precociously
							intellectual with a late-adolescent intensity, Werther too seeks to understand his identity and to discover his place in a
							middle-class milieu that cares for little that is not prudent and sensible, the world represented by Albert. In reference
							to the particular dynamics of Mary Shelley's novel, this milieu would appear very much on the order of the temperate Swiss
							world of Alphonse Frankenstein and Henry Clerval's father. Thus, curiously enough, the novel establishes a link to
							Goethe's fiction both through the intense self-questioning and bleak alienation of the Creature as well as the obsessive
							behavior of his creator Victor Frankenstein, who also turns away from the commonplace Geneva expectations in which he was
							raised to fathom a new mode of being. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="968">
						<term target="#wertplut">I learned . . . thoughts</term>
						<p>The Creature turns from Goethe's novel of isolated sensibility, where he sees his own reflection (and we to some extent see
							Victor's) to contemplate the public and civic models of Plutarch's biographical accounts, engaging a world of social
							interaction and nation-building of which he has no experience whatsoever. Thus the accounts draw him forth from his own
							isolation to imagine a larger cultural sphere of action in which he might participate. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="969">
						<term target="#weshall">we shall be monsters . . . world</term>
						<p>That the Creature proposes to make a virtue out of necessity and embrace his alienation as a mode of existence indicates
							what two years of experience have cost him. The pathos of this declaration does not call attention to itself, but is all
							the more affecting. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="970">
						<term target="#whatcand">what can disturb our tranquillity</term>
						<p>Elizabeth's faith that a retreat from the world would allow the two of them a relief from the buffeting of experience is
							understandable, if sadly ill-placed. The ensuing chapters seem deliberately designed to test this hope both in their
							exemplary tale of a collective retreat (involving not just the DeLacey's and Safie, but the Creature as well) and in the
							very fact that, themselves taking place in an almost inaccessible retreat, they present Victor Frankenstein with a moral
							crisis of a kind he has never known and is unprepared for. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="971">
						<term target="#whatdest">what . . . destination?</term>
						<p>These might be said to be the root questions of all philosophy. They are in a substantial way the end toward which the
							progressive education of the Creature has been tending. That they are unanswerable has larger implications than for just
							him. They contribute to the exploratory tonalities of a novel that resists easy answers and unambiguous truths. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="972">
						<term target="#whenfals">when falsehood can look so like the truth</term>
						<p>Elizabeth's comparative innocence does not allow her the larger perspective held by the reader, who might want to apply the
							force of these words to the accruing series of contrasts between herself and Victor being offered by this paragraph. In
							his lack of candor, justice, and sympathy, Victor appears specifically to negate the virtues of Elizabeth, who stands here
							as something of an emblem for truth itself. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="973">
						<term target="#whnbecam">I was in reality the monster that I am</term>
						<p>A lengthy pattern of self-analysis and attendant self-alienation is implicit in this passage. The Creature's divorce from
							himself is linked to the imagery of doubling throughout the novel. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="974">
						<term target="#windings">continual and short windings</term>
						<p>American usage would substitute the word "switchbacks" for this locution today. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="975">
						<term target="#without">without bounds</term>
						<p>The repetition of "boundless" language from the previous chapter (see II:1:6 and note) emphasizes the point that Victor is,
							as ever, too "ardent," unable to moderate or even control his reaction. Whereas some earlier critics wished to enforce a
							facile dichotomy between Victor as rationalist and his Creature as the exemplar of sensibility, a passage like this
							reminds us of how little power Victor's capacity for abstraction actually has over the broad field of his mind.</p>
						<p> The Creature, as his narrative unfolds, will likewise represent himself through similar language as he experiences what he
							conceives to be a betrayal by his "adopted" family, the De Laceys. At that moment (II:8:12) in his recital he seems
							unconscious of the close similarity between the two of them. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="976">
						<term target="#wobeing">without being able as yet to understand or apply them</term>
						<p>That the Creature has as yet no notion of how words that define feelings can be applied suggests that the next stage of his
							education must be metaphysical, involving an understanding of the self and an exploration of self-consciousness. For him
							this will necessarily entail what Byron called "Consciousness awaking to her woes" (Childe Harold's Pilgrimage 1.941: st.
							92). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="977">
						<term target="#wretchd">the wretched</term>
						<p>"Wretch" is the first term Victor applies to his Creature (I:4:3), as well as his appellation for him at his reappearance
							in this chapter. It is apt that the creature thus picks up this resonant word and by shifting its form alters its meaning.
							For her debut as a novelist Mary Shelley adopts a daring and difficult but brilliantly successful strategy, keeping the
							Creature out of sight for most of Volume I while Victor heaps terms of abuse on his felt presence and renders him for the
							reader the monster he is wont to call him. The urbane calm of the Creature's opening statement, "I expected this
							reception," is a startling reminder of just how much Victor, in his narration of his story, has skewed the perspective on
							its events. In effect, the Creature takes the opportunity of his finally being heard to rename, to reconceptualize,
							himself. And the reader is left hanging in doubt—perhaps, even distrust—about rendering a verdict from having listened
							only to one side of the case. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="978">
						<term target="#youacuse">You accuse me of murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature</term>

						<p> As the Creature's terms have just implicitly placed Victor Frankenstein with the judges who have wrongfully condemned
							Justine Moritz to death, so here, he recognizes that Victor's easy willingness to commit murder, broached in the preceding
							chapter (II:1:6) and reiterated to the Creature himself (II:2:6), places him on the same moral plane as the being he
							accuses of having committed murder. If Victor does not yet recognize his identity with his creation, the Creature's plea
							is reinforcing their "ties" on every level possible. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="979">
						<term target="#yourduty">your duty</term>
						<p>Alphonse Frankenstein has so chastized Victor over his slippery sense of his family obligations that he ought to experience
							some confusion to hear his father's words echoed from the mouth of his Creature. In a world about to be turned
							upside-down, it would not be surprising if Victor's putative son were not in some odd sense to assume the role of his
							father. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="980">
						<term target="#youwrong">You are in the wrong</term>
						<p>No one, not even his father, ever speaks to Victor so forthrightly or with such categorical moral language. The diction
							picks up on the issue of what is a "right" from two paragraphs before. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="981">
						<term target="#acquaint">some acquaintances</term> This would appear to be an "in-joke." This region, of course, in Mary Shelley's day had
						become associated with the Lake Poets, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey, and was likewise the home of the soon-to-be-famous
						Thomas De Quincey, who had rented Dove Cottage from Wordsworth in 1809. Percy Shelley and his first wife Harriet had visited
						the region for several weeks in 1811, where they made the acquaintance of Southey and held long literary and political talks
						with him of the sort indicated here. This context might be indicated by the fact that it is Clerval in particular who is
						attracted to the region and his new acquaintance there. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="982">
						<term target="#actuated">actuated by selfish and vicious motives</term> On the face of it, Victor's honest admission that he has been impelled
						by less than disinterested motives must raise him in the reader's estimation, especially since he is close to his death and
						seems to be struggling for a truthful objectivity. Yet, a second glance at this phrase calls for its positioning, and we
						realize that Victor is referring to the last paragraph of his narration (III:7:26), uttered on 26 August, not three weeks
						before. If the last paragraph of his account is so indelibly tainted as Victor admits, what are we to think of what has
						preceded it? In other words, by what has his entire narration been "actuated"? If the whole rests on nothing but "selfish and
						vicious motives," then the textual indeterminacy so continually hinted at throughout the novel may in fact be radical. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="983">
						<term target="#adfrench">addressed me in French</term> For the third time in these Irish chapters (see III:3:29 and III:4:11) Mary Shelley
						emphasizes a multiple perspective associated with shifts in language. To some extent, she must be reinforcing our awareness of
						an essential affinity between Victor Frankenstein and Mr. Kirwin in matters of class and education. Yet, even as she evokes
						common bonds, she subtly reminds us of the differences that are lost in translation or that, on a larger scale, represent
						features by which we distinguish ourselves from others. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="984">
						<term target="#affect">the affections </term> In these late frames Victor's ramblings tend to touch on themes represented early in the novel
						and subsequently rather shunted to the side by the pressure of events. Thus, Victor's underscoring of the domestic affections
						as the arena for human life's most cherished actions reflects the nostalgic view of his childhood expressed in his first
						chapter (I:1:9, I:1:11) and strongly reinforced by his bitter recriminations over his withdrawal from this arena at Ingolstadt
						(I:3:12 and note). That the novel's actual focus is rather the opposite has been remarked more than once by critics.
						Certainly, the ultimate value of what on the surface appear to be peaceful domestic affections is thrown into question by the
						behavior of the cottagers to the Creature in Volume 2 (II:7:36) or the scapegoating of Justine conducted by the pious burghers
						of Geneva in Volume 1 (I:7:13). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="985">
						<term target="#againvow">Again do I vow vengeance </term> The sudden time shift into the present tense makes us realize how isolated from reality
						is Victor's conception of the universe. But, likewise, the religious overtones of this reiterated "vow," combined with
						Victor's sense that he is an instrument of divine retribution, must alert us to the irony by which the two beings, linked in a
						closed circle of revenge, are anything but redemptive in their endeavors. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="986">
						<term target="#agony">my agony was still superior to thine </term> The Creature's language recalls the diction of Victor Frankenstein's curse
						on him in the cemetery of Geneva where the Frankenstein family was interred (III:7:5), to which he responded with a "loud and
						fiendish laugh." This retrospective perhaps explicates that laugh; at the very least, it indicates that the agony Victor had
						wished upon him then was already the abiding condition of his existence. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="987">
						<term target="#allowed">I allowed . . . moment </term>
						<p> The oddly cavalier attitude toward grave matters pronounced just before in Victor's interview with his father (III:1:8)
							appears to deepen here. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="988">
						<term target="#almost">I almost felt . . . being </term> The "almost" by which Victor separates himself from moral responsibility contrasts
						sharply with the strength of his verb emphasizing sheer brutality. This language is commensurate with the burst of passionate
						violence in which he tore to pieces the second being on whom he had labored (III:3:4). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="989">
						<term target="#almostas">almost as imposing and interesting as truth </term> For a person of Walton's scientific pretensions, this is a
						remarkable phrase. As with other statements in these paragraphs, it bears a poised ambiguity in its significance, both
						justifying the super-natural as a realm of imaginative vision and casting doubt on its actual efficacy. Truth is, after all,
						here an unmodifiable standard by which all visionary comparisons are to be judged. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="990">
						<term target="#alone">I am quite alone </term> This image of existential solitude is the final allusion of the many in this novel to
						Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, "Alone, alone, all, all alone" (line 232). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="991">
						<term target="#aneye">An eye so full of lofty design </term> Admittedly, the reader will not wish to take such a phrase out of its context,
						nor wholly discount how impressed Walton himself is by his friend's intervention on his behalf. Yet at the same time the
						ambivalence in diction that has surrounded the functioning of eloquence since Walton resumed the narration (III:Walton:1,
						III:Walton:6 and note, III:Walton:12 and note) calls attention to this further instance of the double-entendre. "Design" may
						be a synonym for "purpose," the word Walton stresses just below, at the end of this day's entry; but it may also bear a sense
						of calculated histronics. The linguistic ambivalence allows Walton and his readers, should they wish, to derive opposite
						conclusions from the same evidence. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="992">
						<term target="#anguish">the anguish of recognition </term>
						<p> The phrase is suggestive of something beyond the mere identification of the body. Victor surely recognizes his
							responsibility for this death. Perhaps the extremity of his phrase is also intended to accentuate the point at which he
							finds himself looking, as it were, into a mirror, confronting a second self who has been murdered by a being who is
							likewise an extension of himself. The shock, as his reaction strongly testifies, is psychologically as well as physically
							convulsive.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="993">
						<term target="#apoplex">an apoplectic fit </term>
						<p> The OED defines apoplexy: </p>
						<p>A malady, very sudden in its attack, which arrests more or less completely the powers of sense and motion; it is usually
							caused by an effusion of blood or serum in the brain, and preceded by giddiness, partial loss of muscular power, etc. </p>
						<p>In modern parlance, this would be termed a cerebral hemorrhage. It is not certain that the term was applied so specifically
							in Mary Shelley's day. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="994">
						<term target="#appallin">I thought of Switzerland . . . appalling landscape </term> This description, though clearly conditioned by the rugged
						and mountainous islands to which Victor has retreated, is even more appropriate to the realm of transgressive power in which
						his scientific obsessions are centered. Whenever the sublime erupts in Frankenstein, the reader may expect its avatar,
						Victor's Creature, to make an appearance as well. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="995">
						<term target="#appear">appearance of the simplest truth </term> The emphasis on Victor's theatricality in the previous paragraph has insinuated
						the question of exactly where the truth may lie in Victor's account. Although Walton concentrates on the possibility that
						Victor's tale could be a complete fabrication, for the reader convinced of the Creature's existence this language also
						underscores the larger issue of the relativity of any individual's perception of the truth. The Creature's take on this story,
						as Walton will himself learn, is rather different from Victor's. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="996">
						<term target="#apple">the apple had already been eaten </term> Victor here construes himself in terms of the fallen Adam, by his transgressive
						actions forever barred from Paradise. The angel whose "arm [is] bared" is the figure Blake called "the Covering Cherub,"
						assigned to make certain that no return was possible: it is to be assumed that by this figure Victor identifies his Creature
						as an instrument of divine destiny. <p> See also Milton's description of this banishment in Paradise Lost, XII.632-44. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="997">
						<term target="#archangl">like the archangel </term>
						<p>The network of subtle allusiveness that has quietly identified Victor Frankenstein with Milton's Satan in Paradise Lost
							here rises to the surface of the text. Victor refers specifically to the climax of Satan's soliloquy on Mount Niphates:</p>
						<p>Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell; <lb/> And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep <lb/> Still threatening to devour me
							opens wide, <lb/> To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.<lb/> (IV.75-79) </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="998">
						<term target="#ardcrave">They were for ever ardent and craving </term> In the connotations of Mary Shelley's time, this phrase, in combination
						with the "impotent passions" described two sentences earlier, would seem to suggest that the Creature has suffered deeply
						during his existence from unconsummated sexual desire. Ironically, his desire for intercourse has been pure and unsublimated,
						whereas that of Walton and Frankenstein has been strongly channeled away from human interaction and into their respective
						projects (see II:9:9 and note). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="999">
						<term target="#ardesire">ardent desire </term> The resonaces of this phrase for both Victor (see I:2:7), his Creature (see II:5:7 and
						III:Walton:43), Walton (I:L3:1), and even the beneficent Mr. Kirwin (III:4:20) are another indication of how carefully Mary
						Shelley, in this final chapter of Victor's narration, is engaged in marking thematic unities across the various levels of her
						fictional panorama. "Ardent desire," though if untempered it can lead to a solipsistic irresponsibilty, is nonetheless an
						essential human principle. Its abrogation here, which will be reinforced by Victor's repetition of this disclaimer in his last
						moments (see III:Walton:28), indicates how whole is Victor's reversal from the student who undertook his career at Ingolstadt
						because he so "ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge" (I:2:7). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1000">
						<term target="#ardour">Embraced her with ardour </term> After the numerous uses of this word to express a passion deflected upon mental objects
						and self-destructive withdrawal from community (see II:1:6 and its omnibus note), it is almost shocking to have it at last,
						and ironically, function within its normative connotations: that is to say, to represent passionate love. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1001">
						<term target="#ardpray">ardently prayed </term> The language of ardor, earlier associated with the scientific pursuits of both Walton (I:L1:2,
						I:L3:1) and Victor Frankenstein (I:3:2, I:4:3)—where in the latter case it is tinged with something approaching the eroticism
						only fully expressed after the death of Elizabeth (III:6:9)—is here transferred into the arena of hatred. In Victor this
						hatred will constitute a passion as intense and single-minded as erotic infatuation. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1002">
						<term target="#ascfate">ascertain my fate </term> From the retrospect of later chapters in the novel this seemingly innocuous phrase might be
						seen as constituting something of a floodwater for what will become an increasingly powerful, inescapable driving force in
						Victor's comprehension of the world. At the conceptual core of this notion of destiny one finds combined, as here, a sense of
						his own incapacity to act independently, a passivity before what he construes as superior power, and an abnegation of
						responsibility for the actions of himself or others. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1003">
						<term target="#assign">mine is assigned to me by heaven </term> Victor's assurance of transcendental authorization for his murderous intentions
						has become so absolute that he never questions his aims or how they are thus assured. Unlike Walton and his crew, he is locked
						into a vision as rigid and unmoving as had been the icefield surrounding the ship. When it breaks apart, offering an escape to
						a renewed, living community, Victor chooses to revert to the closed and solitary circle of his vengeance. That decision
						insures, indeed, is virtually the equivalent of, the death that forestalls his further pursuit of the Creature. <p/>

					<item n="1004">
						<term target="#assizes">assizes </term> The Oxford English Dictionary, in its twelfth subsection under the substantive "assize," explains these
						courts of trial as follows: The sessions held periodically in each county of England, for the purpose of administering civil
						and criminal justice, by judges acting under certain special commissions (chiefly and usually, but not exclusively, being
						ordinary judges of the superior courts, or, after 1875, of the Supreme Court). It was provided by Magna Carta that the judges
						should visit each county once every year to take assizes (i.e. try writs of assize) of novel disseisin, mort d'ancestre, and
						darreine presentment (so that the jury who constituted the Grand Assize . . . might not be obliged to travel from remote
						corners of England to appear in court at Westminster). Thence the names assizes, and justices or judges of assize, still
						retained by these circuit courts and itinerant judges, after their judicial functions had been greatly extended in various
						directions, especially in that of the trial of felonies and offences. Assizes were abolished by the Courts Act, 1971; their
						criminal jurisdiction was transferred to the Crown Courts. Of course, Ireland in the eighteenth-century had not yet been
						joined administratively to the mechanisms of the United Kingdom as it would become with the Act of Union of 1801. But in
						practical effect the nominally independent country, in its administration of justice, modeled itself on the English system.

						become virtually instinctive. That he refers to the fishermen by the generic term "creatures" is instructive, since it

						<term target="#award">the award of justice </term> In the course of two trials and even in his final deposition to a Geneva magistrate Victor
						is exonerated from reponsibility for any criminal activity. Thus, this "award" is one that, in Victor's mind, exists beyond
						the checkered course of human justice. In a fine irony, it is only moments before he narrates the events of a trial from which

					<item n="1012">
						<term target="#bealone">and I be alone? </term> The faintly Biblical language in which the Creature speaks is actually derived, and it would
						seem significantly so, from Milton. The vocabulary reflects the scene in which Adam names the various, already-mated species
						of animals, then asks God why he should himself be left in solitude. See Paradise Lost 8.389ff. and 8.594. In context, then,
						the Creature is telling Victor that he has broken the contract that God had made with Adam. <p/>

						previous chapter with his enthusiastic reaction to the Rhine valley (III:1:19). His citing of both the beautiful and the
						sublime in this sentence may point the reader less to Victor—who sees himself no longer able to respond fully to either—than

						<term target="#burngush">with what a burning gush </term> The language of passion erupts at this point with a startling suddenness, as Victor
						begins to close with his Creature. That Mary Shelley expects her readers to sense some measure of perverse, almost abstracted
						eroticism in this "burning gush" might be inferred from her continual employment of the language of desire throughout the
						novel (for instance, the various forms of "ardour" and "ardent" she marshals with such skill) and the curious vacuum where one
						might anticipate passion in the relation of Victor and Elizabeth. <p/>

					<item n="1026">
						<term target="#burning">that burning hatred, and ardent desire of revenge </term> If it is really true that these striking oxymorons, in which
						hatred is expressed in the language of love, no longer impel Victor, they do reinforce the passionate cast of his diction in
						the last chapters of his narration (III:7:22 and note). The word "ardent" likewise reminds us of the use of that word to

						<term target="#callmad">they had called me mad </term> Just nine months before Elizabeth's death Victor, after the discovery of Clerval's
						corpse, had fallen into a delirium lasting two months (III:4:11). Even, after he had regained his reason, his ranting
						convinced his father that he remained truly deranged (III:5:5). The constant threading of this issue through the novel must
						remind Mary Shelley's readers that they are wholly at the mercy of this autobiographical narrative embedded in her text, a
						narrative told by a man introduced as "generally having an expression of wildness, even madness" to him (I:L4:10). It is more

						grave-robbing in the destruction of his family. The sudden reappearance of his Creature in such a location—the type, as it

					<item n="1033">
						<term target="#claims">greater claims to my attention </term> Victor seems to refer to the reasoning that brought him to suspend work on the

						substituting what appears to be a distinction between natural and unnatural life forms, or at least between a majority and

						<term target="#colonise">the progress of European colonisation </term> Scholars have debated how to construe this addition to the 1831 text of
						the novel. Given Clerval's seeming representation as a Shelleyan ideal, his desire to attach himself to the imperialist
						designs of Europe upon Asia would appear to have Mary Shelley's endorsement. And it should be said that this early in the
						growth of the British empire—long before the Afghan Wars (1839-42) and the Indian Mutiny (1857-59)—when the liberal-minded Sir
						William Bentinck was Governor-General (1828-35), the British saw their influence in the Indian subcontinent as morally benign.
						Still, the extent to which the imperial "native" is debased within this system has its corollary in the rejection of the
						Creature by Europeans wherever he encounters them. Likewise, earlier imperial projects are roundly condemned elsewhere in the
						novel: for instance, by Victor and by the Creature himself in his reaction to the reading of Volney's Ruins of Empires. <p/>

						<term target="#comcrime">the commission of a dreadful crime </term> As with the language with which he earlier speaks of these "remains,"

						<term target="#comeon">Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives </term> Indicative either of Victor's own deliberate
						reinterpretation of the Creature as his double in rewording the "inscriptions" left for him, or of the symbiotic way in which
						the Creature through the experience of revenge now sounds like a second self of Victor's, this phrase recalls the masculinist

						<term target="#command">commanded his countenance </term> The connotations of this verb, along with the panoply of described emotions

						Walton's language, however, coming immediately upon his assuming what purports to be a narrative objectivity, seems intended
						to have an even more pronounced effect on the larger audience of Mary Shelley's novel. Where Walton may feel he is
						experiencing an authentic emotionality, we in our greater detachment may wish instead to discern in Victor's recounted
						autobiography an accomplished actor's knowing manipulation of his subject matter and his audience. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1040">
						<term target="#compass">the tenderest compassion </term> In the see-saw effect of her characterization of Victor, Mary Shelley returns to the

						withdrawal from social obligations as by the pressure of catastrophic events, Victor is still able to sympathize with the
						plight of Walton and his crew and to offer encouragement to their hopes. Perhaps what would most easily explain this
						sympathetic posture, though it would not justify the optimism he expresses to them, is Victor's own deep sense of helplessness

						<term target="#comrades">many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave </term> These deaths once more testify to the contingent and

						peril and justifies its appeal to the captain to cut short his expedition. Although Walton expresses no guilt for the fate of
						these mariners under his command, one might wonder at its lack. Certainly, it is an odd paradox that the novel can concentrate
						with such intensity on the murderous consequences of the antagonism of Victor Frankenstein and his Creature but pass by
						without comment the revelation that Walton's enterprise in pursuit of knowledge has resulted in apparently greater death than
						has their destructive dynamic. <p/>

					<item n="1043">
						<term target="#conceal">I concealed . . . father </term> Increasingly, in this volume, Alphonse Frankenstein seems incapable of living with the

					<item n="1044">
						<term target="#conscien">the voice of conscience </term> Walton reveals just how much he has learned from listening to Victor's narration, which
						is to say, how much we have likewise learned from reading the novel. Confronting the Creature with a stern morality but also
						with compassion, Walton attributes fundamental human characteristics to him, insisting on his humanity and thus on his
						obligations as a human being. The Creature responds in kind, enumerating even more complexly shaded human attributes as
						fundamental to his constitution. This process of dynamic self-examination through human interchange may also be seen as a new
						element in his experience, eliciting a sense of self not as an alienated, and therefore unique and unaccountable, being, but
						as a sharer in emotions and social duties common to the human race. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1045">
						<term target="#continu">in continuation </term> At this moment of Victor's desparate exhaustion and extreme isolation, Mary Shelley tellingly
						reasserts the centrality of human continuity and connectedness. Her sudden reassignment of the role of narrator, from Victor
						to Walton, also alters its assumed audience. A ship's captain listening to the solitary voice of a dying refugee in the Arctic
						wilderness shares in that sense of impacted solitude. In contrast, the vicarious experience of Walton's sister, who is
						addressed directly in the next sentence and who presumably will read this transmitted account in London, takes place at the
						heart of human civilization. This inserted tag may have a second function as well, that of reinforcing the question posed in
						the last paragraph of Victor's narrative, whether Walton will honor his plea and continue Victor's obsessive pursuit of the
						Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1046">
						<term target="#correct">corrected and augmented </term> The question of narrative truth is here given a sudden new twist. As readers over the
						course of nearly three volumes containing Victor's narrative, we have come to assume that it is a straight-forward account,
						unmediated by another voice. Now we are forced to recognize that what we have read in this simple understanding has been twice
						edited, first by Victor, and then by Walton acting at Victor's behest. What Walton first wrote has in its second draft not
						only been "corrected," but "augmented," added to, leaving us with the uncomfortable feeling that mistakes could still survive
						in the text, or that they could have been accidentally or—much more worrisome—deliberately introduced in the process of
						editing, or that further areas for augmentation might still exist that, if properly elaborated, might materially change the
						focus of our perspective. In other words, Mary Shelley, having just merged two distinct narrative voices and their respective
						audiences, now further destabilizes her text as an embodiment of a fixed, immutably true account of its personalities and
						events. Our knowledge is indeterminate and relative, wholly dependent on those voices that filter it. <p/>

					<item n="1047">
						<term target="#counten">his countenance . . . treachery </term> A reader cannot miss how without basis is this "reading" of the Creature's
						facial expression. Victor has neither seen nor spoken to him for an entire year since their encounter on the Sea of Ice.
						Moreover, throughout the progress of the second volume, in the humanization attendant upon the Creature's autobiographical
						account, we had gradually lost sight of his objective physical deformity. Here, we are thrust back into an "objectification"
						that is so extreme that it allows Victor to relinguish all sense of humane obligation or fellow feeling. The
						self-righteousness that accompanies this distancing is perhaps to be expected. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1048">
						<term target="#courage">I could not collect the courage </term>
						<p> When one examines the chronology of this novel, Victor's inaction or procrastination or incapacity, however one
							denominates it, almost seems more its impetus than his earlier obsessiveness. After a six months' illness at Ingolstadt,
							Victor spends an entire year doing almost nothing there (I:5:15). Urgently recalled to Geneva by William's death, he is
							stopped for two days when he reaches Lausanne by a sense of undefined dread (I:6:14). Although he is certain of Justine's
							innocence, he is incapable of doing anything to support it and watches her trial and execution in helpless frustration.
							There ensues, as the first sentence of the second volume indicates, a "dead calmness of inaction and certainty" (II:1:1)
							from which Victor is roused by the expedition to Mont Blanc. In all, this trip takes just four days, and he returns from
							it to his family "passive to all their arrangements" (II:9:22). The way in which a sort of psychotic trauma wholly blocks
							the ability to act is likewise a major theme of Byron's Manfred (1817), which also grew out of the Geneva summer of 1816. </p>

					<item n="1049">
						<term target="#courage2">their courage would return </term> When they were hired on, the crew was specifically described as being "certainly
						possessed of dauntless courage" (I:L2:1). It is, of course, possible that Walton was wrong in his original estimation, or that
						the ordeal through which they have passed has sapped the men of their bravery. But it is also possible that Walton, driven by
						an obsession with a purpose to which he has devoted years and a small fortune, has misinterpreted the caution with which these
						seamen view the continuance of their mission. Twice in his early letters to his sister (I:L2:5, I:L3:3), Walton assured her
						that he would "do nothing rashly." His crew may simply be holding him to that promise. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1050">
						<term target="#creator">creator </term> In this phrase one hears an undertone, faint if ironic, of which Victor is wholly unconscious. There is

						the imperative posed by his Creature and his own obligations to his creation. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1051">
						<term target="#crimjudg">a criminal judge </term> Although time easily becomes blurred in this novel, the reader should remember that it is
						actually less than two-and-a-half years since the miscarriage of justice that resulted in Justine Moritz's execution. That
						Victor, who on that occasion condemned the entire criminal magistracy of Geneva (I:7:14), should now repair to one of them to
						justify his own murderous pursuit of his Creature underscores the intellectual distance he has traversed in the intervening
						months, as well as the extremity of his current mental state. <p/>

						whom was Wordsworth, who settled at Dove Cottage in Grasmere in 1799. When he transferred a few miles south to the more
						commodious Rydal Mount a decade after, Thomas DeQuincey moved in to Dove Cottage. In this day the Lake District, as celebrated

					<item n="1054">
						<term target="#curiocom">a mixture of curiosity and compassion </term> If Victor Frankenstein's dying injunction carries a weight equivalent to
						that of the law, what suspends Walton's obedience to it are attributes of our human constitution that, for good or for bad,
						actively resist a rigid legalistic construction. The law, which has persecuted both Justice Moritz in volume 1 and Victor
						Frankenstein in volume 3, is accorded no special privilege by this novel; but on the other hand curiosity, which has led
						Walton to endanger the lives of his crew (I:L1:2) and Victor to be blind to the consequences of his scientific obsessions
						(I:7:1 and note), seems deliberately to have been accorded a bad repute by Mary Shelley. Yet, for the author so to link it
						with compassion is to suggest an ethical likeness underpinning the two. <p> This similarity between sympathy and intellectual
							inquiry resonates as well in other writings of Mary Shelley and her husband. A central passage of Percy Bysshe Shelley's
							"Defence of Poetry" succinctly outlines the dimensions of this similarity and suggests why its terms might matter so
							deeply to these writers. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1055">
						<term target="#curios">senseless curiosity </term> This phrase represents another instance of the complexity of verbal resonance we encounter
						late in Mary Shelley's novel. It was, as Victor Frankenstein himself acknowledged, curiosity about the Creature he pursued
						(I:L4:11) that first animated the interest of Walton and his crew. In the very beginning Walton had characterized his driving
						passion as an "ardent curiosity" (I:L1:2), and it is this trait that most obviously links him with the obsessive scientific
						pursuits that Victor early on associated with the realm of the "lawless" (I:7:1). Yet, it is the same trait that compels
						Victor to listen to the Creature's naration (II:2:16) below Mont Blanc and that will restrain Walton from attacking him
						(III:Walton:38) upon his reappearance in the final pages. Thus, what leads to an antisocial solipsism can also be an
						instrument for transcending rigid barriers and reestablishing social relationships through sympathy. The strongly oppositional
						ways in which curiosity functions in the novel may suggest that this most human (and Romantic) attribute is inherently neither
						good nor bad, but is merely an instrument, neutral in itself, that should never be dissociated from our common "sense" of the
						ends it pursues. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1056">
						<term target="#curshell">I was cursed by some devil, and carried about with me my eternal hell </term> To what sort of devil can Victor be
						referring? Is it what, exonerating himself from responsibility, he described to his father as "some destiny of the most
						horrible kind" (III:4:41)? Or is it a more immediately relevant sense that the world of the dead, which in the previous
						paragraphs he has seen as impelling his mission of revenge, has a fundamentally diabolical association (III:7:5)? Or is it
						that he knows himself to be self-curst, as he earlier surmised at the beginning of the second volume (II:1:1)? Such an
						admission would involve acknowledging that the "devil" is an internal spirit. Certainly, the continuation of the sentence
						suggests such a recognition of the diabolical as a psychological state, for it returns us to the conclusion of the first
						volume, where Victor confesses that upon the execution of Justine Moritz he "bore a hell within [him]" (I:7:30). Once again,
						the context is supplied by Milton's Satan as he reviews his career in soliloquy on Mt. Niphates (see Paradise Lost, IV.73ff.).

					</item>
					<item n="1057">
						<term target="#daemon">the daemon </term> Such nomenclature has been absent from the novel since early in the second chapter (see, for

						larger-than-life, fantastic presence in his mind and in the representation of him. <p/>

						<term target="#danger">when you . . . danger </term> Compare with this the stanza quoted from Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" to

						helplessness, which will soon reach an extremity, becoming transformed into a catatonic physical state, will increasingly
						dominate the novel's late events. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1061">
						<term target="#delusion">The threat appeared more as a delusion </term> So heavily ironized has become Victor's existence by this point in the
						novel that he can entertain a notion of a wholesale inversion of reality without remarking on the distortion. The return to an
						actual reality will come, we can be sure, with a devastating finality. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1062">
						<term target="#desbarb">deserts and barbarous countries </term> As elsewhere in the novel (see III:3:1 and note) and in accord with contemporary
						usage, "desert" here means any wilderness. In classical references the land of the barbarians is generally construed as
						Scythia, which is the far interior of Russia. Fittingly, then, it is to that exact geographical region that Victor will pursue
						the Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1063">
						<term target="#deserts">deserts </term> The term is a generic locution for an area uninhabited by humanity (see II:2:13 and note). Thus, the
						Creature's plan to seek "the vast wilds of South America" is compatible with this meaning. <p> Compare the OED:</p>1. An
						uninhabited and uncultivated tract of country; a wilderness: . . . b. formerly applied more widely to any wild, uninhabited
						region, including forest-land. <p>See also Johnson's definition from the Dictionary of 1755: </p>
						<p> DESERT. n.s. [desertum, Latin.] A wilderness; solitude; waste country; uninhabited place. </p>Be alive again, <lb/> And

					</item>
					<item n="1064">
						<term target="#design">my demoniacal design </term> As "design" had an ambiguous sense in its recent application to Victor (III:Walton:18 and
						note), so here the reader is brought short by the Creature's assertion that his series of acts have been freely willed. The
						very adjective he employs embodies an internalization of Victor's demonization of him. Although he certainly bears
						responsibility for his acts through an abiding remorse, at the same time we are aware that he has been conditioned into the
						state of the demonic. To adapt the logic of his own rhetoric, negated as a human being, he has been recreated as a demon by
						the relentless scapegoating he has suffered. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1065">
						<term target="#destined">destined for some great enterprise </term>
						<p>Whether this is seen as an attempt on Victor's part to rewrite his initial account, as an overt expression of a megalomania
							earlier under firmer control, or as simply a more commanding perspective on his youthful passion, a comparison with the
							first chapter of his narrative (I:1:18) yields no sense of Victor's feeling singled out for accomplishment, but rather a
							somewhat wry recollection of a self-indulgent adolescence. Even his remove to Ingolstadt and the most advanced medical
							school of central Europe is a decision totally "resolved" (I:2:1) by his parents. It is true that Victor has consistently
							appealed to a ruling destiny (I:1:14, I:2:19, III:4:41) to justify the course of his life. Indeed, it could be argued that
							his narrative to Walton constitutes a writing of the plot of that destiny, so that by its end every event in his life
							appears logically necessitated. In that case the force of his autobiography would require that the early chapters be
							revised to accommodate this narrative necessity. Once again the reader senses in its capacity for revision an underlying
							instability in the text of the novel. This indeterminacy is finely underscored in the 1831 revision where "I believed
							myself destined" is substituted for "I felt as if I were destined." </p>

					<item n="1066">
						<term target="#detail">in proper detail </term> This remark may be seen as less innocent than it appears at first. Victor is about to recount a
						trial in which it is essential that he exonerate himself. On a more interior level of the discourse we as readers are privy to
						a second narrative, which is meant by Victor to exonerate the course of his life to Walton and, through Walton, to posterity.
						This comment, then, links up with other instances, both early and late in the novel, in which Victor's concern with rhetorical
						propriety shadows a desire to write history so as to reflect well on him (see I:L4:30, I:3:13, and III:WC:2 and III:WC:4).
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1067">
						<term target="#devil">Devil </term> Having called the creature both "dæmon" and "wretch" in the previous paragraphs, Victor naturally adds
						"devil" to his name-calling. In these paragraphs we observe both Victor and the Creature revert to the nomenclature of Volume
						2 to define their unchanging relationship. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1068">
						<term target="#devpass">the devouring and only passion of my soul </term> As is often the case, what appears at first to be an indulgence in
						gothic hyperbole on Mary Shelley's part on second glance bears a startling exactness. The passion of revenge has been truly
						devouring Victor from within. The more obsessively he devotes himself to it the more assuredly he pursues his own destruction.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1069">
						<term target="#diecast">The die is cast </term> As several editions of the novel have noted, this phrase was uttered by Julius Caesar when he
						crossed the Rubicon: it is quoted in the Life of Julius Caesar, the first of the Lives of the Twelve Caesars of Caius
						Suetonius Tranquillus. Mary Shelley read Suetonius in May 1817 while she was writing Frankenstein, so it is certain that she
						would not allude to this famous phrase without a sense of its actual context. Caesar goes forward to total victory, whereas it
						would seem in contrast that Walton returns in defeat. But perhaps the context is as ironic as that provided Victor's speech to
						the sailors by Dante's Inferno 26. In such a case we might want to read Walton's superficial defeat as cloaking a moral
						victory. <p/>

						carefully to hold up a mirror to his conduct. This stolid Swiss bureaucrat flattens four murders and the destruction of a
						prominent Genevan family into a matter of "disappointment" for Victor. It is little wonder that, after what he has suffered,
						he explodes in anger. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1071">
						<term target="#domcalm">our domestic calm</term>
						<p> Alphonse Frankenstein, more than any other member of the family, prizes a total seclusion from the world. This may be
							contrued as a result of his advanced years, but it does appear in sharp contrast to his long professional commitment to
							public service in Geneva. His desire for retreat is tied directly to that of the Creature, and Victor's unwillingness to
							satisfy the desire demanded by the Creature on Mont Blanc will likewise visit dire consequences on his father. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1072">
						<term target="#domestic">the tie of our domestic comfort </term>
						<p> Alphonse Frankenstein's foregrounding of domesticity may come as something of a shock after the Creature's long account of
							his life amid the sublime landscape of Mont Blanc. The aftershock is the realization that he is privileging the same
							exclusionary tribalism as Felix De Lacey. No more than the De Laceys could one expect the Creature to be adopted by the
							Frankenstein family. </p>

					<item n="1073">
						<term target="#drag">to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence </term> As, two paragraphs above, time distinctions suddenly fail and

					<item n="1075">
						<term target="#dread">dread, and yet be pleased </term> The delicacy with which Elizabeth recognizes Victor's possible ambivalence to an
						eroticized relationship with her has the paradoxical effect of alerting us to its rougher corollary in events of the novel of
						which she is ignorant. Translated from the level domestic plane in which she is centered to the sublime heights where Victor
						and his Creature struggle, this ambivalence might seem strangely akin to the intense love-hate dynamic in which that
						homosocial relationship plays itself out. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1076">
						<term target="#dreaming">I was dreaming until night should come, and that I should then enjoy reality </term> As normative time-frames lose their
						distinction at the beginning of this chapter and increasingly death comes to subsume life (see III:7:4), this further jumbling
						of reality and the world of dream seems particularly appropriate to Victor's slippage into a delusionary psychic state. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1077">
						<term target="#duties">the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties </term> That Victor, who has throughout the novel been unable to
						fulfill his duties to either his family or his Creature, should be able to speak in such measured terms of a balance among
						multiple duties is certainly an indication of the objectivity and even wisdom to which he may aspire when he moves outside his
						own narrow concerns. That he specifically steps back from the coercive tone by which he had earlier tried to enlist Walton as
						his agent in murder (III:7:26) likewise testifies to his rediscovery of a moral center in his last hours of life. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1078">
						<term target="#duty">This was my duty </term> This is paradoxically the only occasion in which Victor Frankenstein, without prodding,
						acknowledges that he had a duty toward the being he created. Earlier, we will recall, the Creature had himself to instruct
						Victor on this subject (II:2:7 and note). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1079">
						<term target="#dutymag">It is your duty as a magistrate </term> Victor, we should remind ourselves, comes from a long line of magistrates (see,
						e.g., I:1:1), and he has quite recently been on trial himself with the magistrate Mr. Kirwan leading his defence; so therefore
						it is clear that he perfectly well knows what their duties are. To state them so boldly to this judge requires something of
						his father's authority. <p/>

						<term target="#earlymar">an early marriage would at all interfere . . . utility </term>
						<p> We may observe how totally within a masculine prerogative lie the consummation, delay, or even the value of a marriage.
							Values like "honour and utility" are not to be thought of in relation to women's lives. Before questioning why Mary
							Shelley would adopt so seemingly unfeminist a posture, we should recognize that this is exactly how Mary Wollstonecraft
							saw the case: see, for instance, Vindication of the Rights of Woman (12.25). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1081">
						<term target="#elevmad">this elevation . . . madness </term> Again, Victor's excesses of language betray him. What if it were actually the case

						him into emotional tranquillity. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1082">
						<term target="#eloquen2">the power of his eloquence </term> Again, a reader senses how double-edged is the idea of eloquence in this novel. On
						the one hand, Victor's oratory energizes the crew in positive thinking and rouses them to their tasks. Without this
						invigoration their situation could degenerate into a laxity of spirit and effort perilous to their well-being. Yet, the
						emptiness of mere rhetoric is likewise emphasized here, since the courage roused one day gives in to despondency the next.
						Words relate to reality only tangentially or conditionally, and when the reality remains implacable, Victor's signifying words
						appear hollow substitutes for its unavoidable presence. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1083">
						<term target="#eloquen3">his powers of eloquence and persuasion </term> Walton refers to the last paragraph of Victor's narration (III:7:26 and
						note), forgetting, it would appear, his friend's later adjustment that he was then "actuated by selfish and vicious motives"
						(III:Walton:28 and note). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1084">
						<term target="#eloquenc">eloquence </term> In the very last paragraph of his narration (III:7:26 and note) Victor warned Walton to beware of mere
						eloquence, since the Creature's eloquence had once persuaded him to undertake a second monstrous creation to which on sober
						reflection he should not have agreed. Should we therefore construe Walton's faith in Victor's eloquence in similar terms? Or
						does it testify to the innate sympathy that eloquence forges between one human being and another? Again, Mary Shelley seems to
						raise major questions only to leave them wholly ambiguous in their import. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1085">
						<term target="#eloquent">He is eloquent and persuasive </term> Mary Shelley nicely returns us to the earlier concern with the relationship
						between eloquence and truth, between the representation of action and action itself, well aware of how the issue impinges both
						on her characters (particularly Victor's desire to vindicate himself to the world) and on her own art. <p> See also I:L4:24

						<term target="#endeav">endeavours to move the passions </term> As with the attention Walton gives to Victor's theatrical "command" in the
						opening paragraph of his resumed narrative (III:Walton:1 and note), we are here made conscious of how essentially manipulative
						(even if it could be argued to be not wholly intentional) is Victor's effort to insure that his perspective on events becomes
						the official record handed down to posterity. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1087">
						<term target="#enemy">demoniacal enemy </term> In the third volume Victor has increasingly come to refer to the Creature as a "daemon," thus
						not only dehumanizing him through an association with Satanic evil, but also, by conferring on the Creature a transcendental
						status, absolving himself as his Creator from any responsibility for his nature. In effect, linguistically, Victor is
						canceling his own role in the formation of the Creature. <p/>

						<term target="#ernest">Ernest</term>
						<p> Ernest is at this point about nineteen years old, and, whether or not he has followed his father's wishes and begun to
							study law, it is clear that he has not pursued his earlier inclination, as expressed in Elizabeth's letter to Victor at
							Ingolstadt (I:5:2), to eschew the public life and become a farmer. Whatever degree he contemplates, we can determine from
							this statement that he is undertaking some extended program of higher education at the University of Geneva. </p>

					<item n="1100">
						<term target="#ernlive">Ernest yet lived </term> This is the last reference to Victor's younger brother in the novel. He is left, a

						certainly to carry the family name forward solely by himself. He is the single survivor of the catastrophic history
						surrounding Victor Frankenstein. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1101">
						<term target="#events">the events </term> That Mary Shelley principally wrote Frankenstein, and certainly its third volume, while living in
						Marlow, near Windsor and not far from Oxford, might logically have suggested to her the value of inserting its local scenery
						and history into her novel. More pointedly, her own tribute to her father, in dedicating her novel to Godwin, would have been
						underscored by her including scenes associated with his most recent novel Mandeville, centered on the English civil war in the
						mid-seventeenth century. For this politically-minded group of writers (Godwin, Mary Shelley, P. B. Shelley), the civil war had
						been, first and foremost, a conflict of ideologies pitting aristocratic against republican values. Although a century and a
						half past, its political resonanace was far from muted in a reactionary political climate like England's during the Regency.
						Thus, the political undertones of this choice of scenery on Mary Shelley's part are unlikely to have been in any sense
						innocent. <p> That said, there is another salient reason for the British setting of the earlier chapters of Volume 3, which is
							the simple fact that the novel is designed for an English-reading audience rather unaccustomed during the years of the
							Napoleonic Wars either themselves to travel abroad or to respond with much interest to a continental setting as sweeping
							as that embraced by the first two volumes. In its final volume Frankenstein goes rather out of its way, as if designed
							according to formula, to embrace all three parts of the United Kingdom. </p>

					<item n="1102">
						<term target="#everlast">everlasting hatred </term> If we can believe that the Creature really used such language, then its very
						indistinguishability from Victor's, even down to the extreme hyperbole of the adjective, is another indication that at this
						late point in the novel, the two of them have become a single entity whose overriding passion is hatred and whose life force
						is provided by death. <p/>

					</item>
					<item n="1106">
						<term target="#examin">examining my past conduct </term> The plot of Frankenstein, with its insistent narrative mirrorings and doublings of
						character, seems always to be engaged in reexamining its own conduct, a process that contributes to the reader's skepticism
						about the truth of any single utterance by its protagonists. Here, in an epitome of this structural idiosyncrasy, we are told
						that Victor, after recounting his biography and then rewriting those parts of it he felt Walton had not succeeded in capturing
						in the manner in which he wanted them represented (III:Walton:4), has rethought the terms of his entire narrative and has
						revised it once more. That last revision, however, we will never read: the synopsis here presented does, however, differ in
						salient ways from the account we have been asked to accept as the truth. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1107">
						<term target="#excite">excitements to his vengeance </term> Walton is referring to Victor's own acute sense that the spirit world that guides
						him is vindictive (III:7:19) and exonerates him from normal codes of worldly justice or, indeed, responsibility for his acts
						as a member of society. Yet, the emphasis here on "his vengeance" suggests that Walton's apprehension is crucially different
						from Victor's own and serves to underscore the delusional, paranoid mentality that is now Victor's habitual mode of thought.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1108">
						<term target="#extnat">external nature </term> This sentence suggests that, in this novel, nature as a principle, as is often the case with
						Enlightement materialist philosophy, is carrying something of the freight associated with the deity in earlier religious
						formulations. Nature is acknowledged as an enveloping principle of reality, and Clerval's feeling for it marks both his
						largeness of mind and disinterested perspective. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1109">
						<term target="#fairy">Fairy-land </term> This is the mature figure who at the age of nine wrote a fairy tale that captivated his friends

						<term target="#falkland">the amiable Falkland </term> Sir Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland, was one of the principal Cavaliers in the service
						of Charles I. He died at the Battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643. His name and exalted notion of honor were, it would
						appear, used by William Godwin as models for the hero-villain Count Ferdinando Falkland of The Adventures of Caleb Williams.
						Today Falkland's fame is sustained by his serving as one of the subjects of Ben Jonson's enduring tribute "To the Immortal
						Memory and Friendship of That Nobel Pair Sir Lucius Cary and Sir H. Morison," one of the first true odes in the English
						tradition. <p> The somewhat surprising emphasis on royalist values in this paragraph is suggestive of a historical politics
							far removed from that elsewhere insinuated into Frankenstein (see, for instance, II:5:16) or shared by Mary Shelley with
							her father and Percy. These references are perhaps best explained within the context of the novel William Godwin published
							about a month before Frankenstein appeared, Mandeville: A Tale of the Seventeenth Century in England. The protagonist of
							that novel is an ultra-Royalist who, as his cause deteriorates, retreats further and further into morbid self-obsession.
							The emotional dynamics of Mandeville, if not the portraiture itself, are consonant with the psychological makeup of Victor
							Frankenstein. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1111">
						<term target="#family">I was delighted . . . family </term>
						<p> The phrasing here makes Victor sound cavalier and shallow, no longer responsive to the weight of the universe he had felt
							after his encounter on Mont Blanc (II:9:19). His aim seems less to complete a difficult assignment than to procrastinate
							as long as possible. Whatever one might argue in extenuation of his motives, it seems clear in this passage that he gives
							no thought whatsoever to the Creature's well-being. Perhaps it was with some sense of mitigating these unflattering
							character traits that in 1831 Mary Shelley revised this passage to suggest a greater degree of responsibility on Victor's
							part. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="1114">
						<term target="#fellow">I seek not a fellow-feeling in my misery </term> We notice that the Creature closely follows the course of linguistic

					</item>
					<item n="1115">
						<term target="#feltsuff">felt . . . other sufferings. </term> The context, as earlier in the chapter (III:3:7), here once again brings to mind

					</item>
					<item n="1116">
						<term target="#fever">fever </term> With this characteristic reversion to physical collapse we are reminded of how precarious has been
						Victor's physical and mental stability since his obsessive researches at Ingolstadt (see I:4:17). Only a few months before his

					<item n="1117">
						<term target="#fever2">a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes </term> Victor has been described as feverish since his collapse following

						<term target="#fisher">The fishermen called to one another </term> In this extreme silence the intrusion of human sounds not only testifies to
						the ongoing processes of everyday life, but reminds us that even in the farthest reaches of the globe human beings establish a
						basic community one with the other. These sounds from the darkness at once remind us of the Creature's yearning to participate
						in such a community and reinforce Victor's total self-exclusion from its claims. Moreover, surely there is an intentional
						irony here pitting the productive labor of the fishermen, who in turn depend upon it for their sustenance, against the
						long-postponed and now aborted labor of Victor, who is financially free of such necessities, as well as the lack of productive
						community in which the Creature is forced to exist. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1124">
						<term target="#fit">a fit of enthusiastic madness </term> Although one of the definitions in Johnson's Dictionary describes the substantive
						of this word as "any violent affection of mind or body," in general the connotation emphasized is the temporary state of the
						affliction. In contrast, Victor's enthusiastic obsession was years in its gestation, and it was succeeded by another, more
						lethal obsession with the destruction of the being he created. In other words, though the madness he admits to may have taken
						several forms, it has been unremitting since he entered upon his studies at the University of Ingolstadt. As Victor's diction
						appears to mitigate its force, it suggests that even now, in his final assessment, he is unwilling fully to engage his own
						culpability. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1125">
						<term target="#flying">flying to solitude </term> Elizabeth's seemingly innocent expression is remarkable for the extremity of its depiction.

						in the previous chapter (III:1:21), it is hard not to hear in this phrase the timbres Wordsworth addresses to his sister in
						that poem (lines 116-19). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1127">
						<term target="#freechoi">your own free choice </term> The inclusion of this resonant diction seems intended to establish a linkage between the
						personal and more public conceptions of responsibility that can be traced through the novel. Although Victor, and recently his
						father too, think of him as haunted by a destiny over which he has no control (III:4:43), Elizabeth's language is firmly
						rooted in the primacy of choice in all human relations. Her rejection of a male concept of honor here seems to link it to
						stereotypes of behavior that at once shackle the will and suspend the individual's ultimate responsibility for actions and
						their consequences. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1128">
						<term target="#frenzy">enthusiastic frenzy </term> Earlier in his recital Victor remembered his compulsive application in Ingolstadt as
						"ardour" and thought his "enthusiasm" then to be essentially innocent (I:3:8). The symptoms noted there all return here,
						although their neurotic character is now much more firmly marked. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1129">
						<term target="#friend">I have longed for a friend </term> Walton looks back to the desire expressed in his second letter to his sister (I:L2:2)
						and reiterated to Victor Frankenstein (I:L4:25), who replied in despondency over the memory of his dead friend Henry Clerval
						(I:L4:26). In reinstating that wish, Walton reminds us of how very little time has actually elapsed in the narrative frame of
						the novel as well as of how violent and destructive such intense relationships can become when they are based on hatred rather
						than affection. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1130">
						<term target="#friendsh">friendship </term> As with other aspects of Clerval, his capacity for "devoted," which is to say, perfectly
						disinterested, friendship separates him as an ideal, both for Victor (who from his student days has been too self-absorbed for
						such friendship) and for Walton, whose desire for such a friend, articulated in his second letter (I:L2:1) and in his growing
						attachment(I:L4:21) to Victor, first introduced this theme as central to the structure of Mary Shelley's novel. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1131">
						<term target="#fulfill">to fulfill my wishes and my destiny </term> Victor, apparently deluded into believing his desires and his destiny the
						same, does not notice the double connotation to which his phrase is susceptible. His wishes are, indeed, for a happy,
						prosperous marriage; but the destiny he has marked out for himself is exactly opposite, to suffer ruin. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1132">
						<term target="#fury">fury </term> As with the other terms of this loaded paragraph, this word, when contemplated from the reader's
						perspective of Victor's biography, bears connotations by which it is unlikely he would have wanted himself represented. In
						essence, as he gives himself over to the raw fury of his rage, Victor seems to be acceding to the madness that has become
						progressively more accentuated in his account. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1133">
						<term target="#generous">generous and self-devoted being </term> In a novel in which oxymorons have increasingly come to represent implacable
						ambivalences, this summary of Victor Frankenstein stands out as an epitome. If readers should wonder whether it is really
						possible so to overlay what appear to be opposite constructions, a scrupulous respect for earlier connotations of the terms
						will sharpen the meaning if not wholly dispel its ambiguities. Dr. Johnson's Dictionary (1755) lists these meanings for
						"generous": <list type="simple">
							<item>Not of mean birth; of good extraction. </item>
							<item>Noble of mind; magnanimous; open of heart. </item>
							<item>Liberal; munificent. </item>
							<item>Strong; vigorous. </item>
						</list> It is clear that the third, which is the customary modern sense of the word, would be generally inappropriate to the
						figure that Victor Frankenstein has cut in this novel, but either of the other three meanings would in one phase or another of
						his existence adequately characterize him. The main thrust of the Creature's meaning is probably the second. Even here,
						however, some readers might wish to cavil, asking whether, given Frankenstein's ambitions and good intentions but customary
						self-enclosure, it would be possible to retain a nobility of mind without being greatly magnanimous or open-hearted. <p> With
							"self-devoted," the range of possibility is even greater and likewise is further from a modern, loose conception of the
							term as meaning "devoted to one's self." The three definitions of "to devote" in Johnson's Dictionary are: </p>
						<list type="simple">
							<item>to dedicate; to consecrate; to appropriate </item>
							<item>to addict; to give up to ill </item>
							<item>to curse; to execrate; to doom to destruction </item>
						</list> All of these definitions have a bearing on Victor Frankenstein's character, even simultaneously so, but in the context
						of the Creature's expression of "wildest rage," an attribute mirrored between him and his creator, the last of the definitions
						would seem to bear a particular relevance. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1134">
						<term target="#genial">I, the native of a genial and sunny climate </term> The atmosphere of the third volume of the novel, with the exception
						of the honeymoon excursion along Lake Geneva, has been so far from genial that the reader is enjoined at this point to recall
						the original balancing of the novel, in which the civilized bourgeois world of the Frankenstein household represents the
						beautiful against the sublime of Mont Blanc and the Creature whom Victor encounters there in the second volume (II:2:5). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1135">
						<term target="#ghastly">A ghastly grin </term> This is only the second occasion in which the Creature is perceived smiling (the first is in
						I:4:3), and in each case Victor interprets an expression of pleasure and anticipation as alien, even diabolical. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1136">
						<term target="#gigantic">a gigantic monster </term> As this paragraph suggests ("the fiend" . . . "the fiend" . . . "a gigantic monster"), the
						creation of an abnormal identity through naming has become wholly habitual on Victor's part. We have here, however, one last
						indication that, wherever the Creature goes, he is immediately accorded the status of monster by the human beings he
						encounters. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1137">
						<term target="#giving">in giving the life and spirit </term> There is no little irony in this phrase, since Victor has already in a material
						sense, given "life and spirit" to his Creature and even to his Creature as "enemy." Given his manifest failure on the level of
						the actual, his desire to succeed on the level of the merely textual may be understandable, but it is no less morally
						problematic. Having the last word must be a poor substitute for acting with foresight and responsibility in the first place.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1138">
						<term target="#glimmer">the glimmer of two eyes </term> This is an unmistakeable reference to "Alastor," the poem Percy Bysshe Shelley published
						in March 1816 a few months before the excursion to Lake Geneva. The protagonist of that poem is haunted by the two eyes of a
						"veilèd maid" (line 151) of whom he dreamed and whom he subsequently pursues to the end of his life. As he dies his last
						glimpse is of "two lessening points of light [that] / Gleamed through the darkness" (lines 654-55), an all-consuming ideal
						that is the ironic cause of his destruction. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1139">
						<term target="#glorious">glorious creature </term>
						<p>The shading here seems deliberately suggestive of Milton's Satan. From the very first, the Satanic legions sense that the
							fall from heaven has diminished their spiritual essence, and, as in these early words of Satan's chief follower Beelzebub,
							that loss is expressed in terms of "glory." <lb/>the mind and spirit remains <lb/> Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
							<lb/> Though all our glory extinct, and happy state <lb/> Here swallowed up in endless misery. (I.139-42) The most
							resonant identification of diminished glory with the fall of the angels is uttered by Satan as he soliloquizes atop Mount
							Niphates at the opening of Book IV. There, as he addresses the Sun, the fallen archangel directly contrasts himself and
							God in terms of their manifestation of glory. <lb/> O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned, <lb/> Lookest from thy
							sole dominion like the God <lb/> Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars <lb/> Hide their diminished heads; to
							thee I call, <lb/> But with no friendly voice, and add thy name, <lb/> O Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams, <lb/>
							That bring to my remembrance from what state <lb/> I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere; <lb/> Till pride and worse
							ambition threw me down <lb/> Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King. (IV.32-41) </p>
					</item>
					<item n="1140">
						<term target="#gnashed">gnashed his teeth </term> The Creature manifests the likeness of himself to Victor by replicating an act the reader has
						already identified as characteristic of his creator: see also I:L4:10, I:7:27, and note. The Creature had earlier gnashed his
						teeth when shot by the father of the girl he rescued (see II:8:20 and note): then, as here, he vowed revenge. <p/>

						<term target="#greeks">The Greeks wept for joy </term>
						<p>Mary Shelley refers to the account of the long Greek retreat from Armenia in Xenophon's Anabasis, 4.7, quoted here in the
							translation of Carleton L. Brownson (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1918): </p>
						<p>{329}<lb/> [18] Leaving this land [of the Chalybians], the Greeks arrived at the Harpasus river, which was four plethra in
							width. From there they marched through the territory of the Scythinians four stages, twenty parasangs, over a level plain,
							and they arrived at some villages, and there remained for three days and collected provisions. </p>
						<p> [19] From there they journeyed four stages, twenty parasangs, to a large and prosperous inhabited city which was called
							Gymnias. From this city the ruler of the land sent the Greeks a guide, in order to lead them through territory that was
							hostile to his own. </p>
						<p> [20] When the guide came, he said that he would lead them within five days to a place from which they could see the sea;
							if he failed to do so, he was ready to accept death. Thus taking the lead, as soon as he had brought them into the hostile
							territory, he kept urging them to spread abroad fire and ruin, thereby making it clear that it {331} was with this end in
							view that he had come, and not out of good-will toward the Greeks. </p>
						<p> [21] On the fifth day they did in fact reach the mountain; its name was Theches. Now as soon as the vanguard got to the
							top of the mountain, a great shout went up. </p>
						<p> [22] And when Xenophon and the rearguard heard it, they imagined that other enemies were attacking in front; for enemies
							were following behind them from the district that was in flames, and the rearguard had killed some of them and captured
							others by setting an ambush, and had also taken about twenty wicker shields covered with raw, shaggy ox-hides. </p>
						<p> [23] But as the shout kept getting louder and nearer, as the successive ranks that came up all began to run at full speed
							toward the ranks ahead that were one after another joining in the shout, and as the shout kept growing far louder as the
							number of men grew steadily greater, it became quite clear to Xenophon that here was something of unusual importance; </p>
						<p> [24] so he mounted a horse, took with him Lycius and the cavalry, and pushed ahead to lend aid; and in a moment they heard
							the soldiers shouting, "The Sea! The Sea!" and passing the word along. Then all the troops of the rearguard likewise broke
							into a run, and the pack animals began racing ahead and the horses. </p>
						<p> [25] And when all had reached the summit, then indeed they fell to embracing one another, and generals and captains as
							well, with tears in their eyes. And on a sudden, at the bidding of some one or other, the soldiers began to bring stones
							and to build a great cairn. </p>
						<p> [26] Thereon they placed as offerings a quantity of raw ox-hides and walking-sticks and the captured wicker shields; and
							the guide not only cut these {333} shields to pieces himself, but urged the others to do so. </p>
						<p> [27] After this the Greeks dismissed the guide with gifts from the common stock -- a horse, a silver cup, a Persian dress,
							and ten darics; but what he particularly asked the men for was their rings, and he got a considerable number of them. Then
							he showed them a village to encamp in and the road they were to follow to the country of the Macronians, and, as soon as
							evening came, took his departure. </p>

						<term target="#grin">A grin was on the face of the monster </term> Careful attention to detail here renders Victor's account dubious. With
						all lights extinguished so that the room is only illuminated by the moon, it would appear next to impossible for Victor so
						sharply to distinguish a visage that would be backlit in such circumstances. Neither the Creature's own narration in the
						second volume nor his account of his struggles with Victor Frankenstein at the end accords with such a perspective of fiendish
						exultation in evil. This portrait is, however, wholly commensurate with Victor's increasing tendency to demonize the Creature.

					<item n="1146">
						<term target="#grtcrime">some great crime </term> The reader might well wish to contemplate the oddly contradictory character of this

						psychologically he finds himself in a limbo of uncertainty and incapacity, haunted by a dread he can neither escape nor

						<term target="#hadmoney">I had money with me </term> This is not, perhaps, so innocuous a statement as it at first appears. Why should such a

						not be surprising to see this remark as a recasting of his fine distinction between truth and the "willing suspension of
						disbelief" in literature (see Biographia Literaria, Chapter 14). But, in fact, there is no assurance that Mary Shelley would
						have come upon the formulation in time to have inserted it into the novel. P. B. Shelley is recorded as having finished

						Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto 3, stanza 45ff.: see particularly his summary in stanzas 59-61. Clerval prefers the beautiful, with
						its humanistic overtones, to the sublime with its otherworldly and supernatural associations. It is indicative that he centers

						<term target="#havre">Havre </term> Le Havre is a principal seaport of Normandy: Mary, Shelley, and Claire Clairmont embarked for England from
						Le Havre when they returned from Geneva in September 1816 . The town would have held more than a tourist's interest for Mary.
						Her mother Mary Wollstonecraft had moved to Le Havre to escape the Terror of 1794: there she wrote her Historical and Moral
						View of the Origin and Progress of the French Revolution and gave birth to her daughter Fanny Imlay, Mary's half-sister, in
						May of that year. <p> In the 1831 revision Mary Shelley has Victor and his father sail directly from Dublin to Le Havre,
							avoiding the lengthy coach journey across England in the 1818 novel. This, perhaps, reflects a more sophisticated sense of
							the historical geography of the British Isles gained after her return to England in 1823. Over many centuries Ireland had
							maintained a commercial and cultural exchange with France that flourished independently from the frames of reference in
							which the British viewed the power that was increasingly its major antagonist. Napoleon's attempt to capitalize on the
							Wolfe Tone rebellion of 1798 underscored the dangers implicit in Ireland's independent foreign relations, leading directly
							to the Act of Union of 1801 in which Ireland was assimilated to the British crown. </p>

					<item n="1153">
						<term target="#heart">my heart . . . escape </term> By this time in his experience Victor might have learned to distrust such a state of
						self-induced euphoria. It is literally the case that every time he indulges himself in such a light-headed sense that he has
						escaped his "destiny," he is suddenly caught up short by a new misfortune. (See I:5:17 and II:2:1). <p/>
					</item>

						<term target="#hellish">the cursed and hellish monster </term> The rhetorical overload here may be considered an appropriate expression of what

					</item>
					<item n="1156">
						<term target="#hidnar">what remains of my hideous narration </term> The sharp suspension of narrative line here coincides with a self-regarding
						emphasis on story-telling of a sort that we have witnessed earlier (I:L4:30, I:3:13). Such a mirroring of the function of
						narrative will become a dominant motif in the late pages of the novel. This act of doubling seems to entail another,

						acknowledging that all his talk of and even reliance on a sense of special destiny is empty of signification. If there is no

						from the effects of nursing Elizabeth Lavenza through an adolescent attack of scarlet fever (I:2:2) and that Justine Moritz,
						in her turn, contracts the disease from attending on Caroline Frankenstein and herself falls "very ill" (I:5:5) as a result.

						<term target="#holyhead">Holyhead</term>
						<p>Holyhead, on the island of Angelsey, which lies off the northwest coast of Wales, in the eighteenth century had developed

							kilometers of the Irish Sea intervening. Since, however, Anglesey was an island, passengers still had to negotiate the
							treacherous Menai Strait linking it to the mainland. In 1810 Thomas Telford was commissioned at this site to build the
							first suspension bridge in the world as part of a modernization of the coach road to Holyhead.</p>
						<p>Mary Shelley never traced this itinerary, but Percy did, both going to and returning from his Dublin adventure via Holyhead

						<term target="#honour">honour </term> Honour is a concept that, until now, has figured only modestly in this novel. One earlier reference,
						however, might be construed to have a bearing on Walton's present insistence on its claims. This comes in Elizabeth's letter
						of commiseration to Victor about his illness while in Ingolstadt. There she testified to her accord with Ernest's desire to be
						a farmer, though it were a less "honourable occupation" (I:5:2) than that of a judge. In her letter the idea of honour is tied
						to social and class hierarchies, perhaps as well to distinctions between gender roles. It is clear that in Walton's eyes his
						crew are, to return to Victor's formulation (III:Walton:17), lesser men than they would be if they were possessed of a sense
						of honorable duty to the cause to which their master has committed them. <p/>

						<term target="#hover">I will hover near </term> Victor is transforming himself into the alastor, the evil spirit, that has been his own
						guardian spirit through this chapter. But what he foresees is grisly, himself as one of the living dead, a zombie haunting the
						ongoing processes of life among the living. Remarkable as it may seem, this final vision is, in effect, an image of one last
						Creature let go from his hands as a free and frighteningly independent agent on earth: himself. Perhaps, however, that was
						what he became from the point at which he matriculated at Ingolstadt and entered into the world of his obsessions. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1165">
						<term target="#howhappy">how happy and serene all nature </term> It appears in this novel that whenever the serenity of nature is emphasized
						(I:5:17, III:3:6), the sublime power represented by the Creature is introduced to disturb its tranquillity. Before, however,
						it was Victor who felt the effect of this natural profusion. Here, clearly, Elizabeth is identified with a natural beneficence
						that Victor over the course of the past five years has all but forsaken. What distinguishes her examples is the ability she
						demonstrates to see all elements in motion; in their varied relations with one another; and in their distinct particularity,
						whether distant and high (Mônt Blanc) or near and deep (the bottom of Lake Geneva), rather than according to some reductive
						model by which they are made identical and rendered inanimate. One senses here a very different conception of nature from that
						manifested by Victor as scientist. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1166">
						<term target="#howl">a howl of devilish despair and revenge </term> A further instance of Victor's reconstruction of the Creature's emotions
						as diabolical so as not to have to confront their actual nature. The howl represents, indeed, a reaction of despair following
						an entire year's attentuated expectation, a year spent in solitude and without any other hope. In turn, that understanding
						tends to ironize Victor's own emotional dependency on Clerval during their trip. Both creator and creature are here at last
						equally alone in their solitude, unconsciously prepared to transfer their entire gamut of emotional needs into a single-minded
						pursuit of the other's destruction. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1167">
						<term target="#howlit">how little do you know me </term> The return of Alphonse Frankenstein to the narrative center of the novel brings with
						it the vexed tension between father and son observed in the early chapters when Victor was an adolescent. Victor's silence
						here, of course, is of no advantage in bringing Alphonse to a better understanding of his by-now adult scion. Perhaps the
						son's reticence is meant not just to mark his fear that the truth of his guilt would not be countenanced by his father but
						also to implicate this strained history between them. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1168">
						<term target="#howmany">how many days have passed </term> Victor has gone from a collapse of time distinctions (as in III:7:4) to an inability
						to differentiate time itself. The entrance onto the ice field seems to remove him from all normative structures of human life.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1169">
						<term target="#humsymp">human sympathies </term> This sentence carries an interestingly pointed balance. Everywhere in the novel, in accord with
						Enlightenment values, human sympathy is marked as the foundation for personal and social happiness. Here one infers that Mary
						Shelley recognizes that even this virtue can lead to a measure of self-absorption in the merely human, at the expense of an
						external reality principle embodied in nature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1170">
						<term target="#husband">a husband, and lovely children </term> Until this very late point in the novel we have only been able to assume that
						Margaret Saville, because of the difference in her surname, has a husband. With this confirmed, we discover as well that she
						has children. One reason Mary Shelley may be supplying this information now would be to justify the emotional intensity of
						this outpouring in which Walton in solitude and dire straits reaches out to his only family connections. But by the same
						token, that connectedness contrasts pointedly with the situation in the Frankenstein household, where when the novel ends only
						Ernest, who would seem to have little to recommend him beyond being a dull and regular fellow, will survive its events. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1171">
						<term target="#icalled">I called on him to stay </term> In their monosyllabic simplicity these words constitute the moral center of Mary
						Shelley's novel. Against all his prejudices as Victor's friend, against his repugnance to face a multiple murderer, against
						his basic human instincts that revolt from such sublime ugliness, Robert Walton wills himself into a state of ethical
						selflessness that is truly benevolent. The Creature's "wonder" at this unique experience in his existence is only to be
						expected. He has never before been confronted by human inclusiveness. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1172">
						<term target="#icould">I could send . . . illness </term> The normative expression of sympathy by which Mr. Kirwin reestablishes connections
						that Victor has all but severed emphasizes the extremity of Victor's withdrawal from the society of those who have loved him.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1173">
						<term target="#icurbed">I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness </term>
						<p>"By the utmost self-violence": Victor lacks the modern vocabulary that would term this act mere repression. He likens it to
							suicide, an active, even extreme, assertion of violence against the self. Yet again, the reader may wish to ask, which
							self is it that he would destroy, that of the Creator or of his extension who has destroyed those whom Victor loves? The
							doubling of selves is insistent even where, as here, it is merely insinuated.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1174">
						<term target="#ignorant">ignorant </term> This is a word with considerable resonance by this point in the novel. Victor has carefully kept Walton
						ignorant of the process by which he created life, and, moreover, excoriates him when he suspects Walton of wanting to
						penetrate his secret (III:Walton:3). He dies clearly wishing that he had himself remained in a state of innocent ignorance.
						Although it is likely that, upon reflection, Walton will broaden the range under which he construes knowledge to embrace a
						moral education, here he limits its conception wholly to scientific discovery. In his dejection he seems to have gone out of
						his way to miss the point of Victor Frankenstein's narration, which is itself truly a mark of his ignorance. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1175">
						<term target="#ihadconv">I had been conversing with several persons in the island </term> The episode remembered by Victor is not noted in the
						previous chapter. There, the events of the night before Victor departed "[b]etween two and three in the morning" (III:3:24)
						are wholly unremarked. Clerval's body was discovered approximately four hours earlier, some time after 10 o'clock. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1176">
						<term target="#imagdred">imagination was dreadful </term>
						<p> This is a further example of the dark tones in which the Romantic imagination is painted in this novel, resembling earlier
							cases where an isolated mind is confronted with a radical uncertainty. For earlier instances pertaining to Victor, see
							I:4:18 and note; II:1:8 and note; for a similar construction on the part of the Creature, see II:4:17 and note. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1177">
						<term target="#imagin">the strangest tale that ever imagination formed </term> There may be an element of self-puffery by Mary Shelley in this
						statement, yet it is surprisingly prescient in its sense of the cultural impact her novel was to have. Moreover, it is
						entirely consistent with the way both she and her husband represented the work to its public. Percy Bysshe Shelley, writing
						the Preface to the original edition of Frankenstein, distanced this novel from any attempt at "merely weaving a series of
						supernatural terrors," insisting on its adherence to the higher aims of the "imagination." Similarly, Mary Shelley, in writing
						the Introduction to the third edition, stresses how in its initial conception her "imagination, unbidden, possessed and
						guided" her. That all these statements are congruent with one another and with an exalted notion of the Romantic imagination,
						however, cannot alter the ironic context in which this particular phrase is uttered. In the previous paragraph we have been
						observing Victor Frankenstein, who was once swept along by his imagination to create a deformed and alienated being, revising
						with soberly rational care his account of that act and its consequences. The actual context for this phrase in the novel would
						thus appear to offset its perhaps expected paean to the imagination. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1178">
						<term target="#imaginat">my imagination was vivid </term> Victor's remembrance alters the emphasis of his earlier account, which contrasted his
						own interest in facticity with Elizabeth's (and Henry Clerval's) delight in the imagination (I:1:9). However much he may be
						inflating the record here, the reader cannot but be aware of the ambivalence about the nature of the imagination expressed in
						these lines. That Victor once "trod heaven in [his] thoughts" cannot mitigate the hellish misery to which he has now sunk, nor
						even at that earlier point in his remembrance could it guarantee that the outcome of such an introverted elation would have an
						essential value. The imagination, in this analysis, might be necessary for great achievement, but by itself it is by no means
						sufficient, being merely an instrument, and, as such, easily capable of indulging a self-absorbed solipsism. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1179">
						<term target="#immersol">immersed in a solitude </term> This statement makes very clear that, for Victor, solitude carries psychological
						consequences of considerable and dangerous weight. From this point on for many months, with only the briefest exceptions,
						Victor will be trapped in a kind of solitary confinement. What begins as a figurative condition, indeed, will become an actual
						physical fact. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1180">
						<term target="#impulses">my first impulses </term> The repression of instinctive response continues as Walton, deeply mindful of the solemn and
						reiterated injunction of Victor Frankenstein to exact vengeance upon his Creature, hesitates before the presence of the other
						being. In essence, he substitutes a reality for an abstraction, his own actuality for the vicarious experience provided by
						Victor's narrative. Implied in this act is the priority of individual responsibility for independent judgment. That Walton is
						preoccupied by his "impulses" in the plural may indicate how difficult, complex, and responsive to particular circumstances
						such a judgment must be. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1181">
						<term target="#inherit">a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth </term> This addition to the 1831 text recalls the changed circumstances by which
						Elizabeth enters into the Frankenstein household, as the natural daughter of a revolutionary Milanese aristocrat who had been
						imprisoned by the Austrian government and had had his property confiscated (see I:1:9) for being too ardent in the cause of
						his country's liberty. Although Alphonse Frankenstein's dealings here might be construed as an honorable, duty-bound attempt
						by a citizen of a neutral nation to right a wrong and restore to Elizabeth what had been rightly hers, it is hard to imagine
						Mary Shelley, who abhorred the Austrian occupation of Italy and represented Elizabeth's true father as "nursed in the antique
						glory of Italy," not thinking this detail commensurate with the essentially conservative, state-oriented political views
						Alphonse exhibits elsewhere (see, for instance, I:1:1 or I:6:44 and note). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1182">
						<term target="#injust">injustice </term> In his petulance Walton equates justice to his crew with injustice to himself. That larger,
						disinterested justice is, however, the stronger ethical position, as Walton himself understood when his crew presented its
						case to him earlier (III:Walton:16). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1183">
						<term target="#inquiry">inquiries concerning an event </term>
						<p> The diction Victor uses suggests that it is less having to inform mutual friends of Clerval's death than his sense of
							culpability for it, with the attendant need to exonerate himself, that drives him to avoid his English acquaintance, and
							perhaps some in France as well. However we construe his hesitancy, Victor's total rerouting of his itinerary here is of a
							piece with his progressive withdrawal from human society and normative social obligations. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1184">
						<term target="#instdart">instantly darted into my mind </term> Every detail of this scene seems meant to impress on those observing it that
						Victor's purchase on reality is tentative at best. The closed circle of logic in which his mind revolves leads him to
						conclusions that, on the face of it, would seem ludicrous: in this case, the supposition that Mr. Kirwin would be opening the
						door to Victor's Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1185">
						<term target="#interest">interest for my guest </term> Where the first paragraph may lead Mary Shelley's readers to question the uses (and
						abuses) of writing, the second quickly reminds us of its effects in reinforcing human sympathy and community. Walton's concern
						for Victor is, of course, a measure of his responsiveness as well and therefore of consequence for our estimation of his
						character. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1186">
						<term target="#irish">the Irish </term> Improbably, Victor has floated some hundreds of miles. Moreover, as we discover in the next chapter he
						is not the only one who has traversed the open seas southwest of the Orkneys to land on the northeast coast of Ireland.
						Although it has been suggested that including Ireland in the expansive geographical range of the novel may be Mary Shelley's
						means of honoring her mother, who served as a governess there, the strangeness of this repositioning of setting has never been
						adequately accounted for. <p> From Victor's reference to "a line of high land" (III:3:26), we may suppose that Mary Shelley
							has in mind geological features like the Giant's Causeway, a line of huge islets, or the cliffs of Fair Head. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1187">
						<term target="#irksome">company was irksome to me </term> Victor's rationalizations for his withdrawal from social interaction have an obvious
						logic to support them. Still, that this characteristic retreat within reasserts itself even where he should feel most diverted
						by his novel surroundings indicates a dangerous state of mental health. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1188">
						<term target="#isis">the lovely Isis </term> The Upper Thames River is called the Isis as it flows through Oxford. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1189">
						<term target="#itwashe">it was he . . . nurse </term> Mary Shelley's emphasis is delicate but marked. In his several months of illness and
						misery it appears that only late does Victor recognize that there are medical costs that had to be borne by someone. He has
						focussed critically on the quality of the care without inquiring who had accepted the expence on his behalf. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1190">
						<term target="#iwillnot">I will not </term> The reader may have forgotten, but certainly Victor Frankenstein has not, that he deserted the ice
						floe on which Walton's crew had discovered him and boarded the sailing vessel only because its course lay to the north, the
						destination toward which his pursuit of the Creature was leading him (I:L4:8). Now that Walton's ship veers to the south,
						remaining aboard can no longer serve his purpose, which is as single-minded in its vengeance as ever. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1191">
						<term target="#journal">the journal of Clerval </term> Lacking the journal of Clerval, we will have to settle for that of Mary Shelley, who
						traversed this route in 1814 and published it in her History of a Six Weeks' Tour just before Frankenstein. At that time the
						point of departure for the Shelley party was Basel. <p> Yet, that we lack Clerval's journal might in context seem strange. The
							entire novel is based on the presence of an overload of documentary information that includes the letters of Alphonse
							Frankenstein and Elizabeth Lavenza, the journal letter of Robert Walton, his representation of Victor's narrative
							(dutifully "corrected" by Victor), which in turn contains the Creature's narrative, which is, in part, attested to by the
							letters of Felix that the Creature promised to leave with Victor when he finished. If we lack this last piece of evidence,
							however, we do not lack its effect on the narrative, since Victor here calls attention to the nature and quality of
							Clerval's writing. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1192">
						<term target="#jura">Jura opposing its dark side </term> The Jura massif runs to the northwest of Geneva and serves as a natural barrier to
						an armed adventure from neighboring France. This is clearly a reference to the French invasion of Switzerland in the spring of
						1798, when, it must be said, the Jura wholly failed in this protective office. Still, why such a strong political sentiment
						should be intruded by Victor Frankenstein at this point is not readily explicable. Perhaps what the reader is intended to
						recognize is that Victor's distancing himself within a political context allows him to forget the last time all these features
						of the landscape were brought together by him in a single perspective, the night he first encountered his Creature outside
						Geneva (I:6:17). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1193">
						<term target="#justice">in justice, or even in possibility </term> Questions of justice have entered this novel from various directions,
						spanning the Creature's plea for a mate (II:9:2, II:9:8) to the condemnation of Justine Moritz (I:7:1). What may be most
						interesting about Walton's invocation of the term is his implicit understanding of the notion of disinterested equity, a
						notion wholly absent from the closed circle of antagonism in which Victor and his Creature exist. For Mary Shelley to
						introduce such a concept this late in the novel might suggest an effort on her part to establish an ethical code by which
						readers can take the measure of the novel's characters and events. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1194">
						<term target="#lakes">I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri </term> Mary Shelley's History of a Six Weeks' Tour recounts her visit to
						Lucerne and Uri. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1195">
						<term target="#landscap">a singularly variegated landscape </term> Although Mary Shelley depends for the description here principally on her own
						observations, Byron's representation of the Rhine landscape as a point in nature where one might observe a symbolic
						reconciliation of opposite powers in harmonious symmetry (see Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto 3, stanzas 59-61) seems to
						touch her conception here. That representation, in any case, would not be far from her mind, since it was written in the
						summer of 1816 and, indeed, when the Shelleys returned to England they carried the manuscript of the poem with them. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1196">
						<term target="#language">that language </term> Victor's sudden reminder of the instability of language throughout the novel also serves to link
						linguistic difference with the notion of an alienated identity, a condition that from now on he will share with his Creature.
						The Creature's vow to make Victor equally miserable first unfolds on a psychological plain. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1197">
						<term target="#lastaut">last autumn </term> This is another sign of the mistaken chronology at this point in the narrative. The previous autumn
						Victor spent awaiting his trial. What Elizabeth is referring to is actually the late summer—the aftermath of the August trip
						to Mont Blanc—of the previous year. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1198">
						<term target="#laudanum">a small quantity of laudanum </term> This revelation helps greatly to explain Victor's manic changes of mood, from
						almost delirious emotionality to an impassive lethargy. Laudanum, a form of liquified opium, was a narcotic freely available
						in the latter part of the eighteenth century. In those days its usage lacked the social stigma that would be attached to it by
						later cultures and it was commonly employed in all stations of society. Thomas DeQuincey's Confessions of an English
						Opium-Eater was published in its first version in two installments of the London Magazine in 1821, three years after the
						publication of Frankenstein, making his literary reputation overnight. Percy Bysshe Shelley seems to have used laudanum to
						dull the pain of the chronic nephritis from which he suffered. Mary Shelley, however, was also well aware of the more
						consequential abuses to which laudanum lent itself. Her half-sister, Fanny Imlay, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft and the
						American Gilbert Imlay, committed suicide by an overdose of laudanum in November of 1816, while Mary Shelley was still in the
						early stages of her novel. Thus, this detail must be seen as colored by that tragic event. At the very least, it is a further
						indication of the deep instability of Victor Frankenstein's mind at this juncture of his career. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1199">
						<term target="#lead">I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger </term> Despite the bitter dejection recorded at the beginning of this entry to
						the letter, Walton recognizes the essential justice of a contract mutually agreed to and refuses to use the arbitrary
						authority contemporary law put in his hands to force the mariners to fulfill his purposes. The emphasis on the adverbial
						"unwillingly" carries political as well as ethical connotations. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1200">
						<term target="#lessons">the lessons of my father </term> Victor is at this point twenty-five years old and seemingly beyond the necessity of
						instruction in the nature of human affairs. The distance, in attitude and experience, between father and son stands without
						comment, although Victor's silence at the beginning of this scene of patriarchal instruction is indicative of how unbridgeable
						we may presume has become the gap that divides them. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1201">
						<term target="#letters">the letters of Felix and Safie </term> These were the letters Safie wrote Felix imploring his aid in the rescue of her
						father from prison and that she had translated from Turkish into French. In recounting this episode, the Creature had promised
						to give Victor the copies he had made of them (II:6:7), and this offhand reference suggests that he did so. The logical
						completion of that strand of the narrative does not, of course, explain just why Victor Frankenstein, embarked on an odyssey
						of epic proportions where he can scarcely provide himself with the essentials of life, is carrying the translated
						correspondence of a perfect stranger. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1202">
						<term target="#liberty">liberty had been a useless gift </term> In Mary Shelley's households, whether living with her husband or her father,
						liberty is the greatest of human gifts. For Victor to call it useless speaks volumes about the deterioration of his mind and
						sensibility. It also subtly links his present mental condition to his continuing sloughing off of personal responsibility upon
						an abstract and transcendental destiny. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1203">
						<term target="#lifeext">until my own life, or that of my adversary, were extinguished </term> Mary Shelley here offers another accentuation of
						the adversarial masculinist code that has dominated Victor's perspective on his Creature and blinded him to the dangers to
						which he has exposed his loved ones. The melodramatic posturing, it should be emphasized, does have a purpose if we remind
						ourselves that this first-person narrative is delivered to a listener, Robert Walton, who at the end of the next chapter will
						reenter the novel. Since Victor is well aware that Walton is preserving this record as an exemplary warning to later human
						generations, he has every reason to try to influence the portrait thus handed down to the future. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1204">
						<term target="#light">Light, feeling, and sense, will pass away </term> In contemplating his end, the Creature logically reverts to the memory
						of his first sensations as he became conscious of the world around him (II:3:1 and note). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1205">
						<term target="#listles2">listless indolence </term>
						<p> The near-catatonic state in which Victor exists is a sign of profound mental disturbance: Mary Shelley's repetition of the
							word "listless" from the chapter's beginning indicates that Victor leaves in the same state in which he has existed since
							his interview with the Creature: compare III:1:1 and note. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1206">
						<term target="#listless">I passed whole days . . . silent and listless </term>
						<p> Victor has returned to the desultory sailing on Lake Geneva that occupied him earlier in the summer (II:1:5 and note). To
							be "listless" is literally to be without desire. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1207">
						<term target="#lost">lost in darkness and distance </term> The novel closes with a fine symmetry, repeating the verbal form ("lost") with
						which the Creature had disappeared from view in Volume 1 (I:L4:3) and Volume 2 (II:9:18). Given its profound association with
						the epic of Milton that so haunts this work, that term may be thought to be a marker for the Creature's entire existence. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1208">
						<term target="#loveanot">Do you not love another? </term> At this juncture in the novel few readers would not be startled by the aptness of this
						question, even if none would construe the passion that consumes Victor as in any conventional sense, whether erotic or
						paternal, that of love. Whatever the problems of the fictional time scheme, it is apparent that for the past four-and-a-half
						years, which is the lifetime of Victor's offspring, not to neglect the months of concentrated labor that went into his
						gestation, Victor has been obsessed with the Creature to the neglect, even destruction, of any other relationship. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1209">
						<term target="#mad">I should be supposed mad </term> Given the past consequences on his friends and family of Victor's silence, particularly
						in his never explaining to Clerval the possible danger to his existence from accompanying him to Britain, Victor's continuing
						reticence seems perverse. Yet, at the same time, when he is driven at last to depose himself to the law, the fact that he is
						treated with patronizing incredulity and wholly exonerated from any responsibility for the wake of destruction that has
						visited his family circle (see III:6:24), is a subtle touch on Mary Shelley's part. Conventional human expectation, of
						necessity, protects itself from whatever is beyond its normal range of experience. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1210">
						<term target="#mad2">Are you mad . . . ? </term> Alphonse Frankenstein had raised exactly the same question with Victor at the beginning of
						the fifth chapter (III.5.5), and the Genevan magistrate seems to have been assured of the matter from his interview at the end
						of the sixth (III.6.28). For readers who by this point in the novel might well have come to the same conclusion, Victor's
						questioning of Walton's mental stability would venture on the absurd. From the larger perspective of the novel's development,
						however, the strange echo emphasizes how relative, given the acute isolation in which its three male protagonists have come to
						exist, have become all grounds of reason and normalcy. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1211">
						<term target="#madenthu">the mad enthusiasm </term> As elsewhere in these paragraphs the candor of Victor's language is unexpected and
						surprising. Earlier in his narration he has used "enthusiasm" as an apology, even perhaps as a cover for his lack of
						responsibility (see I:3:3, I:3:8, I:3:14, and III:2:21). This linking of his obsession with creating life to a state of
						madness will be reinforced near the end of the novel where Victor will reflect on his endeavor as a "fit of enthusiastic
						madness" (III:Walton:28). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1212">
						<term target="#madrage">a maddening rage </term> The language seems scrupulously chosen to indicate a transference of madness into the obsession
						of revenge: which is to say that, though his vindictiveness allows Victor to focus his mind wholly on this pursuit, the aim
						may nonetheless be construed as insane. After the death of Elizabeth and his father, Victor seems not so much to recover his
						mental health as to concentrate his madness. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1213">
						<term target="#madschem">my mad schemes are the cause </term> The notion of madness, encountered frequently in the late chapters of the novel,
						has been associated almost entirely with Victor Frankenstein's disturbed mental state. This small shift in rhetoric for the
						1831 edition, coming as it does eight paragraphs after Victor's impassioned questioning of Walton's naive desire to know "the
						particulars of his creature's formation" ("Are you mad, my friend . . . ?"—see III:Walton:3 and note), suggests that, for this
						novel, madness may be less a matter of actual derangement than it is a kind of violation of accepted codes of social conduct
						whereby the individual becomes isolated from the community and communal obligations. Its closest synonymn might then be
						"solipsism," which is an issue with deep roots within Romanticism and one that is stressed in these final pages of
						Frankenstein. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1214">
						<term target="#magist">magistrate . . . benevolent man </term> As a magistrate, Mr. Kirwin, who treats all people with equity and compassion,
						contrasts with the Geneva judges who condemned Justine Moritz to death (I:7:14) as well as the rigged Paris tribunal that
						pronounced a like sentence on Safie's father (II:6:3). There is likewise to be observed here a curious symmetry, since at the
						other end of Victor's trip to the British Isles is another magistrate who, in effect, authorized it, Alphonse Frankenstein.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1215">
						<term target="#mainland">the main land </term> The Orkney Islands begin just north of John O'Groats, the point of Caithness that is commonly
						considered the northernmost point in the United Kingdom. There are several small islands between this village and Pomona, the
						largest of the Orkneys. Exactitude is impossible here, however, because Pomona is itself popularly known as Mainland. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1216">
						<term target="#majestic">its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes </term>
						<p> Oxford is famous for the way in which the structures of the university rise above other features of the landscape to
							dominate the horizon. In the late nineteenth century Thomas Hardy paints an enduring picture of the young Jude Fawley, the
							hero of Jude the Obscure who has mythicized what is there denominated Christminster, venturing far out of his village and
							climbing a ladder at sunset with the hope of making out this far-off object of all his desires: </p>
						<p>Some way within the limits of the stretch of landscape, points of light like the topaz gleamed. The air increased in
							transparency with the lapse of minutes, till the topaz points showed themselves to be the vanes, windows, wet roof slates,
							and other shining spots upon the spires, domes, freestone-work, and varied outlines that were faintly revealed. It was
							Christminster, unquestionably; either directly seen, or miraged in the peculiar atmosphere.</p>
						<p> The spectator gazed on till the windows and vanes lost their shine, going out almost suddenly like extinguished candles.
							The vague city became veiled in mist. (I.iii)</p>

					<item n="1217">
						<term target="#makewret">I can make you so wretched </term> Resuming the earlier play on the meanings of "wretch" and "wretched," the Creature
						once again turns Victor's own terminology back on him. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1218">
						<term target="#maladie">maladie du pays </term> Home-sickness. Why Victor should lapse into his native tongue here, the single such instance in
						his lengthy account to Walton, is a mystery. Perhaps it is meant as another instance of his euphemisms, suggestive of an
						essential insincerity in his representation of his motives. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1219">
						<term target="#manes">call on the manes </term> The Oxford English Dictionary nicely captures the rationale for Victor's use of this Latinism,
						defining the term in the plural, as the deified souls of departed ancestors (as beneficent spirits; opposed to larvæ and
						lemures, the malevolent shades of the Lower World). Also, the spirit, `shade' of a departed person, considered as an object of
						homage or reverence, or as demanding to be propitiated by vengeance. The manes Victor lists here have in the aggregate
						constituted the guiding spirits that throughout this chapter he has invoked as demanding his intercession to avenge their
						deaths. Upon his own death he foresees himself joining their number. If Walton is expected to pick up the family cause,
						perhaps in thinking of Victor as "the brother of [his] heart" (I:L4:22) he has got much more than he bargained for. <p/>

						<term target="#martyrs">the martyrs of old </term> Once again Victor's sense of his own heroism intrudes on the discourse to transform what
						could be construed as unfeeling, sordid, or insane into a grand and self-exculpating gesture. Martyrs, we may remind
						ourselves, however their acts may be justified, are by their nature suicidal. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1222">
						<term target="#master">I am your master </term> Portending a reversal of the father-son roles both Victor and the Creature have implicitly
						relied on, this assertion of the Creature's power contrasts markedly with Victor's chronic indecision and impotence. From this
						point on, as this language intimates, both are locked in the embrace of their mutual anatagonism. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1223">
						<term target="#material">Of what materials was I made </term> The word "materials" is the euphemism Victor customarily uses for the human and
						animal parts out of which he constructs the beings to which he intends to impart life. Now reduced to a psychological
						wretchedness, his physical being seems to him equivalent to these shards of undifferentiated flesh. Mary Shelley subtly
						reaffirms Victor's growing identification with his miserable Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1224">
						<term target="#may8">8th of May </term>
						<p> The timetable seems seriously awry at this point. Henry Clerval was murdered in late August. Victor's subsequent breakdown
							forced a two-month delay during which his father was summoned, and the trial seems to have transpired about a month after
							Alphonse Frankenstein's arrival. This would put it in the December following the summer's removal to the Orkney Islands.
							Victor's release from prison ensued in a fortnight (III:4:44), and he records that thereafter he and his father left
							Ireland as speedily as they could (III:4:48). Thus, the arrival in Paris should come some four months earlier than
							Elizabeth's letter makes it. This error is attenuated in the first edition, we may remember, by a similar lapse of time in
							the trip to England, where, though it appears that Victor and Henry begin their trip down the Rhine in early September,
							they are not reported as having crossed the channel until the "latter days of September " (III:1:24). </p>
						<p> Scrutiny of the surviving manuscripts suggests that Mary Shelley had her chronology straight the first time around and for
							some reason changed her mind and then, again, subsequently compounded the confusion. In the draft she originally had
							Victor and his father arrive in Le Havre on the "8th of Feb." and dated Elizabeth's letter from Geneva "February 18th;"
							then in each case she crossed out the month, substituting "May." In the fair copy intended for the printer, Elizabeth's
							letter was first dated "April," but this designation was cancelled and replaced with "May 18th." </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1225">
						<term target="#mayence">Mayence </term> A French spelling for Mainz. Mary Shelley uses this same form in A History of a Six Weeks' Tour. Her
						description of the Rhine landscape at the same time of the year closely parallels Frankenstein's account on this occasion.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1226">
						<term target="#mechanic">the mechanical impulse </term> A reader can empathize with the sense of relief with which Victor sheds his anxious,
						nervous state of mind in favor of a dogged determination. But the particular language Mary Shelley uses here indicates that it
						is also a dogged determinism. In ridding himself of anxiety and a sense of personal responsibility, Victor would seem to give
						up his last shreds of humanity, transforming himself into a mere machinery of destruction, an armament of war. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1227">
						<term target="#melanch">an absorbing melancholy, that resembled madness </term>
						<p> The final third of the novel is going to concentrate much attention on the progressive deterioration of Victor's mental
							health. Thus, in revising the novel, Mary Shelley carefully implants at this crucial turn of events, when Victor once
							again plans to depart the family circle, Alphonse Frankenstein's suspicion that his son may be deranged.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1228">
						<term target="#memory">satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory </term> Curiously, in this respect the Creature is the
						opposite of Victor Frankenstein, whom he otherwise mirrors in so many aspects. Victor was so preoccupied with inscribing his
						experiences in such a way as to exonerate himself that he corrected Walton's transcript of his narration (III:Walton:4). Oddly
						enough, the only tangible memory that the Creature existed is embodied in Walton's manuscript, of which he is ignorant. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1229">
						<term target="#midnight">It is midnight </term> In folk traditions midnight is a time for supernatural events (the transformation of Cinderella's
						coach into a pumpkin) or strange apparitions (witches, elves). It was at midnight that Victor Frankenstein first encountered
						his Creature in the wild, on his return to Geneva after the murder of William (I:6:25). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1230">
						<term target="#minister">wandering ministers of vengeance </term> Upon a moment's reflection the reader will recognize that Victor, by this term,
						means the primitive Furies of classical myth. Their most prominent realization in Greek literature is in Aeschylus's Oresteia,
						where, as enacted in the third part of the trilogy, The Eumenides, the Furies are persuaded by Athena to give over their
						ritual vengeance to a new and more civilized system of justice that will henceforth regulate human behavior. For Victor thus
						to invoke the Furies suggests his reversion to a primitive bloodlust incompatible with modern civilization. Although not yet
						written, P. B. Shelley's representation of the Furies in Prometheus Unbound (see I.444), as psychological agents of
						self-victimization who lacerate the psyche, is wholly in accord with Mary Shelley's conception here. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1231">
						<term target="#miser">Miserable himself, that he may render no other wretched </term> This phrasing succinctly captures the closed circle in
						which the Creature and his creator exist, miserable and incapable of producing anything else but misery. Its terms are as
						applicable to the speaker as to the object of his hatred, as may be indicated by the simple fact that Victor Frankenstein dies
						first. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1232">
						<term target="#miserabl">so miserable a wretch </term> This speech is closely linked in tone and diction with the point in Victor's narration
						when, awaiting his trial in Ireland, he resolved on the destruction of his Creature as the sole purpose of his future
						existence (III:4:43). Once again, we discern language (e.g. "miserable," "wretch"), which was originally applied to the
						Creature (I:4:2, I:4:3), then thrown back upon Victor by the Creature's taunts (III:7:7), operating as a standard diction for
						his own self-reference. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1233">
						<term target="#mispent">miserably pent . . . wretchedness </term> The ironic undertone of identification between Victor and his Creature
						continues with the implication of how unfortunate it will be should Victor once more be "let loose" upon the world. Here, the
						term by which Victor first denominated his Creature—wretch (see I:4:2 and note)—which is descended from the Old English word
						for exile, is expanded to encompass the entire world. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1234">
						<term target="#miswret">miserable wretch </term> There is no sharper indication of the way in which doubling patterns operate in this novel than
						the way in which this term shifts its application as the narrations unfold. The two words are first juxtaposed by Victor as he
						contemplates his newly vivified Creature (I:4:3). This exact phrase is then employed by the Creature (though, of course, we
						must recall that in terms of strict chronology, his usage predates that of Victor's narrative), as he tells of his sensations
						upon awakening on the first night of his existence (II:3:2). Now it is he who applies it to Victor. In its final use Victor,
						having internalized its truth, will invoke the term, in conversation with Walton, to describe the total failure of his
						existence (III:Walton:9). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1235">
						<term target="#miswrtch">miserable wretch </term> By this point in the novel's development, these terms have become interchangeably shared by
						Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. Unconscious of his repetitive language, Victor has named the Creature a "wretch" on
						first looking at him (see II:4:2) and, again upon seeing him a second time, as the being approaches him across the Sea of Ice
						(II:2:5). But he likewise refers to himself by the same term in the last sentence of Volume 1 (I:7:33), and Elizabeth
						characterizes him similarly at the beginning of the second volume (II:1:8). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1236">
						<term target="#modelled">it modelled my feelings </term> Whether impelled by the verb "modelled" (1818) or "moulded" (1831), this is a
						fascinating phrase. In the second case, although the revised edition lacks the epigraph from Milton's Paradise Lost that marks
						the original title page ("Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay / To mould me Man?"—X.743-44 ), Mary Shelley's recast
						diction seems to recall it with a deliberate irony. In this reconstitution the new Adam, lacking all free will, is animated by
						his own revenge, which is the pattern, the "mould," established by Satan in Milton's epic. <p> On a mundane rather than cosmic
							level, however, we might want to contemplate what it is to have one's entire emotional life formed by the sentiment of
							revenge? In accord with the loss of "voluntary thought" mentioned in the previous sentence, Victor also gives up any
							feeling, any instinctual sense of identification, that might lead him away from his obsessive rage against his double. He
							thus confesses himself as being wholly shaped, both intellectually and emotionally, by this bond of negation. As he
							embarks on a pursuit of high adventure, he casts himself, ironically, as a totally passive victim of his own choosing. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1237">
						<term target="#monsdaem">the monster . . . the daemon </term> The interchangeability of this nomenclature is by this point in Victor's career
						habitual. The Creature is thoroughly demonized in his mind. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1238">
						<term target="#monster">the monster of my creation </term> Of all Victor's terms for the being he has brought to life this seems the most
						directly applicable to a true understanding of the dynamics that underlie the identification of him as monstrous. No longer
						merely a "monster" in and of himself, here the Creature is designated as being created in such a form. Victor thus tacitly
						acknowledges his responsibility for making his Creature monstrous, whether in deed or by the mere utterance of the word. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1239">
						<term target="#monster2">apparition of the monster </term> The undertone in which the text, as Walton reasserts his control over it, questions
						the statements of its narrators continues here as Walton twice—and in the formulation of a logical proof ("conviction of the
						truth" . . . "Such a monster has then really existence")—thoughtlessly borrows Victor's diction to describe the Creature.
						Careful readers will remember that the "apparition . . . seen from our ship" was described very differently at the time
						(I:L4:3). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1240">
						<term target="#moondisk">Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose </term> Since the rising of the moon is, like the dawning of the sun, a
						phenomenon marked almost wholly by its gradual character, the reader can attribute this statement either to Mary Shelley's
						desire for a gothic ambience or, more consistent with her art, to Victor's overheated imagination. Since the previous
						paragraphs have, through the foreshortening of time, already hinted at his surrender to mania, this could be intended as a
						further example of the slippage of his sense of reality. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1241">
						<term target="#morethan">his more than daughter </term>
						<p> In the 1818 edition Elizabeth is the daughter of Alphonse's deceased sister (see I:1:7). Although in the 1831 edition her
							parentage is distanced, she retains this same designation of being "more than daughter." The terms recall the rhetoric in
							which she herself, in her dungeon, addressed Justine (see I:7:23). Even more so, they echo Victor's own description of her
							in their youth, in the revised 1831 edition (see 1831:I:1:10), and thus strongly suggest that there Mary Shelley was
							attempting to draw together these linguistic echoes to emphasize the inbred, almost incestuous, closeness of the family.
							As elsewhere, the echoes may intimate that the bourgeois domestic affections are not an unmixed blessing. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1242">
						<term target="#morning">Towards morning . . . night-mare </term> This appears to be a further application of Coleridge's writings to the general
						tenor of the novel. His "Pains of Sleep," in which he recounts the psychic repercussions of a nightmare induced by opium, was
						published in 1816, shortly before Mary Shelley began writing Frankenstein. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1243">
						<term target="#mostdist">the most distinguished natural philosophers </term> In general terms England was the center for scientific knowledge in
						the Europe of the late Enlightenment. A major reason for this was the presence of the Royal Society for the Improvement of
						Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660 shortly after the restoration of Charles II: its periodical, Philosophical Transactions,
						was still in Mary Shelley's day the principal scientific journal of the world. The president of the Royal Society at the time
						of the publication of Frankenstein was Sir Joseph Banks, one of the great explorers and botanists of the eighteenth century.
						Although Banks's diverse interests would not have specifically engaged Victor Frankenstein, we can be sure that his example
						would have been a guiding light for Walton. That of his successor, Sir Humphrey Davy, however, would have equally drawn
						Victor's admiration, since he was perhaps the premier scientist experimenting with the chemical effects of electricity in the
						first quarter of the nineteenth century. <p>Percy Bysshe Shelley, it should be noted, attended a number of anatomical lectures
							by John Abernethy in 1811. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1244">
						<term target="#mostmis">most miserable of mortals </term> The terms here have a strongly echoing effect, returning us to the language in which
						the Creature and Victor acknowledged their similarities toward the end of the colloquy on the Mer-de-Glace (II:8:36, II:9:2,
						II:9:5). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1245">
						<term target="#muscle">motion of every muscle . . . extremities of my limbs </term> The oddity of this observation seems to be directly based
						in Victor's experience as a physiologist. What the reader cannot miss, however, is the extent of self-absorption that could
						lead a man in the process of discovering his wife's corpse to note his own bodily symptoms with such detached scrupulosity.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1246">
						<term target="#mutilate">mutilated one </term> The irony of the previous sentence is here almost grotesquely intensified. The being to whom
						Victor originally gave "life and spirit" was so horribly mutilated in his creation as to provoke universal aversion from all
						whom he met. Now, in the text, Victor hopes in some way to rectify that lack of initial perspective and clean up either what
						he once called his "filthy creation" (I:3:9), or lacking success at that aim, at least his own image. The secondary irony is
						that neither he nor his Creature can expect an individual "posterity" since each has denied the other the possibility of
						procreation. The posterity that will determine their lasting reputations is thus composed solely of readers of the present
						text that Victor is so assiduously determined to rewrite. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1247">
						<term target="#mutiny">the fears I entertained of a mutiny </term> These are by no means unfounded fears. The notorious mutiny of Henry
						Hudson's crew during his fourth voyage to the north in 1611 resulted in the renowned explorer's death. Even so late as his
						polar exploration of 1829, Sir John Ross experienced a mutiny on one of its ships. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1248">
						<term target="#mychains">to shake off my chains </term> This conception of slavery as a psychological as well as physical condition is very much
						of a piece with other literary productions by the Geneva circle during the summer of 1816, most particularly The Prisoner of
						Chillon, written by Lord Byron in the week after he and Percy Bysshe Shelley visited the Castle of Chillon during their boat
						trip around the lake in mid-July. Shelley included an account in the letters he appended to A History of a Six Weeks' Tour. In
						Byron's poem, at the end of his long captivity, François de Bonnivard, the prisoner, claims, "It was at length the same to me,
						/ Fetter'd or fetterless to be" (lines 372-73) and ruefully notes, in much the same language as Victor employs here, that
						"iron is a cankering thing, / For in these limbs its teeth remain, / With marks that will not wear away" (lines 38-40). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1249">
						<term target="#mydest">my destiny . . . close </term> The wrenching shift in narrative stance into a present "now" accentuates the difference
						subtly in play up to this moment between Victor's self-accusations and his actual avowal of culpability. The man talking to
						his father knows that he is innocent of the crime for which he is languishing in jail. The one speaking in Walton's cabin
						nearly three years later, in contrast, has locked the key on his own imprisonment. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1250">
						<term target="#mydestin">such is not my destiny </term> Victor reiterates what he has said before (III:4:43, III:7:5), accentuating the reader's
						strong sense that he has built a conceptual prison around himself. If the purpose of one's life is solely to bring death to
						another, then the notion of a vital or life force has been systematically inverted. Such a psychological condition is clearly
						pathological. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1251">
						<term target="#myduties">what were my duties with regard to this destroyer </term> "Duty" has been a charged concept throughout Frankenstein,
						invoked in regard to family affairs, social obligations, legal contracts, uses of knowledge—even, in Victor's rationale for
						suspending his second creation, the human race. This occasion is different from all the rest, involving the question of what
						is the moral duty of a human to another sentient but alien being. This assertion of the priority of moral obligation requires
						willed self-abnegation on Walton's part. No other figure in the novel, certainly not Victor Frankenstein, has ever assumed
						that the Creature was owed anything. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1252">
						<term target="#myeyes">my eyes . . . death </term> Whatever the accruing psychological similarities between Victor and his Creature, this is
						the first indication that Victor is also growing into his physical counterpart. Perhaps, these signs of death are to be read
						from a moral perspective, as indicating how deeply implicated with spiritual decay is Victor's retreat from normal human
						interaction. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1253">
						<term target="#myfiend">my fiendish enemy. </term> Victor first designates his creature as an "enemy" shortly after his creation (I:4:12), and
						the Creature, in turn, after the collapse of his aspirations with the DeLacey's thinks of Victor in a like capacity (II:8:30).
						Throughout this last chapter, however, Victor has conceptualized his Creature wholly in adversarial terms, again and again
						referring to him as an enemy. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1254">
						<term target="#myfriend">my friends </term> The plural form appears to indicate that Victor has deduced from the sympathetic concern of the
						benevolent Mr. Kirwin that he is as true a friend to him as his father. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1255">
						<term target="#mygrave">it was to be my grave. </term> As earlier in the chapter (III:3:19), Victor's egotism is a barrier to his recognizing
						where the actual threats to his well-being are lodged. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1256">
						<term target="#myhands">they all died by my hands </term> This is a further instance in which Victor's new level of candor is striking in its
						unblinking justice. Although it is easy to dismiss this language as characteristically hyperbolic and histrionic, to do so
						without maintaining a regard for the intensification of his self-understanding would be unjust. The sense of connectedness he
						now acknowledges with his Creature will become the distinguishing feature of the last movement of the novel. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1257">
						<term target="#myimag">my imagination . . . sting me </term> As on several earlier occasions in the novel (see I:3:11, I:4:18, I:6:24) the
						Romantic imagination is here connected with inner torment rather than transcendence. Instead of regenerating the psychic
						economy, the imagination preys across its isolated and wholly enclosed spaces. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1258">
						<term target="#myletter">My letter was calm and affectionate </term> A less calming letter could scarcely have been written to a fiancée who had
						not heard from her lover for the better part of two years. Perhaps, Mary Shelley writes with her tongue in her cheek, wishing
						to stress the strange air of unreality that has become habitual by now with Victor. His idea of "perfect confidence," after
						all, is to let on that he has a "dreadful" secret and then to require that Elizabeth not ask him a word about it. The irony is
						lost on him, though one assumes not on the reader. Unfortunately for Elizabeth, she, indeed, never questions him about his odd
						revelation. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1259">
						<term target="#mymis">my misfortunes, and their cause </term> No reader can miss the tone here, as Elizabeth's murder is abstracted into
						merely another item in Victor's pitiful history of sorrows. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1260">
						<term target="#myvow">my vow was heard, and that I was reserved for vengeance </term> The supposition with which this graveyard scene
						commenced has now hardened into conviction. But surely Mary Shelley emphasizes her irony here, that the sign that Victor's vow
						has been heard is not some apparition from the dead he would avenge but rather the laugh of the Creature. It is, then,
						specifically the Creature who reserves Victor's remaining months for vengeance. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1261">
						<term target="#mywander">my wanderings </term> Another important theme of the novel and of the age here resonates in Victor's seemingly innocuous
						phrase. As the Ancient Mariner of Coleridge has been invoked on several occasions in the novel, the reader may here wish to
						see Victor, in his passive surrender to his obsession, as willingly assuming that character's fate. But the idea goes
						considerably beyond Coleridge's prototype. The notion of the Wandering Jew, cursed to be an eternal vagabond for having
						taunted Christ on his way to the cross, stands behind both Coleridge's and Mary Shelley's conceptions; and, indeed, that myth
						may be being evoked here on a particularly subtle level, as Victor's turning his back on his own will to live assumes a
						psychological counterpart to that taunting of the figure of redemption. The poet figure of Percy Shelley's "Alastor" (1815),
						who wanders over some of the same terrain as Victor in search of his visionary love, suggests yet another context. Behind that
						figure is probably another conceptual avatar, the peddler in Wordsworth's Excursion (1814) who is explicitly named the
						Wanderer, and who in that poet's conception is able through his internal poise and just relationship with his natural
						environment to maintain his balance amid the turbulence of life. Neither of the Shelleys had much respect for that poem, but,
						needless to say, Victor's balance in contrast to that of Wordsworth's peddler is seriously awry. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1262">
						<term target="#mywretch">my wretchedness </term> Once again, the Creature reverses Victor's assignment of "wretchedness," affirming that it is
						the state he is forced to inhabit, not the condition he wishes to perpetrate on human society. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1263">
						<term target="#nature">Nature </term> This is the only point in the 1818 edition where Nature is capitalized to give it a quasi-transcendental
						significance. By the 1831 edition this practice is extended (see I:2:10 or II:10:1 in that text). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1264">
						<term target="#nearyear">nearly a year had elapsed </term>
						<p> This would suggest that the date is in early August, since it was "in the latter end of August that [Victor] departed"
							(III:1:15) from Geneva. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1265">
						<term target="#neck">its deadly weight yet hanging around my neck </term>
						<p> Although this language may sound proverbial, we are actually witness here to the actual occurrence of a cultural
							transformation into proverbial status. The reference is, once again, specifically to Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient
							Mariner," where the dead albatross is hung around the Mariner's neck in the last stanza of Part 2, not to be removed until
							the end of Part 4. Although the overtone of Victor's comment is light, it does return us to the isolation of the far
							northern seas where this story is being told and where earlier Coleridge's poem was invoked for analogy by Walton
							(I:L2:6). It may also remind us of the morning after the Creature's endowment with life (I:4:7) when Victor's sense of
							being haunted first descends on him. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1266">
						<term target="#newdear">new and dear objects of care will be born </term> This statement carries a subtle resonance, reminding us that this was
						exactly the fear Victor entertained of his Creature if he were allowed a mate, except that his perspective on those "dear
						objects of care" was of "a race of devils [being] propagated upon the earth" (III:3:2 and note). Immersed as he is in irony,
						Victor does not notice the similarity between his state and that of his Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1267">
						<term target="#newtown">the new town </term> The area to the north of the old town, between the Castle and the Firth of Forth, was developed
						during the eighteenth century and rapidly became the center of the vital cultural and intellectual life of the "Scottish
						Enlightenment." When Percy Bysshe Shelley and his first wife Harriet eloped to Edinburgh at the end of August 1811, they took
						lodgings in George Street in New Town. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1268">
						<term target="#nicer">nicer eye </term>Nice here bears the significance of sense 12a of the Oxford English Dictionary: "Entering minutely into
						details; attentive, close." Elizabeth's frankness and perspicuity are testified to earlier by Victor upon his return to Geneva
						after William's murder (see I:6:41). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1269">
						<term target="#night">O Night, and by the spirits that preside over thee </term> In all conventional mythologies Night is a figure of discord
						and threat. As she appears in Book I of Spenser's Faerie Queene, she is represented as "griesly Night, with visage deadly sad"
						(I.5.172), testifying that "I the mother bee/ Of falshood" (I.5.240-41). The eldest of divinities, she has unimpeded access to
						the depths of Hell. In Paradise Lost Night dwells with Chaos in the "dark/ Illimitable ocean without bound" (II.891-92) from
						which God creates Hell. Whatever Victor thinks he is doing by solemnly invoking Night to aid him in his revenge, it is clear,
						by all traditional associations, that no good will come of it. <p> The observant reader may recall that the Creature invoked
							figures associated with the daytime in swearing before Victor that, if he were given a partner, he would never trouble his
							maker again (see II:9:17). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1270">
						<term target="#nochoice">I had no choice but to adapt my nature </term> As the Creature laments over Victor, he unwittingly uses language with
						which we have become familar through Victor's own usage. Here, it is the terminology of destiny. There is, however, an added
						recognition on his part that the course he embarked on was "willingly chosen," which is an acknowledgement that Victor would
						have been wont to suppress. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1271">
						<term target="#nocreat">no creature . . . history of man </term> Victor's lot is doubtless a hard one, but the hyperbole by which he inflates it
						to a unique status in human annals is surely self-serving, the more so as this summary comes at so determined a break in the
						narrative thread. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1272">
						<term target="#nopeace">for the guilty there is no peace </term> Victor's self-conviction is once again expressed with neither mitigating
						excuses nor any sense of possible future exoneration. For him, truly, guilt has become a constant state of mind. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1273">
						<term target="#north">I would not lead them further north </term>
						<p>The association of the north with the realm of Satan is deeply embedded in Christian mythology, perhaps justifying Dante's
							depiction of the lowest circle of Hell, in which Satan is trapped, as ice-bound. Certainly, in Paradise Lost Milton
							knowingly exploits this association, as at the very moment in which Satan's revolt against God materializes he retreats to
							the north: </p>
						<p>          Assemble thou <lb/> Of all those myriads which we lead the chief; <lb/> Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim
							night <lb/> Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste, <lb/> And all who under me their banners wave, <lb/> Homeward,

						<term target="#northern">I shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe </term> Mary Shelley gives her Creature the honor of discovering
						the North Pole over a century before the first human explorer reached it. She does so, however, not just for the sake of
						irony, but to complete a figurative line that has spanned the novel from Walton's first letter (I:L1:2) on and has underscored
						the linkage of Walton and Victor Frankenstein. The Creature, who was brought to life by a fiery electric charge, intends
						through fire to resign his being into the pure electromagnetic field of the pole. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1275">
						<term target="#notcred">you do not credit my narrative </term> Mary Shelley here achieves a fine balance herself between crediting and
						subverting the narrative. On the one hand, her readers (not to exclude Walton) have been at the mercy of this autobiographical
						account for the better course of the novel. Its "connectedness" is in great part what keeps them reading on. Yet there is the
						lingering hint of madness threading its way through the narrative and impinging on its claims to reliability. That Victor
						manages to convince Walton of its truth before the actual evidence appears is, in the face of the skepticism he arouses here,
						rather an achievement. But then, we might wish to remind ourselves that Walton is an habitué of adventure stories and was wont
						to believe the North Pole a "region of beauty and delight" (I:L1:2). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1276">
						<term target="#nothear">You will not hear </term> It goes without saying that if Margaret Saville hears nothing of her brother's fate, we will
						never read this novel. Thus, even as Walton is apprehensive about his future, we know that he will survive. This is something
						more, however, than a conventional expression of fear or a plea for pity, being rather another instance of Mary Shelley's
						accentuating the instability of her text and the innumerable contingencies surrounding all authorship, whether we think of the
						result as her novel or Victor's Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1277">
						<term target="#notmad">I am not mad </term> Mary Shelley's concentration on this issue brings the reader to an awareness that, where an entire
						culture refuses to believe in the truth of the aberrant, it may appear mad even when it is not technically so. Or, as the
						British psychoanalyst of the 1970s, R. D. Laing, tried to argue, it is possible to believe that those we call mad are merely
						reacting sanely to the inherently mad stresses forced upon them by modern civilization. It is those who have no awareness of
						them who truly constitute the mad. In this case the public position of those who seem to value Victor's intellectual integrity
						but dismiss his self-accusations, first Mr. Kirwin and then his own father, allows us to read them as representatives of a
						reigning cultural establishment that, however well-meaning it may be, may at the same time appear willfully blind. <p/>

					<item n="1278">
						<term target="#nugent">Daniel Nugent </term> Catherine Nugent was the landlady with whom Percy Bysshe Shelley and his first wife Harriet
						resided during their short visit to Dublin in the spring of 1812. Both the Shelleys maintained a correspondence with her
						thereafter. The fact that Harriet, not Percy Shelley, informed Catherine Nugent of the rupture of their marriage suggests,
						perhaps, that of the two she felt the closer ties. Mary Shelley, however, never met Catherine Nugent, and there is no
						reference to her anywhere in her writings or in her husband's correspondence with her. Thus, the presence of the surname
						Nugent in this novel comes as something of a surprise that has never been explained. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1279">
						<term target="#offspring">offspring of solitude and delirium </term> Walton is taking very seriously the notion of the living dead whom Victor
						accounted a "guiding spirit" (III:7:26 and note) as he embarked on the Arctic ice fields. Yet what he appears to be telling
						his sister and her readers here is that Victor's only solace is in madness, and that for so deeply alienated a creature
						madness is preferable to sanity. If by this statement he is recognizing that Victor is actually mad, it raises considerable
						questions about what constitutes the truth contained by either narrative—Victor's, certainly, but also his own which relies
						exclusively on Victor's for its authority. <p/>

					<item n="1280">
						<term target="#orkney">one of the remotest of the Orkneys </term> The Orkney Islands, or Orcades, long a Norse dependency, were joined to

						group amounts to seventy islands. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1281">
						<term target="#ourcirc">our circle will be small </term> Alphonse seems incapable of thinking outside the terms of an enclosed, bourgeois family

					</item>
					<item n="1282">
						<term target="#outcast">I would rather . . . friendless outcast over the earth </term> Here, as Victor recognizes how wholly inverted was truth
						from expectation, the ironies become heavy indeed, for, however extreme his rhetoric, he seems wholly unconscious that this is
						the fate he has bestowed upon his Creature. And given that what he utters here comes with the burden of a sudden shift to the
						total retrospect of Walton's cabin, he seems strangely unable to acknowledge that this is the fate he has bestowed upon
						himself as well. From a few days after the marriage onward, Victor does, in fact, desert Switzerland for ever to pursue the
						Creature far and wide across national borders, the two of them sharing a state of permanent "exile." <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1283">
						<term target="#particip">I wished to be participated </term>
						<p>This curious locution calls attention to itself, and it would seem purposefully so, as being distinctively Miltonic. It is

						<p>Of fellowship I speak <lb/> Such as I seek, fit to participate <lb/> All rational delight: wherein the brute <lb/> Cannot

					</item>
					<item n="1284">
						<term target="#passion">I may still be misled by passion </term> A final insistence on a continuing revision of the text, this phrase suggests
						that even at the end Victor cannot be sure that he responds to anything concerning his own situation with total
						disinterestedness. His frank admission is touching in its expression of a simple, unapologetic humanity. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1285">
						<term target="#peasant">the peasant </term> The powerless of this unlanded peasant before the forces of state power probably reflects the
						devastation of Europe during the last phase of the Napoleonic Wars. However self-serving or self-pitying we may find Victor's
						comparison, its political edge is unmistakable and is perhaps intended by Mary Shelley, like other incidental political
						observations in the novel, to insinuate a viewpoint that could not be explicitly stated in the political climate of England in
						1818. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1286">
						<term target="#perfsol">the most perfect solitude </term>
						<p> If the reader regards this phrase ironically, it would seem commensurate (or nearly so) with death. The last third of
							Frankenstein is dominated by the withdrawal of its protagonists behind psychic barricades that wall them off increasingly
							from the forces of life. Again, one senses the context of P.B. Shelley's recently-published Alastor; or, The Spirit of
							Solitude behind Mary Shelley's text. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1287">
						<term target="#period">That then was the period </term> The "then" reveals Victor distancing himself from the sense that there will be any
						immediate consequences to his act. His susceptibility to dismiss, or just miss, the logical point, however, is not so much the
						result of chronic thick-headedness as it is the effect of the egotism through which he filters all experience. His
						characteristic assignment of a "destiny" to himself likewise testifies as much to his sense of self-importance as to the
						determinism by which he attempts to deflect moral responsibility for his actions from himself. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1288">
						<term target="#perished">perished </term> Victor's digression, although it moves at last into the uncertainties of question marks, foreshadows

						<p> An ancient city of Scotland, Perth was the Scottish capital until the mid-fifteenth century, when Edinburgh succeeded it:

					<item n="1291">
						<term target="#physiog">a considerable change in the physiognomy </term> After the various kinds of mental deterioration Victor has suffered in
						the later chapters, it may come as something of a relief to acknowledge that he is still as scientifically alert to the

						<term target="#poisoned">my heart was poisoned with remorse </term> This may seem a strange usage, but it accords with the primary meaning of
						"remorse" in Mary Shelley's day. Johnson's Dictionary (1755) lists the following two definitions: <list type="simple">
							<item>Pain of guilt </item>
							<item>Tenderness; pity; sympathetick sorrow </item>
						</list> In both cases, but particularly in the first, remorse involves a passionate suffering that could be likened to the

					<item n="1294">
						<term target="#portsmou">Portsmouth </term>
						<p> Portsmouth was at this time the principal commercial port of the south of England, maintaining a constant traffic between

							Portsmouth would have been preferable for voyagers coming, like Alphonse and Victor, from the west of England. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1295">
						<term target="#post">to post </term> To post means going overland in vehicles drawn by horses. Mary Shelley copies the experience recorded in

						continental excursion by stagecoach. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1296">
						<term target="#power">my power is complete </term> This curious phrase recalls us to the last colloquy between Victor and his Creature after
						the destruction of Victor's second being. There, asserting his mastery over Victor, the Creature claims that he will attain
						this "power" (III:3:11), which is that of reducing Victor to the state of utter wretchedness he has now reached. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1297">
						<term target="#precaut">One paternal kind precaution </term>
						<p> Bearing in mind the previous paragraph's emphasis on Alphonse's fears for his son's mental stability, we may see this
							careful planning between father and fiancée as reflecting a shared concern that Victor not be left alone to indulge what
							they see as a tendency toward melancholy, or, in his own characterization, "lonely, maddening reflection." Even his
							seemingly innocent adjective here ("maddening") takes on added weight in the depiction of Clerval as a kind of chaperon to
							ensure the preservation of Victor's mental balance. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1298">
						<term target="#prison">in a prison </term> As the initial consequence of Victor's abandoning his Creature led to his brother's death and
						Justine's being cast into the Swiss prison where he visited her, the second wave of dark events is starkly complementary. Now
						his best friend has been murdered and he has himself experienced the alienating effects of imprisonment. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1299">
						<term target="#proceed">I will proceed with my tale </term> With Victor's pause to utter his encomium upon Clerval and thus intrude a strong
						value judgment into his discourse, the question of narrative truth is once again brought to the fore. Once again, Victor
						intrudes the notion of a "tale," a word used by him (I:L4:28, I:3:13) and by the Creature (II:2:13, II:2:16, II:9:18) to
						describe their narratives, also (with a different construction of what might constitute the truth) in the last sentence of the
						novel's Preface. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1300">
						<term target="#projector">the herd of common projectors </term> "Projector" is a term commonly used in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
						centuries to refer to inventors, often in a pejorative sense. Its ambivalence of connotation is reflected in the double
						primary meaning assigned to it by the Oxford English Dictionary: a. One who forms a project, who plans or designs some
						enterprise or undertaking; a founder. <p> b. In invidious use: A schemer; one who lives by his wits; a promoter of bubble
							companies; a speculator, a cheat. </p> Samuel Johnson is, if anything, less evenhanded in the double definition of
						"projector" contained in his 1755 Dictionary: 1. One who forms schemes or designs. <p> 2. One who forms wild impracticable
							schemes. </p> Perhaps the most famous literary account of projectors is that offered by Jonathan Swift in Gulliver's tour
						through the Grand Academy of Lagado (Gulliver's Travels, III.5), a think-tank populated by inventors of perfectly useless or
						insane conceptions and contraptions. <p> Victor Frankenstein's desire to separate himself from madmen and hacks is thus easily
							justifiable, whether we construe it in accord with his ambition or his achievement. Yet, the tone of condescension in his
							phrasing is expressive of an arrogance and self-approbation that verges on universal contempt. Its natural complement in a
							social dimension would be a hierarchical rigidity denominated according to class, and in a psychological field the
							prejudice we customarily comprehend under the rubric of racism. In other words, there is an easy shift from this
							self-esteem to the denigration of the Other expressed by Victor's continual demonization of his Creature. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1301">
						<term target="#promise">I had had now neglected my promise for some time </term> Since Victor and Clerval had not left London until the end of
						March, and as they had "passed a considerable period at Oxford" and "two months in Cumberland and Westmoreland," not to
						mention the time spent in this lengthy journey northward, it should now be early in July, which is to say, almost a year after
						Victor's promise to his Creature. His pattern of attenuated delays throughout the novel is particularized in an earlier note.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1302">
						<term target="#putanend">I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence </term> The matter-of-fact tone in which Victor speaks here clothes
						in euphemistic objectivity, and seems meant to cushion, a remarkable statement. A person who "often" over a period of a few
						weeks attempts to commit suicide, in general terms, would be considered seriously deranged. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1303">
						<term target="#queen">his queen, and son </term> The syntax is somewhat confusing. Falkland and Gower/Goring are mentioned as companions to
						King Charles I, whose queen was Henrietta Maria (1609-69)—actually Henriette-Marie, daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie
						de Medici, by birth and practice a Roman Catholic. The son mentioned here probably would be Charles II (1630-85; restored
						after the Commonwealth as king of Great Britain and Ireland, 1660-85); but the term could as easily apply to his slightly
						younger brother James II (1633-1701), who became king after the death of Charles II but was deposed three years later, in
						1688, in what became known as the Bloodless Revolution. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1304">
						<term target="#race">a race of devils </term> At this point Victor's demonizing of his Creature extends into a primitive form of racism,
						transforming a personal vendetta into a supposedly objective ideology that stamps this Other as inherently inferior, incapable
						of civilization, and undeserving of existence. Thus positioning himself at an extreme of self-righteous justification, Victor
						will fall back upon this hardened, docrinaire authority for all his subsequent actions concerning the Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1305">
						<term target="#race2">I belonged to a race of human beings </term> It requires but a moment's pause over this bland statement of relief,
						particularly in conjunction with Victor's fears, expressed at the beginning of the chapter, about propagating a race of devils
						(see III:3:2 and note) to realize that its premise is a blatant racism. Mary Shelley represents it without any underscoring,
						all the more suggestive of how inherent is the thinking, how psychologically embedded the attitude. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1306">
						<term target="#rage">the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion </term> Rage has appeared such an emotional constant of this novel that
						the reader may be surprised in reflection to realize that the emotion never occurs in Volume 1, but enters the space of the
						fiction in the encounter of the Creature and Victor Frankenstein on the Mer-de-Glace of Mont Blanc. There the figure embroiled
						in rage is Victor (II:2:5). In the Creature's own narration something like this present unrestrained rage occurs when he burns
						down the cottagers' house (II:8:12). Thereafter, the novel evinces a smoldering fire, ready to burst into flame at any point:
						we witness it in the successive "rage" that grips Victor (II:9:3) and the Creature (II:9:6) over the question of the creation
						of a companion. Beginning with chapter 3 of the third volume, rage is an abiding emotion of Victor Frankenstein's, concomitant
						with the fever that wastes his body. Now that he is dead, it is as if that violent emotion were floating free of his body, the
						sole evidence of the bond driving both these figures to their destruction. It is notable that the rage inhabiting the Creature
						is not against Victor but himself. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1307">
						<term target="#realinsa">real insanity possessed me </term> It is easy to overlook the weight of this statement, but "real" should be given its
						due meaning. Following the accounts of Victor's attempted suicide (III:4:46) and his father's questioning earlier in this
						chapter whether his son was not actually mad, (III:5:5) these symptoms, an alteration between violent rage and withdrawn
						lethargy, point to a serious manic-depressive condition. For Elizabeth this has to be extraordinarily trying: the depressed
						state Victor was in when he had left her, both upon undertaking the excursion to Chamounix (II:1:10 and II:1:14) and in the
						aftermath of his encounter with the Creature (III:1:1), had been serious enough, but the extremity into which it has developed
						hardly bodes well for her future with him. Even so, Elizabeth reverts to her characteristic vocation of nurse. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1308">
						<term target="#reality">it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality </term> The uncanny coincidences by which Victor comes
						upon the scene of Clerval's death, as if enmeshed in a logic over which he has no control, reinforce his larger sense that he
						has no independent will to exercise in his life's narrative. These coincidences may likewise remind us of the crucial role
						played by narrative, or having a firm control over interpretation of the narrative, throughout the novel. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1309">
						<term target="#reason">a thinking and reasoning animal </term> As in his initial creation Victor's impulse is to deny humanity to the being he
						would endow with life. What most deeply plagues his mind is the fact that his creation will be beyond his control. In a
						theological extension of this concern, the question before the creator is whether the new race, particularly the female member
						of it, can be trusted to exercise free will. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1310">
						<term target="#recollec">The recollection of this injustice </term> The Creature is an acute reader of his own history, aware that amid his
						accumulated experiences of victimization some cases were freer than others from any possible mitigation. He concentrates here
						on the two instances (see II:7:38 and II:8:19) where his own disinterested benevolence was rewarded with a violent attack on
						his person. For all Victor's repeated threats to grapple with his Creature, it is interesting to observe that after his
						creation he never again physically touches him. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1311">
						<term target="#record">I cannot forbear recording it </term> Walton, who cannot resist the impulse to continue a creation whose end he cannot
						predict, bears an uncanny resemblance to the obsessive Victor Frankenstein racing to the denouement of the Creature's birth in
						Ingolstadt (I:3:8). The difference, and it is one maintained throughout the novel's self-reflexive mirroring of its own
						operations, is that writing has no effect in the world until it is read. The writer's obsession with the text may seem both
						narcissistic and solipsistic, but this antisocial dimension is confined to a conceptual plane. Still, Walton's unselfconscious
						acquiescence in the claims of what seems to him irresistable reinforces our sense that what drives Victor is little different
						from the passions we all share as human beings. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1312">
						<term target="#regret">only regretted . . . understanding </term>
						<p> At this point Elizabeth Lavenza is about twenty-one years old. Two years younger, Mary Shelley has spent a good part of
							her childhood in Scotland, has twice been to France and Switzerland, and has travelled up the Rhine through Germany and
							Holland (none of it under parental guidance or supervision). That her experiences were unusual is reflected in this
							observation, with its glancing feminist edge. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1313">
						<term target="#remalone">that I might remain alone </term> Victor's retreat from society characteristically involves shutting himself up in an
						enclosed room, as he had done when engaged in creating the Creature in Ingolstadt. Although the former desire has turned to
						abhorrence, his practices do not alter. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1314">
						<term target="#remembra">his remembrance </term> This confirms the sense of mortality initimated by the questions of the previous paragraph. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1315">
						<term target="#remorse">remorse </term> Remorse is by no means an unalloyed virtue in Enlightenment usage, as Johnson's definition of it makes
						clear. Contemporary literary usage had, indeed, suggested that this was a tragic passion. Coleridge's Remorse, which was
						produced in 1813, represents the passion as a static rankling, and Byron, who had a hand in bringing that tragedy to the stage
						at Drury Lane, recasts its essential situation into the unavailing grief of Manfred. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1316">
						<term target="#repulsiv">even to the most repulsive among them </term> Perhaps this statement is meant to remind us that, though Victor was
						originally repelled by the "repulsive countenance" of Krempe, the chemistry professor at the University of Ingolstadt (see
						I:2:9), in time he came to treasure "his sound sense and real information," however much he was still aware of their being
						"combined . . . with a respulsive physiognomy" (I:3:1). Obviously, however, what Victor can tolerate in a human constrained by
						the normative boundaries of inherited genetic combination he is unwilling to extend to his Creature, who is a being of whom,
						from the first, he claimed "no mortal could support the horror of that countenance" (I:4:4), a being who himself, upon first
						seeing his reflection, "started back" from his "miserable deformity" (II:4:13). Victor's magnanimous identification with his
						fellow beings collapses here under the weight of the ironies of a categorical discrimination he seems unable to comprehend.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1317">
						<term target="#resolute">a resolution . . . of vice </term> This is a term with something of a history in the novel. Both Walton and Victor have
						earlier prided themselves on their resolution. See I:L1:6 and note, confirmed in I:L2:5, and I:3:1. Victor's resolution will
						become ever more unbending and even murderous in the course of the novel's conclusion. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1318">
						<term target="#restless">I grew restless and nervous </term> As in Ingolstadt (I:3:14), Victor's health begins to suffer from his compulsive and
						solitary existence. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1319">
						<term target="#restrain">to restrain me </term> It would appear from this statement that Victor's capacity for violence has increased markedly
						since, three months earlier, he had destroyed the female creature, "trembling with passion" (III:3:4). Again, the terminology
						(e.g., "restrain") seems appropriate to a pathological condition. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1320">
						<term target="#restspec">a restless spectre </term> Literally, a ghost who cannot break through the barrier separating the afterworld from the
						scene of actual human life. Such a being, we should remind ourselves, is also a "dæmon," the term used by Victor in the
						previous sentence to distance himself from and dehumanize his Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1321">
						<term target="#revenge">revenge remains . . . food </term> The Creature, as it were, accepts the challenge Victor offered at the beginning of
						the previous paragraph, assuming mastery over his destiny. The terms in which he defines his revenge, indeed, will be the
						dominating force of the later chapters, in which vengeance becomes a single-minded obsession for both creature and creator.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1322">
						<term target="#rimini">Leigh Hunt's "Rimini" </term> Leigh Hunt's Story of Rimini (1816) recounts the legendary love of Francesca da Rimini and
						her brother-in-law, Paolo Malatesta, which is found in Dante's Inferno (5.73-138), in a style at once richly textured like a
						medieval tapestry and linguistically contemporary. His explanation for the illicit love was that the youthful Francesca was
						married to Paolo as a stand-in for his haughty older brother and fell in love with him at first sight. This quotation comes
						from the beginning of Canto 2, after the groom's elaborate wedding party arrives with the surrogate Paolo as "the very poetry
						of nature" (2.47) to fetch the bride. In 1815 Hunt had become something of a mentor to both Mary Godwin and Percy Bysshe
						Shelley, and he was to remain one of their warmest friends. Indicative of how close this circle was, Hunt's Story of Rimini
						was dedicated to Lord Byron. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1323">
						<term target="#roarings">roarings like thunder </term> This is the sound of the "ground sea," which had also been heard some five weeks earlier,
						on the afternoon of 31 July (I:L4:5 and note). The breakup of the ice on that occasion cut Victor Frankenstein off from his
						Creature, and he remembered its violent sound (III:7:24 and note) in terms similar to those used here by Walton. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1324">
						<term target="#rotterdm">Rotterdam </term> In 1814 the Shelley party also sailed for England from the port of Rotterdam. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1325">
						<term target="#sacrific">I could not sacrifice the whole human race </term> Even as Victor demonized his Creature and surrounded his second
						creation with imaginings of the direst consequences, it is clear that in the ensuing months he has inflated this act of
						destruction of the second being, transforming what appeared at the time as an act of passionate homicide into a gesture of
						sublime heroism offered in behalf of all of humankind. It is small wonder Alphone Frankenstein changes the subject: such
						apparent delusions of grandeur are highly suspect. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1326">
						<term target="#saleve">Mont Salêve </term> This is a nice touch on Mary Shelley's part. The attentive reader will nod in recognition that the
						previous time this mountain was reported as being in Victor's line of vision, two years earlier, he had descried his Creature
						climbing its nearly perpendicular face (I:6:22). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1327">
						<term target="#sameboat">the same boat </term> A realistic perspective on this evidence might emphasize the fact that, since both the Creature's
						and Victor's boats are Scottish in make, they would therefore in all probability resemble one another closely. But Mary
						Shelley seems to have another purpose in mind. Having already forced an aura of the uncanny upon this scene through the great
						distance of travel and coincidence of destination of her characters, she subtly reinforces the interchangeability of Creature
						and creator that will progressively intensify as the novel moves towards its conclusion. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1328">
						<term target="#scene">what a scene has just taken place </term> Characteristic of the structural ingenuity of Frankenstein, its final scene is
						a recollected flashback. Chronologically speaking, this brief paragraph, with its self-reflexiveness about its own artistic

						<term target="#scent">scent of flowers and hay </term> As this is June, the air is suffused with the scent of Alpine wildflowers and freshly

					<item n="1330">
						<term target="#selfish">my selfish despair </term> If the terms in which Victor recounts his regaining a sense of responsibility cannot easily
						be reconciled with a disinterested ethics, one senses in this phrase a tone of self-accusation reflecting a more mature
						understanding of his own implication in the catastrophic events he has unleashed. This acceptance of responsibility is not
						uniform, returning only sporadically in the later chapters of the novel, but it testifies, perhaps, to a measure of moral
						growth; or, if Victor's vindictive diction places that conclusion in some doubt, at least to a sharper sense of the price that
						has been paid for his solitary ambition and withdrawal from normative human interactions. Still, suspecting that Victor's
						self-important posture as family protector will only eventuate in great calamities, a reader may find it hard not to cast an
						ironic eye upon what continue as usual to be good intentions never sufficiently thought through. <p/>

						<term target="#seneca">the lessons of my Seneca </term>
						<p> Lucius Annaeus Seneca (c. 4 BCE — 65 CE). A leading philosopher and statesman of the mid-first century, Seneca was also a
							playwright, whose nine tragedies celebrate stoic resignation. As a statesman, his practice was anything but what such a
							philosophical stance might indicate, for he was an activist not a conservative. He was Nero's tutor and later acted behind
							the scenes to secure the emperor's power. He retired from the court in the year 62 to devote himself to philosophy, but
							three years later he was denounced as taking part in the conspiracy of Piso against the emperor. Ordered by Nero to commit
							suicide, Seneca took his own life with stoic resignation and fortitude. It is not, it would appear, in Seneca's writings
							but in his example that Walton looks for comfort in his peril.</p>

					<item n="1332">
						<term target="#sensibil">sensibility </term> Victor is here being characterized as the ideal "man of feeling," in accord with Enlightenment
						cultural standards of a kind associated with the writings of Rousseau and, in English, Adam Smith. With the latter, see
						particularly The Theory of Moral Sentiments, 3.2-3.3, 5.2, and 6.3. <p/>

						<term target="#sentence">sentence </term> Officially exonerated as he has been by his trial in the previous chapter, Victor nonetheless carries a
						profound psychological sense that he has been convicted in the court in which his destiny has been plotted and that there is
						no escaping the sentence. That he totally misreads the result, however, is sufficient commentary on the "necessity" under
						which he feels he labors. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1334">
						<term target="#sept2">September 2d </term> A week has elapsed since Walton's last entry in the letter to his sister, a notable absence in a
						time frame that has been previously so overcharged with event. The dating makes comparison almost inevitable, and the reader
						thus becomes conscious of the curious fact that the entirety of Victor's narration of his life took one day less than this
						week-long lacuna in which the late-summer ice has slowly but inexorably been heaved by the pressures of wind and sea into
						threatening mountains. The natural landscape, as is so often the case with Mary Shelley's treatment of the sublime Arctic
						wilderness, has a corollary in the psychological development of her characters, particularly in the nexus of guilt and destiny
						driving Victor. <p/>

						<term target="#sept9th">September 9th </term>
						<p>In 1818 the compositor, evidently reading this as one in a series of journal entries, surmised that it could not follow
							"September 12th" and added an integer to make it "September 19th." But, of course, what the text intends us to understand
							by its idiom is, "On September 9th the ice began to move." Since this is the date in the manuscript and it is restored in
							1831, the text has been emended here. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1336">
						<term target="#septemb">the latter days of </term> The text printed in 1818 has "latter days of December," which is clearly a compositor's error
						unnoticed in the Shelleys' proofreading of the text for the first edition. The mistake, once in print, went unnoticed in all
						later editions of the novel. In Mary Shelley's draft, however, the word is unmistakably "September." She would have had every
						reason to adhere to this timeline since, just a few weeks earlier than her fictional schedule, in 1814, it took the Shelley
						party nine days to cover the distance between Basel and Rotterdam (30 August-7 September) travelling exactly as do Victor
						Frankenstein and Henry Clerval and, even when adverse conditions delayed their departure from Holland, a three days' crossing
						brought them to London on 13 September (see Six Weeks' Tour for Switzerland and Holland). <p> The attenuated journey of the
							1818 text is whittled to three months in the shifting of the original departure date in 1831, which, as indicated earlier,
							may have been done to accommodate the timespan after Victor's return from Mont Blanc rather than his arrival date in
							England. In the next chapter, as recorded in both the 1818 and 1831 texts, the chronology reverts to a normative calendar
							and Victor observes that he and Clerval "had arrived in England at the beginning of October" (III:2:5). </p>

					<item n="1337">
						<term target="#shadow">the shadow of a human being </term> Although this phrase is meant to underscore the precarious state of Victor's
						physical health, it resonates within a psychological and moral construction as well, once again reminding us of how like the
						state of his Creature Victor's has become. The Creature functions as a shadow, not just in the modern sense of trailing Victor
						wherever he goes, but also in his incapacity ever to assume a full human dimension. Victor, in his isolation and his chronic
						sense of undiscriminating guilt, has also forsaken that dimension. In the late chapters of the novel Victor's physical
						condition is, as here, a measure of his psychic state. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1338">
						<term target="#shout">a shout of tumultuous joy </term> Although there are shrieks of fear or anger here and there across this novel's
						landscape, this is the only shout heard in Frankenstein. The intense silence of the novel, indeed, is a remarkable stylistic
						achievement. The noisy enthuasiasm of the sailors may remind us of Victor's recent recollection of how the Greek soldiers wept
						for joy upon reencountering the sea when they returned from Persia (III:7:17). The naturalness of the mariners' response
						stands in paradoxical contrast with Victor's sense of transcendental empowerment. It is little wonder that he should be
						awakened from his sleep by the threat simple humanity poses against his aims. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1339">
						<term target="#shuteyes">I shut my eyes involuntarily </term> These two sentences encapsulate a highly complex aesthetic and moral act. It is
						against his will that Walton closes his eyes; yet with eyes closed he occupies an essentially different space from that in
						which he first viewed the Creature a second before. He has unwittingly placed himself in the position of the elder DeLacey,
						who is the only stranger not to have rejected the Creature at first sight (II:7:18). DeLacey's blindness and Walton's closed
						eyes remove from their judgments the beautiful as a determining aesthetic criterion. With its absence each is able to act on
						what purports to be an objective moral plane, or at least not to have pre-determined aesthetic categories prejudice their
						responses. Paradoxically, an act that is reflexive and therefore deterministic in its inception becomes the means by which
						unexamined, normative standards of behavior, which are truly deterministic in their impulse, can be transcended, allowing an
						exercise of free will. Since Walton is not actually blind, his act in its ethical import is unique for the novel. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1340">
						<term target="#single">with a single man in it </term> The villagers one and all reduce the being whom Victor has been anathematizing as a
						daemon to human proportions. In this they seem cast in the same mold as Walton's lieutenant who, after the initial appearance
						of the Creature, stolidly questions Victor about the "man" he has been pursuing (I:L4:11). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1341">
						<term target="#sister">a sister or a brother </term> In terms of Mary Shelley's biography, this may be a revealing, if somewhat odd, statement.
						Mary Shelley was the sole child of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, conceived before they were officially married and
						then left motherless by Wollstonecraft's death. She had three step-siblings: Fanny Imlay, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft
						and the American Gilbert Imlay, who committed suicide in 1817 while Mary was still engaged in the writing of Frankenstein; and
						Charles and Claire Clairmont, children of the first marriage of Godwin's second wife Mary Jane Clairmont. Because of their
						gender and nearness of age, Mary and Claire were thrown much together and experienced considerable sibling friction. Claire's
						unacknowledged pregnancy by Lord Byron was the driving force behind the 1816 journey to Geneva, and when her condition became
						known it fell largely to Mary to see her through the pregnancy without scandal. From this point on, for the next five years,
						Claire lived with the Shelleys both in England and Italy. Whatever words Victor speaks here, it is clear that Mary's closeness
						to her step-sister generally increased the suspiciousness with which she regarded Claire's motives and actions. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1342">
						<term target="#slavenot">I was the slave, not the master </term> The Creature reverts to the terms of his last confrontation of Victor
						Frankenstein, when he called Victor his slave and demanded his obedience (III:3:11 and note). The effect of this recantation,
						however, is not so much the simple reversal the diction connotes, as an erasure of the polarizing of his terms. Both he and
						Victor were slaves, mastered alike by their antagonism. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1343">
						<term target="#slaveof">during which I was the slave of my creature </term>
						<p> The new terminology for Victor's relationship with the Creature, introduced four paragraphs earlier (III:1:9), returns
							with augmented stress. The underlying notion of slavery includes not just bondage but an absence of willed responsibility.
							Victor thus appears to be distancing himself from his recognition of the awesome obligations of a deity with which the
							second volume closed (II:9:18). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1344">
						<term target="#slavery">my slavery </term>
						<p> This term is ominous for Victor's future relations with his Creature. It also considerably darkens the construction of
							what Victor sees as his destiny, also of how he comprehends the nature of imitative behavior, for he appears to think it
							achieved not through emulation but, rather, through the exercise of coercion.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1345">
						<term target="#smooth">smooth and placid as a southern sea </term> Victor's only experience of a southern sea would appear to have come at the
						beginning of this last trip in pursuit of the Creature, embarked on from a French Mediterranean port (III:7:9). On its surface
						his sardonic comment roundly indicts the crew for moral and spiritual laxity. Yet, on second thought, an even stronger
						counterforce ironically deflates the surface terms. This ironic inversion begins as we recognize the considerable negative
						connotations from earlier in the novel already adhering to this celebration of the "glorious" (I:L1:6 and note, I:L2:3 and
						note, and III:Walton:6 and note). On top of those resonances, the reference to "a southern sea" should remind the
						knowledgeable reader of the last voyage undertaken by Ulysses and his crew in search of glory, a voyage that took them far
						into the unknown southern sea where their ship foundered. This is the subject of Canto 26 of Dante's Inferno, which is
						likewise the source upon which Tennyson depended for his dramatic monologue, "Ulysses," written in 1833. In Dante's rendition
						of this story, for all his heroic posturing, Ulysses has led his men to their death for nothing beyond a meaningless personal
						glory. For this act of essential treachery he is lodged near the bottom of hell for eternity. <p> It is worth remarking that,
							in her draft of this passage, Mary Shelley originally wrote "summer lake," and the phrase "southern sea" was inserted
							above it in P. B. Shelley's hand. This interpolation, of course, would have had to have been agreed to by Mary Shelley,
							presumably after some discussion of the appropriateness of the intertextual context the phrase evokes. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1346">
						<term target="#smother">smothered voice </term> A year after the Creature's long narration beneath Mont Blanc and after several chapters devoted
						to Victor's egocentric ruminations in the interim, we are here sharply reminded of the Creature's inner life that Victor
						refuses to acknowledge. In modern parlance the Creature is engaged at this point in a deliberate repression of his anger. As
						in their previous encounter Victor notably outrants his Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1347">
						<term target="#solitude">the solitude I coveted </term>
						<p> Although, of course, Victor will need to pursue his scientific labors by himself, the verb "coveted" conveys a sense of
							profound asociality as a crucial aspect of Victor's constitution. However eagerly he expresses his anticipation of
							returning to find fulfillment in his union with Elizabeth, what his father praises as "our domestic calm" at this point in
							the 1818 edition seems wholly to lack the capacity to satisfy Victor.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1348">
						<term target="#somedest">some destiny </term> Victor's perhaps unconscious withdrawal into vague euphemism to match his father's rhetoric here
						strongly suggests a lack of candor. It also indicates that, however self-accusing he may be, he has accepted no real
						responsibility for the actions of his Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1349">
						<term target="#somerev">wishing for some mighty revolution </term> Victor's desire for an externally applied apocalyptic solution that will
						break the logical circle he cannot escape is as characteristic of him as the passivity into which he actually retreats from
						the stress of events. Still, his figure resonates against his contrasting application of the turning wheel a few paragraphs
						earlier (see III:4:12 and note), where its every revolution was conceived as bringing new calamities upon him. <p> The term
							"mighty revolution" cannot but retain some of its political charge in the context of post-Napoleonic Europe, particularly
							if connected to the world of undiscriminated wretchedness that Victor had been contemplating before Mr. Kirwin entered to
							prepare him for his father's arrival (III:4:21). </p>

					<item n="1350">
						<term target="#soonlost">soon lost amid the waves </term> The Creature disappears not only with the same superhuman speed but also in much the

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1351">
						<term target="#sounfeel">so unfeeling a speech </term> Victor's reflection on the nurse's lack of charity and sympathy is surely justified, but

						more substantial claims on his interest and attention. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1352">
						<term target="#spirdead">the spirits of the dead </term> The character of the "guiding spirit" (III:7:17) is darkened even more by this
						representation of the walking dead hovering around Victor and encouraging his desperate venture into a world of death.
						Although such macaberie is conventional to the gothic mode, its psychological impress here is new and startling. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1353">
						<term target="#spirgood">a spirit of good </term> The context strongly suggests that it is the ever-watchful Creature who is sustaining Victor's
						life throughout his long voyage, not the heaven-directed spirits that Victor imagines. Thus, this phrase is heavily weighted
						with irony. The irony is in fact attenuated, for Mary Shelley could not have written this phrase without consciousness of P.B.
						Shelley's title, "Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude," the poem he published in 1816, three months before the excursion to
						Lake Geneva. An alastor in Greek is an evil spirit. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1354">
						<term target="#spirguar">The spirits that guarded me </term> Two paragraphs before Victor hypothesized the active intervention of the spirit
						world on his behalf. By this point he has convinced himself that he is under their protection. This is a further example of
						how in the last pages of his narration Victor moves further and further beyond the boundaries of a normative rationality. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1355">
						<term target="#spirinvo">the spirits that I had invoked to aid me </term> This observation strengthens Victor's faith in an unworldly sanction
						for his mission of destruction. Yet, the forceful egotism by which Victor empowers himself, justifying his actions as divinely
						decreed, also suggests what today we would call a megalomania. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1356">
						<term target="#spirit">this glorious spirit </term> This is the second time that Walton has referred to Victor Frankenstein as "glorious."
						Although less obviously allusive to Milton's characterization of Satan in Paradise Lost than the earlier reference
						(III:Walton:6 and note; see also I:L4:22), the verbal repetition serves to underscore with some finality the parallel with the
						fallen archangel. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1357">
						<term target="#spirits">The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around </term> As the chapter continues the tentative "seems" of the shadow
						cast by the dead is sharpened by Victor into a certainty. The dead become the enablers of his action and he sees himself
						increasingly as acting upon their behalf. Again, Mary Shelley's psychological portrait here is subtly telling: a person who
						has given up all sense of individual will has surrendered the central principal of vitality and may, indeed, be considered to
						have become an agent of death. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1358">
						<term target="#spokenat">as I spoke my native language </term> Although he has spent a full year negotiating his way in English, when Victor is
						reduced to an irrational state he naturally falls back on his native French. There is an undercurrent of class revealed in the
						indication that only Mr. Kirwin among the Irish attendants or villagers is sufficiently educated to understand French. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1359">
						<term target="#standrew">St. Andrew's </term>
						<p>A coastal city in Fife, St. Andrew's is the site of the oldest university in Scotland, founded in 1411. However impatient
							Victor represents himself, he and Henry Clerval go well out of their way to visit medieval sites on their way to Perth. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="1360">
						<term target="#steeples">the numerous steeples of London </term>
						<p> Coming up the Thames, these late eighteenth-century travellers remark the objects that rise above the cityscape, which in
							general would have otherwise been limited to perhaps five or six storeys in height. In these circumstances the steeples of
							the London churches would have called attention to themselves, as they include many architectural masterpieces. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1361">
						<term target="#storm">Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended </term> Mary Shelley's readers might easily construe the storm as merely
						providing a conventional Gothic atmosphere in which to wrap the suspense of this long-awaited evening. But the storm functions
						more specifically as a leitmotif associated with the sublime power of nature, of forces beyond human control, and of the
						Creature. There actually are only two such Gothic storms in Frankenstein. The first was also set in the environs of Lake
						Geneva and occured as Victor, returning from Ingolstadt, sought out the scene of his brother William's death at Plainpalais.
						There in a brilliant flash of lightning he encountered the form of his Creature for the first time since the night of its
						creation. That scene in the sixth chapter in the first volume (I:6:20) thus operates as a symmetrical counterpart to this
						other storm of the sixth chapter of the third volume, anticipating the reemergence of the Creature into Victor's domestic
						idyll. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1362">
						<term target="#story">The story is too connected </term> Doubtless, Victor, who has in numerous critical situations been unwilling to explain
						his case for fear of not being believed, worries about how he can convey his deposition so as to produce conviction. Yet, once
						again, the language reminds us that we are in the midst of a narrative whose truth is totally dependant on the veracity of the
						narrator. Victor likewise makes much of its internal consistency to Walton as he begins the narration (I:L4:30). What this
						detail adds is the realization that Victor's is truly what Nathaniel Hawthorne termed a "twice-told tale," having, with the
						exception of its final chapter, been already rehearsed in the judge's chamber. The reiteration of such a tale of fatally
						transgressed boundaries recalls the context provided by the same sort of obsessive repetition in Coleridge's "Rime of the
						Ancient Mariner." <p/>

					<item n="1363">
						<term target="#stpauls">St. Paul's </term>
						<p> In the eighteenth century the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, after St. Peter's in Rome the largest structure in the world,

						<term target="#strasbrg">Strasburgh </term>
						<p> The idea here is that Victor would travel northeast to Basel on the confines of Switzerland, thence follow the Rhine to
							Strasbourg, where he would be met by Clerval who, suspending his course of studies at the University of Ingolstadt, would
							have travelled west across Germany to join him. The two would then proceed north by boat through Germany into Holland
							where the Rhine empties into the North Sea just beyond Rotterdam. This is essentially the return route followed by Mary
							Godwin and Percy Shelley in their 1814 excursion memorialized in A History of a Six Weeks' Tour.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1365">
						<term target="#strchanc">the strange chances that have lately occured </term> Mary Shelley's diction indicates how deliberately she has plotted
						these "strange chances" to seem beyond the ordinary expectations of causality, whether in a human or a novelistic sphere. Such
						uncanny events are, however, a customary feature of the gothic novel, and it is at points like this that one feels that the
						author fully recognizes the heritage she is exploiting. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1366">
						<term target="#struggle">A deadly struggle would take place </term> Although Victor is self-evidently no match in strength with his creature, he
						continually looks to a melodramatic struggle-to-the-death to resolve their conflict, thus substituting a simply physical
						resolution for one that might embody ethical or psychological justice. Once again, one may read here a female author's sense
						of the conventions of masculinist fictions, whether those of art or real life. (For other instances where Victor similarly
						falls back on physical competitiveness, see II:2:5, II:2:6, III:3:16 and III:3:17). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1367">
						<term target="#subsist">I generally subsisted on the wild animals </term> In the vegetarian Shelley household this information would carry an
						implicit ring of false consciousness, as Victor charges himself with a solemn revenge for murders of human beings yet supports
						his mission by killing other sentient creatures. Readers will recall that, in contrast, the Creature is a strict vegetarian.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1368">
						<term target="#succeed">yet another may succeed </term> Victor's complete self-contradiction in his last moments mirrors the novel's ambivalence
						over the conflicting claims of domestic retreat and aspiring self-assertion, which are in turn poles that themselves comprise
						a dialectical field over which Romanticism continually expresses much ambivalence. The particular terms of Victor's last
						utterance have a somewhat chilling effect: at what, a reader may well wonder, does Victor contemplate another's success? If in
						the realm in which he has failed, assuming the role of God, we may envision from Victor's experience a greater, even a
						catastrophic, failure. Even as he moves linguistically to open up possibility, the lingering effects of his example resist his
						optimism. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1369">
						<term target="#sufblunt">suffering blunt </term> The reader who has overheard the Creature's narrative—particularly his claim that "misery made
						me a fiend" (see II:2:11 and note)—may view this generalized platitude with a more sharply focussed perspective than Victor
						brings to bear on it. As is so often the case, he misses the connnection between his experiences and those of the being he
						created. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1370">
						<term target="#suffic">sufficent for me was the consciousness of them </term> In other words, what human society allows into its purview is no
						longer the factor by which Victor judges his actions. His sense of pronounced guilt in the face of a normative cultural
						sanction of his innocence moves him further into an alienated posture that seems identical with what we have come, in the
						second volume of the novel, to characterize as that of the Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1371">
						<term target="#summoney">a sum of money, together with a few jewels </term> Does Mary Shelley intend us to see a comparison or a total contrast
						with Safie, who uses virtually the same words to explain how she escaped her father in Leghorn and made it north to the De
						Lacey's cottage in Germany? That episode, impelled by love, occurs at the center and southern extremity of the novel; Victor,
						in this last chapter of his narrative, stands near its outer edge and sets out for the far north driven by a hatred that in
						its passion and compulsion seems a mirror reflection of Safie's desire: see II:6:19. <p> The statement also contains a second
							bearing, which is that, although it is not explicitly mentioned by Victor, with the demise of Alphonse Frankenstein,
							Victor, as first-born son, has inherited the family estate and can spend his inheritance in whatever fashion he chooses.
							No longer need he follow his father's admonition to attend a university (see I:2:1) or ask his permission to travel to the
							British Isles (see III:1:11). In effect, Victor is now the patriarch of his family. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1372">
						<term target="#sunshone">the sun shone upon me </term> The context seems to take the reader back to the May afternoon two and a half years
						earlier when Victor and Henry Clerval returned from their happy perambulations in the region of Ingolstadt to find Alphonse
						Frankenstein's letter describing William's death. Such innocent pleasure in natural renewal, Victor asserts, is no longer
						possible for him (see I:5:17). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1373">
						<term target="#swear">swear </term> That Victor has no right to implicate Walton in his vendetta goes without saying. But the legalistic,

						now for many months. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1374">
						<term target="#sympath">sympathies </term> Although Victor dehumanizes the creature, it is interesting to recognize that, even so, he is unable

					</item>
					<item n="1375">
						<term target="#sympstra">the sympathy of a stranger </term> In accentuating his own lack of any ties but the common ones of humanity, Mr. Kirwin
						quietly establishes his link with Walton, who in the immediate context of the narrative recital has likewise altruistically
						attended to Victor's well-being without any sense of obligation or self-congratulation. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1376">
						<term target="#teargush">tears gushed from my eyes </term> Victor's emotional instability is underscored by this sudden excess of sensibility.
						That his rekindled joy will soon be transformed into the despair his isolation in the boat had prefigured is indicative of the
						irony in which, from the point in which he spurned his Creature's desire for sympathetic rapport, he finds himself invested.
						Later, hope will come to him in a "burning gush" of ironically inverted expectation (III:7:22). <p/>

					<item n="1377">
						<term target="#tears">tears . . . streamed from my eyes </term> Even as Victor thinks of himself as reacting with compassion to the assumed

						<term target="#thensafe">Are you then safe </term> Victor's first words to his father in fourteen months must, if we detach ourselves from his
						obsessive perspective, seem more than merely odd. They are the expression of what has become a deeply paranoid personality.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1383">
						<term target="#thetower">the Tower </term>
						<p> By the eighteenth century the Tower of London had been reduced to a tourist attraction, housing the crown jewels, the
							royal armor modelled by full-size wooden figures, and a menagerie dominated by the great cats.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1384">
						<term target="#thinner">She was thinner </term> Characteristically, Victor construes Elizabeth's state of health in reference to himself. At the
						age of twenty-two she should not be so beyond her prime. Clearly, worry over the last two years has taken its toll. Although
						Mary Shelley maintains her undeviating focus on Victor, this momentary description illuminates the cost of his obsession and
						detachment from Elizabeth on her state of mind and body. This is as close to an inner life as Elizabeth ever manifests. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1385">
						<term target="#thisdep">this deposition did not in the least interest me </term> A reader could sense a cultural dislocation and estrangement
						behind this remark. On the other hand, the lack of concern for the plight of others unless it bears in some way on his own
						subtly underscores Victor's egotism here. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1386">
						<term target="#thrust">thrust your sword </term> From the language of the legalistic contract, expressing at least an implicit ideal of
						fidelity, Victor advances to that of the secret assassin. Here in the last sentence of his narration, we are confronted with
						the mentality of a murderer. In that regard, at the very least, the doubling with his creature is absolute. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1387">
						<term target="#tilbury">Tilbury Fort </term> This fortress was erected as the major barrier to the Spanish fleet if it attempted to sail up the
						Thames. The Earl of Leicester's troops were stationed here in 1588. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1388">
						<term target="#tintern">Tintern Abbey </term> Mary Shelley quotes lines 76-83 of the last poem in the 1798 Lyrical Ballads by Wordsworth and
						Coleridge, changing first person pronouns to the third person ("or" in line 83 was regularized by Wordsworth to "nor" only in
						1836). The quotation of these celebrated lines about natural inspiration underscores the association of Henry Clerval with the
						Romantic poet, and more specifically, might recall Byron's remark that Percy Shelley "dosed" him with Wordsworth during the
						summer of 1816. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1389">
						<term target="#tocease">which are to cease but with life </term> Another conspicuous feature of the final chapter is introduced here. Although
						we are close to having completed the narrative circle, returning to Walton's voice part way through this chapter, the
						continual shift of time frames does more than remind us of this impending closure. The sudden confrontation of past and future
						in a sentence such as this also serves implicitly to suggest that at the point where Victor locked himself into the
						hermetically sealed enclosure of his obsession, time began to lose its normative distinctions. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1399">
						<term target="#torch">You throw a torch </term> Walton's metaphor is prescient, since it is by fire that the Creature plans to consume himself
						(III:Walton:45). It is no coincidence but an extensive of the metaphor that Victor appears to have succumbed to a consumptive
						fever (III:Walton:14). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1400">
						<term target="#tore">tore to pieces the thing </term> On the complex moral spectrum laid out by this novel Victor here engages in the
						equivalent of murder. His destructive burst of passion and pointed denial of humanity to the object of his creation, which he
						calls a thing, reduce him at least to the moral level of the Creature, who at this point has likewise been guilty of one
						murder. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1401">
						<term target="#torture">it did not endure the violence of the change without torture </term> Having been created over a long period of time,
						then brought to life, the Creature has passed the nearly six years of his existence being recreated in an inverse, indeed, a
						negative manner. He describes it as viscerallly painful, a creation without anesthesia. The violent negation of his original
						being is a corollary to the way in which hatred replaced love as his bond with Victor Frankenstein. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1402">
						<term target="#tourscot">the tour of Scotland alone </term> Obviously, Victor needs to isolate himself in order to carry out his scientific
						labors. On the other hand, the phraseology here may be seen as indicative of an antisocial instinct that has been so long
						indulged as to have become an essential aspect of his character. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1403">
						<term target="#toyou">To you first entering on life </term> In regard to this curious reminder of the present tense in which Victor narrates
						the story of his life, it is important to recall that, far from being Victor's junior, Walton is 28 years old at this point in
						the account, one year older than Victor. A useful point of comparison is the exchange between the simple Chamois Hunter and
						Manfred in the second act of Byron's Manfred, the dramatic poem he began in the summer of 1816 and set in the same Alpine
						wilderness as the second volume of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1404">
						<term target="#trembled">trembled violently</term>
						<p> This is also the phrase used to depict Felix De Lacey upon his last appearance in the novel (II:8:11 and note). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1405">
						<term target="#tremblin">trembling with passion </term> We are returned to the language of "ardour" associated with Victor's earlier obsession
						with his scientific experiments and to his lack of self-control in their pursuit. What is new here is the sudden resort to
						unchecked and criminal violence. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1407">
						<term target="#truereas">concealing the true reasons</term>
						<p> Asked to reply candidly, Victor lies to his father. This might be considered of a piece with the way he recalled his
							solemn promise to the Creature two paragraphs earlier: no sooner was it invoked than he began immediately to consider what
							would result should he dare to break it.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1408">
						<term target="#trytocon">I tried to conceal </term> Although Clerval has just been described as like a "former self" to Victor, the difference
						between them involves more than the effect of experience on each man's sense of well-being. Victor is, in effect, living a
						lie, and his lack of openness to Clerval is the actual wedge by which their division is being enforced. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1409">
						<term target="#turning">like the turning of the wheel </term> When Ixion, king of Thessaly, fell in love with Hera, Zeus punished him for his
						effrontery by binding him to a wheel in Hades that revolved in perpetuity. In notable instances in the English literary
						tradition the mode of Ixion's torture is reconceptualized in psychological terms. Mary Shelley would surely have been familiar
						with King Lear's portrayal of himself as "bound/ Upon a wheel of fire" (IV.vii.46-47). It could well be that her own image
						influenced Percy Shelley's employment of the same figure in Prometheus Unbound (see I.139-42). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1410">
						<term target="#twomonth">I lay for two months </term> It has been less than three years since Victor Frankenstein had been seized with a similar
						"nervous fever" that, after the creation of his being, confined him for months (see I:4:17 and note). Mary Shelley emphasizes
						how severely debilitated his physical state has become as a result of the acute psychological stress under which he has been
						laboring and from which no amount of diversion can seem to liberate him. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1411">
						<term target="#unavoid">the threatened fate as unavoidable </term> Victor's constant attention to his unavoidable fate is at least partly to be
						construed, at this point in the discourse, as a justification for the blindness with which he worried so exclusively about
						himself, leaving Elizabeth unprotected. But it falls in line as well with his reiterated invocation of destiny during this
						narration to Walton, a rhetorical ploy by which, whether or not it is his explicit intention, he exonerates himself of
						acknowledged responsiblity for the events his actions produce. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1412">
						<term target="#unming">unmingled with disbelief </term> Victor's self-consciousness as to his effect as narrator shadows this deposition of his
						case, both for the magistrate and for Mary Shelley's readers. We cannot help recognizing here that the end of a novel is to
						make fiction appear like truth. That Victor in the end does not gain the credence of his judge does, of course, vindicate his
						earlier reticence; but it also in some sense impinges on his reliability as a witness. Does it also have a destabilizing
						effect on the larger narrative of which it is a microcosm? <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1413">
						<term target="#uttercar">utter carelessness . . . second </term> Again, as in his shock over the mistreatment of Justine Moritz in the first
						volume (I:7:30), Victor's innate sense of decency is evoked to complicate our recognitions: in this particular case, that his
						own medical carelessness was implicit in his creation of a being with monstrous features who could not function within a
						conventional social format (I:3:7) and that his uncaring brutality has been recently marked in the wanton destruction of the
						second creature on whom he had been working in the preceding chapter (III:3:4). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1414">
						<term target="#vasthand">one vast hand was extended </term> With his "hand . . . stretched out, seemingly to detain" his double, the Creature
						replicates the gesture in which he first appeared before Victor's eyes, in his bedroom in Ingolstadt (I:4:3). The reaction of
						Walton to his monstrous presence is in stark contrast to that evinced on that previous occasion by his creator. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1415">
						<term target="#vintage">We travelled at the time of the vintage </term> In this context "vintage" means the harvesting of the grapes used in
						making the classic white wines of Germany frequently designated as "Rhine wines." Mary Godwin, Claire Clairmont, and Percy
						Bysshe Shelley descended the Rhine at this same time of year in 1814, and this description is colored by the experiences Mary
						recorded in A History of a Six Weeks' Tour. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1416">
						<term target="#virtue">the love of virtue </term> The Creature unwittingly echoes the language with which Victor surveyed his past life after
						the execution of Justine Moritz (II:1:1). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1417">
						<term target="#voluntar">voluntary thought </term> Beginning with this phrase, the last chapter of Victor's long narration starts a subtle
						recapitulation and intensification of the overarching themes of his discourse. In this case, if we read between the lines we
						realize that Victor has finally given up all reponsibility for his own actions and, with that loss, any sense of his
						individual identity. He is now locking himself within the dyad of his adversarial relation with the Creature. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1418">
						<term target="#wasalone">I was alone </term> Victor ironically echoes the reflection of the Creature, as he contemplates the domestic happiness
						of the De Lacey household, on his contrasting solitude. The diction the Creature used at the point—"no Eve soothed my
						sorrows"—would suggest that it was then that he began to conceive the plan for a mate that here comes to a disastrous
						conclusion. (See II:7:11). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1419">
						<term target="#watery">the watery, clouded eyes </term> See I:4:2. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1420">
						<term target="#wearing">Wearing away his time fruitlessly </term> The 1818 text at this point stipulates that "nearly a year had elapsed" since
						this journey had begun from Geneva, a period the 1831 text identifies as "the latter end of September." (There is a month's
						disparity between the two texts on this point—see III:1 in 1818 and 1831). In her revision of the novel Mary Shelley, desiring
						to underpin the professional engagement of Henry Clerval, quietly presses home the irony that he, who once indolently indulged
						himself in imitating eastern poetry (see I:6:14) now has, in contrast to Victor, a firm sense of personal mission and a
						commitment to the future. Of course, in Ingolstadt at one point Victor was himself posssessed of both traits. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1421">
						<term target="#wept">I should have wept to die </term> It is true that the Creature's first experience of spring was joyful (II:4:19); but
						his memory is here playing tricks with him. He was created on a "dreary night of November" (I:4:1), and upon his escape into
						the woods near Ingolstadt he experienced extreme and uncomfortable cold. His reaction to his first day of life was, in fact,
						to weep (II:3:2). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1422">
						<term target="#whatfeel">What his feelings were </term> Mary Shelley at once reminds us that the Creature has feelings and that, except on the
						one occasion on Mont Blanc when he told his life story (II:3:1), they are wholly indecipherable to Victor, beset as he is with
						his calculations of revenge. She also prepares us for his unmediated reintroduction into the arena of the novel when in its
						last scene he comes aboard Walton's ship (III:Walton:33). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1423">
						<term target="#whofear">Who feared that if I lost all trace I should despair and die </term> The egotism of this statement is less strange than
						its underlying logic, which is that the closed circle of revenge enacts a kind of perverse sympathy in which the Creature
						sustains Victor so that he may continue on his mission to destroy his Creature. Throughout this final chapter of Victor's
						narration Mary Shelley is ingenious in following through on the implications of a life cast wholly in an ironic mode. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1424">
						<term target="#wildimag">wild and enthusiastic imagination </term> This encomium to Henry Clerval touches virtually all the thematic stops
						invoked by the novel in its representation of an ideal character, with terms already enveloped with multiple associations.
						Although any single one in excess might reveal a flaw productive of personal and social difficulties, in Clerval they reside
						in a perfect dynamic and dialectical balance. Where earlier critics associate Clerval with Percy Bysshe Shelley, this passage
						would be taken as a loving tribute to him. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1425">
						<term target="#wind">the wind was unfavorable </term> As would be natural in this environment, the storm descends from the west or northwest,
						picking up energy and precipitation in traversing Lake Geneva. To return to Geneva, Victor must drive squarely against the
						wind. With sails thus rendered useless, only manual exertion can prevail against the storm. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1426">
						<term target="#windsor">Windsor</term>
						<p> Percy Shelley had been living in Windsor when he first met Mary, and it was to that region that they moved in 1817 to set
							up their household in Marlow. There Mary Shelley wrote the principal part of this novel. It is clear that in retrospect
							Windsor held a special place in Mary Shelley's memories: it is the site, for instance, in which she bases the early
							chapters of The Last Man (1826), with their idealized portraits of herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1427">
						<term target="#windstre">the wind was contrary, and the stream of the river was too gentle </term> In other words, the boat was encountering a
						north wind blowing against their further progress in that direction. By the time the Rhine reaches Cologne it has broadened
						considerably, abating the strong current it bears through the mountainous country further south. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1428">
						<term target="#wish">a wish . . . across me </term> In its context this is a striking revelation of Victor's deep, antisocial isolation,
						which contrasts ironically with the passionate need for community that drives the Creature and that has just been denied him,
						it would appear, forever. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1429">
						<term target="#wretch">the wretch </term> By this time, we are so aware of how this kind of terminology distances and demonizes the Creature
						that Victor's resort to it is perhaps only to be expected. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1430">
						<term target="#wretch2">Wretch! </term> At this late point in the novel this vocative is literally true, and the Creature will acknowledge it so
						three paragraphs later. Still, we have to recognize that we have come full circle: Walton addresses the Creature with the
						appellation employed by Victor Frankenstein immediately after his creation (I:4:2 and note) and again upon reencountering him
						on the Mer-de-Glace of Mont Blanc (II:2:5 and note). Two sentences later he will reiterate Victor's linguistic leap into
						transcendental terminology, demonizing the Creature as a fiend. In his response the Creature picks up on the shift in
						signification, comparing himself both to Adam and to Satan. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1431">
						<term target="#yearago">a year ago </term> At this point in the year before Victor and Henry resided in London and were preparing to transfer
						their center of activity to Oxford. Elizabeth must be referring to the despondent period the summer earlier, following
						Victor's confrontation by the Creature beneath Mont Blanc. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1432">
						<term target="#youmy">you, my friend </term> Not since Volume 1 (I:3:13, I:6:18 and note) have the narrative lines been broken to remind us of
						the circumstances in which this story is being told. As was the case in those instances Victor signals a new intensification
						in the circumstances of the plot, with Henry Clerval reentering the novel. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="1433">
						<term target="#young">young man </term> As the weight of circumstances and of tragedies accumulates it may be somewhat difficult to remember
						the actual chronology of the novel. Victor is yet only 24 years old. <p/>
