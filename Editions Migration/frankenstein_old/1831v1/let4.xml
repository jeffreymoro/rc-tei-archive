<p>So
 
          strange an accident has
 
          happened to us, that I
 
          cannot forbear recording
 
          it, although it is very
 
          probable that you will
 
          see me before these papers
 
          can come into your possession.       </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Last Monday
            (July 31st),
 
             we were nearly surrounded
 
             by ice, which closed
            in the ship on all sides,
 
             scarcely leaving her
            the sea-room in
 
             which she floated.
            Our situation was somewhat
 
             dangerous, especially
 
             as we were compassed
            round by a very thick
            fog. We accordingly
            lay to, hoping that
            some change would take
            place in the atmosphere
 
             and weather.
            </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>

About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched
out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which
seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own
mind began to grow watchful
with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our
own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge
and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of
half a mile: a being which had
the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat
in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress
of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant
inequalities of the ice.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>    This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as  we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but       this  apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so  distant       as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was  impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the  greatest attention.      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the       ground sea; and       before night       the ice broke, and freed  our ship. We, however, lay to until  the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses  which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this  time to rest for a few hours.      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon the deck,  and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently  talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we  had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on       a large fragment of ice.  Only       one dog remained alive; but there was a   human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the   vessel.       He was not, as the other traveller   seemed to be, a savage inhabitant       of some undiscovered island, but   an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, "Here is our   captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea."      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a       foreign accent. "Before I come on board  your vessel," said he, "will you have the kindness to inform me whither  you are bound?"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>    You may conceive my       astonishment       on hearing  such a question  addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to  whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a  resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious  wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on  a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to  come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who  thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been  boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully  emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so  wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin;  but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he       fainted. We  accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to  animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow  a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life, we wrapped  him up in blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the  kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little  soup, which restored him wonderfully.      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often  feared that his suffering had deprived him of understanding. When he had  in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and       attended on him       as much as my duty  would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have  generally an expression of wildness, and even       madness; but there are moments when, if  any one performs an act of kindness towards him, or does him any the most  trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a  beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is  generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he       gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of  the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>      When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the  men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him  to be tormented by       their idle  curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently  depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he  had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle?      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest  gloom; and he replied, "To seek one who fled from me."      </p>
<p>    "And did the       man whom you pursued travel in the same  fashion?"      </p>
<p>    "Yes."      </p>
<p>    "Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked  you up, we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it,  across the ice."      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>This aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a  multitude of questions concerning the route which the       dæmon, as  he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with  me, he said,—"I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as  well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to  make inquiries."      </p>
<p>    "Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman  in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine."      </p>
<p>    "And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous  situation; you have       benevolently       restored me to  life."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Soon after this he inquired, if I thought that the breaking up of  the ice had destroyed the other sledge? I replied, that I could  not answer with any degree of certainty; for the ice had not  broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived  at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not  judge.      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>From this time the a new spirit of life animated       the decaying frame of the stranger. He  manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge  which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the  cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I  have promised that some one should watch for him, and give him instant  notice if any new object should appear in sight.      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the       present day. The stranger has gradually  improved in health, but is very silent, and appears uneasy when any one  except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and  gentle, that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had  very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to       love him as a brother; and his constant  and deep grief fills me with       sympathy  and compassion. He must have been a       noble creature in his better days,  being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I said in       one of my letters, my dear   Margaret, that I should   find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before  his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to  have possessed as the brother of my heart.      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,  should I have any fresh incidents to record.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>August 13th, 17--.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> My
 
          affection for my guest increases
 
           every day. He excites
          at once my admiration
          and my pity to an astonishing
 
           degree. How can I see so
 
            noble a creature destroyed
 
             by misery without feeling
 
             the most poignant grief?
 
             He is so gentle, yet
            so wise; his mind is
            so cultivated; and when
            he speaks, although
            his words are culled
            with the choicest art,
            yet they flow with rapidity
            and unparalleled
 
          eloquence.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>He
 
          is now much recovered
         from his illness, and is
         continually on the deck,
         apparently watching for
         the sledge that preceded
         his own. Yet, although
         unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied       by
         his own misery, but that
         he interests himself deeply
         in the projects of others.
         He has frequently conversed
         with me on mine, which
         I have communicated to
         him without  disguise.
         He entered attentively
         into all my arguments in
         favour of my eventual success,
         and into every minute detail
         of the measures I had taken
         to secure it. I was easily
         led by the sympathy which
         he evinced, to use the
         language of my heart; to
         give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul;
         and to say, with all the
         fervour that warmed me,
         how gladly I would sacrifice
         my fortune, my existence,
         my every hope, to the furtherance
         of my enterprise. One man's
         life or death were but
         a small price to pay for
         the acquirement of the knowledge       which
 
          I sought; for the dominion
 
          I should acquire and transmit
         over the elemental foes
         of our race. As I spoke,
         a dark gloom spread over
         my listener's countenance.
         At first I perceived that
         he tried to suppress his
 
          emotion; he placed his
         hands before his eyes;
         and my voice quivered and
         failed me, as I beheld
         tears trickle fast from
         between his fingers,—a groan burst from his
         heaving breast. I paused;—at length he spoke,
 
          in broken accents:—"Unhappy
             man! Do you share  my madness?
 
              Have you drank also
 
              of the intoxicating
 
              draught? Hear me,—let me reveal my
             tale, and you will
             dash the cup from your
             lips!"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Such
         words, you may imagine,
         strongly excited my curiosity;
         but the paroxysm of grief
         that had seized the stranger
         overcame his weakened powers,
         and many hours of repose
         and tranquil conversation
         were necessary to restore
         his composure.      
         </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>    Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise   himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the       dark tyranny of   despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He   asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told: but   it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding         a friend—of my thirst for a more   intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and   expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness, who   did not enjoy this blessing.</p>
</item>
<item>"I agree with you," replied the stranger; "we are unfashioned creatures,        but
half made up, if one wiser,   better, dearer than ourselves—such a
friend ought to be—do not lend   his aid to perfectionate our weak and
faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am
entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world
before you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost every thing,
and       cannot begin
life anew."      </item>
<item>
<p>As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm  settled grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent,  and presently retired to his cabin.      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does  the       beauties of nature. The starry  sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems  still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a  double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by  disappointments; yet, when he has       retired  into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo  around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.      </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Will you smile at the       enthusiasm       I  express concerning this       divine  wanderer? You would not, if you saw him. You have been tutored and  refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are, therefore,        somewhat fastidious; but this only   renders you the more fit to appreciate the       extraordinary merits       of this wonderful   man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he   possesses, that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I   ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment; a quick but   neverfailing power of judgment; a penetration into the causes of things,   unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of   expression, and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.</p>

 Yesterday
 the
 stranger
 said
 to
 me, "You
 may
 easily
 perceive,
 Captain
 Walton,
 that
 I
 have
 suffered
 great
 and
 unparalleled
 misfortunes.
 I
 had
 determined,
 at
 one
 time,
 that
 the
 memory
 of
 these
 evils
 should
 die
 with
 me;
 but
 you
 have
 won
 me
 to
 alter
 my
 determination.
 You
 seek
 for knowledge  and
 wisdom,
 as
 I
 once
 did;
 and
 I
 ardently
 hope
 that
 the
 gratification
 of
 your
 wishes
 may
 not
 be
 a
 serpent
 to
 sting
 you,
 as
 mine
 has
 been.
 I
 do
 not
 know
 that
 the
 relation
 of
 my
 disasters
 will
 be
 useful
 to
 you;
 yet,
 when
 I
 reflect
 that
 you
 are
 pursuing
 the
 same
 course,
 exposing
 yourself
 to
 the
 same
 dangers
 which
 have
 rendered
 me
 what
 I
 am,
 I
 imagine
 that
 you
 may
 deduce
 an
 apt
 moral
 from
 my
 tale;
 one
 that
 may
 direct
 you
 if
 you
 succeed
 in
 your
 undertaking,
 and
 console
 you
 in
 case
 of
 failure.
 Prepare
 to
 hear
 of occurrences
 which
 are
 usually
 deemed
 marvellous.
 Were
 we
 among
 the
 tamer
 scenes
 of
 nature,
 I
 might
 fear
 to
 encounter
 your
 unbelief,
 perhaps
 your
 ridicule;
 but
 many
 things
 will
 appear
 possible
 in
 these
 wild
 and
 mysterious
 regions,
 which
 would
 provoke
 the
 laughter
 of
 those
 unacquainted
 with the
 ever-varied
 powers
 of
 nature:—nor
 can
 I
 doubt
 but
 that
 my
 tale
 conveys
 in
 its
 series
 internal
 evidence
 of
 the truth of
 the
 events
 of
 which
 it
 is
 composed."

<p>You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered  communication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a  recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the  promised narrative, partly from       curiosity, and partly from a strong  desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these   feelings in my answer.</p>

<p>      "I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but it is useless; my       fate       is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for  one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,"  continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; "but you are  mistaken,       my friend, if thus you  will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny:  listen to my  history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined."      </p>

<p>He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when I  should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have  resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to  record,       as nearly as possible       in  his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged,  I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the  greatest pleasure: but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own  lips, with what       interest and  sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my  task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on  me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in  animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul  within. Strange and harrowing must be his story; frightful the storm which  embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and wrecked it—thus!</p>
