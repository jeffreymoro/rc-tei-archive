<p rend="emph">Preface</p>

<list type="simple">
<item>
<p>THE event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by Dr. Darwin, and some of  the physiological writers of Germany, as not of
									impossible occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to such an
									imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors. The
									event on which the interest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or
									enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a
									physical fact, affords a point of view to the
									imagination for the delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the
									ordinary relations of existing events can yield.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their
									combinations. The Iliad, the tragic poetry of Greece, Shakespeare, in the Tempest and Midsummer
										Night's Dream and most especially Milton, in Paradise Lost, conform to this rule; and the most
									humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from his labours, may, without presumption, apply to prose
									fiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human feeling
									have resulted in the highest specimens of poetry.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual conversation. It was commenced partly as a source
									of amusement, and partly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind. Other motives were mingled
									with these as the work proceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies
									exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader; yet my chief concern in this respect
									has been limited to the avoiding the enervating effects of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition of
										the amiableness of domestic affection, and the
									excellence of universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from the character and situation of the hero
									are by no means to be conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn
									from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It is a subject also of additional interest to the author that this story was begun in the majestic region where
									the scene is principally laid, and in society which cannot cease to be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in
									the environs of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire,
									and occasionally amused ourselves with some German
										stories of ghosts, which happened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of
									imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the pen of
									one of whom would be far more acceptable to the public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and myself
									agreed to write each a story founded on some supernatural occurrence.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends left me on a journey among the Alps, and lost, in
									the magnificent scenes which they present, all memory of their ghostly visions. The following tale is the only one
									which has been completed.</p>
<p> MARLOW, September, 1817.</p>
