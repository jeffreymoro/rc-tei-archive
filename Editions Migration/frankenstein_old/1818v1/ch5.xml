CLERVAL then put the following letter into my
hands.
</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"To V. FRANKENSTEIN.
  </p>
<p>

"MY DEAR COUSIN,</p>
<p>"I cannot describe to you the uneasiness we have all felt
concerning your health.  We cannot help imagining that your
friend Clerval conceals the extent of your disorder:  for it is
now several months since we have seen your hand-writing; and all
this time you have been obliged to dictate your letters to Henry.
Surely, Victor, you must have been exceedingly ill; and this
makes us all very wretched, as much so nearly as after the death
of your dear mother.  My uncle was almost persuaded that you were
indeed dangerously ill, and could hardly be restrained from
undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.  Clerval always writes that
you are getting better; I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in
your own hand-writing; for indeed, indeed, Victor, we are all
very miserable on this account.  Relieve us from this fear, and
we shall be the happiest creatures in the world.  Your father's health is now so
vigorous, that he appears ten years younger since last winter.
Ernest also is so much
improved, that you would hardly know him:  he is now nearly
sixteen, and has lost that sickly appearance which he had some
years ago; he is grown quite robust and active.
</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"My uncle and I conversed a long time last night about what
profession Ernest should follow.  His constant illness when young
has deprived him of the habits of application; and now that he
enjoys good health, he is continually in the open air, climbing
the hills, or rowing on the lake.  I therefore proposed that he
should be a farmer; which you know, Cousin, is a favourite scheme
of mine.  A farmer's is a very healthy happy life; and the least
hurtful, or rather the most beneficial profession of any.  My
uncle had an idea of his being educated as an advocate, that through his interest he might become
a judge.  But, besides that he is not at all fitted for such
an occupation, it is certainly more creditable to cultivate the
earth for the sustenance of man, than to be the confidant,
and sometimes the accomplice, of his vices; which is the
profession of a lawyer.  I said, that the employments of a
prosperous farmer, if they were not a more honourable, they were
at least a happier species of occupation than that of a judge,
whose misfortune it was always to meddle with the dark side of
human nature.  My uncle smiled, and said, that I ought to be
an advocate myself, which put an end to the conversation on that
subject.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"And now I must tell you a story that will please, and perhaps amuse you.
Do you not remember Justine Moritz?  Probably you do not; I will relate
her history, therefore, in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a
widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had
always been the favourite of her father; but, through a strange
perversity, her mother could not endure
her, and, after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt
observed this; and, when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her
mother to allow her to live at her house. The republican institutions of our country
have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the
great monarchies that surround it.
Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its
inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised,
their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same
thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in
our family, learned the duties of a servant; a condition which, in our
fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice
of the dignity of a human being.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"After what I have said, I dare say you well remember the heroine of my
little tale:  for Justine was a great favourite of your's; and I recollect
you once remarked, that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from
Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of
Angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a
great attachment for her, by which she
was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at
first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most
grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any
professions, I never heard one pass her lips; but you could see by her
eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was
gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest
attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all
excellence, and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so
that even now she often reminds me of
her.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"When my dearest aunt died, everyone was too much occupied in their own
grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with
the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials
were reserved for her.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of the
woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites
was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her
confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few
months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her
repentant mother. Poor girl! she wept when she quitted our house: she was
much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a
winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for
vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature to
restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.
She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener
accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.
Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at
first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace forever. She died on the first approach of cold
weather, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has returned to
us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,
and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expressions
continually remind me of my dear aunt.
</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. I wish you could see him; he
is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eye-lashes,
and curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek,
which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little
wives, but Louisa Biron is his
favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of
Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory
visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John
Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last
autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several
misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already
recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a
very lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much
older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with
every body.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I have written myself into good spirits, dear cousin; yet I
cannot conclude without again anxiously inquiring concerning your
health.  Dear Victor, if you are not very ill, write yourself,
and make your father and all of us happy; or -- I cannot bear to
think of the other side of the question; my tears already flow.
Adieu, my dearest cousin.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"ELIZABETH
LAVENZA.</p>
<p>"Geneva, March 18th, 17--."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Dear, dear Elizabeth!" I exclaimed when I had read her
letter, "I will write instantly, and relieve them from the
anxiety they must feel." I wrote, and this exertion greatly
fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded
regularly. In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.
</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the
several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of
rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever
since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my
misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When I was
otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument
would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had
removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment;
for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no
avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he
praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in
the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but, not
guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed
the subject from my improvement to the science itself, with a desire, as
I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to please,
and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in
my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me
to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not
exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always
quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject,
alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a
more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he
was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and
although I loved him with a mixture of
affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never
persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so often present
to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only
impress more deeply.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of
almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me
even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. "D--n the
fellow!" cried he; "why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us
all. Aye, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster
who, but a few years ago, believed Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as the
gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is
not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Aye, aye,"
continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, "M. Frankenstein
is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be
diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval; I was myself when young;
but that wears out in a very short time."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which
happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so
annoying to me.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Clerval was no natural philosopher.  His imagination was too vivid for the
minutiae of science.  Languages were
his principal study; and he sought, but acquiring their elements, to
open a field for self-instruction on his return to Geneva.  Persian,
Arabic, and Hebrew, gained his attention, after he had made himself
perfectly master of Greek and Latin.  For my own part, idleness had ever
been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and
hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil
with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the
works of the orientalists. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
elevating to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any
other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a
warm sun and garden of roses, in
the smiles and frowns of a fair
enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from
the manly
and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome.
</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed
for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents,
winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded
until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to
see my native town, and my beloved friends. My return had only been
delayed so long from an unwillingness
to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted
with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully;
and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came, its beauty
compensated for its dilatoriness.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the
letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when
Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt
that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long
inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was
fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite
companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among
the scenes of my native country.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We passed a fortnight in these perambulations; my health and
spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional
strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural
incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend.
Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my
fellow-creatures, and rendered me
unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart;
he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces
of children. Excellent friend! how
sincerely did you love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind, until it was
on a level with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me,
until your gentleness and
affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy
creature who, a few years ago, loving and beloved by all, had no
sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the power of
bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky and
verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine;
the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while
those of summer were already in bud: I was undisturbed by
thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me,
notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an
invincible burden.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathized in my
feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the
sensations that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on
this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full
of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the
Persian and
Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.
At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out
into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the
peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and
happy. My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with
feelings of unbridled joy and
hilarity.
