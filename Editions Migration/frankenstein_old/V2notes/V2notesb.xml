				<list type="simple">
					<item n="1">
						<term>abhorred devil</term> The repetitiousness of Victor's diction—it was "abhorred monster!" at the beginning of this
						interview (II:2:8)—seems fitting in circumstances where so many mirrored prisms are being deployed simultaneously by Mary
						Shelley. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="2">
						<term>the submission of abject slavery </term> This is a phrase that will resonate through the final third of the novel as the
						Creature and Victor Frankenstein vie for mastery over the other's will. Although fundamentally psychological in its
						formulation, the contention, as this phrase stresses, carries political overtones as well. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="3">
						<term>like Adam </term> Although the Creature here alludes to Adam's instruction by Raphael, which occupies the central third
						of Milton's epic, the imprecation on his creator that follows in the next paragraph bears comparison with the fallen Adam's
						indictment of God and lament that he was ever born (X.720ff). Like Adam, although physically he does not bear the imprint of
						his Creator, the Creature is indissolubly bound to Victor Frankenstein, as is indicated by his frequent unconscious doublings
						in language or gesture. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="4">
						<term>a duty</term> As he has before, Alphonse Frankenstein raises before Victor the notion of duty as a contractual
						obligation between individual and family or state (I:1:1, I:3:10). <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="5">
						<term>the affections of a sensitive being </term> This antiquated terminology bears pausing over. "Sensitive" in this context
						implies both "vitality, "human feeling," and an "independent will." The reciprocity of sensitive beings is the foundation of
						all social interchange; thus, the key to creating a society. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="6">
						<term>disgust and affright </term> The explicitly sensual terms with which the Creature characterizes Caroline Frankenstein,
						unknown to him the mother of his creator-father, recalls his reaction to the first sight of Safie (II:5:4 and note). Clearly,
						Safie is in his mind when the paragraph ends with the anticipated aversion of a beautiful woman to his form. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="7">
						<term>again, with a lessened form</term> That is, the moon has disappeared totally, then has just reappeared in its new phase:
						so, a period of two weeks has elapsed. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="8">
						<term>A gentle light </term>
						<p>The moon, which appears from details that follow in the narrative to be in its full phase. It is so bright, in Victor's
							narrative of the night of the Creature's birth, that "it forced its way through the window-shutters" (I:4:3), allowing him
							sufficient light to discern the features of the Creature as he opened the bed curtains to discover Victor. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="9">
						<term>a hell of intense tortures</term> Again, the stress is on hell as a mental state that Victor bears within himself. As
						demonstrated earlier at I:4:5 (and note) and I:7:30 (and note), Victor's internalization of the pangs of hell-fire is a clear
						allusion to the misery of Milton's Satan in Paradise Lost, especially IV.66-75. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="10">
						<term>aiguilles</term> Literally needles: the term applies to the smaller pinnacles that rise in the periphery of Mont Blanc.
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="11">
						<term>a lady </term> With the arrival of this enigmatic stranger Mary Shelley essentially completes the cast of
						characters—which is to say, the balance of human and social elements—that compose her novel. That Safie is herself an outsider
						makes her curiously similar to the Creature who observes her entrance on the scene. <p/>
					</item>
					<item n="12">
						<term>All was blasted</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>The language seems intended to invoke the "blasted stump" (I:1:22 and note) that is left after lightning strikes the tree
							near Bellerive, a manifestation of the power of the "vital fluid," electricity, that can at once create and destroy. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="13">
						<term>A league</term>
						<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines this unit of measurement as follows: </p>
						<p>LEAGUE: </p>
						<p> league lig, sb.1 Forms: 4-5 leghe, 4-6 lege, leuge, (4 lewge, 5 lewke, leuke, leeke), 5-6 leege, 6 legge, le(a)que, Sc.
							lig, 6-7 leag(e, 6- league. Late ME. leuge, lege, leghe, etc., ad. late L. leuga, leuca (= late Gr. leu'gh, leu'kh),
							according to Hesychius and Jordanes a Gaulish word; hence OFr. liue, liwe (mod.Fr. lieue), Pr. lega, legua, Cat. llegua,
							Sp. legua, Pg. legoa, Ital. lega.</p>
						<p> a. An itinerary measure of distance, varying in different countries, but usually estimated roughly at about 3 miles; app.
							never in regular use in England, but often occurring in poetical or rhetorical statements of distance.</p>
						<p>MARINE LEAGUE</p>
						<p>marine league: a unit of distance = 3 nautical miles or 3041 fathoms. Although the league appears never to have been an
							English measure, leuca occurs somewhat frequently in Anglo-Latin law-books (Bracton, Fleta, etc.); it is disputed whether
							in these works it means one mile or two.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="14">
						<term>All bounds of moderation</term>
						<p>Although Victor had earlier moralized against letting the pursuit of knowledge run away with one's sober judgment (I:3:12),
							here he portrays himself as indulging his hatred with the kind of impulsiveness and lack of restraint he had displayed in
							Ingolstadt. It is clear that what Alphonse Frankenstein had termed "immoderate grief" three paragraphs earlier (II:1:3) is
							not Victor's problem. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="15">
						<term>All pleasures . . . life</term>
						<p>This is a remarkable sentence, redolent of all of Victor's earlier obsessiveness but now transposed into a kind of
							psychotic state. It is surely tied to earlier questions about the unhealthy products of the human imagination. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="16">
						<term>all the light I enjoyed came through the stye</term>
						<p>This is not easy to visualize, but Mary Shelley twice emphasizes the presence of this stye. She appears to do so for
							several interrelated reasons: in order to have a natural bulwark against the Creature's being detected by the cottagers;
							to place the Creature symbolically as close to the natural order as to human beings; and to reveal, against our visceral
							repugnance at the accompanying noise and stench (if the De Lacey household had been able to afford to keep a herd of
							swine), the level of subsistence to which necessity has reduced this being after six weeks or so of his existence. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="17">
						<term>I am alone, and miserable</term>
						<p>In the 1818 edition the last noun of Volume 1, in Victor's narration, is "misery" (I:7:33), and the second volume opens on
							a scene in which he draws further into himself and his despair (II:1:1). Given the technical mastery of Frankenstein, it
							is thus perhaps only to be expected that the Creature's autobiographical account should conclude with the Creature in the
							exact condition of his Creator, sharing an existential misery compounded of solitude and guilt. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="18">
						<term>I will go . . . America</term>
						<p>Although there was relatively little Swiss (or German) emigration to the New World by the time this novel was written,
							there was of course a great amount of it from the country in which Frankenstein was published. Indeed, Percy Bysshe
							Shelley's grandfather had been born in the British Colonies of North America (in Passaic, New Jersey), whence he
							reimmigrated to Great Britain. The closest parallel for the Creature's plan, and probably one that would be uppermost in
							the minds of a contemporary reader, was the British penal colony established in 1788 at Botany Bay in Australia. There
							hardened convicts were transported so as to rid honest citizens from their threat to the common welfare. Over time, of
							course, these outcasts "civilized" a new continent. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="19">
						<term>anger and hatred</term>
						<p>It may be difficult for the reader to suspend prior knowledge of the plot at this point and recall that Victor's one
							sighting of his Creature in the vicinity of Geneva does not constitute proof that he has done anything transgressive, let
							alone has accomplished the murder of William and the framing of Justine. Given what Victor actually knows of his Creature,
							this first greeting of him would seem to testify to a psychological disturbance, if not a real derangement. Certainly, he
							does not treat him as the prodigal son returning to his rightful father. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="20">
						<term>anticipations of joy</term>
						<p>The diction seems deliberately intended to evoke the end of Chapter 5 of Volume 1, where a full year later Victor and
							Clerval return from their walking tour around Ingolstadt—"with feelings of unbridled joy" (I:5:19)— to be greeted by a
							letter from Victor's father announcing the death of his brother William. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="21">
						<term>appearance, different from any I had ever before seen</term>
						<p>The Creature had, of course, seen Victor before, but it was by dim moonlight, with Victor first in bed, then rushing
							hastily from the room (I:4:3). This is his first conscious encounter with another human being, whose mundane business is
							wholly disrupted by this unanticipated and sublime intrusion. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="22">
						<term>arbiters of my future destiny</term>
						<p>The Creature's sense of his destiny stands in marked contrast to Victor's. Whereas the scientist sees himself as passively
							compelled by his destiny within an obsessive solitude, whether in his experiments with the principle of life or, later, in
							pursuit of the being that is its result, the Creature conceives of himself instinctively within a domesticated social
							context where he will be guided by others toward his self-realization. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="23">
						<term>my arch-enemy, because my creator</term>
						<p>In Paradise Lost Satan bears this designation (I.81)—or is named Arch-foe (VI.259)—but it is ironically reversed here to

						<term>the art of language</term>
						<p>Although Mary Shelley in this chapter seems deliberately to be emphasizing the Creature's "ardour" to place it within the
							context of the ambitions driving both Walton and Victor Frankenstein (see paragraph 9 above and note), she is effectively
							contrasting them. In the Creature's education language has a moral function, allowing communication among beings and
							operating as an instrument by which they may think and feel in common. True sympathy, the object of his utmost desire, is
							thus dependent upon language. </p>

						<p>The Arve is fed by the glacier called the Mer de Glace (Sea of Ice), where the remaining chapters of Volume 2 will take

						<p>The simile is telling here. We will discover in the next chapter that the Alps can, indeed, support another "race" of
							beings. Yet, however much human imagination may discern in these altitudes the possibility of a transcendence of the human
							condition, neither a human nor another kind of being can effectually manage to do so. Moreover, "another race" of beings,
							if brought down from an imaginary conception to the solid ground of normative human existence would be considered, like
							Victor's Creature, alien and hounded from human society. The conflict between the unrestricted imagination and human

						<p>This is the Creature's second knowing reference to Milton's Paradise Lost (see I.670ff. and X.418ff.): the first was when

						<term>I was like a wild beast</term>
						<p>The language once again affirms the Creature's affinity with nature and natural forces: his atavistic rage is a sublime

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="37">
						<term>beautiful</term>
						<p>The beautiful, in this formulation, would seem to be a characteristic understood only within a human context. That is to
							say, until the Creature can identify himself with human concerns and human emotions, he cannot distinguish the beautiful.
							The corollary of this, however, may not be so honorific to humanity. The birds with whom the creature first identified in
							paragraph four above seem wholly unconcerned with the sublime; but all humans are terrified of it and flee. </p>
						<p/>

						<p>We have no comparable description of Elizabeth Lavenza from Victor, whose appreciation of her virtues overshadows the few

							unself-conscious innocence of the Creature, in contrast, not only do we realize that he has a nuanced appreciation for the
							beautiful, but we also comprehend that strong romantic desire—not a subject in which Victor seems particularly adept—is an
							aspect of his makeup, perhaps to be considered normal for a human being, but in the Creature's circumstances deeply
							problematical. Mary Shelley's delicate handling of the Creature's awakening to desire is an index of the complexity with
							which she endows his character. </p>

					<item n="42">

						<p>It is fair to say that Victor's intentions almost always outstrip his ability to realize them. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="43">
						<term>benevolence</term>
						<p>It is a remarkable achievement of Mary Shelley's that by this point in the Creature's narrative, this word (and its
							derivatives) have become fully ironized. Continually repeated as it is (see, for instance, II:7:2 and II:7:9), this
							Enlightenment concept stands in a kind of verbal isolation, unsupported by any examples that might convince us of its
							dynamic, positive value, or even (outside the Creature's own actions) that active benevolence exists. Thus the Creature's
							ironic conclusion seems altogether appropriate. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="44">
						<term>benevolence</term>
						<p>In this paragraph the Creature skillfully assembles the conclusions to be abstracted from his treatment by the cottagers,
							touching on each of the themes so woven through the fabric of his discourse. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="45">
						<term>benevolent dispositions</term>
						<p>The Creature has been repeating this adjective (and the noun "benevolence") in seeming insistence on the unquestionable
							virtues of the cottagers. Now, the intrusion of the ensuing phrase ("I persuaded myself") and a next sentence in the form
							of a question artfully raises the doubts his narrative has suspended. The entire paragraph, indeed, evokes a litany of the
							high ideals of Enlightenment virtue gleaned by the Creature from his reading and quietly interrogates their efficacy for
							"a wretched outcast." </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="46">
						<term>berries, nuts, and roots</term>
						<p>Although it might seem eccentric to some readers, a crucial aspect of the Creature's bonding with the De Lacey family comes
							from the shared benevolence they practice to the natural world. Their mutual vegetarian nourishment is stressed in these
							adjacent paragraphs. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="47">
						<term>Why . . . so wantonly bestowed</term>
						<p>This is the third time this phrasing has been heard in the volume. The first is at its very beginning where Victor
							confesses that he "ardently wished to extinguish that life which [he] had so thoughtlessly bestowed" (II:1:6). The second
							occurence takes place during the encounter on the Mer de Glace, where under the intensity of the experience Victor adds to
							his weight of guilt, vowing to "extinguish the spark that I so negligently bestowed" (II:2:8). The Creature thus taunts
							Victor with his own words and desires, but stresses the character of the negligence involved: his life, he asserts, has
							been "wantonly bestowed," which returns him to his earlier line of attack: "How dare you sport thus with life?" (II:2:7). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="48">
						<term>books</term>
						<p>The novel's continuing self-reflexiveness is quietly underscored here, but so is the idea of a personal library. A further
							step in the Creature's education and his exploration of his identity, reading books, rather than just overhearing them
							being read, frees him from another's tutelage, increasing his own sense of responsibility and maturity. Whether such books
							can make him happier is another question entirely. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="49">
						<term>bound by ties</term>
						<p>As Alphonse Frankenstein continually speaks from the vantage of patriarch of the family, asserting an almost tribal sense
							of bonded attachment, so the Creature confronts Victor with his unique equivalence to those blood-ties, a bond Victor has
							from the first spurned. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="50">
						<term>burning passion</term>
						<p>There is an unmistakeable erotic charge to the language of these paragraphs, but it is almost metaphysical in its
							conception. The Creature suggests that the rage awakened within him, which is fired by his rejection and desperate
							solitude, can only be slaked by being converted into a psychologically and socially constructive alternative, which is to
							say love. There are ramifications here as well for the "ardent" pursuits of both Walton and Victor Frankenstein. </p>
						<p>Although the notion of channeling libidinous forces into socially beneficial relationships might be thought particularly
							suited to a woman's perspective on modern culture, the conventions of the age kept most women authors from a direct
							engagement with issues of sexuality and its repression or displacement. A notable exception is Mary Wollstonecraft. Here
							one senses a true family resemblance. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="51">
						<term>burst all bounds of reason</term>
						<p>The Creature unconsciously echoes the very language Victor (II:1:6 and note) had used to express his violent aversion to
							him earlier in the chapter before their encounter in the mountains. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="52">
						<term>by the sun . . . heaven</term>
						<p>Given the richness of context provided by Milton's representation of the Judeo-Christian Genesis in Paradise Lost, one
							cannot miss the alternate model being provided by the Creature, a pantheism rooted in nature. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="53">
						<term>cause should produce such opposite effects</term>
						<p>Twice in the paragraph stressing the word "cause," the Creature learns that pleasure and pain proceed from the same force,
							a considerable development in his education and mental sophistication. If this is the groundwork of morality, however, it
							is important to recognize that it shares a common bond, as the earlier quotation from Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Mutability"
							may remind us, with the scientific systems that form so conspicuous a context for the novel (see II:2:3 and note). There
							are other elements emphasized in the novel that likewise exist on a neutral ground that can result in either good or ill:
							curiosity is an obvious case in point (II:2:16). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="54">
						<term>I will cause fear</term>
						<p>In this phrase the Creature encapsulates what will become the dynamic force of the third volume, an intense desire turned
							inside out and thus ironized, so that hatred is pursued with the single-minded obsession of passionate love. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="55">
						<term>across Mont Cenis</term>
						<p>This was the easiest route into Italy, across southeastern France from Chambery to Turin in northwestern Italy. The Mont
							Cenis Pass rises to only 6825 feet. This was Napoleon's invasion route to Italy in 1796, and thereafter the post-road was
							improved to allow uninterrupted traffic between the two countries. It was this road, indeed, that the Shelleys themselves
							would take shiortly after publication of the novel, in March 1818, on their trip to Italy. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="56">
						<term>the chain . . . excluded</term>

					<item n="58">
						<term>thy compassion</term>
						<p>In effect, the Creature asks Victor to look the other way and listen to his story. We will recognize the similarity of this
							plea to that made to the blind De Lacey when the Creature first attempts to establish human community later in the volume
							(II:7:15). Throughout Frankenstein sound, rather than sight, is the means by which human sympathy is evoked. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="59">
						<term>compassion</term>
						<p>An appeal to justice must necessarily depend on compassion, fellow-feeling. This is the only occasion in the Creature's
							existence where, even momentarily, he has been accorded what we assume to be that fundamental right of human beings. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="60">
						<term>He was tried, and condemned to death</term>
						<p>This is, it should be obvious, the novel's second such condemnation of an innocent victim after a summary trial. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="61">
						<term>I did not strive to controul them</term>
						<p>The power of the Creature's rage is shocking, perhaps as well to himself after having spent an entire year in isolation and
							under a regimen of strict and carefully enforced self-control. The infinitive, however, reminds us how severely that
							control has been earlier exercised by him. It might likewise call to mind the lack of restraint with which Victor
							Frankenstein pursued the researches that resulted in the Creature's birth (I:3:3). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="62">
						<term>conversed with my family</term>
						<p>Such incongruity of tone can have its value (though Mary Shelley did decide in the third edition to remove the family
							presence altogether from Victor's excursion to Mont Blanc). We will shortly be reminded that there is another part of
							Victor's family he has assiduously avoided and to whom, unlike his conventional family, he has given no solicitude
							whatsoever. The oddity of tone here, quickly rectified by the gloomy weather of the next morning, almost unconsciously
							prepares us for the conversation so feared and so long postponed but now, given the state of Victor's psychological
							condition, clearly urgent. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="63">
						<term>names of the cottagers</term>
						<p>The naming of the cottagers depends not just on their individual identities but also on their family, i.e., their social,
							relations. That they thus have several different names, depending on which aspect is being emphasized, constitutes a new
							level of awareness on the Creature's part. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="64">
						<term>his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity</term>
						<p>The nouns here are all associated with Satan and the Satanic in Paradise Lost: e.g. "anguish" (II.568; VI.340); "disdain"
							(I.98; II.680; V.666); "malign" (III.553; IV.503; VII.189). And yet, the framing language forces us to consider
							perspective: "bespoke" is not the same as "constitutes" in its implicit representation of reality; and if Victor, even as
							he articulates it, openly remarks that he "scarcely observed this," where, then, might his terms come from? As we will
							learn from the Creature himself (II:7:7), it is easy to insert oneself (or others) into the mythic texture of Paradise
							Lost: thus it might appear, as it were, that Victor does so first, here defining the Creature as Satanic not from sharp
							empirical observation but from literary—that is to say, cultural—convention. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="65">
						<term>you must create</term>
						<p>The change in verb form to a command is rhetorically powerful, but it also signals a shift in, broadly speaking, the
							political dynamics of the novel. Victor's power, a symbolic extension of that of his father and family, is no longer
							absolute, but can be successfully challenged by the figure who stands in the position of his son and who can command
							superior strength and tenacity. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="66">
						<term>a creature of fine sensations</term>
						<p>Along with his acknowledgement of justice, Victor appears at last to have recognized what a masterpiece of work he created
							only to abandon. Even if he is not reminded of his original ambition to create "a new species," we certainly may be (see
							I:3:8). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="67">
						<term>Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you</term>
						<p>Under the creature's unrelenting accusation, the self-destructive nature of Victor's hatred and its manifestation in the
							Creature-as-double are here at last openly admitted by him. Percy Bysshe Shelley will use the same formula a year later in
							writing the first act of Prometheus Unbound, where Prometheus summons the Phantasm of Jupiter, the specter of his enemy,
							to repeat the self-enchaining curse Prometheus had once pronounced upon Jupiter (see 1.258). There, too, the strong echoes
							of Paradise Lost suggest a reading of God and Satan in the manner represented in his "Defence of Poetry," as
							co-complicitous doubles. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="68">
						<term>Cursed, cursed creator!</term>
						<p>This chapter begins with a remarkable series of linguistic echoes in which the Creature echoes the language of Victor
							Frankenstein, in part to indicate that comparable experiences have produced comparable misery, but also to underscore the
							affinity of creator and creation. The first element is this imprecation, a repetition of the curse Victor pronounced on
							himself at their meeting on the Mer de Glace (II:2:14 and note). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="69">
						<term>Dante's iron . . . hypocrites</term>
						<p>The reference is to Inferno 23.58ff. Here at the end of the volume we are recalled to the "hell of intense tortures" with
							which it began (II:1:1). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="70">
						<term>dare you sport thus with life</term>
						<p>The moral power of this verb stands out against Victor's ineffectual name-calling, reminding us that in some sense
							"curiosity" (a word with considerable resonance in the first volume) is sport, as are all open-ended intellectual
							endeavors associated with the imagination. The pejorative sense of the word as used here against Victor is, appropriately,
							the sense invoked by Victor himself in silently indicting the Creature during the trial of Justine (I:7:11). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="71">
						<term>daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society</term>
						<p>Unlike his son (or, for that matter, Robert Walton), Alphonse Frankenstein shares Justine Moritz's sense, uttered as her
							last words (I:7:31 and note), of the value embodied in a humble, quotidian usefulness. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="72">
						<term>I declared everlasting war . . . me</term>
						<p>The emphasis here is on the psychology of alienation, as centered in the antagonism between Satan and God in Paradise Lost
							(I.105-24). There, as Mary Shelley interprets the emotional dynamics, a cycle of destruction results from God's rejection
							of Satan. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="73">
						<term>deep, dark, death-like solitude</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>The language seems intended to invoke both hell and the grave as being synonymous with Victor's sense of himself, in the
							previous paragraph, as an "evil spirit." Behind this language a reader may sense the solitude of Coleridge's Ancient
							Mariner, won by Life-in-Death and obsessively reenacting his guilt. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="74">
						<term>a deep and deadly revenge</term>
						<p>On an uncomplicated psychological plane Mary Shelley is representing the simple dynamics of the Creature's alienation. With
							no other presence to balance or feel for this injustice, in his solitude he works himself into a confirmed opposition to
							the world that has rejected and threatened him. The Enlightenment virtues of benevolence and sympathy, were they ever to
							be encountered by the Creature, would by their very nature undercut his introverted and exclusionary mental state and
							enforce a social communion. Once again, as in Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Alastor; or, the Spirit of Solitude," published in
							March 1816, we recognize that solitude constitutes an evil spirit leading one to ill. The opening paragraph of Volume 2,
							in which Victor Frankenstein reveals himself similarly introverted and plotting revenge as a means of assuaging his
							self-hatred is, indeed, an appropriate introduction to this dynamic that arches across the volume (see II:1:1 and note). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="75">
						<term>one as deformed . . . deny herself to me</term>
						<p>As at the beginning of this chapter, so at its end the Creature is willing to repress his own desires to accord with the
							normative expectations of humanity. Although human beings cannot endure his sight, he will inure himself to make ugliness
							aesethetically acceptable to his eyes. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="76">
						<term>the family of De Lacey</term>
						<p>The marmoreal cast of this sentence throws the emphasis on the family unit. Whereas before the Creature had seen a
							patriarchal family as nurturing civilized values (II:7:6), here he has reason to interpret it from a contrasting
							perspective, as harboring the equivalent of ethnic prejudices on a small, tightly formed, and exclusionary scale. With
							that perspective in mind one might return to the family unit that Victor Frankenstein left a few hours back to consider
							how little different is its underlying ethos (II:1:3). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="77">
						<term>Felix was too delicate to accept this offer</term>
						<p>There is a marked similarity here between the sense of honor of Felix and that of Alphonse Frankenstein after rescuing the
							daughter of his old friend Beaufort from poverty (I:1:5). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="78">
						<term>Chief delights</term>
						<p>The Creature implicitly reaffirms his part in a natural order and his own affinity with nature. Once again, we are reminded
							that in his composition there are non-human creaturely attributes (see I:3:9 and note) that fit him for the wild. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="79">
						<term>deprived of his wealth and rank</term>
						<p>Given the nature of the injustice visited upon Felix and his family, it is especially fitting that Volney's Ruins should
							form the basic educational text in the cottage. We should recall that it is from that book that the Creature learns, and
							Felix and Safie are bitterly reminded, of the necessities of wealth and rank (II:5:16). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="80">
						<term>I believe, descended</term>
						<p>Victor's workshop, he reported earlier (I:3:9), was a cell at the top of the house, separated in a complex way from the
							main part of the edifice. Presumably, the bedchamber to which he fled at the awakening of the Creature (I:4:3) was on a
							floor below. There the Creature wandered and awoke Victor who then in terror plunged outside. By some means unknown to
							Victor and unremembered by the Creature, the newly created being made his way from the house to the streets outside the
							courtyard, where Victor spent the night, and thence into the countryside surrounding Ingolstadt, where at last he fell
							asleep. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="81">
						<term>desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge</term>
						<p>"Desert" here means "of the wilderness" (cf. III:3:1 and note). This account, then, exactly fulfills the prescription
							innocently thought by Victor as he approached the alpine range, that these mountains might be "the habitations of another
							race of beings" (II:1:12). Since Mont Blanc was first scaled only in 1786, the fact that the Creature has taken up his
							abode there indicates just how superior to conventional human endurance Victor has made him. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="82">
						<term>deserved better treatment</term>
						<p>This would appear a premonition of the Creature's own experience with the De Lacey family. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="83">
						<term>the greater became my desire</term>
						<p>The Creature's intensity, like the suddenness of his admiration for Safie (II:5:4 and note), has the ring of adolescence to
							it. It is not, then, utterly surprising that it should remind us of the diction of the two "ardent" men whose youthful
							discourse we have already overheard: Walton (see I:L1:2 and I:L2:2) and Victor Frankenstein (see I:2:7, I:3:1, and I:3:6).
							Burning desire is a characteristic all three share. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="84">
						<term>my desolate state</term>
						<p>Desolation is, indeed, the appropriate term for a condition in which the Creature is so alienated from his original state
							that he feels the rebirth of spring as an ironic counterforce to his internal degeneration. Mary Shelley carefully marks
							the inherent "unnaturalness" and thus self-destructiveness of such a psychological condition. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="85">
						<term>a destable monster</term>
						<p>None of the cottagers, of course, has as yet to lay sight on the Creature. It is a mark of how self-alienated his education
							has made him that he can presume such a reaction without having to put it to the test. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="86">
						<term>the devoted cottage</term>
						<p>That is, reserved for destruction, the same usage as in the encounter with Victor on the Mer de Glace (II:2:11 and note.) </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="87">
						<term>Devil!</term>
						<p>This is the first word that Victor utters to his Creature. Perhaps, as the allusions to Satan in the previous paragraph
							suggest, it is already in his mind. But, there is a dimension to this epithet beyond its effectiveness as an index to
							Victor's mental state, a timeless and mythic dimension. Although rigorously suppressed wherever organized Christendom
							extended its arms into secular society, the writings of heretical theology, particularly from Gnostic sects, continually
							revert to the concurrence of creation and the fall as two aspects of a single event. Thus to create is to cast out, on a
							universal level as well as, literally so, in childbirth. The cast-off in this case functions as Satan in a dual sense—as a
							disrupter of the putative unity of God and his coextensive creation, and—from the Hebrew root—as the accuser, who here
							immediately upbraids Victor Frankenstein for not doing his duty by his creature.</p>
						<p>Note how carefully Milton embeds this coincidence, without heretically stressing a linkage, in the moment where God divides
							himself so as to function on a second level, as a Creative Word, the Logos that will render God's conceptual blueprint for
							the universe into a workable reality (Paradise Lost, V.594-617). </p>

						<p>As the preceding paragraphs have made clear, the more the Creature reads the more he becomes conscious of alternate plot

						<term>loaded me with epithets</term>
						<p>That it is to stop a child's naming that impels the Creature almost accidentally to kill him is significant in several
							ways. Most importantly, the Creature is existentially unnamed, lacking an identity that denominates a particularized
							selfhood and a socialized connectedness, the sort of implicit identity by which William himself immediately commands
							authority. It was Victor Frankenstein's initial duty as his creator to accord him that name but he fled from the
							responsibility. Thus, everywhere else in the novel, with Victor from his distance actively participating in the process,
							the Creature is identified, not by a name but through epithets, as being outside a human sphere. In a symbolic sense at
							least, William dies for his naming, for taking on a function only his brother has the right to perform. </p>
						<p/>

					<item n="98">
						<term>I looked . . . evil</term>
						<p>The "as yet" introduces an ominous tone into this account, but it also reminds us that the Creature as a voyeur hiding from

						<p>Victor, with something like a Genevan Calvinist's sense of original sin, cannot bring himself to think of his Creature as

						<term>an evil spirit</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>Mary Shelley seems deliberately to invoke the terms of Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Alastor: or, the Spirit of Solitude,"
							published in March 1816 a few months before the summer trip to Geneva. The title was suggested by their friend Thomas Love
							Peacock, poet and novelist, and an autodidact in classical Greek, who conveyed to Percy Bysshe Shelley the aptness of
							using the Greek word for a kakodaimon, "alastor," as the governing term for his poem. The word kakodaimon translates
							exactly into the "evil spirit" invoked here by Victor Frankenstein, and its association with solitude is manifest in these
							circumstances as well. At the same time, a sensitive reader cannot help observing the likeness of this term to the diction
							Victor commonly uses to describe his Creature, which he now, without recognizing the similarity, applies to himself. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="101">
						<term>excess of misery</term>
						<p>Although we are apparently returned here to Alphonse Frankenstein's worries over "immoderate grief" with which the volume
							began (II:1:3). We are reminded both that "misery" is the last noun of Volume 1 and that the Creature ended his account of
							his life with the declaration of his own misery (see II:8:36 and note). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="102">
						<term>the exhortations of her father</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's insistence on the deference of daughters to fathers might be logically connected with her dedication of this
							novel to her own father; at the same time, it is rather at odds with her mother's views, and particularly with her running
							argument against Rousseau's views on female education in Book 5 of her Vindication of the Rights of Woman. What is odd in
							the present case is the fact that Felix does not mirror Agatha's reaction. His stance suggests something of the distance
							between son and father already accentuated in the case of Victor and Alphonse Frankenstein. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="103">
						<term>a perpetual exile</term>
						<p>The status of persona non grata, if somewhat unusual, was certainly not unheard of in France either before, or after, the
							Revolution. Napoleon, in fact, became famous for sending those who displeased him into exile. With one of these, Germaine
							de Staël, he got more than he bargained for: resentful of her criticism of his authoritarian rule, he banished her forever
							from French dominions, whereupon she set out on a long tour of Europe, speaking out against the Emperor of France and
							attracting legions of admirers wherever she went. One reason that she established herself at Coppet and gathered around
							her a set of pan-European intellectuals was that she could not return to Paris. Mary Shelley, in the ambience of Geneva in
							the summer of 1816, would have well aware of this record. Madame de Staël's last book, published posthumously in 1820, was
							called Ten Years of Exile. Whether Napoleon was afforded a copy on St. Helena, his island of exile in the middle of the
							Atlantic Ocean, is unlikely. Nonetheless, Germaine de Staël decidedly had the last laugh. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="104">
						<term>fall of snow had taken place</term>
						<p>It would appear that a month or more has passed since the Creature's birth, and with autumn's end he is experiencing the

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="105">
						<term>feelings which . . . have made me what I am</term>
						<p>Up to now the Creature has been remarking seasonal changes and their reflection in the landscape. Here, suddenly, the sense
							of internal divorce and self-alienation already present in the previous chapter (II:4:4, II:4:13) opens out into a split
							between past and present selves equivalent, as the emphatic language might suggest, to Adam's fall from paradise. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="106">
						<term>I felt cold also</term>
						<p>Victor Frankenstein has already supplied additional details to elucidate the weather being experienced here. The Creature,
							he recounts, was born "on a dreary night of November," and the next morning dawned "dismal and wet," with rain pouring
							"from a black and comfortless sky" (I:4:6). Although, if we then follow the Creature's account, it subsequently cleared
							sufficiently for the light to seem oppressive to him, later that night, the time to which he is referring in his
							narrative, it reverted to a seasonably cold temperature. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="107">
						<term>the fiend that lurked in my heart</term>
						<p>As with the double resonance of "wretch" at the end of the previous paragraph, here Victor applies to himself the term he
							had used to refer to the Creature three paragraphs earlier. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="108">
						<term>the fiend with an air of exultation</term>
						<p>Nothing in the Creature's statements in the previous paragraph—particularly given the stark alternatives he lays before
							Victor at its end—suggests that he is exulting at this point. Rather, the remark along with the epithet convey Victor's
							intrinsic sense of superiority and of his right to wield a power capable of affording satisfaction to an underling.
							Whatever Victor may regard as "the duties of a creator," they do not yet forestall him from calling his creature a "fiend"
							and regarding him as "odious." </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="109">
						<term>fiend</term>
						<p>At the beginning of the chapter he bore the neutral term "being"; but, as Victor indulges his rage, so the Creature's

					</item>
					<item n="111">
						<term>I was a fool</term>
						<p>This calm reconsideration of his actions attests to the analytical capacities of the Creature and pictures him once again
							as superior to those who spurn him. On a darker side, it also exhibits him in the process of internalizing himself as
							Other and of reifying a concept of normative reality in which he lacks any secure place. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="112">
						<term>forced solitude</term>
						<p>Where Victor hedges, the Creature counters: as "evil passions" the phrase Victor employed four paragraphs before, will
							disappear within an ambience of sympathy, so (as "vices") they are the product of solitude. Again, we hear the resonance
							of the title of Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Alastor; or, the Spirit of Solitude," published a few months before Frankenstein
							was begun (see II:8:21 and note). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="113">
						<term>are you French</term>
						<p>In ordinary circumstances this would not seem so absurd a question. The fact that the Creature lacks a national identity,
							however, throws into relief how deeply embedded are national prejudices even among the enlightened. We have already
							witnessed in the French reaction to Safie's father (II:6:3) and in his abuse of Felix's kindness (II:6:12) how
							mean-spiritedness is served by national identity. Part of Volney's aim in Les Ruines is to eradicate such defining
							ideological concepts. That the Creature is thus born without them indicates his superiority and, ironically, is a further
							example of how he does not fit into normative human society. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="114">
						<term>a feeling and kind friend</term>
						<p>Up to this point all the expression of sympathy has come as a surmise of the Creature's about the cottagers. This assertion
							reminds us that for something like a year the Creature has intervened actively to assist the cottagers in their daily
							existence. His fellow-feeling has, indeed, extended into kind actions on their behalf. The heavy irony behind this scene
							is that all the Enlightenment virtues the Creature has presumed to be attributes of the cottagers have been employed by

						<p>In his pain and anger the Creature imitates the actions of Victor Frankenstein twice noted in the first volume (I:L4:10 and

						<p>Although on the face of it this appears like stealing, the Creature makes no distinction between this human fare and the

						<p>Unknowingly yet shrewdly, throughout this speech the Creature touches Victor Frankenstein on his most sensitive moral
							points. Watching Justine condemned for a crime for which he held himself responsible, Victor was (and continues to be)
							racked by a sense of injustice. Yet, in condemning the Creature, he is just as guilty of fundamental injustice as had been

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="129">
						<term>hellish triumph</term>
						<p>The Creature has internalized the dynamics of Paradise Lost, setting himself as a reactionary force to undo the world of

							well understood by Mary Shelley, yet to be learned by the Creature. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="130">
						<term>I, like the arch fiend, bore a hell within me</term>
						<p>His limited reading immediately calls to his mind the mythic model for his profound alienation, Milton's Satan,

							identical expression at the end of Volume I (Chapter 8 in the 1831 edition): see I:7:30 and note. Victor also makes

					<item n="131">
						<term>He thus began his tale</term>
						<p>We enter here into a third level of narrative, one that is embedded within Victor Frankenstein's autobiography, which is
							itself being transcribed by Walton each night of its recounting for his sister's future perusal. Issues of the authority
							and even the reliability of any particular level of the narrative thus abound and have raised serious debate in the
							critical literature on the novel. As the Creature twice in these two paragraphs speaks of his "tale," so Victor refers to
							his narrative as a "tale" as well (see I:L4:30 and I:3:13). The underlying question is how true is any tale. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="132">
						<term>Hideous monster!</term>
						<p>The combination of terms here may be accidental, but is wonderfully encapsulating of the dynamics of the novel thus far.
							The Creature is denominated an Other even as the fixed point for comparison is lodged in the established, public figure of
							Alphonse Frankenstein, who, from the point of view of his sons (and of himself) is never capable of being viewed in the
							light of alterity. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="133">
						<term>he placed his hands before his eyes</term>

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="134">
						<term>His son was bred in the service of his country</term>
						<p>This could mean, narrowly, that Felix had been educated for the French diplomatic corps or, more broadly, to function in
							the upper levels of the government bureaucracy. Whatever the case, there is a clear link between his family and
							expectations and those of Victor Frankenstein, whose father and forefathers, from a strong sense of civic duty, have held
							positions of public trust in Geneva. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="135">
						<term>How can I move thee</term>
						<p>As Victor is self-conscious about the shape and impact of his narrative (see I:7:13 and note), so is his Creature. His
							question also curiously echoes Justine Moritz's recognition that facts alone are not sufficient to exonerate her (I:7:5
							and note); if she is to establish her claim to innocence she must move her auditors. Aside from such thematic continuities
							within the novel, this issue is likewise very much alive in the poetry that Percy Shelley was writing contemporaneously,
							particularly in The Revolt of Islam, where Cythna's eloquence is an important element in spreading political and cultural
							enlightenment: see particularly Canto 8. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="136">
						<term>the hut upon the mountain</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley knows from experience of what she writes. There were actually two such huts on Montanvert above the Sea of

							Desportes, in the year 1795 (Charles Edward Mathews, The Annals of Mont Blanc [Boston: L.C. Page, 1900]).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="137">
						<term>am I not alone, miserably alone?</term>
						<p>Not only does the Creature's terrible solitude remind us of the mental isolation into which Victor Frankenstein finds
							himself plunged, but it also takes us back to the original scene in which this narrative is being recited, upon a ship in
							the midst of the Arctic Ocean, remote from either land or other human beings. As in Walton's letters (Letter I and Letter
							II), so here one cannot fail to hear the echo of Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner": "Alone, alone, all, all
							alone,/ Alone on a wide wide sea!" (line 232-3). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="138">
						<term>I ardently desired to understand them</term>
						<p>As earlier in his ruminations about language acquisition (II:4:9), the Creature unconsciously adopts the exact phrasing of

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="139">
						<term>I ardently wished to extinguish that life</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>Heavy irony attends this choice of diction. Not only are we reminded of the "ardent" desire with which, when young, Victor
							(I:2:7) (and Walton—I:L1:2) eagerly pursued scientific knowledge, but we can associate with that innocent desire the more
							complicated ardency driving Victor obsessively toward the scientific breakthrough that was the birth of this Creature: see
							I:3:1 and note. This is the point in the novel when the language of intense love first is used to embody the designs of a
							passionate hatred. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="140">
						<term>I exclaimed</term>
						<p>It is a curious coincidence that the last time Victor called upon the heavens (I:6:22) he instantly beheld his Creature. If
							Mary Shelley intended to signify something through this coincidence, she certainly left no hint, and it has not been
							explained by commentators. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="141">
						<term>I gnashed my teeth</term>
						<p>The same characteristic has been the subject of our recent focus, as Victor's anguished frustration in Justine's prison
							cell issues in this extraordinary physical reaction (I:7:27). Earlier we witnessed the same phenomenon when Victor was
							brought aboard Walton's ship (I:L4:10 and note), which, since it is an event almost contemporary with his present
							narrative account must give us a sense of how habitual this reaction has become; also how revelatory of psychological (and
							moral) disturbance it is. Two other characters engage in the same passionate behavior: the Creature (III:3:13) and
							Milton's Satan. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="142">
						<term>the imagination</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>As has already been evident in earlier chapters, in Mary Shelley's perspective the imagination is a power at once of great
							dynamic force and ethically neutral in its operations, leading to good or evil ends depending on the psychological
							framework in which it exists. The darker side of this mental attribute has been especially invoked as events in the novel
							have taken a tragic turn: see, for instance, I:3:7 and note, I:4:18 and note, I:6:27 and note. </p>

						<term>immense mountains and precipices</term>
						<p>The reader observes a carefully registered journey from the beautiful into the sublime, from what Elizabeth has proposed as
							a domestic enclosure, warding off the unimaginable and protecting the family unit from threat, into another confrontation,
							at least for Victor, with elemental nature, with destruction and with fresh creation. The transitional point of this rite

						<p>This is a nice detail in itself but not wholly devoid of further import. However boastful the Creature may be about his

							Like his "father," he is superior to his fellow-students (I:3:2). With his great stature, his exquisitely fine feelings,
							and his mental quickness, he should have been equipped, in Victor's early aspiration, to be a "new species" (I:3:8) of

						<p>The Creature, who appears to educate himself by a process of progressive binary distinctions, here broaches his master

					<item n="149">
						<term>the hapless fate of its original inhabitants</term>
						<p>The Creature and Safie alike bemoan the conquering of native Americans of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres by the
							various European imperial powers, who in many cases reduced the natives to a condition of slavery. The Creature's
							emotional identification with their fate is unself-conscious at this point, but the progress of his education is leading
							him to understand an fundamental similarity with their abjectness (see, for instance, II:9:5 and note). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="150">
						<term>injustice</term>
						<p>There is a qualitative difference between this sense of injustice and what the Creature has felt earlier. Here, after doing
							a good deed, he has been been judged undesirable in a preemptive manner and physically punished. Thus, what festers
							mentally as well as physically is that a simple action to save a life has been met with a violent, life-threatening
							reaction from the larger society of human beings. He feels no longer merely rejected by this world but actively menaced. </p>

					<item n="151">
						<term>a kind of insanity</term>
						<p>Victor will exactly echo this language at the very end of Volume 2 (Chapter 17 in the 1831 edition), in II:9:23. </p>
						<p> As he is superior to other human beings in stature and endurance, and finely tuned both emotionally and intellectually,
							perhaps we should not be surprised at the sublimity of the Creature's emotional outburst. Or, at least we should be no
							more surprised than we are at the inarticulate ranting of Victor Frankenstein when they meet on the Mer de Glace (II:2:6)
							or at the fury of Felix De Lacey (II:7:38), both of whom are the products of cultivated families and refined educations. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="152">
						<term>instinctively, finding myself so desolate</term>
						<p>In contrast to Victor, who through his intellectual obsession at Ingolstadt virtually sequestered himself from both family

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="153">
						<term>She instructed her daughter . . . religion</term>
						<p>As with the condescension to Justine's Catholicism (I:5:6, I:7:21), this ostensible religious bias needs to be placed
							within the conventions of English publishing and religious attitudes. It is unlikely that Mary Shelley herself subscribes
							to them. Indeed, if in this chapter one reads in the attitudes of Turks to women some sense of reflection on contemporary
							English attitudes, then, Mary Shelley would appear to be playing something of her mother's game. And the mother-daughter
							relationship here certainly testifies to that which Mary Shelley derived from the frequent perusal of her mother's
							writings, an inculcation of ideals of independence on which, like, Safie she was not afraid to act. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="155">
						<term>interchange of kindness</term>
						<p>That the Creature's argument is wholly based on Englightenment premises about the function of virtue makes them practically

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="156">
						<term>I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed</term>
						<p>The Creature delivers a sudden telescoping and radical interpretation of the mythic text that stands behind this entire
							narrative, Milton's Paradise Lost. The point behind the Creature's distinction is that Adam fell by knowingly commiting a
							sinful deed, whereas Satan, in contrast, in this reading was intended to fall from heaven as an intrinsic part of the
							conception of God's new creation. Most readers of Milton's epic would not countenance a reading of Satan as more sinned
							against than sinning, but it is the general interpretation that Percy Bysshe Shelley offers in the famous passage of his
							"Defence of Poetry" devoted to the poem. Since that document dates from 1821, five years after the beginning of
							Frankenstein, however well it glosses the antagonism of Victor and his Creature, it ought not to be read in retrospect as
							explaining this usage. One might, however, wish to argue that the representation in Mary Shelley's novel either influenced
							her husband's interpretation or was worked out as a reading in tandem with him. Whatever the case, the emphasis is
							unmistakeable here, that the Creature sees himself as like Satan, "irrevocably excluded" from bliss, which—although Milton
							(in Satan's soliloquy on Mount Niphates, IV.32ff.) tries to finesse the issue—is how received theology forced him to
							represent the fallen archangel in his epic. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="157">
						<term>I persuaded myself</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p> Whatever self-examination Victor undertakes, he cannot appear to see what the reader does, that the same habitual
							obsessiveness regulates his thoughts, turned now, not on a scientific experiment, but on the inner landscape of the mind
							over which he pores with a customarily intense scrutiny. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="158">
						<term>Thus I relieve thee</term>
						<p>Although the Creature here gains the bitter satisfaction of forcing Victor to confront his own responsibility for having
							created a being of such surpassing ugliness that he himself cannot bear his sight, at the same time this aggressive
							gesture imposes the threat of his great physical power upon his weaker creator. It sharply emphasizes the aesthetic
							problem he poses for human beings; but this gesture does not by any means seem limited solely to that end. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="159">
						<term>I sat down and wept</term>
						<p>As in the infant grin with which the Creature greeted Victor after his birth (I:4:3) here again we are suddenly reminded
							that he is a newborn, signalling his wants by crying. But, cast off by his creator and forced to make his way into the
							world in utter solitude, his wants are so enormous that here we are perhaps intended by the similarity of diction to
							recall the timbres of one of the most famous songs of exile (Psalm 137) in the Western tradition. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="160">
						<term>I so ardently desire</term>
						<p>The same phrasing was used by the Creature to describe his obsession with learning to speak (see II:4:9). After all the
							variants on the term, applied to and linking the intellectual passions of Walton, Victor, and the Creature, the reader is
							hardly prepared to encounter it here in its primary sense, as an expression of uninhibited and undeflected sexual
							instinct. </p>

					<item n="161">
						<term>the Italian state which they inhabited</term>
						<p>From 1796, when Napoleon invaded Italy until 1814 when he was exiled to Elba, in fact, most of Italy was either under the
							rule or the strong influence of France, and with the restoration of the old monarchies in 1815, although the politics
							decidedly changed, the French influence on Italy remained strong. Whether it would in either case have involved
							extradition from Livorno of a non-French national might be questionable, but the Turk's fears are not entirely groundless. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="162">
						<term>I vowed eternal hatred . . . mankind</term>
						<p>This is actually the second such vow. The first, uttered after being driven from the De Lacey's cottage (paragraph 3 above

							threat. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="163">
						<term>I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch</term>
						<p>With telling artistic assurance Mary Shelley has the Creature, who up to this point has referred to himself only by
							personal pronouns, name himself with the same word originally used by Victor, "wretch" (I:4:3). Here, however, he defines
							himself as what King Lear calls "the thing itself . . . unaccommodated man" (III.iv.100). Perhaps, indeed, Mary Shelley
							means us to hear in the insistent repetition of the word "wretch" the memorable accents of that unsceptered, sorrowing
							monarch: </p> Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,<lb/> That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,<lb/> How shall

						<p>Here, as elsewhere in the novel, we sense some strain in Victor's relationship with his strict father. Usually it is marked

						<p>Evidently the journal is written in French, and it suggests that Victor's claim to Walton that he had thought his creation

						<p>Behind this utterance, one can hear what is truly the locus classicus, the classic statement, of how one is impelled by
							exile to provide sympathetic assistance to other exiles, that of Dido before the shipwrecked Aeneas: "Non ignari mali,
							miseris succerere disco—Not ignorant of evils myself, I learn to succor the miserable" (Aeneid, I.630). Without question

					</item>
					<item n="170">
						<term>justice</term>
						<p>By this point in the novel, after two trials and an education in ancient and modern political science, this word may be
							thought to carry large public as well as private associations. But in this context they are theological as well, invoking
							the notion of a theodicy (from Greek theou dike), a justification of God, which is Milton's announced purpose for Paradise
							Lost: that is, to "justify the ways of God to men" (I.26). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="171">
						<term>justice</term>
						<p>Perhaps the Creature comprehends that is he talking to a person from a long line of civic magistrates, or perhaps his plea
							has simply been predicated on their shared Enlightenment discourse. Whatever the case, in his long narration he has
							consistently been touching on the nerve from which he at last gets a response. For the first time in his dealings with the
							Creature, from the original thought of his creation down to this moment of moral decision, Victor acknowledges an abstract
							concept of the justice owed him. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="172">
						<term>justice</term>
						<p>This phrase is ambiguous: "fellow-creatures" in this contexts appears to be limited to his family and friends. Later,

							quite differently. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="173">
						<term>a kind of insanity</term>
						<p>These exact words were uttered in the previous chapter when the Creature described burning down the De Lacey's cottage

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="174">
						<term>This trait of kindness</term>
						<p>In the ongoing education of the Creature this is the point at which he is first able to conceptualize that refinement of
							affection that constitutes kindness. As with much of the ongoing development of his awareness, there is an ironic
							undertone here, however, since he will never experience the sort of solicitude that, despite his poverty and blindness, is
							the elder De Lacey's daily expectation and comfort. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="175">
						<term>I required kindness and sympathy</term>
						<p>As was the case three paragraphs earlier, here the Creature evokes essential Enlightenment values, twice privileging the

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="176">
						<term>I know, I feel</term>
						<p>A highly resonant shift of language. Elizabeth is forced back on intuition in the same manner as Victor had been on his
							return to Geneva (I:6:25). Given the miscarriage of justice perpetrated by those who convicted Justine on the basis of
							circumstantial logic, Elizabeth's intuitive knowledge of the heart seems a preferable means by which to organize—or to
							transcend—social institutions. And yet, the contrasting case of Victor's passion for revenge would suggest how
							unpredictable, and even dangerous, such a course might be. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="177">
						<term>Of what a strange nature is knowledge!</term>
						<p>Again, the Creature uncannily picks up on the timbres of Victor's meditations. Compare, for instance, the first paragraph
							of this second volume (II:1:1), where Victor reviews what he considers is a "blasted" existence. There his remorse (note)
							has much the same deleterious and lasting effect that the Creature here attributes to knowledge. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="178">
						<term>the language of the country</term>
						<p>That is, the language spoken is German, not the French used by the De Laceys and the Creature. This relapse appears to bear
							a symbolic connotation, as the Creature, who had seen his efforts to acquire language as the key to his being accepted
							within human society, is suddenly plunged once again into linguistic incomprehension. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="179">
						<term>She and I rapidly improved in the knowledge of language</term>
						<p>Although the tonality is subtle, the Creature's education along with Safie seems to have a bonding effect, increasing his
							original attachment to her. In two months' time the linguistic disadvantage that is a shared mark of their alienation is
							assuaged, preparing them simultaneously for what should be a full social integration. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="180">
						<term>written in the language</term>
						<p>These works are written, respectively, in Renaissance English, classical Latin, and modern German. Fortunately for the

					</item>
					<item n="181">
						<term>I suddenly left my home</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>This is the major departure from the 1818 text, indicative of Mary Shelley's wish to keep her novel concentrated not on
							Victor's family relations, but, instead, on the sense of abject isolation he bears in his psyche. Most critics who have
							compared the texts prefer the appropriateness of this extensive shift of focus. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="182">
						<term>Leghorn</term>
						<p>Livorno, in Italian. Leghorn was the major port of Tuscany, with a large and thriving English community of traders; hence

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="183">
						<term>the lessons . . . sanguinary laws of man</term>
						<p>The Creature means that the story of Felix's efforts on behalf of Safie's father and the ruination suffered by the De
							Laceys as a result have taught him how to manipulate the judicial system. Thus, his framing of Justine Moritz is
							deliberate. There is a further sense in which he has also framed the magistrate Alphonse Frankenstein to become
							complicitous in a grave injustice, but that solid upright citizen is never aware of it.</p>
						<p> A particularly brutal aspect of the "sanguinary laws of man" that the Creature did not learn from Felix but has discovered
							on his own is how to victimize women. In the 1831 text (II:16:35) Mary Shelley stresses that Justine is framed because she
							represents the type of Safie who fled in fear from his presence. In the revised text, then, the planting of the picture is
							a symbolic form of rape. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="184">
						<term>let us try our strength in a fight</term>
						<p>If the scene were less highly charged emotionally, this repeated challenge would bear comic undertones. That Mary Shelley

							exhibit Victor falling back upon a conventional posture of masculinist belligerence. </p>

					<item n="187">
						<term>love and respect</term>
						<p>Although it may be a relatively small point, nonetheless it is worth observing how differently the underlying patriarchal
							structure operates in the De Lacey household from that to be discerned among the Frankensteins. At the same time, the
							mutual love of the De Lacey family, with its emphasis on the sufficiency of the domestic affections, repeats motifs from
							the early chapters of Victor's narration (see, for instance, I:3:12 and note). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="188">
						<term>You have made me wretched beyond expression</term>
						<p>Fittingly, as the curse Victor visits upon himself acknowledges his doubling in his Creature, so here he essentially

							colloquy (II:2:7). </p>
						<p/>

					<item n="189">

						<p>Justine's last injunction to Elizabeth—"Live, and be happy, and make others so" (I:7:31) resonates as well for Victor,

							return to Geneva, has been the very act that has forestalled a true utility to his fellow beings. </p>
						<p/>

					<item n="191">
						<term>so vicious and base</term>
						<p>The Creature's education in and through the simultaneity of contraries (see II:3:6 and note) leads him to a large political

							resonates with the same sense of frustration with the contradictions of the human condition expressed by Byron's Manfred
							(Manfred was begun in the summer of 1816) in a similar Alpine setting to that in which the Creature speaks. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="192">
						<term>why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute</term>
						<p>Readers might think of this sentence as heavily ironic, given the encounter that is immediately to ensue. Yet, it may be
							intended to operate on a subtler level than just that of forcing us and Victor to contemplate the truth of his relations
							with his Creature. It is almost as if Victor's mental state, once he has been transposed into the sublime, has transformed
							him, preparing him, unlike other members of his family, to look full into the face of brute nature and experience at once
							its otherness and its symbiosis with humanity. </p>

						<p>Percy Bysshe Shelley was passionately fond of boats. During the previous summer, which he and Mary spent at Marlow near
							Windsor, he would drift in a small boat on the Thames while he wrote. Mary, Claire, and he had a boat on Lake Geneva
							during the 1816 summer, in which they sailed out most evenings. Later in the summer Byron and Shelley undertook a two-week

					<item n="194">

					</item>
					<item n="195">
						<term>meet with sympathy</term>
						<p>The Creature is an adept rhetorician, countering Victor's supposition about his original sin with a strict causality: evil

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="196">
						<term>miserable beyond all living things</term>
						<p>Following his reappropriation of "wretch," the Creature picks up on this derogatory term just employed by Victor and

							or the reader. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="197">
						<term>miserable, unhappy wretch</term>
						<p>The Creature echoes his memories of his first day of existence (II:3:1), which may suggest that, however much he has

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="198">
						<term>miserable head</term>
						<p>In her customary way Mary Shelley plays on two meanings of the word. Victor uses it in a derogatory manner, denoting the

							misery. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="199">
						<term>misery made me a fiend</term>
						<p>The Creature picks up the name Victor has just hurled at him and subtly recasts its point. From the first Victor has looked
							upon his Creature as essentially depraved, that is to say, evil in his very nature. The same issue hovers over the
							treatment of Justine Moritz, particularly by members of the Frankenstein household, in Chapters 6 and 7 of Volume 1. The
							Creature's rejoinder is constructivist: which is to say, that a sentient being is molded by material conditions. It is a
							position stoutly argued by William Godwin throughout Political Justice (1793). In terms of contemporary criticism of
							Frankenstein, this issue has a high visibility in all gender criticism. Beyond literary criticism per se, the terms in
							which the novel casts this debate are highly resonant for modern social and critical theory. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="200">
						<term>a mixture of pain and pleasure</term>
						<p>This is a step in the Creature's education, related to his encountering pain and pleasure from a single source in fire

							safe to say, were unknown in prelapsarian Eden. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="202">
						<term>monsters thirsting for each other's blood</term>
						<p>The echo here is pronounced. Only two paragraphs earlier Victor had recounted his fear "lest the monster whom I had created
							should perpetrate some new wickedness." In Elizabeth's perspective, on the other hand, there is no alien being to consider
							as a scapegoat and in whom to localize and therefore objectify evil. Instead, the potentiality for monstrousness exists in
							all human hearts, and in their collective aggregate that is human society, as Justine's fate demonstrates, this
							monstrousness can be institutionalized as an underlying, unrecognized and therefore dangerous formation. In other words,
							the monstrous is not external but within. </p>

						<p>Like his Creator, the Creature is highly conscious of rhetorical effect. By this locution he may mean that he will now

							our own engagement as readers with his text, as Victor has done before him (I:3:13) and will again attempt to do after

						<p>Mary Shelley posits the Lockean notion that at first one's natural condition is that of synaesthesia, an indiscriminate

							according to the five diverse senses. The physiological basis for this development had been posited in the mid-eighteenth
							century by the French materialist philosopher Condillac, in his Traité des sensations. </p>
						<p>Deliberate synaesthesia is an artistic ploy often to be found among the English Romantic poets, in none more than Percy
							Bysshe Shelley: see, for instance, his poem of 1818, "Lines Written among the Euganean Hills," esp. line 285 ff. </p>

						<p>Thus, the Creature explicitly remarks what the experience of Justine's trial and execution had conveyed to Elizabeth, that
							men are universally "monsters thirsting for . . . blood" (II:1:8). This is exactly antipathetic to the tenets of
							disinterested benevolence Godwin had championed in his public writings (see Political Justice Book IV, Chapter 8 and

						<term>mutability</term>
						<p>The third and fourth stanzas of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem, "Mutability," published in the Alastor volume in March 1816.</p>
						<p> The fairly conventional notions of her husband's poem seem at first to have little direct linkage with the circumstances
							into which Mary Shelley has thrust Victor at this juncture. But if one looks back over the landscape of the first volume,
							the operations of mutability as a force of destruction are everywhere evident—from the fearsome movements of sea and ice
							in Walton's letters, to the sudden deaths in the Frankenstein and Moritz households, to the unmerited reversal of
							Justine's fortunes. But mutability is also the very stuff of life. Perhaps then, most of all, the subject of the poem
							applies to the scientific paradigms that govern the development of the volume—in ancient alchemy (from the various
							transmutations it would apply to base metals to its search for a means of suspending mutability itself in the elixir of
							life); or in modern chemistry, which increasingly saw organic changes in terms of chemical transformations; or in
							contemporary electrical theory, where dialectical tensions between opposing poles were held responsible for the essential
							energy of life. A later poem of Percy Bysshe Shelley confronts these ambivalences more subtly and more directly, embedding
							them in a single symbolic force that is at one and same time both "Creator and Destroyer," the "Ode to the West Wind,"
							written in 1819. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="209">
						<term>mutual bonds</term>
						<p>Here one begins to get a glimmer of the impact of Safie's arrival on the Creature's thoughts, as he ponders his own need
							for a mutuality of feeling. The novel powerfully demonstrates that where there are not such mutual bonds, a form of
							bondage is substituted instead. Neither Victor nor his Creature is able to break away from the other, even if all that
							holds them together is their antagonism. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="210">
						<term>my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature</term>
						<p>The Creature's logic is direct and unambiguous, starting from a premise of obligation that Victor had totally expunged from
							his mind. Continuing the process by which he picks up on Victor's language and wholly recontextualizes it, now he asserts
							his right to be considered in the place of Adam, not, as Victor had tried to cast him in the previous paragraph, as Satan. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="211">
						<term>which would decide my fate</term>
						<p>The Creature's growing obsession with revealing himself to the cottagers may lack an external instrumentation, but
							otherwise is of a piece with other obsessions in the novel, both those of Walton and of Victor Frankenstein. His casting
							his future in terms of destiny likewise echoes the discourse of the novel's other protagonists. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="212">
						<term>my father</term>
						<p>The Creature at last names Victor as father, forcing upon his unwilling head the entire range of cultural and literary

					</item>
					<item n="213">
						<term>my form is a filthy type of your's</term>
						<p>There are occasions in this novel where the subtlety of the verbal patterning may leave readers shaking their heads. The
							Creature, alluding to the journal in which Victor describes the process of his creation, appears deliberately to echo the
							ugly language with which Victor had earlier, in marked aversion, recounted that experience to Walton. We are thus to
							suppose that Victor has been reusing phrases from that journal in his narrative. For his "workshop of filthy creation,"
							see I:3:9 and note. For his further reference to the Creature as "the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life,"
							see I:6:22. At the end of this interview Victor will revert to the adjective to characterize him once again (II:9:12), and
							the word then appears in the penultimate sentence of the 1818 volume translated into nightmarish proportions (II:9:23). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="214">
						<term>my imagination</term>
						<p>At first sight this appears to be an evocation of the imagination more in line with the normative practices of British
							Romanticism than earlier ones have been: the Creature in his isolation takes refuge in an innocent, even utopian world of
							his own making, one provided by the creative power of his imagination. This characteristic, almost more than any other so
							far encountered in his educational process, testifies to his fully human sensibility. From a more analytical perspective,
							however, such a refuge of the creative imagination shares the main attributes of Victor's introverted retreat at
							Ingolstadt, even to the point of opening the way to a sudden, disastrous reversal. </p>

					<item n="215">
						<term>My wife</term>

					</item>
					<item n="216">
						<term>I discovered the names</term>
						<p>The first definitions are of discrete things, which happen also to be the necessities of life. The Creature's education
							places him in the condition of Adam, who named the animals of Eden. See Genesis 2:18-20: </p>
						<p>Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him."</p>
						<p>So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to
							see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.</p>
						<p>The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for the man there was
							not found a helper fit for him.</p>
						<p>The last phrase of the Genesis text we will soon see applies to the Creature as much as it does to all of God's creation. </p>
						<p>Milton's litany of the creatures whom Adam named comes in his account of the Creation in Paradise Lost, Book VII, 493ff. </p>

					<item n="218">
						<term>There can be no community between you and me</term>
						<p>Although Victor is thinking solely in personal terms, Johnson's 1755 Dictionary emphasizes in a valuable way the social,
							and particularly the political, dimensions of this noun. Given the fact that the novel will soon move directly to include
							such a framework of human institutions, it is important to recognize that the Creature's perspective on such diction might
							be quite different from, perhaps even more knowing than, Victor's. </p>

					<item n="220">
						<term>no longer that happy creature</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>Elizabeth's sudden plunge into a maturity born of despondency was indicated in the last chapter of Volume 1 (I:7:25). Not
							events per se, but their impact on characters' perceptions give Mary Shelley's novel its dynamic momentum. In this focus
							on the integrity of mental phenomena for good or ill—concerns likewise at this time governing the productions of both Lord
							Byron (Manfred) and Percy Bysshe Shelley ("Mont Blanc" and Prometheus Unbound)—one senses Mary Shelley's equal
							participation in the intellectual vibrancy of that 1816 summer. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="221">
						<term>No one could love a child more than I loved your brother</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>For all Alphonse's attempt to console Victor, his being exactly wrong about the source of Victor's grief must be indicative
							of some narrowness or shortsightedness of his own. His son William is his only concern, and he assumes the same family
							priorities for Victor; but Victor knows that Justine has been murdered, too, and that more than tribal loyalty is at
							stake. That the father's commitment to the "public situations" (I:1:1) in which he has passed his mature years extends so
							little into actual social benevolence must in some sense affect how we take his counsel and assess his notion of virtue. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="222">
						<term>no power</term>
						<p>Victor's habitual passivity reasserts itself with a sharp irony that reminds one of the physical deterioration he suffered
							in giving life to his creation (I:3:9). His argument is that the Creature, empowered by Victor with life, has so used that
							power that it has robbed Victor of his own ability to act independently. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="223">
						<term>I had no right to claim their sympathies</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>Given the novel's insistence on sympathy as an essential moral attribute of an individual human being and a just society,
							Victor's drawing away so wholly from normative family intercourse is an alarming event. That he is scarcely able to speak
							to his family suggests a psychological condition that in modern parlance would seem to border on psychosis. It is ironic
							that the Creature's passionate demand for an end to his solitude should result in Victor's own recoil into a solitude
							almost as utter and just as fraught with danger to himself and to others. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="224">
						<term>I could not consent to the death of any human being</term>
						<p>As this sentence might suggest, Mary Shelley was opposed to all forms of capital punishment, a sentiment she shared with
							her father and husband. Perhaps, the true significance of this statement, however, is the contrast it offers to the
							violent retribution Victor would inflict on the Creature, whom, we must remember, he has as yet no evidence whatsoever to
							connect with the murder of William or the framing of Justine. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="225">
						<term>I dared not enter it</term>
						<p>If it occurs to a reader to wonder why the De Lacey family did not hear of such a fearsome apparition in the nearby
							village, the reason is that they are, in their poverty and separation, self-sufficient. They have no money to spend in
							that German community and are likewise isolated from it by the fact that they appear to speak only French. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="226">
						<term>not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>This is an open threat of mass destruction, the second such intimation of the violence to which the Creature will resort if
							he is provoked: see II:2:7. Although its unethical dimensions cannot be ignored, one should again remark how aptly
							congruent is the amoral power Percy Bysshe Shelley saw embodied in Mont Blanc itself: see Shelley's "Mont Blanc," lines
							107-20. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="227">
						<term>I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee</term>
						<p>It is significant that the Creature is the one to try to break the impasse between himself and Victor, likewise that he
							understands the fateful ethical consequences of the antagonistic course to which Victor has set himself. The primary verb
							of this sentence ("tempt") assumes free will and moral responsibility as premises for all human action, premises that
							Victor repeatedly endeavors to deny. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="228">
						<term>I do not destroy the lamb and the kid . . . nourishment</term>

					<item n="234">
						<term>You are an ogre</term>
						<p>The seven-year old William seems to be drawing his points of reference from reading fairy tales and romances. This is of a

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="235">
						<term>Oh that I had forever remained . . . heat</term>
						<p>Here the Creature unconsciously echoes the sentiments of Victor Frankenstein ("if our impulses were confined to hunger,
							thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free") from earlier the same morning of their conversation (II:2:3). That the
							Creature speaks of heat where Victor uses "desire" reflects his very first conscious experiences (II:3:3, II:3:6), but

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="236">
						<term>Oh! stars, and clouds, and winds</term>
						<p>It is one thing for the Creature to utter a pantheistic oath (previous paragraph), but to put a second immediately into the

						<p>To a later reader accustomed to the 1818 edition or to the customary biographical terrain of Mary Shelley's family

							seem to ring true to the general distance kept thus far between the characters and conventional religious expression. The
							reader has the choice of construing this interpolation as a sign of a shift in Mary Shelley's rhetorical palette to
							accommodate an early Victorian religious sensibility (which has been asserted by some critics). On the other hand, this
							could be interpreted instead as an attempt on her part to prepare us for the deep, if primitive, religious faith that will
							eventually be invoked by Victor to sanction his single-minded pursuit of revenge against his Creature. In other words, not

						<p>The supposition is that the Creature has been able to remain within the general confines of woodlands during this three-day

					<item n="242">
						<term>the original æra of my being</term>
						<p>To compare the creature's sense of his original identity with that contained in the opening sentence (I:1:1) of Victor

						<p>Although we have no guide to Mary Shelley's thought processes as she wrote this passage, it is probable that the stanza
							from Percy Shelley's poetry she quotes at the end of the paragraph caused her to think of another from the volume in which
							it was published (or the causality might have been reversed, with that other passage first coming to mind and prompting
							the remembrance of this stanza): whatever the case, this description of mountain conifers strongly resembles the desolate
							final scene, actually drawn from Shelley's experiences in Wales before he met Mary, of his poem "Alastor" (see lines
							550-70). An early sketch of this same subject is contained in a poem in the early notebook known as the Esdaile Notebook,
							a poem Shelley wrote in 1811 and never published, called after its first line "Dark spirit of the desart rude." </p>
						<p>On the other hand, the scenery of Switzerland, far more sublime than that of Wales, afforded ample opportunity for Mary
							Shelley to observe the desolation that alpine storms and glacial movement could visit on the pine forests of the
							mountains. There is a description of such shattered trees in Letter 4 of A History of Six Weeks' Tour. Byron offers
							another such passage in the second scene of Manfred, I.ii.66-74, which, though begun later than Frankenstein, indicates at

						<p>Paradise Lost, John Milton's epic poem, was originally published in 1667 in ten books, then revised by its author into the

							Europe, its impact on Frankenstein is major and discernible from beginning to end. In the immediate context of the

						<p>In England at this time a man without property had no vote: thus the very idea of citizenship, of having a "stake" in the

							their accounts and using almost identical language to do so. One may thus compare this utterance with those of Victor to
							Walton at the beginning (I:L4:30 and note) and end (III:Walton:2) of his narrative. That the "evidence" comes from the
							centrally embedded narrative, the story of Safie, is thus taken to lend credibility to all narrative strands that subsume

						<p>Mary Shelley had herself to have been highly conscious of these attributes. Byron, even if he inherited his title almost by

						<p>These reflections are of a very different character from earlier occasions where Victor has used the term, so much so that

						<p>A remarkable difference exists, we must realize with something of a jolt, between the Creature's silent meditations in his

					<item n="269">
						<term>revenge</term>
						<p>With characteristic understatement, Mary Shelley places the two cousins in total contrast: Elizabeth through her sympathy

							Elizabeth who makes the social gesture, "taking [Victor's] hand," and Victor who retreats into self-accusation. As a

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="270">
						<term>as a right</term>
						<p>This is a distinction worth pondering. In general terms throughout the novel we have been allowed to relax in the notion of
							sympathy as a private, even domestic virtue, commensurate with compassion and affection. Questions of justice have been
							largely raised within public arenas or as involving the legal rights of individuals. Here, however, the larger issues of
							late Enlightenment democratic enfranchisement merge with private desire, as to an important degree they also do in the
							Constitution of the United States of America (1787), particularly as amended by the Bill of Rights (1789), or the
							Declaration of Rights of the French Constituent Assembly (1789) or that proposed by Maximilien Robespierre (1793) or,
							indeed, the radical Declaration of Rights written by the young agitator Percy Bysshe Shelley for distribution among the
							Irish in 1812. Sympathy thus has a political component to it. In the Creature's formulation God, or one who would assume
							the supreme powers of God, implicitly has an obligation to foster the "pursuit of happiness" of a creation or subject. </p>

						<term>Ruins of Empire</term>
						<p>Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) by Constantin François Chasseboeuf, comte de Volney
							(1757-1820) is one of the geniunely radical documents produced in the early years of the French Revolution, a work that
							severely critiques all the reigning ideologies of the world—whether political or theological—and proposes their abolition.
							That the Creature should get his principal education into the institutions of modern culture from such a profoundly
							antiestablishment work must have a significant influence on his own subsequent distaste for human culture. But there is an
							ironic side to it as well, for Volney's attempt to create the blueprint for the new revolutionary man here falls on the
							ears of a uniquely revolutionary and wholly dispossessed individual. The first English translation of Les Ruines,
							published as The Ruins, or a Survey of the Revolutions of Empires (London: Joseph Johnson, 1792) was done by Godwin's
							close friend James Marshall. Volney himself thought the translation too tame and in 1802 oversaw a new English version
							published in Paris, which was reprinted frequently and became the standard conduit for his ideas throughout the
							English-speaking world. Among those strongly effected by it was Percy Bysshe Shelley, whose Queen Mab shows considerable
							debt to its ideas. </p>

						<p>That the enterprizing Safie, who has managed to travel from Constantinople to Paris, then to central Italy, and from there
							to this rural section of south-central Germany, is so horrified attests to the intensity of fear aroused by the sight of
							the Creature. That she deserts the entire family at this moment of crisis testifies to a primal, irrational sense of
							self-preservation that is distinctly unGodwinian and stands as an ironic counterstatement to all the Enlightenment ideals
							so accentuated in the paragraphs leading up to this denouement. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="274">
						<term>Safie arrived from Constantinople</term>
						<p>Although Mary Shelley puts no extra emphasis on this point, still it is significant that Safie, a woman with ambition and a
							mind of her own, is up to this point the best-traveled figure in the novel. On some level of consciousness Mary Shelley
							must be aware of her implicit links to Cythna, the liberated feminist heroine of Percy Shelley's contemporary Revolt of
							Islam, published simultaneously with Frankenstein in 1818. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="275">
						<term>Satan</term>
						<p>The resemblance to Satan stems at first from the Creature's sense of having no place in the universe, of being designed for
							alienation in the fulfillment of the Genesis. This is, indeed, the ground upon which his colloquy with Victor Frankenstein
							began: see II:2:7 and note. The Satanic prototype will extend, however, to the point of having external not simply
							psychological ramifications: as Satan's only acts are reactions, attempts to undo the perfection of God's universe, so the
							Creature will claim Victor's attention by destroying what he most values. </p>

							dynamics of alienation just witnessed in the Creature's night-time rampage. The use of political terminology reminds us of
							the Creature's reading matter (particularly of the education furnished him by Volney's Ruines), but also suggests that he

					</item>
					<item n="281">

							language" (II:4:18) is an acquisition essential for his claim to true humanness. As Safie is enfolded by the De Lacey
							family through acquiring their language, so, the Creature hopes, he can likewise break down the barriers of Otherness in
							which he is compelled to live. If language has up to now been used as an instrument for his self-knowledge (note), with

						<p>The crucial place of language in the Creature's education and in his growing sense of identity is a significant sign of the

							the novel, as the child, wife, and associate of other major authors of the age. And yet it is always shadowed by the dark
							irony of another "monster" accorded the use of language, Shakespeare's Caliban, who tells Miranda: "You taught me

						<p>Although the rhetoric is overloaded, one should not miss the significance of the Creature's being first defined as the

						<p>The Creature's imagery tends to be poetic and generally, as is the case here or in his description of Safie's singing three

							interestingly, to be something of a cross between Elizabeth, with her love of nature, and Clerval, with his refined poetic

						<term>the strange system of human society</term>
						<p>However unthreatening such language may sound today, in 1818, with England racked by unrest and governed by reactionaries,

							readers—and reviewers. This is the point in the novel where discerning readers, not knowing who the author was, would
							comprehend the significance of the dedication to William Godwin, whose Enquiry Concerning Political Justice of 1793
							remained the most radical analysis of "the strange system of human society" for the generation of his daughter. This work,
							rather than the more tempered redaction of 1798, when the extreme antiestablishment perspective of the original might have
							been taken for treason, in many respects underlies the Creature's sense of alienation, his understanding of the structured
							injustice that allows him no place in human society, and his recognition of endemic restraints upon individual

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="304">
						<term>such lovely creatures</term>
						<p>However this veneration of an ideal to which he might aspire testifies to the underlying human sensibility of the Creature,

						<p>In accordance with Enlightenment social thought, notably the writings of the Earl of Shaftesbury and his many followers,

					</item>
					<item n="311">
						<term>I sympathized</term>
						<p>Although the later writings of Percy Bysshe Shelley cannot be cited as indicating his influence here, still his Defence of

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="312">

					<item n="313">
						<term>My papa is a Syndic</term>
						<p>The capacity to name, or abuse by naming—and to judge, or misjudge—are intimately allied throughout this novel. This is
							even truer of the stance one takes to the object of naming and judging. As William confidently assures the Creature, his
							father has been accorded the power to punish by this society: William adopts the same tone and attitude of natural
							superiority. Perhaps it was implictly present from the family expectations underscored in the first sentence of Victor's
							narrative (I:1:1) as well. Given the emotional chords that have resonated from William's death for eleven chapters and the
							epithets with which he has been honored ("little darling William" by Elizabeth [I:5:7], "that sweet child . . . who was so
							gentle, yet so gay" by Alphonse [I:6:3], "dear angel" by Victor [I:6:25]), his sheer childish nastiness surprizes us and,

					</item>
					<item n="315">
						<term>What did their tears imply?</term>
						<p>The logic of desire is played out through this paragraph to such an extent that, in the abstract at least, the answer to
							the question is already implicit in the disparity the Creature feels between himself and the De Lacey household. The
							thirst for perfection and incumbent awareness of personal inadequacy is a theme often encountered in the poetry of Lord
							Byron (e.g. Childe Harold's Pilgrimage Canto 4, 122ff.) and Percy Bysshe Shelley (e.g. "Lines Written among the Euganean

						<p>In a boating accident during the summer Percy Bysshe Shelley, who could not swim, fell overboard and sank to the bottom of

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="317">
						<term>signification of those terms</term>
						<p>Here one senses the imprint of Godwin's method of progressively discriminating the necessary components of abstract ethical
							concepts. Virtue, and to a less degree vice, are repeatedly used as markers for social justice in the Enquiry concerning
							Political Justice, whose extended title continues as "and Its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness." Particular
							attention is paid to these concepts in Book I, Chapter 3 ("The Moral Characters of Men Originate in their Perceptions"),
							Book 4, Chapter 6 ("Inferences from the Doctrine of Necessity"), Book 4, Chapter 8 ("Of the Principle of Virtue"), Book 4,
							Chapter 9 ("Of the Tendency of Virtue"), and Book 5, Chapter 2 ("Of Education"). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="318">
						<term>that could not be</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>This phrase carries a significant freight. Although it might be read as one more occasion in which Victor yields up his
							distinctive identity, substituting an obscure destiny in the process of fulfillment for his innate responsibility for
							events, in fact this necessity is driven by his own remorse, which is so acute that it can never be assuaged. Although he
							seems unaware of what he is doing, he is actually claiming responsibility for that destiny. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="319">
						<term>the awful and majestic in nature</term>
						<p>The modern descriptive term for Victor's experience would be awesome. Although he dwells on how satisfying is this kind of
							response to nature (and in the third edition it is particularly accentuated), it is probably so because of its reliable
							alterity from his own situation. In a few paragraphs, with startling irony, he will have that dependability rudely broken,
							and the sublime will come directly home to the human who, thinking to master it, had fled from its tremendous power. </p>

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="322">
						<term>the monster</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>Although Victor continually flagellates himself for the deaths of William and Justine, yet the hardening of his language as
							a means of self-exculpation and displacing his guilt continues. As he interchanges "fiend" and "monster," he combines the
							diabolic and the unnatural to objectify and distance his Creature from the norms he accords his family. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="323">
						<term>the wretch</term>
						<p>Victor reverts, as if by instinct (or psychological regression), to the nomenclature in which he first invested his

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="324">
						<term>they shall share my wretchedness</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p>Since this noun and its derivatives tolls like a bell through the novel after it is first used by Victor to name the
							Creature (I:4:3), there is a very real sense, on a linguisitic plane, in which the condition is already broadly shared. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="325">
						<term>This frequently took place</term>
						<p>It is now early spring, the first spring for the Creature, and he observes its characteristics without any previous example

						<p>As earlier, Victor's histrionic sputtering, even as it testifies at once to the explosion of long repressed emotion and to
							his incapacity to handle the situation with which he is suddenly confronted, is also revelatory on a conceptual level. His
							mind is totally bound by the binary opposition of God and Satan in which he assumes not just creative godhead but also the

						<p>Only at this point, at the end of the chapter, do we become aware that the Creature has, up to now, no ability to relate
							linguistically, that he is still operating on the non-verbal level of the sparrows and thrushes whose sounds he first
							discriminated (paragraph 4 above). Although presumably the De Lacey family speaks during the ongoing business of the day,
							except for the "few sounds" (paragraph 14 above) that were uttered by the young man outside the cottage and by the old man
							when his music elicited tears, this account is, as it were, rendered against a backdrop of total silence except for the
							interlude of music. Mary Shelley's artistic refinement in rendering this silence intensifies, in contrast, the importance

						<term>the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me</term>
						<p>The sense of the momentous responsibility he has assumed seems for the moment to have made Victor into a new being. In a

							the end of Paradise Lost, a moral being for whom, as the Creature himself has acknowledged in reference to Byron's Manfred

						<p>This is the Creature's first sense of how he appears as a figure within a natural order. It is not a pleasant discovery to

							anomalous being not to feel himself divorced from the natural order. On the contrary, he seems instinctively able to

						<p>As with her earlier treatment of Justine Moritz, Mary Shelley seems unable to keep a certain class bias from entering her
							discourse. In the case of Alphonse Frankenstein (I:6:36 and note) this may be something of a key to his character; but the
							Creature's emphasis on gentility after six weeks of existence might seem ill-conceived to some readers. It would appear,

						<p>The last word of Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Mont Blanc" is vacancy. In that poem the mountain is a "blank" slate upon which

							Lacey cottage, but rather in a hut above the Sea of Ice on Mont Blanc. It is here, fittingly, that the Creature, another

						<term>when I viewed myself in a transparent pool</term>
						<p>With pointed economy Mary Shelley returns to the context of Paradise Lost, once again to emphasize the disparity between
							God's accomplishment and that of Victor Frankenstein. This time it is centered in the figure of Eve, who is transfixed by
							her beauty when, newly born, she happens to catch sight of her perfect form mirrored in a pool (IV.449-88). In both the

					<item n="350">
						<term>violently</term>
						<p>A few paragraphs before, the Creature was reintroduced to human society through observing "violent gesticulations." Now

					</item>
					<item n="352">
						<term>the virtues that I once possessed</term>
						<p>The Creature acknowledges his fall from an original state of grace: "virtues" seems to be deliberately Miltonic diction,
							invoking Satan and Adam (and Eve). The Biblical context aside, this claim to a prelapsarian perfection is intended to
							remind Victor of his own high ambition (see I:3:8) and to affirm how well, on an internal if not external plane, it was
							realized. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="353">
						<term>wandering beggars</term>
						<p>This is the Creature's first observation of human society rather than the life of nature, and it does not exactly accord
							with our normative sense of the civilized. Yet, a wandering beggar himself, he accepts this without wondering why it
							should be, leaving that question to the logical instincts of a reader with greater command over social institutions. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="354">
						<term>wantonness of power</term>
						<p>The Creature knows about the effects of unchecked power through the account of Safie's father's persecution (II:6:3) and
							the De Laceys' ruination (II:6:14), and he may have gleaned something of its underlying assumptions from William
							Frankenstein's instinctive reliance on his father's ability to punish arbitrarily (see II:8:27 and note). Yet, it is to
							Victor that the Creature speaks, and, since he has used a derivative of "wantonness" in his earlier condemnation (II:8:1
							and note), it is perhaps to that particularized sense of irresponsibility that he reverts here. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="355">
						<term>I was benevolent</term>
						<p>This appears a deliberate echo of Victor's self-exculpating claim, "I had begun life with benevolent intentions," in the

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="356">
						<term>Was I then a monster</term>
						<p>Even to be able to ask the question suggests the extremity of alienation in which the Creature exists and the extent to

							force of logic that excludes the Creature from a recognizable place in the world. </p>
						<p/>

					<item n="358">
						<term>Sorrows of Werter</term>
						<p>Die Leiden des Jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of the Young Werter) by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) was originally
							published anonymously in Leipzig in 1774. Almost instantly it became a best seller, catapulting its young and unknown
							author into fame and a major literary career that would span more than half a century. By the end of the decade the novel
							had been translated into the other European languages, attaining a pan-European success that continued well into the
							nineteenth century: as late as 1892 it afforded Jules Massenet one of his greatest musical triumphs at the Paris Opera.</p>
						<p>The first French translation was published in 1777 as the work of C. Aubry, a pseudonym for Friedrich Wilhelm Karl, Graf
							von Schmettau (1742-1806), and it was frequently reprinted in that language. The first English version, by Daniel Malthus,
							was published in 1779 as The Sorrows of Werter, using the French text, rather than Goethe's original, as its base. </p>
						<p>The novel coincided with what has come to be known as the Age of Sensibility, whose flames it helped to fan. It is an
							epistolary novel, told in Werther's voice and from his perspective, and there is little in the way of plot. Charlotte, the
							oldest of six children, is left an orphan by the sudden death of her mother, and she marries the sensible, if somewhat
							plodding, Albert as a means of holding the family together. Onto the scene comes the young student Werther who is
							befriended by the couple but then falls passionately in love with Lotte. His infatuation progressively deepens to a point
							of desperation in which he commits suicide. The novel was said to be responsible for making suicide fashionable among the
							young men of Europe.</p>
						<p>What the Creature responds to are less the episodes of the plot or even the dynamics of infatuation than the sense of moral
							emptiness that Werther finds in the world and from which he turns for refuge to the somewhat maternal Lotte. Precociously
							intellectual with a late-adolescent intensity, Werther too seeks to understand his identity and to discover his place in a
							middle-class milieu that cares for little that is not prudent and sensible, the world represented by Albert. In reference
							to the particular dynamics of Mary Shelley's novel, this milieu would appear very much on the order of the temperate Swiss
							world of Alphonse Frankenstein and Henry Clerval's father. Thus, curiously enough, the novel establishes a link to
							Goethe's fiction both through the intense self-questioning and bleak alienation of the Creature as well as the obsessive
							behavior of his creator Victor Frankenstein, who also turns away from the commonplace Geneva expectations in which he was
							raised to fathom a new mode of being. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="359">
						<term>I learned . . . thoughts</term>
						<p>The Creature turns from Goethe's novel of isolated sensibility, where he sees his own reflection (and we to some extent see
							Victor's) to contemplate the public and civic models of Plutarch's biographical accounts, engaging a world of social
							interaction and nation-building of which he has no experience whatsoever. Thus the accounts draw him forth from his own
							isolation to imagine a larger cultural sphere of action in which he might participate. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="360">
						<term>we shall be monsters . . . world</term>
						<p>That the Creature proposes to make a virtue out of necessity and embrace his alienation as a mode of existence indicates
							what two years of experience have cost him. The pathos of this declaration does not call attention to itself, but is all
							the more affecting. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="361">
						<term>what can disturb our tranquillity</term>
						<p>Elizabeth's faith that a retreat from the world would allow the two of them a relief from the buffeting of experience is
							understandable, if sadly ill-placed. The ensuing chapters seem deliberately designed to test this hope both in their
							exemplary tale of a collective retreat (involving not just the DeLacey's and Safie, but the Creature as well) and in the
							very fact that, themselves taking place in an almost inaccessible retreat, they present Victor Frankenstein with a moral
							crisis of a kind he has never known and is unprepared for. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="362">
						<term>what . . . destination?</term>
						<p>These might be said to be the root questions of all philosophy. They are in a substantial way the end toward which the
							progressive education of the Creature has been tending. That they are unanswerable has larger implications than for just
							him. They contribute to the exploratory tonalities of a novel that resists easy answers and unambiguous truths. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="363">
						<term>when falsehood can look so like the truth</term>
						<p>Elizabeth's comparative innocence does not allow her the larger perspective held by the reader, who might want to apply the
							force of these words to the accruing series of contrasts between herself and Victor being offered by this paragraph. In
							his lack of candor, justice, and sympathy, Victor appears specifically to negate the virtues of Elizabeth, who stands here
							as something of an emblem for truth itself. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="364">
						<term>I was in reality the monster that I am</term>
						<p>A lengthy pattern of self-analysis and attendant self-alienation is implicit in this passage. The Creature's divorce from
							himself is linked to the imagery of doubling throughout the novel. </p>

						<p>American usage would substitute the word "switchbacks" for this locution today. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="366">
						<term>without bounds</term>
						<p>The repetition of "boundless" language from the previous chapter (see II:1:6 and note) emphasizes the point that Victor is,
							as ever, too "ardent," unable to moderate or even control his reaction. Whereas some earlier critics wished to enforce a
							facile dichotomy between Victor as rationalist and his Creature as the exemplar of sensibility, a passage like this
							reminds us of how little power Victor's capacity for abstraction actually has over the broad field of his mind.</p>
						<p> The Creature, as his narrative unfolds, will likewise represent himself through similar language as he experiences what he
							conceives to be a betrayal by his "adopted" family, the De Laceys. At that moment (II:8:12) in his recital he seems
							unconscious of the close similarity between the two of them. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="367">
						<term>without being able as yet to understand or apply them</term>
						<p>That the Creature has as yet no notion of how words that define feelings can be applied suggests that the next stage of his
							education must be metaphysical, involving an understanding of the self and an exploration of self-consciousness. For him
							this will necessarily entail what Byron called "Consciousness awaking to her woes" (Childe Harold's Pilgrimage 1.941: st.
							92). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="368">
						<term>the wretched</term>
						<p>"Wretch" is the first term Victor applies to his Creature (I:4:3), as well as his appellation for him at his reappearance
							in this chapter. It is apt that the creature thus picks up this resonant word and by shifting its form alters its meaning.
							For her debut as a novelist Mary Shelley adopts a daring and difficult but brilliantly successful strategy, keeping the
							Creature out of sight for most of Volume I while Victor heaps terms of abuse on his felt presence and renders him for the
							reader the monster he is wont to call him. The urbane calm of the Creature's opening statement, "I expected this
							reception," is a startling reminder of just how much Victor, in his narration of his story, has skewed the perspective on
							its events. In effect, the Creature takes the opportunity of his finally being heard to rename, to reconceptualize,
							himself. And the reader is left hanging in doubt—perhaps, even distrust—about rendering a verdict from having listened
							only to one side of the case. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="369">
						<term>You accuse me of murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature</term>
						<p> </p>
						<p> As the Creature's terms have just implicitly placed Victor Frankenstein with the judges who have wrongfully condemned
							Justine Moritz to death, so here, he recognizes that Victor's easy willingness to commit murder, broached in the preceding
							chapter (II:1:6) and reiterated to the Creature himself (II:2:6), places him on the same moral plane as the being he
							accuses of having committed murder. If Victor does not yet recognize his identity with his creation, the Creature's plea
							is reinforcing their "ties" on every level possible. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="370">
						<term>your duty</term>
						<p>Alphonse Frankenstein has so chastized Victor over his slippery sense of his family obligations that he ought to experience
							some confusion to hear his father's words echoed from the mouth of his Creature. In a world about to be turned
							upside-down, it would not be surprising if Victor's putative son were not in some odd sense to assume the role of his
							father. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="371">
						<term>You are in the wrong</term>
						<p>No one, not even his father, ever speaks to Victor so forthrightly or with such categorical moral language. The diction
							picks up on the issue of what is a "right" from two paragraphs before. </p>
