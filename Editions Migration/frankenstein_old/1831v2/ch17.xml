<p rend="emph">Chapter 17 </p>

<list type="simple">
<item>
<p>THE being finished speaking, and fixed
									his looks upon me in expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas
									sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone
									can do; and I demand it of you as a right which you
									must not refuse to concede."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life
									among the cottagers, and, as he said this, I could no longer
										suppress the rage that burned within me.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I do refuse it," I replied; "and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most
									miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose
									joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never
									consent." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"You are in the wrong," replied the fiend; "and, instead of threatening, I am content to
									reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my
									creator, would tear me to pieces, and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he
									pities me? You would not call it murder, if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts, and destroy my
									frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man, when he contemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness; and, instead of injury, I
									would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our
									union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject
										slavery. I will revenge my injuries: if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear; and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear
									inextinguishable hatred. Have a care: I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so
									that you shall curse the hour of your birth." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to
									behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me; for you do not reflect that you are the cause of
									its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence
									towards me, I should return them an hundred and an hundred fold; for that one creature's sake, I would make peace
									with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised. What I ask of you is reasonable
									and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself: the gratification is small, but it is
									all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world;
									but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be
									harmless, and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! my creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you
									for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!" </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent; but I felt that
									there was some justice in his argument. His tale,
									and the feelings he now expressed, proved him to be a
										creature of fine sensations; and did I not as his maker, owe him all the portion of happiness that it was
									in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling, and continued—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again: I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My
									food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and
										the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of
									the same nature as myself, and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun
									will shine on us as on man, and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you
									must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of
										power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the
									favourable moment, and persuade you to promise what I so
										ardently desire." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"You propose," replied I, "to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the
									field will be your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this
									exile? You will return, and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will
									then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I
									cannot consent." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"How inconstant are your feelings! but a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do
									you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me,
									that, with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man, and dwell as it may chance, in the most
									savage of places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! my life will flow quietly away,
									and, in my dying moments, I shall not curse my maker." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and sometimes felt a wish to console him; but when I
									looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened, and my feelings were altered
									to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these
										sensations; I thought, that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the
									small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"You swear," I said, "to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make
									me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your
									revenge." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"How is this? I must not be trifled with: and I demand an answer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and
									vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing, of
									whose existence every one will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor; and my virtues will
									necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being, and become linked to
									the chain of existence and events, from which I am now
										excluded." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I paused some time to reflect on all
									he had related, and the various arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he had
									displayed on the opening of his existence, and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and
									scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations:
									a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of
									inaccessible precipices, was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of
									reflection, I concluded that the justice due both to
									him and my fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I
									said—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood
									of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I swear," he cried, "by the sun, and by the blue sky of
										Heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you
									shall never behold me again. Depart to your home, and commence your labours: I shall watch their progress with
									unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the
									mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost him among the undulations of the sea of
									ice. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I
									ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of
									winding among the little paths of the mountains, and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced, perplexed me, occupied
									as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced, when I came to the
									half-way resting-place, and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals, as the clouds passed
									from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground: it was a scene of wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange
									thoughts within me. I wept bitterly; and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, "Oh! stars and clouds, and winds, ye are all about to
									mock me: if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart,
									and leave me in darkness." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>These were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and
									how I listened to every blast of wind, as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned
									immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on
									me with a mountain's weight, and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering
									the house, presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm; but I answered no
									question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their
									sympathies—as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to
									adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an
									occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream; and that thought only had to me
									the reality of life. </p>
