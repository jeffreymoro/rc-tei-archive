<p>
DAY after day, week after week, passed away on my
return to Geneva; and I could
not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the
vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to
overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found
that I could not compose a female without again devoting several
months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard
of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the
knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes
thought of obtaining my father's consent to visit England for
this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and could
not resolve to interrupt my returning tranquillity.  My health,
which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my
spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose
proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he
turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the
remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return
by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching
sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the
lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds, and
listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But
the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some
degree of composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of
my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,
calling me aside, thus addressed me:—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your
former pleasures, and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet
you are still unhappy, and still avoid our society. For some time
I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this; but yesterday
an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to
avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but
draw down treble misery on us all."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>
I trembled violently at
this exordium, and my father continued—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your
marriage with your cousin as the tie of our domestic
comfort, and the stay of my declining years. You were
attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied
together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely
suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man,
that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may
have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your
sister, without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay,
you may have met with another whom you may love; and, considering
yourself as bound in honour to your cousin, this struggle may
occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly
and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth
does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and
prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The expression of your sentiments on this subject, my dear
Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time
experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy,
however present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this
gloom, which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind,
that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you object
to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage. We have been
unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that every-day
tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger;
yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent
fortune, that an early
marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour
and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,
however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you, or that a delay
on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my
words with candour, and
answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>
I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some
time incapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my
mind a multitude of thoughts, and endeavoured to arrive at some
conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my
cousin was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn
promise, which I had not yet fulfilled, and dared not break; or,
if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my
devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my
neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must perform my
engagement, and let the monster depart with his mate, before I
allowed myself to enjoy the delight of an union from which I
expected peace.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either
journeying to England, or entering into a long correspondence
with those philosophers of that country, whose knowledge and
discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present
undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired
intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory: besides, any
variation was agreeable to me, and I was delighted with the idea
of spending a year or two in change of scene and variety of
occupation, in absence from my
family; during which period some event might happen which
would restore me to them in peace and happiness:  my promise
might be fulfilled, and the monster have departed; or some
accident might occur to destroy him, and put an end to my slavery for ever.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a
wish to visit England; but, concealing the true reasons
of this request, I clothed my desires under the guise of wishing
to travel and see the world before I sat down for life within the
walls of my native town.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>
I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was
easily induced to comply; for a more indulgent and less
dictatorial parent did not exist upon earth.  Our plan was soon
arranged.  I should travel to Strasburgh, where Clerval would
join me.  Some short time would be spent in the towns of Holland,
and our principal stay would be in England.  We should return by
France; and it was agreed that the tour should occupy the space
of two years.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>My father pleased himself with the reflection, that my union
with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return to
Geneva.  "These two years," said he, "will pass swiftly, and it
will be the last delay that will oppose itself to your happiness.
And, indeed, I earnestly desire that period to arrive, when we
shall all be united, and neither hopes or fears arise to disturb
our domestic calm."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I am content," I replied, "with your arrangement.  By that
time we shall both have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we
at present are."  I sighed; but my father kindly forbore to
question me further concerning the cause of my dejection.  He
hoped that new scenes, and the amusement of travelling, would
restore my tranquillity.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I now made arrangements for my journey; but one feeling
haunted me, which filled me with fear and agitation. During my
absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of
their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he
might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me
wherever I might go; and would he not accompany me to England?
This imagination was
dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch
as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonized with the
idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen.
But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my
creature, I allowed myself
to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present
sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me, and
exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>
It was in the latter end of
August that I departed, to pass two years of exile. Elizabeth
approved of the reasons of my departure, and only regretted that she had not the
same opportunities of enlarging her experience, and cultivating
her understanding.  She wept, however, as she bade me
farewell, and entreated me to return happy and tranquil.  "We
all," said she, "depend upon you; and if you are miserable, what
must be our feelings?"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away,
hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing
around.  I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish
that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments
should be packed to go with me:  for I resolved to fulfil my
promise while abroad, and return, if possible, a free man. Filled with dreary
imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic
scenes; but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only
think of the bourne of my
travels, and the work which was to occupy me whilst they
endured.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>After some days spent in listless
indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at
Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great
was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene; joyful when
he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it
rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours
of the landscape, and the appearances of the sky. "This is what it is to
live," he cried, "now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein,
wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful?" In truth, I was occupied by
gloomy thoughts, and neither saw the descent of the evening star, nor the
golden sun-rise reflected in the Rhine.—And you, my friend, would be far more amused
with the journal of Clerval, who
observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than to listen
to my reflections. I, a miserable
wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>
We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a
boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping
for London. During this voyage, we
passed many willowy islands, and saw
several beautiful towns. We staid a day at Manheim, and, on the fifth from our
departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mayence. The course of the Rhine below
Mayence becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly, and
winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw
many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,
presents a singularly variegated
landscape. In one spot you view rugged
hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark
Rhine rushing beneath; and, on the sudden turn of a promontory,
flourishing vineyards, with green sloping banks, and a meandering river,
and populous towns, occupy the scene.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>
We travelled at the time of the
vintage, and heard the song of the
labourers, as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and
my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I
lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky,
I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger.
And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt
as if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a happiness
seldom tasted by man. "I have seen," he said, "the most beautiful scenes
of my own country; I have visited the
lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost
perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades,
which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance, were it not for the
most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have
seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of
water, and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great
ocean, and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the
priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche, and where their
dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly
wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud: but
this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The
mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange; but there is a
charm in the banks of this divine river, that I never before saw
equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that
also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely
trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and
that village half-hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely, the
spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man, than
those who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the
mountains of our own country."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your
words, and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently
deserving. He was a being formed in the "very poetry of nature."
His wild and enthusiastic
imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His
soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that
devoted and wondrous nature that the worldy-minded teach us to
look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not
sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others
regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:</p>
</item>
<item>
<lg>
<l>------  "The sounding cataract<lb/>
Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,<lb/>
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,<lb/>
Their colours and their forms, were then to him<lb/>
An appetite; a feeling, and a love,<lb/>
That had no need of a remoter charm,<lb/>
By thought supplied, or any interest<lb/>
Unborrowed from the eye."</l>
</lg>
<p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being
lost forever? Has this mind so replete with ideas, imaginations
fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence
depended on the life of its creator; has this mind perished?  Does it now only
exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely
wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit
still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a
slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe
my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my
tale.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>
Beyond Cologne we descended to the
plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way; for the wind was contrary, and the stream of
the river was too gentle to aid us.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful
scenery; but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we
proceeded by sea to England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of September, that
I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames
presented a new scene; they were flat, but fertile, and almost
every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort, and remembered
the Spanish armada; Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich, places which I had
heard of even in my country.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>At length, we saw the numerous steeples
of London, St. Paul's
towering above all, and the Tower
famed
in English history.</p>
