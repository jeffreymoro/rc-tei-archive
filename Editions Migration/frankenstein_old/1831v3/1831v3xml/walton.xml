<p rend="emph">Walton, in continuation</p>
<p> </p>
<list type="simple">
<item>
<p>August 26th, 17--.</p>
<p>YOU have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congealed with horror, like
									that which even now curdles mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others,
									his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely
									eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow, and quenched in infinite wretchedness.
									Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones, and
									related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
									volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage, as he shrieked out
									imprecations on his persecutor.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His tale is connected, and told with an appearance of the
										simplest truth; yet I own to you that the letters
										of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his
									narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has then really existence! I
									cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the
									particulars of his creature's formation; but on this point he was impenetrable.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Are you mad, my friend?" said he; "or whither does your
										senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also
									create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?
									Peace, peace! learn my miseries, and do not seek to increase your own."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he asked to see them, and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places; but
									principally in giving the life and spirit to the
									conversations he held with his enemy. "Since you have preserved my narration," said he, "I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the
										strangest tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul, have been drunk up
									by the interest for my guest, which this tale, and
									his own elevated and gentle manners, have created. I wish to soothe him; yet can I counsel one so infinitely
									miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only joy that he can now know will be
									when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium: he believes,
									that, when in dreams he holds converse with his friends, and derives from that communion consolation for his
									miseries, or excitements to his vengeance, that they
									are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world.
									This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes. On every point of general literature
									he displays unbounded knowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear
									him, when he relates a pathetic incident, or endeavours to
										move the passions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days
									of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth, and the greatness of
									his fall.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"When younger," said he, "I believed myself destined for some great enterprise. My feelings are
									profound; but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of
									the worth of my nature supported me, when others would have been oppressed; for I deemed it criminal to throw away
									in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I had
									completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this thought,
									which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my
									speculations and hopes are as nothing; and, like the
										archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis
									and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea, and executed the creation of a
									man. Even now I cannot recollect, without passion, my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my
									thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with
									high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would
									not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,
									never, never again to rise."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a
										friend; I have sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert seas I have found
									such a one; but, I fear, I have gained him only to know his value, and lose him. I would reconcile him to life,
									but he repulses the idea.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I thank you, Walton," he said, "for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new
									ties, and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval
									was; or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the
										affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always
									possess a certain power over our minds, which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine
									dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our
									actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such
									symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly
									he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
									through habit and association, but from their own merits; and, wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth,
									and the conversation of Clerval, will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead; and but one feeling in such a
									solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with
									extensive utility to my fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy
									the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled, and I may die."</p>
</item>
<item>My beloved Sister, <p> I write to you, encompassed by peril, and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear
									England, and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice, which admit of no escape,
									and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows, whom I have persuaded to be my companions, look
									towards me for aid; but I have none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my
									courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered
									through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the
									cause.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You
										will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you will
									have visitings of despair, and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! my beloved sister, the sickening failing of your
									heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband, and lovely children; you may be happy:
									Heaven bless you, and make you so!</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest
										compassion. He endeavours to fill me with hope; and talks as if life were a possession which he valued. He
									reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators, who have attempted this sea, and, in
									spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence: when he speaks, they no
									longer despair; he rouses their energies, and, while they hear his voice, they believe these vast mountains of ice
									are mole-hills, which will vanish before the resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of
									expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest, that although it is highly probable that these papers may never
									reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in
									their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my
										unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily
									declined in health: a feverish fire still glimmers in his
										eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into
									apparent lifelessness.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a
										mutiny. This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes half closed,
									and his limbs hanging listlessly,—I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission
									into the cabin. They entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen
									by the other sailors to come in deputation to me, to make me a requisition, which, in justice, I could not refuse.
									We were immured in ice, and should probably never escape; but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should
									dissipate, and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage, and lead them into fresh
									dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a
									solemn promise, that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southward.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>This speech troubled me. I had not despaired; nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning, if set free. Yet could
									I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this
									demand? I hesitated before I answered; when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and, indeed, appeared
									hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with
									momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you then so easily turned from your design? Did you not
									call this a glorious expedition? And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it
									was full of dangers and terror; because, at every new incident, your fortitude was to be called forth, and your
									courage exhibited; because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this was
									it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species; your name adored, as
									belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour, and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the
									first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink
									away, and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor
									souls, they were chilly, and returned to their warm fire-sides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need
									not have come thus far, and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat, merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh!
										be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes, and firm as a rock.
									This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable, and cannot withstand you, if you say that
									it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return, as heroes
									who have fought and conquered, and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can
									you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another, and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them
									to retire, and consider of what had been said: that I would
										not lead them farther north, if they strenuously desired the contrary; but that I hoped that, with
									reflection, their courage would return.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>They retired, and I turned towards my friend; but he was sunk in languor, and almost deprived of life.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>How all this will terminate, I know not; but I had rather die than return shamefully,—my purpose
									unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their
									present hardships.</p>
<p>September 7th.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The die is cast; I have consented to
									return, if we are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed. It requires more
									philosophy than I possess, to bear this injustice with
									patience. </p>
<p/>
<p>September 12th.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; — I have
									lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am
									wafted towards England, and towards you, I will not despond.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like
										thunder were heard at a distance, as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were in the most
									imminent peril; but, as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest,
									whose illness increased in such a degree, that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us, and
									was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprung from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the
									south became perfectly free. When the sailors saw this, and that their return to their native country was
									apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke
									from them, loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke, and asked the cause of the tumult. "They
									shout," I said, "because they will soon return to England."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Do you then really return?"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Alas! yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead
										them unwillingly to danger, and I must return."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up
									your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by Heaven,
									and I dare not. I am weak; but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength."
									Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back, and
									fainted.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It was long before he was restored; and I often thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he opened his
									eyes; he breathed with difficulty, and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught, and ordered us to leave him
									undisturbed. In the mean time he told me, that my friend had not many hours to live.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His sentence was pronounced; and I could only grieve, and be patient. I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were
									closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and, bidding me come near,
									said—"Alas! the strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and
									persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred, and ardent desire of revenge, I
									once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I have
									been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I
									find it blameable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I
									created a rational creature, and was bound towards him, to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
									well-being. This was my duty; but there was another
									still paramount to that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention, because they included
									a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create
									a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness, in evil: he destroyed my
									friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know
									where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself,
										that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have
									failed. When actuated by selfishness and vicious
									motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work; and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by
									reason and virtue.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends, to fulfil this task; and now, that you are returning to
									England, you will have little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your
									duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare not
									ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be
										misled by passion.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily
									expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the beloved dead
									flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity, and avoid ambition,
									even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do I
									say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet
										another may succeed."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His voice became fainter as he spoke; and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sunk into silence. About half an
									hour afterwards he attempted again to speak, but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for
									ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit? What can I say, that will
									enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble. My
									tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
										disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is
										midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again; there is a sound as of a
									human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise, and
									examine. Good night, my sister.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet
									dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I
									have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I
									cannot find words to describe; gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over
									the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent
									texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and
									horror, and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome, yet
									appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily,
									and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties
									with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to
									stay.</p>

<p>He paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to
									forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"That is also my victim!" he exclaimed: "in his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being
									is wound to its close! Oh, Frankenstein! generous and
										self-devoted being! what does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed
									thee by destroying all thou lovest. Alas! he is cold, he cannot answer me."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His voice seemed suffocated; and my first impulses,
									which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend, in destroying his enemy, were now
									suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion.
									I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring
									and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to
									utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the
									tempest of his passion: "Your repentance," I said, "is now superfluous. If you had listened to the voice of conscience, and heeded the stings of
									remorse, before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"And do you dream?" said the dæmon; "do you think that I was then dead to agony and
									remorse?—He," he continued, pointing to the corpse, "he suffered not in the consummation of the
									deed;—oh! not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its
									execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart
									was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy; and, when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change, without
										torture such as you cannot even imagine.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"After the murder of Clerval, I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity
									amounted to horror: I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of
									its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness; that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me,
									he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then
									impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat,
									and resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture; but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse,
									which I detested, yet could not disobey. Yet when she died!—nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast
									off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an
									element which I had willingly chosen. The completion of my
										demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of
										his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when
									I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me. "Wretch!" I said, "it is well that you come here to
									whine over the desolation that you have made. You throw a
										torch into a pile of buildings; and, when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins, and lament the fall.
									Hypocritical fiend! if he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the
									prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your
									malignity is withdrawn from your power."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Oh, it is not thus—not thus," interrupted the being; "yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by
									what appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek
										not a fellow-feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and
									affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I
										wished to be participated. But now, that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and
									affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer
									alone, while my sufferings shall endure: when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my
										memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped
									to meet with beings, who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable
									of unfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me beneath the
									meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over
									the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled
									with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen
									angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation;
										I am alone.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But, in the
									detail which he gave you of them, he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured, wasting in
									impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still I
									desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only
									criminal, when all human kind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door
									with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are
									virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked,
									and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at the
										recollection of this injustice.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as
									they slept, and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my
									creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him
									even to that irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me; but your abhorrence cannot
									equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which
									the imagination of it was conceived, and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that
									imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any
									man's death is needed to consummate the series of my being, and accomplish that which must be done; but it
									requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the
									ice-raft which brought me thither, and shall seek the
										most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile, and consume to ashes this miserable
									frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch, who would create such another as
									I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me, or be the prey of feelings
									unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very
									remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars, or feel the winds play on my
									cheeks. Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and
									in this condition must I find my happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened
									upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer, and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the
									birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to
									die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes, and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find
									rest but in death?</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of human kind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein!
									If thou wert yet alive, and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life
									than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater
									wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not
									desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine; for the bitter
									sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"But soon," he cried, with sad and solemn enthusiasm, "I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon
									these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly, and exult in the agony of the
									torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the
									winds. My spirit will sleep in peace; or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, upon the ice-raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon
									borne away by the waves, and lost in darkness and
									distance.</p>
