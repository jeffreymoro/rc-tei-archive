        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rendition="#indent4"><hi rend="smcaps">Yes</hi>, let me tell of Jennet, my last child;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">In her the charms of all the rest ran wild,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And sprouted as they pleased. Still by my side,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I own she was my favourite, was my pride, </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Since first she labour’d round my neck to twine,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Or clasp’d both little hands in one of mine:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And when the season broke, I’ve seen her bring</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Lapfuls of flowers, and then the girl would sing</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Whole songs, and halves, and bits, O, with such glee!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">If playmates found a favourite, it was she.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Her lively spirit lifted her to joy;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To distance in the race a clumsy boy</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Would raise the flush of conquest in her eye,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And all was dance, and laugh, and liberty.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Yet not hard-hearted, take me right, I beg,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The veriest romp that ever wagg’d a leg</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Was Jennet; but when pity soothed her mind,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Prompt with her tears, and delicately kind.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The half-fledged nestling, rabbit, mouse, or dove, </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">By turns engaged her cares and infant love;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And many a one, at the last doubtful strife,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Warm’d in her bosom, started into life.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rendition="#indent4">At thirteen she was all that Heaven could send,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">My nurse, my faithful clerk, my lively friend;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Last at my pillow when I sunk to sleep,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">First on my threshold soon as day could peep:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I heard her happy to her heart’s desire,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With clanking pattens, and a roaring fire.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Then, having store of new-laid eggs to spare, </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She fill’d her basket with the simple fare,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And weekly trudged (I think I see her still)</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To sell them at yon house upon the hill.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Oft have I watch’d her as she stroll’d along,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Heard the gate bang, and heard her morning song;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And, as my warm ungovern’d feelings rose,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Said to myself, ‘Heaven bless her! there she goes.’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Long would she tarry, and then dancing home,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Tell how the lady bade her oft’ner come,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And bade her talk and laugh without control;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For Jennet’s voice was music to the soul,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">My tale shall prove it:—For there dwelt a son,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">An only child, and where there is but one,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Indulgence like a mildew reigns, from whence</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Mischief may follow if that child wants sense. </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But Alfred was a youth of noble mind,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With ardent passions, and with taste refined:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">All that could please still courted heart and hand,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Music, joy, peace, and wealth, at his command;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Wealth, which his widow’d mother deem’d his own;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Except the poor, she lived for him alone.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Yet would she weep by stealth when he was near,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But check’d all sighs to spare his wounded ear;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For from his cradle he had never seen</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Soul-cheering sunbeams, or wild nature’s green. </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But all life’s blessings centre not in sight;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For Providence, that dealt him one long night,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Had given, in pity to the blooming boy,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Feelings more exquisitely tuned to joy.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Fond to excess was he of all that grew;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The morning blossom sprinkled o’er with dew,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Across his path, as if in playful freak,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Would dash his brow, and weep upon his cheek;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Each varying leaf that brush’d where’er he came,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Press’d to his rosy lip he call’d by name; </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He grasp’d the saplings, measured every bough,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Inhaled the fragrance that the spring months throw</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Profusely round, till his young heart confess’d</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That all was beauty, and himself was bless’d.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Yet when he traced the wide extended plain, </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Or clear brook side, he felt a transient pain;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The keen regret of goodness, void of pride,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To think he could not roam without a guide.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rendition="#indent4">Who, guess ye, knew these scenes of home delight</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Better than Jennet, bless’d with health and sight? </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Whene’er she came, he from his sports would slide,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And catch her wild laugh, listening by her side;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Mount to the tell-tale clock with ardent spring,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And <hi rend="ital">feel </hi>the passing hour, then fondly cling</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To Jennet’s arm, and tell how sweet the breath </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Of bright May-mornings on the open heath;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Then off they started, rambling far and wide,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Like Cupid with a wood-nymph by his side.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rendition="#indent4">Thus months and months roll’d on, the summer pass’d,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And the long darkness, and the winter blast, </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Sever’d the pair; no flowery fields to roam,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Poor Alfred sought his music and his home.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">What wonder then if inwardly he pined?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The anxious mother mark’d her stripling’s mind</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Gloomy and sad, yet striving to be gay </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">As the long tedious evenings pass’d away:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas her delight fresh spirits to supply.—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">My girl was sent for—just for company.</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">A tender governess my daughter found,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Her temper placid, her instruction sound; </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Plain were her precepts, full of strength, their power</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">Would tell how great their strength, their bounds how far,</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">The globe she managed with a timid hand,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Told which was ocean, which was solid land,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And said, whate’er their diff ‘rent climates bore,</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">Thus grown familiar, and at perfect ease,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">What could be Jennet’s duty but to please?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Yet hitherto she kept, scarce knowing why,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">One powerful charm reserved, and still was shy. </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">When Alfred from his grand-piano drew</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Those heavenly sounds that seem’d for ever new,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She sat as if to sing would be a crime,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And only gazed with joy, and nodded time.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Till one snug evening, I myself was there,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The whispering lad inquired, behind my chair,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Bowman, can Jennet sing?’ ‘At home,’ said I,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘She sings from morn till night, and seems to fly</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">From tune to tune, the sad, the wild, the merry,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And moulds her lip to suit them like a cherry; </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She learn’d them here.’—‘O ho!’ said he, ‘O ho!’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And rubb’d his hands, and stroked his forehead, so.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Then down he sat, sought out a tender strain,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Sung the first words, then struck the chords again;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Come, Jennet, help me, you <hi rend="ital">must </hi>know this song</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Which I have sung, and you have heard so long.’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I mark’d the palpitation of her heart,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Yet she complied, and strove to take a part,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But faint and fluttering, swelling by degrees,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Ere self-composure gave that perfect ease, </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The soul of song:—then, with triumphant glee,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Resting her idle work upon her knee,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Her little tongue soon fill’d the room around</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With such a voluble and magic sound,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That, ’spite of all her pains to persevere, </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She stopp’d to sigh, and wipe a starting tear;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Then roused herself for faults to make amends,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">While Alfred trembled to his fingers’ ends.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But when this storm of feeling sunk to rest,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Jennet, resuming, sung her very best, </l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">And talk’d of Cowper’s ‘Task,’<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> [William Cowper, ‘The Task: A Poem in Six Books’,

          <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas thus I found they pass’d their happy time,</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">Once on a sunbright morning, ’twas in June,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I felt my spirits and my hopes in tune,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And idly rambled forth, as if t’ explore</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The little valley just before my door; </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Down by yon dark green oak I found a seat</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Beneath the clustering thorns, a snug retreat</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For poets, as I deem’d, who often prize</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Such holes and corners far from human eyes;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I mark’d young Alfred, led by Jennet, stray</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Just to the spot, both chatting on their way:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">They came behind me, I was still unseen;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He was the elder, Jennet was sixteen.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">My heart misgave me, lest I should be deem’d</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A prying listener, never much esteem’d, </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But this fear soon subsided, and I said,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘I’ll hear this blind lad and my little maid.’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That instant down she pluck’d a woodbine wreath,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The loose leaves rattled on my head beneath;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">This was for Alfred, which he seized with joy,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘O, thank you, Jennet,’ said the generous boy.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Much was their talk, which many a theme supplied,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">As down they sat, for every blade was dried.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I would have skulk’d away, but dare not move,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Besides,’ thought I, ‘they will not talk of love;’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But I was wrong, for Alfred, with a sigh,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A little tremulous, a little shy,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But, with the tenderest accents, ask’d his guide</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A question which might touch both love and pride.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘This morning, Jennet, why did you delay,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And talk to that strange clown upon your way,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Our homespun gardener? how can you bear</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">His screech-owl tones upon your perfect ear?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I cannot like that man, yet know not why,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He’s surely quite as old again as I;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He’s ignorant, and cannot be your choice,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And ugly too, I’m certain, by his voice,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Besides, he call’d you pretty.’—‘Well, what then?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I cannot hide my face from all the men;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Alfred, indeed, indeed, you are deceived,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He never spoke a word that I believed;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Nay, can he think that I would leave a home</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Full of enjoyment, present, and to come,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">While your dear mother’s favours daily prove</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">How sweet the bonds of gratitude and love?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">No, while beneath her roof I shall remain,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I’ll never vex you, never give you pain.’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Enough, my life,’ he cried, and up they sprung;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">By Heaven, I almost wish’d that I was young;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">It was a dainty sight to see them pass,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Light as the July fawns upon the grass,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Pure as the breath of spring when forth it spreads,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Love in their hearts, and sunshine on their heads.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rendition="#indent4">Next day I felt what I was bound to do,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To weigh the adventure well, and tell it too;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For Alfred’s mother must not be beguiled,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He was her earthly hope, her only child;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I had no wish, no right to pass it by,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">It might bring grief, perhaps calamity.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She was the judge, and she alone should know</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Whether to check the flame or let it grow.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I went with fluttering heart, and moisten’d eye,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But strong in truth, and arm’d for her reply.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Well, master Bowman, why that serious face?’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Exclaim’d the lovely dame, with such a grace, </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That had I knelt before her, I had been</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Not quite the simplest votary ever seen.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I told my tale, and urged that well-known truth,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That the soft passion in the bloom of youth</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Starts into power, and leads th’ unconscious heart</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A chase where reason takes but little part;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Nothing was more in nature, or more pure,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And from their habits nothing was more sure.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Whether the lady blush’d from pride or joy,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I could but guess;—at length she said—‘My boy </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Dropp’d not a syllable of this to me!</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">Blind as he is! the heir to my estate!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I now might break his heart, and Jennet’s too;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">What must I, Bowman, or what can I do?’—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Do, madam?’ said I, boldly, ‘if you trace</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">‘I will,’ she said, but the next moment sigh’d;</l>

        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rendition="#indent4">I left her thus, deep musing, and soon found</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">Of Alfred’s flageolet; no cares had they,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But in the garden bower spent half the day.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">By starts he sung, then wildest trillings made,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To mock a piping blackbird in the glade.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I turn’d a corner and approach’d the pair;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">My little rogue had roses in her hair!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She whipp’d them out, and with a downcast look,</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">My object was to talk with her aside,</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">She came,—but not till fatal news had wrung</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Her heart through sleepless hours, and chain’d her tongue.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She came, but with a look that gave me pain,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For, though bright sunbeams sparkled after rain,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Though every brood came round, half run, half fly,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I knew her anguish by her alter’d eye;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And strove, with all my power, where’er she came,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To soothe her grief, yet gave it not a name.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">At length a few sad bitter tears she shed,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And on both hands reclined her aching head.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas then my time the conqueror to prove,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I summon’d all my rhetoric, all my love.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Jennet, you must not think to pass through life</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Without its sorrows, and without its strife;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Good, dutiful, and worthy, as you are,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">You must have griefs, and you must learn to bear.’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Thus I went on, trite moral truths to string,—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">All chaff, mere chaff, where love has spread his wing:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She cared not, listen’d not, nor seem’d to know</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">What was my aim, but wiped her burning brow, </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Where sat more eloquence and living power</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Than language could embody in an hour.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With soften’d tone I mention’d Alfred’s name,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">His wealth, our poverty, and that sad blame</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Which would have weigh’d me down, had I not told</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The secret which I dare not keep for gold,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Of Alfred’s love, o’erheard the other morn,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The gardener, and the woodbine, and the thorn;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And added, ‘Though the lady sends you home,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">You are but young, child, and a day may come’—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘She has <hi rend="ital">not </hi>sent me home,’ the girl replied,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And rose with sobs of passion from my side;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘She has <hi rend="ital">not </hi>sent me home, dear father, no;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She gives me leave to tarry or to go;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She has not <hi rend="ital">blamed </hi>me,—yet she weeps no less,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And every tear but adds to my distress;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I am the cause,—thus all that she has done</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Will bring the death or misery of her son.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Jealous he might be, could he but have seen</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">How other lads approach’d where I have been;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But this man’s voice offends his very soul,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That strange antipathy brooks no control;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And should I leave him now, or seem unkind,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The thought would surely wreck his noble mind;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To leave him thus, and in his utmost need! </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Poor Alfred! then you will be blind indeed!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I will not leave him.’—‘Nay, child, do not rave,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">What, would you be his menial, be his slave?’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Yes,’ she exclaim’d, and wiped each streaming eye,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Yes, be his slave, and serve him till I die;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He is too just to act the tyrant’s part,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He’s truth itself.’ O how my burthen’d heart</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Sigh’d for relief!—soon that relief was found;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Without one word we traced the meadow round,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Her feverish hand in mine, and weigh’d the case,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Nor dared to look each other in the face;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Till, with a sudden stop, as if from fear,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I roused her sinking spirit, ‘Who comes here?’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Down the green slope before us, glowing warm,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Came Alfred, tugging at his mother’s arm;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Willing she seem’d, but he still led the way,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She had not walk’d so fast for many a day;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">His hand was lifted, and his brow was bare,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For now no clust’ring ringlets wanton’d there,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He threw them back in anger and in spleen,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And shouted ‘Jennet’ o’er the daisied green.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Boyish impatience strove with manly grace</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">In ev’ry line and feature of his face;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">His claim appear’d resistless as his choice,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And when he caught the sound of Jennet’s voice,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And when with spotless soul he clasp’d the maid,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">My heart exulted while my breath was staid.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Jennet, we must not part! return again;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">What have I done to merit all this pain?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Dear mother, share my fortune with the poor,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Jennet is mine, and <hi rend="ital">shall </hi>be—say no more;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Bowman, you know not what a friend I’ll be;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Give me your daughter, Bowman, give her me;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Jennet, what will my days be if you go?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A dreary darkness, and a life of woe: </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">My dearest love, come <hi rend="ital">home</hi>, and do not cry;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">You are my daylight, Jennet, I shall die.’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To such appeals all prompt replies are cold,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And stately prudence snaps her cobweb hold.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Had the good widow tried, or wish’d to speak,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">This was a bond she could not, dared not break;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Their hearts (you never saw their likeness, never)</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Were join’d, indissolubly join’d for ever.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Why need I tell how soon our tears were dried,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">How Jennet blush’d, how Alfred with a stride </l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Bore off his prize, and fancied every charm,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And clipp’d against his ribs her trembling arm;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">How mute we seniors stood, our power all gone?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Completely conquer’d, Love the day had won,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And the young vagrant triumph’d in our plight,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And shook his roguish plumes, and laugh’d outright.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Yet, by my life and hopes, I would not part</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With this sweet recollection from my heart;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I would not now forget that tender scene</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To wear a crown, or make my girl a queen.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Why need be told how pass’d the months along,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">How sped the summer’s walk, the winter’s song,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">How the foil’d suitor all his hopes gave up,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">How Providence with rapture fill’d their cup?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">No dark regrets, no tragic scenes to prove,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The gardener was too old to die for love.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A thousand incidents I cast aside</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To tell but one—I gave away the bride—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Gave the dear youth what kings could not have given;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Then bless’d them both, and put my trust in Heaven.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">There the old neighbours laugh’d the night away,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Who talk of Jennet’s wedding to this day.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And could you but have seen the modest grace,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The half-hid smiles that play’d in Jennet’s face,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Or mark’d the bridegroom’s bounding heart o’erflow,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">You might have wept for joy, as I could now:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I speak from memory of days long past;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Though ’tis a father’s tale, I’ve done at last.</l>

            <l rendition="#indent4">Here rest thee, rest thee, Muse, review the scene</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Where thou with me from peep of dawn hast been: </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">We did not promise that this motley throng</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Should every <hi rend="ital">one </hi>supply a votive song,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Nor every tenant:—yet thou hast been kind,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">For untold tales must still remain behind,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Which might o’er listening patience still prevail, </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Did fancy waver not, nor daylight fail.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">‘The Soldier’s Wife,’ her toils, his battles o’er,</l>

            <l rendition="#indent4">Then, ‘Lines to Aggravation’ form the close,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Parent of murders, and the worst of woes.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">But while the changeful hours of daylight flew,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Some homeward look’d, and talk’d of evening dew;</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Some watch’d the sun’s decline, and stroll’d around,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Some wish’d another dance, and partners found;</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">When in an instant every eye was drawn </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">To one bright object on the upper lawn;</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">A fair procession from the mansion came,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Unknown its purport, and unknown its aim.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">No gazer could refrain, no tongue could cease,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">It seem’d an embassy of love and peace. </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Nearer and nearer still approach’d the train,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Age in the van transform’d to youth again.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Sir Ambrose gazed, and scarce believed his eyes;</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas magic, memory, love, and blank surprise,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">For there his venerable lady wore </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The very dress which, sixty years before,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Had sparkled on her sunshine bridal morn,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Had sparkled, ay, beneath this very thorn!</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Her hair was snowy white, o’er which was seen,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Emblem of what her bridal cheeks had been, </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">A twin red rose—no other ornament</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Had pride suggested, or false feeling lent;</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">She came to grace the triumph of her lord,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">And pay him honours at his festive board.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Nine ruddy lasses follow’d where she stepp’d; </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">White were their virgin robes, that lightly swept</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The downy grass; in every laughing eye</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Cupid had skulk’d, and written ‘victory.’</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">What heart on earth its homage could refuse?</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Each tripp’d, unconsciously, a blushing Muse.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">A slender chaplet of fresh blossoms bound</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Their clustering ringlets in a magic round.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">And, as they slowly moved across the green,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Each in her beauty seem’d a May-day queen.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The first a wreath bore in her outstretch’d hand, </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The rest a single rose upon a wand;</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Their steps were measured to that grassy throne</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Where, watching them, Sir Ambrose sat alone.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">They stopp’d,—when she, the foremost of the row,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Curtsied, and placed the wreath upon his brow; </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The rest, in order pacing by his bower,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">In the loop’d wreath left each her single flower,—</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Then stood aside.—What broke the scene’s repose?</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The whole assembly clapp’d their hands and rose.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The Muses charm’d them as they form’d a ring, </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">And look’d the very life and soul of Spring!</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">But still the white hair’d dame they view’d with pride,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Her love so perfect, and her truth so tried.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Oh, sweet it is to hear, to see, to name,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Unquench’d affection in the palsied frame— </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">To think upon the boundless raptures past,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">And love, triumphant, conquering to the last!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l rendition="#indent4">Silenced by feeling, vanquish’d by his tears,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The host sprung up, nor felt the weight of years;</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Yet utterance found not, though in virtue’s cause, </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">But acclamations fill’d up nature’s pause,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Till, by one last and vigorous essay,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">His tide of feeling roll’d itself away;</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The language of delight its bondage broke,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">And many a warm heart bless’d him as he spoke. </l>

            <l rendition="#indent4">Ours is an humbler task, that may release</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The high-wrought soul, and mould it into peace.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">These pastoral notes some victor’s ear may fill,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Breathed amidst blossoms, where the drum is still:</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">I purpose then to send them forth to try </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The public patience, or its apathy.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The world shall see them; why should I refrain?</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">’Tis all the produce of my own domain.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Farewell!’ he said, then took his lady’s arm,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">On his shrunk hand her starting tears fell warm; </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Again he turn’d to view the happy crowd,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">And cried, ‘Good night, good night, good night,’ aloud,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">‘Health to you all! for see, the evening closes,’</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Then march’d to rest, beneath his crown of roses.</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">‘Happy old man! with feelings such as these, </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The seasons all can charm, and trifles please.’</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">An instantaneous shout re-echoed round,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas wine and gratitude inspired the sound:</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Some joyous souls resumed the dance again,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The aged loiter’d o’er the homeward plain,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">And scatter’d lovers rambled through the park,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">And breathed their vows of honour in the dark;</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Others a festal harmony preferr’d,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Still round the thorn the jovial song was heard;</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Dance, rhymes, and fame, they scorn’d such things as these, </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">But drain’d the mouldy barrel to its lees,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">As if ’twere worse than shame to want repose:</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Nor was the lawn clear till the moon arose,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">And on each turret pour’d a brilliant gleam</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">Of modest light, that trembled on the stream; </l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">The owl awoke, but dared not yet complain,</l>
            <l rendition="#indent4">And banish’d silence re-assumed her reign.</l>
