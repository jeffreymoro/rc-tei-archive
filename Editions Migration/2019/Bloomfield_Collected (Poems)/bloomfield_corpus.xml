                  <head>About This Edition</head>
                  <p rend="noCount">Admired by Wordsworth and Southey, called by Clare 'the greatest Pastoral Poet England ever gave birth too’, Robert Bloomfield was one of the bestselling poets of the nineteenth century. A labouring-class writer famed for his rural verse, Bloomfield was not only a major influence on Clare but also a children’s author, playwright, tourist writer, and literary critic. <title level="m">The Collected Writings of Robert Bloomfield</title> is the first ever scholarly edition of his entire oeuvre. The editors have collated all the lifetime editions of his publications, making it possible as never before to study the range of his work and the many revisions it underwent. The poems’ textual histories are displayed in variants, editorial footnotes and explanatory introductions. The literary and biographical contexts are discussed, as are the works' critical receptions and publication histories. The effect on his publications of Bloomfield’s vexed position, caught between the traditional expectations of a patron and the demands of a commercial bookseller is detailed. As a result, it is now possible to see Bloomfield both as a major nature poet and as a dramatic illustration of the new pressures on the author caused by the expansion of print culture in the Romantic era. <title level="m">The Collected Writings</title> takes its place alongside the other Bloomfield resources on Romantic Circles—the Electronic Editions of his <title level="m">Letters</title> and of his poem/tour journal/sketchbook <title level="m">The Banks of Wye</title>—and the essay collection ‘The inestimable blessing of letters’.</p>

            developed the modified versions of the transforms provided by the TEI that were
            used to convert the TEI files into HTML. TEI renders text archival quality for
            better preservation and future access. </p>

          of Bloomfield’s first three collections is the most important of these, since he had editorial control over it. Post-1900 editions are far
          fewer, and those we are aware of are listed here in chronological order (not including recent generic print-on-demand reprints).</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">A Note on the Text</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The copytext for the works in this, the first ever edition of Bloomfield’s collected writings, is that of first publication,
          collated with later lifetime editions and the 1824 <title>Remains of Robert Bloomfield</title>. Spelling and punctuation have been retained
          from the first publication. Verbal variants have been recorded; variants of spelling and punctuation have not. One wholesale change has been
          made: the eighteenth-century practice of beginning each line of a quotation with an inverted comma has not been retained. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In the case of the major work, <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>, we have collated the two extant MSS – the 1798 MS of the
          poem sent by Bloomfield to his patron Capel Lofft and, emended by Lofft, sent thence to Thomas Hill and to the printer (Houghton Library fMS
          Eng 776); also that of the poem as reconstructed from memory by Bloomfield in 1801, so as to preserve (in effect reconstitute) a version of
          the text as he first wrote it, free of Lofft’s alterations (Houghton Library fMS Eng 776.1). This constitutes the first ever variorum text
          of the poem, tracing all the manifold alterations in the lifetime editions, not least the changes in the Preface that reflected a battle for
          control of the text between Lofft, Bloomfield and the publishers Vernor and Hood.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">A similar battle is preserved in the variants we record across the editions of <title>Rural Tales</title>. Here, for the
          first time, we make it possible to trace the imposition by Lofft of critical remarks on each poem in the volume’s first printing and their
          subsequent removal; the reviewers’ derision endorsed Bloomfield’s prophecy that such comments would attract ridicule.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Minor poems first collected after Bloomfield’s death in <title>The Remains of Robert Bloomfield</title> are presented in
          chronological order of composition and publication, where the date has been determined. Where we have been unable to establish the date of
          writing and/or publication, we have presented the poems in a section ‘Poems Published in <title>The Remains of Robert
          Bloomfield</title>’.</p>

            slight correction in a place or two where the distribution or mechanism of the lines was not exact’) as ‘a little Fragment in <hi rend="ital">Blank verse</hi>’ in the Supplement to the 2nd edn of <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>. Bloomfield later included the whole
            of the poem in the ‘Advertisement’ to the 8th edn, where the text was taken from the <title>General Advertiser</title> (pub. by John
            Almon, London) for 5 October 1786. Of the poem, Bloomfield noted there: ‘This was once thought to be blank verse; and though nineteen
            years have amended my judgment, rather than my proficiency in that kind of composition, the only just way in the present case, is to give
            the disjointed thing precisely as it was written’. Lines 28–35 were also included in <title>The Remains of Robert Bloomfield</title>
            (1824), where they were given the title ‘Happiness of Gleaners’.</note>

          of opinion that it is indeed desirable the whole Song, of which this is a <hi rend="ital">Fragment</hi>, should be recover’d. It will
          probably be found (according to the recollection of the Author) either in the <title>General Advertiser, Gazetteer</title>, or
            <title>Courant</title>’. The whole was later published in the ‘Advertisment’ to the 8th edn, where the text was based on that published in
          the <title>General Advertiser</title> (pub. by John Almon, London) for 11 November 1786, and, with a slightly different text, in <title>The
            Remains of Robert Bloomfield</title> (1824).</note>

              from the East Indies, as the verses themselves will evince. The word ‘flow,’ was substituted by the editor of the paper for the original
              word ‘offspring.’ This I remembered, and gave the original in the fragment I sent to Mr. Lofft. But, in the 4th stanza, the original
              word had escaped all recollection, until this unexpected sight of the piece, and of its connection, so that if ‘hardships’ be read for
              ‘ought,’ all the meaning I had will be seen. I perfectly remember feeling rather indignant, at seeing myself so badly corrected; and
              this feeling, perhaps, engraved those trifles on my mind much deeper than they deserved.</note> of rapture warm blended, </l>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">HON. FATHER,</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It would have been a great pleasure to us both to have met you at Mr. Wyatt’s this time, and we were only prevented by
          visitors, who came quite unexpected. You would have liked to have seen our little one; and I hope you will yet, before long. We thank you
          for all your kindness, and as I am endeavouring to get into business for myself, I sincerely hope, to have it in my power, to entertain you
          better when you come. I have an undeniable chance. I have some good customers, and might have enough immediately, to provide a genteel
          living for <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn">my wife</ref> and <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldHannah">child</ref>, if I could take advantage of it soon. If I could get three months credit at my leather-cutters, for five or six pounds only, it
          would enable me to give credit to that amount, as my custom lies among such, as are able and willing to improve it: but I am determined to
          carry it on as well as I can. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The underwritten lines, contain the sentiments, which always occur to my mind when I come to Woolwich; and as I put them
          into metre when the Boyne was launched, and they are still perfect on my mind, I write them now, because I think you have a relish for such
          things, particularly the devotional parts of them.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Before I was married, I often amused myself with such compositions, and had several pieces published in newspapers,
          magazines, &amp;; but I find other employment now, which is of equal pleasure to me.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">My Polly and the child are in good health, and I hope to hear from you soon; and remain yours, in duty and affection, </p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Editorial Introduction</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s most famous poem, one of the greatest as well as latest Georgics to be written in English, was also his most
          popular. In his lifetime, it went through fourteen official editions (pirated editions were published in France and America), was translated
          into Latin, and sold an estimated 51000 copies – putting it on a par with <title>Childe Harold</title> and <title>The Lay of the Last
            Minstrel</title> as one of the bestselling poems of the Romantic era. This popularity lasted: new editions regularly appeared until 1877;
          only in the twentieth century did interest decline. Admired by poets, including Southey and Wordsworth, as well as by the public, the poem
          was a critical success. It was also a seminal piece for labouring-class writers, including <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ClareJohn">John Clare</ref>; its representation of Suffolk, meanwhile, influenced <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ConstableJohn">John Constable</ref>’s art.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Composition</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield himself is the main source concerning the history of the poem’s composition. In the Preface he wrote for the
          edition that appeared in the 1809 <title>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</title>, he quoted a letter he had written from
          London to his <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">brother George</ref> in Suffolk on <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.10.html">16 September 1798</ref> sending the manuscript he had completed in June, and declaring</p>
               <quote>When I began it, I thought to myself that I could compleat it in a twelvemonth, allowing myself three months for each quarter; but I
          soon found that I could not, and indeed I made it longer than I at first intended. Nine tenths of it was put together as I sat at work,
          where there are usually six of us; no one in the house have any knowledge of what I have employed my thoughts about when I did not
          talk.</quote>
               <quote>I chose to do it in rhime for this reason; because I found allways that when I put two or three lines together in blank verse, or
          something that sounded like it, it was a great chance if it stood right when it came to be wrote down, for blank verse have ten syllables in
          a line, and this particular I could not adjust, nor bear in memory as I could rhimes. Winter, and half of Autumn were done long before I
          could find leisure to write them. In the Harvest Home you will find the essence of letters you have wrote formerly to London.</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">These remarks date the poem’s origins to between May and December 1796; they also reveal the extraordinary circumstances of
          its composition: Bloomfield produced it not on the farm in Suffolk but in a crowded shoemakers’ garret in London -– the mental process
          hindered, or perhaps helped, by the repetitive noises of hammering and stitching, and by the patterns of his workmates’ conversation. This
          origin in urban labour and in labourers’ sociability, so different from the leisure and solitude in which the typically gentlemanly activity
          of poetic composition usually occurred, had its effect on the poem’s form and content: Bloomfield chose rhyming couplets because they helped
          him not only to attain prosodic regularity but also to memorise the verse; he depicted the harvest home not from first hand experience as a
          reaper but because his brother George, who had left London for Suffolk in 1784, had described it to him in letters.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Despite its paperless origin, the poem was not affiliated to oral poetry. It was not based on the work songs or folk ballads
          that were performed on city street and in village pub, but on the highly literary form of the Georgic as represented by James Thomson’s
            <title>The Seasons </title>(issued in parts between 1725–30 and first collected in 1748) which had been among Bloomfield’s favourite
          reading since he had acquired a copy from a fellow London shoemaker in 1783 or 1784. His poem had, he explained, begun in set-piece
          episodes:</p>
               <quote>The parts of the poem first composed, before any thought was entertained of going through with the Seasons, were the morning scene in
          Spring, beginning ‘This task had <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi>,’ and the description of the lambs at play. </quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">From these initial scenes, the poem grew to four books, one for each season, totaling, by November 1797, just over 1500
          lines. Initially committed to memory, these were transcribed in the manuscript that Bloomfield patiently compiled and sent to George,
          warning him, in a <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.11.html">letter of 7 November 1798</ref>,
          that ‘Having never been instructed in grammar, it may abound in faults of that kind which I am not aware of. The management of stops I don’t

          a radical Whig, and as such believed himself to be a ‘friend of the people’, an opinion that recommended the poem to him. He was an astute
          choice on George’s part, for he was not simply a traditional patron, prepared to offer a local man of talent a small donation or pension as
          part of his duty, but also an author and editor with influence in the expanding publishing market in which magazines and journals—the new
          means of publicizing books—had begun to flourish. He had commercial experience as well as the paternalist attitudes of a traditional Whig
          squire. He wrote to Bloomfield, declaring that ‘the example, as well as the Poem, may teach the rich, and the highly born or educated, not
          unnaturally to urge harsh and overbearing lines of distinction; but to be more attentive to the gifts bestowed by the common Father on
          mankind, than to an overweening conceit of their own privileges and advantages’ (see Preface to the stereotype <title>Poems of Robert
            Bloomfield</title>, 1809). Impressed by the poem both in its own right and as evidence that the poor and poorly educated were not
          naturally inferior, he sent it to <ref type="m"

          well-connected on the London literary scene. Hill arranged to have it published by the firm of <ref type="m"

          he edited, <title>The Monthly Mirror</title>. While little direct information survives as to the terms of the arrangement, a dispute that
          arose between Lofft and Hood in November 1800 suggests that the firm spent £190 on the printing, giving Bloomfield £20 as an advance, and
          taking, it considered, a half interest in the copyright not just for the first but also for subsequent editions (meaning that royalties
          would be split 50/50 with Bloomfield). This, as Hood told Lofft when Lofft argued that the firm’s half interest did not outlast the first
          edition, was a handsome arrangement (see <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.45.html">Letter

          printing themselves, with the bookseller/publisher handling distribution, or to publish by subscription. That this was not the case with
            <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> must have been a result of Lofft’s strategy of showing the poem to Hill, an experienced editor of magazine
          verse with influence over a publishing house. Hill’s imprimatur assured Vernor and Hood that it would find a sale sufficient to repay their
          costs – not least because it could be puffed in the magazines they also published and in which Hill and Lofft reviewed. It was a bargain

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">What Hood published on 1 March 1800 was not quite the manuscript as submitted by George Bloomfield to Lofft in 1798. Lofft
          took it upon himself to revise what he read, as he noted in his Preface to the first edition:</p>
               <quote>My part has been this, and it has been a very pleasing one: to revise the MS. Making occasionally corrections with respect to
          Orthography, and sometimes in the grammatical construction. The corrections, in point of Grammar, reduce themselves almost wholly to a
          circumstance of provincial usage, which even well educated persons in Suffolk and Norfolk do not wholly avoid; and which may be said, as to
          general custom, to have become in these Counties almost an established Dialect:…that of adopting the plural for the singular termination of
          verbs, so as to exclude the s. But not a line is added or substantially alter’d through the whole Poem. (Preface)</quote>

              Parallel Text Edition</title>, ed. Peter Cochran (Newcastle upon Tyne, 2014), p. 19.</note> Lofft’s final
          sentence here was not quite correct. In fact, he did alter phrases that he found too colloquial or too earthy, in favour of a more
          conventional and polite language. The effect of these changes was to make the poem more ‘tasteful’, more detached from the labouring-class
          locutions, and more generic (because its language was deracinated from the language community of rural Suffolk). Although these changes were
          not extensive, Bloomfield himself having largely mastered the gentlemanly style of his model James Thomson, they were significant. In <hi rend="ital">Summer</hi>, for example, Bloomfield’s focus on the ‘writhing loins’ of the ‘sturdy Mower’ proved all too close-up: Lofft
          changed ‘loins’ to ‘form’ (142–3). In <hi rend="ital">Autumn</hi> Bloomfield’s description of the mad girl who left her cottage each night
          ‘in filth to lie, / Where the swine grunting yields up half his sty’ became ‘unhous’d to lie, / Or share the swine’s impure and narrow sty’
          (136–8). Lofft’s farm was to have no hint of sex or shit about it.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Whether Bloomfield knew of these changes while the work was in production, is unclear, for he did not supervise the printing
          (by Thomas Bensley, who would print all of the first six editions), and relied on the press to discover details about the forthcoming
          volume. In a letter to George of 8 September–6 October 1799 (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.16.html">Letter 16</ref>), he noted</p>

          received a copy—perhaps from Lofft—before the humble author and was impressed enough to want to patronise him. He gave Bloomfield a five

          life story using information provided by George, emphasising his rural naivety and natural gentility. It prepared bookbuyers to encounter a
          work of natural genius achieved by a sensitive, humble family man: Bloomfield, it showed, was not an uncouth ale-drinking farmhand and nor
          was he a radicalised artisan (thus banishing the spectres of the democrat campaigners Thomas Paine, a corsetmaker born near Bloomfield in
          Norfolk, and Thomas Hardy, like Bloomfield a London shoemaker, tried for treason in 1794). It also incorporated the praise of several literary gentleman, assuring the upper and middle-classes who were the poem’s likely
          purchasers that it would meet their taste. This was an early use of the marketing technique of name recognition. Lofft’s prefatory framing
          patronised Bloomfield, but thereby made him suitable both for aristocratic patrons who wished to reward natural genius from their regions
          and for middle-class patrons of booksellers’ shops who could support him by buying the poem. It left Bloomfield embarrassed, however,
          because it put his private life on parade and used the rural simplicity that he had shown when he first came to London as a boy to define
          his character as a man. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Lofft’s publicity strategy worked: the reviews followed the lead of the Preface, agreeing that the poet was ‘the untutored

          They relayed the story of Bloomfield’s deserving life. In doing so, they were responding to Lofft’s presentation of the poet, and also to
          Bloomfield’s own choice of a child narrator, highly unusual for a locodescriptive and Georgic poem in the Thomsonian tradition. Instead of
          Thomson’s disembodied, distant narrator, Bloomfield chose not simply a farmworker, as in Stephen Duck’s and Mary Collier’s labouring-class
          revisions of the Georgic tradition, but a boy. This choice gave him a narrator who could be present without being wholly involved in the
          grown-up world he witnessed—as if an unobserved observer. In the gap between the adult writer and his boy narrator, and between the boy and
          the adults within the poem, distance, loneliness and pathos enter. This is not the pathos of time having past—the Wordsworthian lost hour of
          splendour in the grass that the <title>Prelude</title> was written to record and redeem (the temporal distance between the urban, adult
          author and the rural, child narrator was fundamental to Bloomfield’s writing but is not explicitly discussed). It is more a matter of a
          certain alienation in situ: unlike Duck, who conveyed rural life directly to the reader as a man’s personal and collective experience of
          labour, Bloomfield’s boy stands at a remove, looking on. He is not quite one of the lads and certainly not a man, and when he speaks of work
          with the authority born of experience he does so not to challenge the poetic idealisations that depict peasants as fortunate sons of the
          soil who are contented in their labour, but to record his misery and fear when tasked with spending hour after hour alone in the field
          scaring crows. Rural labour, this implies, can be isolating and soul destroying even if not backbreaking. Unlike the ploughmen and the
          threshers, or the milkmaids and the washerwomen, the boy does not get to be one of a team that communally takes pride in its strength, skill
          and usefulness. Thus part of the poem’s appeal lay in its narrator’s ability to mobilise pity, whereas an adult narrator might have raised
          awkward issues of class difference, seeming either obsequious or truculent—anxious to soothe or keen to shock the feelings of a polite
          reader brought face to face with the uncouth farmyard and the uncouth bodies—human and animal—that it places side by side in the muck.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The public’s sympathies were engaged and it began to buy the poem in larger numbers than anyone expected, making Bloomfield
          the first publishing sensation of the nineteenth-century mass-market press. Vernor and Hood astutely catered to different income levels,
          selling <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> in large quartos on fine Whatman paper for the wealthy, in quartos (at half a guinea), and in
          smaller octavos for those with more modest means. The book’s success, then, owed much to commercial acumen on its editors’ and publishers’
          parts. Second and third editions followed later in 1800, in cheaper demi octavo and octavo sizes. In the third, Lofft made a major addition
          to the paratextual material that would turn out to have severe consequences for his relationship with the poem and its author. He added an
          appendix in which he complained at length about his having been removed from his role as a justice of the peace on the grounds, he
          suspected, of his radical politics. The removal had little or nothing to do with Bloomfield’s poem; the appendix therefore did nothing more
          than reveal Lofft’s egotism and his proprietorial attitude towards the work he had brought to public attention. <title>The Farmer’s
            Boy</title> was, the appendix suggested, a place for Lofft to parade his goodwill and air his grievances. It was his, the patron’s, work
          almost as much as that of Bloomfield, who was his client and was to be approached through him, his verse bracketed by Lofft’s prose.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The Appendix distressed Bloomfield and the publisher, Hood, because it put Lofft’s personal affairs between the poet and the
          reader, and introduced contentious political matters to a volume they had tried to keep free of radicalism so as not to alarm reviewers and
          purchasers. In the fifth edition (1801), they persuaded Lofft to add this note exculpating Bloomfield: </p>
               <quote>I wish it to be understood, that neither for my political Sentiments, Opinions, and Conduct, nor for any thing which I have said that
          personally concerns myself in the introductory part of this <hi rend="ital">Appendix</hi>, is Mr. <hi rend="smcaps">Bloomfield</hi> in the smallest degree
          responsible. Those therefore who dislike either the sentiments or the mode of expression must, in mere justice, impute them to me alone, and
          in no respect as any way implicating him. He wishes, I believe, to decline <hi rend="ital">Politics</hi> and <hi rend="ital">Controversy</hi> altogether; and I wish no man to mix in either farther than he feels it to be a Duty.</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">A tension was now evident: the power relations of patron and client did not harmonise with those of editor and author.
          Lofft’s underlying conception of what and who the publication was for (fellow Suffolk gentlefolk who bought the book so as to support worthy
          local causes) was at odds with Hood’s eye on the wider reading public, whom he supposed to want uncontroversial pastoral pleasure. The split
          became wider in October 1801, as Vernor and Hood prepared a sixth edition. Hill and Hood pressured Bloomfield to gain Lofft’s consent to
          drop the appendix (Lofft having by this point been restored to the bench). They also desired the removal of a note approving of the debating
          societies that, anti-Jacobins believed, were hotbeds of labouring class radicalism. Lofft’s reply to the request, Bloomfield reported, made
          it clear that ‘The infalible result of any inovation <hi rend="ital">now</hi> made in “the Farmer’s Boy”, would infix in the mind of Mr L
          the deepest and the most rooted dislike to me’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.69.html">Letter 69</ref>; see also letters <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.63.html">63</ref>,

Lofft let him know that if the cuts were
          made he would ensure Bloomfield became known as an ingrate: Bloomfield, having so little social status, could not risk appearing thus to the
          gentlemen and aristocrats who had supported the work, and was left pleading with Hill and Hood to leave the appendix and the note in place.
          Caught between patron and publisher, Bloomfield found himself to be the property of others (Hood retained half the copyright)—his case a
          symptom of the changes produced by the rapid expansion of the book market and the concomitant diminution of the role of patron and rise of
          that of the bookseller. Although Bloomfield’s plea worked, and Lofft’s embarrassing grandstanding was left in place in the sixth and seventh
          editions, printed by James Swan (1802 and 1803), the difficulty was not resolved. By 1803 he and Lofft were estranged, Lofft having been
          offended by the removal of his footnotes commenting on the poems in Bloomfield’s second collection <title>Rural Tales</title> (1802). In the
          eighth edition, of 1805, Lofft’s insertions concerning debating societies, concerning his tenure on the bench, and concerning his marriage
          were removed; Lofft’s voice presenting the biographical account of Bloomfield’s early life was replaced by Bloomfield’s own; some of the
          flattering commentary on the poem by Lofft’s friends was deleted. Bloomfield did call another literary gentleman to his aid, including in
          the edition a list compiled by <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ParkThomas">Thomas Park</ref> (1759–1834; an editor and antiquarian) of
          all the alterations that Lofft had, in 1799, made to the manuscript of the poem. The aim, apparently, was not just to strip Lofft from the
          paratext, but also to chart what he had done to the text. As a result, Lofft’s words no longer prepared the reader to encounter the boyish
          rustic poet: that poet appeared as an intelligent, straightforward man speaking to men (he had by then read Wordsworth’s preface to that
          relatively poorly-selling collection of rural poems, <title>Lyrical Ballads</title>). </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The tussle was not over: in the ninth edition (1806) Lofft reasserted himself, adding notes indicating his displeasure at
          the omission of his words from the eighth and again delivering his political opinions. After an earlier remark regretting the restriction of
          newspapers and popular print was dropped, Lofft now added ‘I spoke in the former Editions of the effect of <hi rend="ital">Newspapers</hi>,
          and other means of popular Information; and I now say, I have no doubt that the opportunity of reading them contributed much to form the
          mind of the Author of the <hi rend="ital">Farmer’s Boy</hi>. Genius profits greatly by small daily aids and excitements. A wise and good
          Government will render those aids as free and as generally accessible as it can. From such sparks not only the spirit of the former <hi rend="ital">Poet</hi>, but of the Artist in various branches, of the future sailor and soldier is awakened’. He also added a new note
          endorsing debating societies, after his former one was excised, and occasional snide comments such as ‘Mr. Bloomfield having omitted in the
          eighth Edition what I had said in the seventh, of the satisfaction I had in 1800 in being made personally acquainted with him here at <hi rend="ital">Troston</hi>, I shall not restore it against his will’. Thus the struggle for supervision of Bloomfield’s verse and biography,
          and, still more, the resentment of poet and publisher by patron, was made apparent to all readers. Lofft’s remarks remained in later
          lifetime stand-alone editions of the poem (1808, 1810, 1811, 1815, 1820): he had, it might seem, the last (and first) word.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Not so: in 1809 the <title>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</title> was published – a collection of all the poet’s major
          publications to that date. Produced by the new stereotype method, so that it could be reissued again and again without the need to set up
          new type, this collected edition was supervised by Bloomfield himself, and featured a <hi rend="ital">Farmer’s Boy</hi> from which Lofft’s
          voice was largely excised. For the first time, Lofft’s 1799 alterations of the verse were largely removed in favour of what Bloomfield had
          written in the original MS. Poem as well as preface was now in Bloomfield’s words, and these words were plainer and more colloquial than
          anything previously published in his name. For example, in the first edition the phrase about mud, ‘Till dirt usurp the empire of his
          shoes’, became ‘dirt adhesive loads his clouted shoes’ (<hi rend="ital">Spring</hi> 82)—’clouted’ smacking of Suffolk rustic speech. The
          ‘shepherd idling’ became the ‘idling shepherd’ (<hi rend="ital">Spring</hi> 281)—the poetic inversion gone. The phrase about the sheep
          longing for familiar fields, ‘Instinctively they haunt the homeward gate’ was changed to ‘Bleating around the homeward gate they meet’ (<hi rend="ital">Spring</hi> 297). Since the stereotype edition was reissued in 1814, 1817 and 1821 there were effectively two competing

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The extra payment of £100 for the first six editions, Bloomfield regarded as generous. But the profits were large.
          Bloomfield told his brother on 30 November 1801 that ‘The 5th and 6th edition of Giles comprize together 10,000 copies, the new work
            [<title>Rural Tales</title>] 7,000, so that I have at any rate to share the profits of 17,000 books, for which (at full price) the
          publick, if they are goodnaturd enough to buy them, will pay no less than £36,025!’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.70.html">Letter 70</ref>). The ninth edition, printed by
          William Wilson (as were the tenth and eleventh) was of 4000 copies. This brought the total printed to 26100. This success was important to
          Vernor and Hood, but they nonetheless faced increasing financial difficulties and from the sixth edition of 1802 divided their half share of
          the profits equally with <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LongmanThomasN">Longman</ref>, Hurst, Rees, and Orme (this arrangement was still
          in operation for the twelfth edition of 1811). In 1812, after Hood’s death, the firm failed and the surviving partner, <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SharpeC">C. Sharpe</ref>, sold off his share in the poem to <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#CrosbyBenjamin">B.
            Crosby</ref> and Co, and unloaded 4500 unsold copies of Bloomfield’s publications at a discount (thus reducing the value of Bloomfield’s
          half-share of the profits and making the volumes inaccessible to him). The bankruptcy, and Sharpe’s death soon afterwards, meant that
          Bloomfield, as one of many creditors, received only 4s 6d for each pound of the £372, 12s and 4d owed him in royalties (23%: and this to be
          staggered into four payments stretching from 1813 to 1816). He took legal advice from Lofft and from the eminent Whig lawyer Samuel Romilly
          and discovered that copyright for the poem would revert to him, if living, fourteen years after first publication. He hoped that this would
          be worth ‘not less than £2000’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.273.html">Letter
          273</ref>). The reversion occurred in March 1814, and he then sold to London publishers a half share in the copyright for the next fourteen
          years, though obtaining only ‘about half the sum which I suppose their chance is worth’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.294.html">Letter 294</ref>). The publishers’ half share was
          in turn divided, so that the risk was spread across several firms. Thus in 1815 the thirteenth edition, printed by Samuel Hamilton in
          Weybridge, was published by a group of booksellers in which Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown took the lead. Both for these editions and
          for the 1814, 1820 and 1821 stereotype editions of the <title>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</title> Bloomfield kept a half share in the
          profits; a quarter was held by Longmans, while the remaining quarter was divided between several booksellers (Crosby was named among them
          for the 1814 <title>Poems</title> only—and went bankrupt in that year of recession in the book trade). Of these <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BaldwinRobert">Baldwin</ref>, Cradock and Joy took responsibility for printing, distribution and payment of royalties
          (see <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.310.html">Letter 310</ref> and <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.350.html">Letter 350</ref>). They printed 2000 copies of the
          fourteenth edition of <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> (1820) and 2000 of the 1821 <title>Poems</title>.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The poem was popular enough for editions to be published beyond the reach of British copyright law. There were two editions
          in New York, and others in Philadelphia and Leipzig, in 1801; in 1802 an edition was published in Dublin; in 1803 editions appeared in New
          York, Dublin and Baltimore; further editions came out in Paris in 1804; and in Albany, N.Y., in 1814. After copyright expired in 1828, the
          poem, either alone or combined with editions of other out-of-copyright works by Bloomfield, was frequently published, throughout the
          nineteenth century. B. C. Bloomfield reveals that ‘The firm of Milner, for instance, under its various names and in its various series, sold
          65,550 copies of Bloomfield between 1835 and 1895, and he was fifth in popularity, as measured by sales, during that period. The figures
          are:</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">This Edition</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This edition is the first ever to collate all the lifetime editions of the poem. It also collates the manuscript that
          Bloomfield wrote out from memory in 1801 (Houghton Library Eng fMS 776.1) in an effort to recreate the original manuscript that in 1798 he
          had sent to George Bloomfield, who had passed it to Lofft who emended it and sent it to Thomas Hill and thence to press (now Houghton
          Library Eng fMS 776). The press set up type from this original manuscript, and it was then kept by Hill and not returned to Bloomfield, who
          was thus left without a manuscript of his own poem—hence the need to write out a new one from memory, one free of Lofft’s emendations that
          had made their way into the first published edition (1800). Bloomfield explained his reasons for creating a new manuscript in a letter of 30
          November 1801 (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.70.html">Letter 70</ref>): ‘I am writing a
          fair copy of the Farmer’s Boy exactly as you saw it in MS., and marking the alterations made by Mr Lofft; and adding notes of information,
          &amp;c., this I do that as I have not the original, something in <hi rend="ital">my own hand</hi> may be found hereafter, and I do it
          too to improve my handwriting: I shall have it bound carefully’. By collating this manuscript (fMS 776.1) and all the lifetime editions, and
          displaying variants, it is for the first time possible to trace the many alterations made to the poem and its paratext as a result of the
          growing tensions between Bloomfield, Lofft and the publishers Vernor and Hood. We display, in effect, the history of <title>The Farmer’s
            Boy</title> as a battleground between parties seeking success and authority with an expanded literary public shaped by a commercial book
          market.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">While our copytext is the 1800 first edition, on the grounds it was this that gave the poem its major public impact, it is
          possible to trace the Lofftian emendations that the 1800 edition made to the original manuscript by examining the variants. Lofft’s
          additional remarks in successive editions of the Preface and Appendix, and in notes, are now traceable; so are the prunings of these remarks
          in the eighth edition, and Lofft’s responses to these prunings in the ninth and subsequent editions. The text and paratext as brought under
          Bloomfield’s control, with much of Lofft’s input excised, in the 1809, 1814, 1817 and 1821 stereotype <title>Poems of Robert
            Bloomfield</title> is also recorded in variants. </p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The Houghton Library, Harvard University, holds two manuscripts of the poem. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">fMS Eng 776 is the manuscript sent by Bloomfield to George, and taken by George to Lofft, in 1798. It was then transmitted
          to Thomas Hill, who kept it after its use by the printer. A fair copy of the whole poem, it contains emendations in pen and pencil
          identified by Bloomfield as the work of Lofft. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">MS Eng 776.1 is from 1801. It has no line-numbers, and is of white, laid paper, of higher quality than fMS Eng 776,
          measuring 31 x 19cm. It begins with an explanation: </p>
               <quote>City Road, London. Octr 8th 1801. The Original Manuscript of my ‘Farmer’s Boy’ is not likely ever to be in my possession again; it
          being left, by Mr Lofft’s desire, in the hands of T Hill Esq. of Henrietta Street Covent Garden; where it now remains; except about two
          hundred and Sixty lines of the commencement of the Poem which are lost. Wishing to possess a Manuscript like the Original, I meen that the
          right hand page of this Book shall contain a genuine Copy of the Poem As I wrote it at first; and that the left hand page shall shew the
          amendments and alterations introduced by Mr Lofft. This I can do now while my memory retains the deviations; but, some years hence, I may
          not be able, and may then wish that I had done it when it was in my power. Robert Bloomfield</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Lofft’s verbal emendations of the original, 1798, manuscript are entered on the verso, together with several notes, and
          Bloomfield’s reconstitution from memory of the original manuscript is written out on the recto.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Hitherto the biographical narrative, as given originally by my brother, in letters to my good friend <ref type="m"
                          target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Mr. Lofft</ref>, has gone undisturbed.
            Though I have often doubted the accuracy of the dates, the facts themselves remain unimpeachable. I had, indeed, convinced my brother,
            that he inadvertently mis-stated my age, on coming to London; and, by my wish, the reader was told, in the preface to the former editions,
            that my juvenile pieces, there referred to, and of which fragments are given, were written in the year 1784. As I certainly transgressed
            in rhyme from the age of fifteen years and a half until twenty, writing pieces of various descriptions, the doubt on my mind was, whether
            my brother, who saw them all, could tell, any more than myself, on being questioned fourteen years after the time, at what particular date
            the pieces were actually written or published, which he had mentioned to Mr. Lofft; for I well remember, more than once, to have received
            the sentence of, ‘R. B. is inadmissible.’</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">To satisfy my curiosity, and arrive at the truth, I
            have examined the files of old newspapers, as they are preserved at Peel’s Coffee-house, Fleet-street; beginning with 1784; at which time,
            in my seventeenth year, I supposed them to have been written. My trouble was repaid, by finding the objects of my search under the date of
            1786. Whatever merit or puerility may be found in the pieces I have thus unexpectedly regained, and which I had endeavoured to recollect,
            they appear to have been written, or at least published, between the ages of nineteen and twenty; and, consequently, any reader of taste
            will believe, on perusing them, that they are here given to the world, more from the love of truth than the love of praise; and will, at
            the same time, observe, that the copy of ‘A Village Girl,’ as given from memory by <ref type="m"
                          target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">my brother</ref>, was not quite
            correct.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I lay down all reputed juvenile excellence with infinite satisfaction; and, though some
            may blame this kind of self exposure, I can make up the account to my own conscience, and am determined to believe, that, whatever
            different opinions may be entertained as to the nature and proper limits of biography, to rectify mistakes is to do right; and to tell
            truth, the first duty of us all.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">If it should be asked, why I did not make the search before the
            publication of the ‘Farmer’s Boy’ I answer, that I did well to trust to the kind hand which was about to lift me from obscurity and
            distress; that I had then no doubt of the accuracy of the dates, nor the least knowledge that such newspapers were any where in existence;
            and, lastly, I had not then a Coffee-house coat to my back, to carry me through the enquiry.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">There will be found in these little pieces, obscurities and bad grammar, they are exact copies from the papers, and as I wrote them;
            except in the instances marked at the foot of each piece, the editors of the papers not thinking it worth their while to correct them. The
            reader will recognise in them the ‘provincial usage’ mentioned by Mr. Lofft, at page xvi. of the following preface.</p>

            to Mr. Lofft. But, in the 4th stanza, the original word had escaped all recollection, until this unexpected sight of the piece, and of its
            connection, so that if ‘hardships’ be read for ‘ought,’ all the meaning I had will be seen. I perfectly remember feeling rather indignant,

        true sense of the natural and pathetic, force of thought, and liveliness of imagination, which were in common between Thomson and this Author.
        And these are qualities which whoever has the eye, the heart, the awakened and surrounding intellect, and the diviner sense of the Poet; which

        are so widely diverse in the two Authors, could make it different. Simplicity, sweetness, a natural tenderness, that <title>molle atque

        beautiful and simply expressive Song. But he imagined that some thought of this kind was in the mind of the Author: and he was willing to
        endeavour to express it. The Breast which has felt Love, justly shrinks from the idea of its total extinction, as from annihilation itself.
        And there is even an high social and moral use in that order of Providence which exalts Sensations into tender and benign Passions; those
        Passions into habitual Affections yet more tender; and raises from those Affections <hi rend="ital">Virtues</hi> the most permanent, the most

        He had many Books,…and some which he did not value: such as the <hi rend="smcaps">Seasons, Paradise Lost</hi>, and some <hi rend="ital">Novels.</hi> These Books he lent to <hi rend="smcaps">Robert</hi>; who spent all his leisure hours in reading the <hi rend="ital">Seasons</hi>, which he was now capable of reading.

        of <hi rend="ital">Cheapside</hi>, took an active part against the lawful journeymen; and even went so far as to pay off every man that worked
        for him that had joined their Clubs. This so exasperated the men, that their acting Committee soon looked for <hi rend="ital">unlawful

            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">They found out little <hi rend="ital">Robert</hi>, and threatened to prosecute <hi rend="ital">Chamberlayne</hi> for employing him, and to prosecute his Brother, Mr. <hi rend="ital">G. Bloomfield</hi>, for teaching him. Chamberlayne
        requested of the Brother to go on and bring it to a Trial; for that he would defend it; and that neither <hi rend="ital">George</hi> nor <hi rend="ital">Robert</hi> should be hurt.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In the mean time <hi rend="ital">George</hi> was much insulted for having refus’d to join upon this

        famed for patience, (it is not indeed so much as might be sometimes wish’d, very often the lot of strong and acute minds to possess largely of
        this virtue,) took his pen, and addressed a Letter to one of the most active of their Committee-men (a man of very bad character). In this,
        after stating that he took <hi rend="ital">Robert</hi> at his Mother’s request, he made free as well with the private character of this man as
        with the views of the Committee. ‘This,’ says <hi rend="ital">George</hi>, ‘was very foolish; for it made things worse: but I felt too much to

        appear’d in <hi rend="ital">March</hi> last, I intimated a design of accompanying it with some <hi rend="smcaps">Critical Remarks</hi>. With
        that design various Engagements have since greatly interfer’d. From one of the most laborious and constant of those, that of the office of a
        Justice of the Peace for the County of Suffolk, I am now discharg’d. Why those who are in power have done this, they have not explain’d: and
        it being an office from which any one who holds it is removable at <hi rend="ital">pleasure</hi>, they are not call’d to explain. Had it been
        for Crime or Misconduct as a Magistrate, of course Trial and Conviction should have preceded my Removal. As it is, I feel, as I have publicly
        declar’d, no shame in the removal. I have held an office honorable because extensively useful; because unprofitable and burthensome to the
        individual; because independently and conscientiously exercis’d, with a devotion, such as it requir’d, of my time, my thoughts, and my best
        faculties, daily to its discharge. My Colleagues,—and they are and have been, during a course of seventeen years, those of them who now act,
        and those who are dead or absent, men with whom to have acted was indeed satisfactory and pleasant,—my late Colleagues part with me, and I
        with them regrettingly. Our reciprocal Esteem is not lessen’d by this abruption of our official intercourse. And as every man who feels what
        Society is, ought to determine to be serviceable to the Public, my removal from this office neither weakens the determination, nor probably
        will be found to have impair’d the means of effecting it. I am therefore well content;—as I ought to be. I sought not the office. I have never
        sought any. It solicited my acceptance; unask’d and unexpected. I owe my appointment to the <ref type="m"
                    target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Duke of <hi rend="smcaps">Grafton</hi>
               </ref>, very soon after I came to reside in this County. He was then <hi rend="ital">Lord Lieutenant</hi>. I have not yielded
        that appointment to disgust; though there were those who were not sparing in their endeavours to disgust me with it: I have not relinquish’d
        it to suit my convenience; though in times like these an office of no little expence, and which shut me out from sources of professional
        emolument, was to me certainly not convenient: I have not consulted my ease or health by a voluntary retirement. I am remov’d, I am
        superseded, I am struck out from an office of incredible and hourly increasing anxiety. Circumstances like this are not new. They have
        repeatedly taken place in relation to very high offices; and the Public remembers men to whom they have happen’d whose internal dignity and
        worth is above any official dignity. Had I felt that I <hi rend="ital">merited</hi> to be remov’d, I should not have thought myself a fit
        Editor of the <hi rend="smcaps">Farmer’s Boy</hi>; a Poem which breathes every where modest independence, benevolence, innocence, and virtue.
        As it is, I think myself no way less fit than ever for any laudable and becoming employ. And I have accordingly announc’d my intention of
        resuming my profession as a <hi rend="smcaps">Barrister</hi>.<note n="66" place="foot" resp="editors"> [5th, 6th, and 7th edns add note:]

          remark, that whatever <hi rend="ital">political </hi>Sentiments or <hi rend="ital">personal </hi>Feelings I have exprest, either in the <hi rend="smcaps">Preface</hi> or the <hi rend="smcaps">Appendix</hi>, I trust they have not occupied a disproportion’d Space; nor have been
          unsuitable either to the place in which they are introduced, or to the subject or the occasion. That occasion, I am convinced, is just and
          urgent: and that it is becoming of a man, and of me in particular, and consonant to the whole course of my life, to speak openly even in
          these times what I think of moment to my Country and to human Society. As to what is personal to myself, I should have passed it entirely
          here, if that also did not concern the <hi rend="smcaps">Public</hi>; and if it did not concern the <hi rend="smcaps">Farmer’s Boy</hi> on

          the sentiments or the mode of expression must, in mere justice, impute them to me alone, and in no respect as any way implicating him. He
          wishes, I believe, to decline <hi rend="ital">Politics </hi>and <hi rend="ital">Controversy </hi>altogether; and I wish no man to mix in
          either farther than he feels it to be a Duty. L.</note> In the mean time, the leisure which has thus been thrown to me may properly and

            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Mr. <hi rend="smcaps">Swan</hi> thus expresses himself:</p>

        this purpose I obtain’d his address, and found him … the modest, the unambitious person you describe; wondering at the praise and admiration
        with which his Poem has been receiv’d; whose utmost ambition was to have presented a fair copy to his aged Mother, as a pledge of filial
        affection, and a picture of his juvenile avocations. So unexpected was the fame of his production, that the whole of his good fortune appears
        to him as a dream.—“I had no more idea,” says he, “to be sent for by the Duke of Grafton, and be so kindly and generously treated, than of the

        inform’d of his manner of composition. I enquir’d, as he compos’d it in a garret, amid the bustle and noise of six or seven fellow workmen,
        whether he us’d a slate; or wrote it on paper with a pencil, or pen and ink. But what was my surprize when told that he had us’d neither.—My
        business, during the greatest part of my life having led me into the line of litterary pursuits, and made me acquainted with litterary men, I
        am, consequently, pretty well inform’d of the methods us’d by authors for the retention of their productions. We are told, if my recollection
        is just, that Milton took his Daughters as his amanuenses; that Savage, when his poverty precluded him the conveniency of pen, ink, and paper,
        us’d to study in the streets, and go into shops to record the productions of his fertile genius; that Pope, when on visits at Lord
        Bolingbroke’s, us’d to ring up the servants at any hour in the night for pen and ink, to write any thought that struck his lively and wakeful
        imagination; that Dr. Blacklock, though blind, had the happy faculty of writing down, in a very legible hand, the chaste and elegant
        productions of his Muse.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">With these and many other methods of composition we are acquainted; but that of a great part of <hi rend="ital">the Farmer’s Boy</hi> stands, in my opinion, first on the List of Litterary<note n="70" place="foot" resp="editors"> [3rd, 4th,

        pecuniary resources to purchase Paper, or from other reasons, compos’d the latter part of his <hi rend="ital">Autumn </hi>and the whole of his
          <hi rend="ital">Winter</hi> in his head, without committing one line to paper.—This cannot fail to surprize the litterary World: who are
        well acquainted with the treacherousness of memory, and how soon the most happy ideas, for want of sufficient quickness in noting down, are
        lost in the rapidity of thought.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">But this is not all.—He went still a step farther.—He not only compos’d and committed that part of the
        work to his retentive memory, but he corrected it all in his head. And, as he said, when it was thus prepar’d, … <hi rend="ital">I had nothing
          to do but to write it down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">By this new and wonderful mode of composition he studied and completed his Farmer’s Boy in a garret:

        operations of the dairy, occupy the chief part of this Season: which is clos’d by a beautiful Personification of the Spring and her
        attendants, and an admirable delineation of the sportive pleasures of the young Lambs.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <hi rend="ital">second</hi> Book, or <hi rend="ital">Summer</hi>, commences with a characteristic
        sketch of the prudent yet benevolent Farmer. The genial influence of the rain is then welcom’d; to which succeeds a most delicious picture of
        a green and woody covert with all its insect tribe. The ascension of the sky-lark, the peaceful repose of <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi>, a view
        of the ripening harvest, with some moral reflections on Nature and her great Creator, are introduced: followed by animated descriptions of
        reaping, gleaning, the honest exultation of the Farmer, the beauty of the Country Girl, and the wholesome refreshment of the field. Animals
        teazed by insects, the cruelty of docking horses, the insolence of the gander, the apathy of the swine, are drawn in a striking manner: and
        the Book concludes with masterly pictures of a twilight repose, a midnight storm of thunder and lightning, and views of the ancient and
        present mode of celebrating Harvest-home.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <hi rend="ital">third</hi> Book, <hi rend="ital">Autumn</hi>, is introduc’d with a delineation of
        forest scenery, and pigs fattening on fallen acorns. Sketches of wild ducks and their haunts, of hogs settling to repose in a wood, and of
        wheat sowing, succeed. The sound of village bells suggests a most pleasing digression: of which the church and its pastor, the rustic
        amusements of a Sunday, the Village Maids, and a most pathetic description of a distracted Female, are the prominent features. Returning to
        rural business, <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi> is drawn guarding the rising wheat from birds:—his little hut, with his preparation for the
        reception of his playmates, their treachery and his disappointment, are conceiv’d and colour’d in an exquisite style. Fox-Hunting, the
        Fox-hound’s epitaph, the long autumnal evenings, a description of domestic fowl, and a welcome to the snowy nights of Winter, form the
        concluding topics of this Season. </p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <hi rend="ital">fourth</hi> Book, under the appellation of <hi rend="ital">Winter</hi>, is usher’d in
        by some humane injunctions for the treatment of storm-pinch’d cattle. The frozen turnips are broken for them: and the cowyard at night is
        describ’d. The conviviality of a Christmas evening, and the conversation round the fire, with the admonitions from the Master’s chair, are
        depicted in a manner truly pleasing. The <hi rend="ital">Sea Boy</hi> and the <hi rend="ital">Farmer’s Boy</hi> are contrasted with much
        effect:—and the ploughman feeding his horses at night, with the comparison between the cart-horse and post-horse, have great merit. The
        mastiff turn’d sheep-biter is next delineated; succeeded by a description of a moon-light night, and the appearance of a spectre. </p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The counting of the Sheep in the fold, and the adopted Lambs, are beautiful paintings: and with the
        Triumph of <hi rend="smcaps">Giles</hi> on the conclusion of the Year, and his Address to the <hi rend="smcaps">Deity</hi>, the Book and Poem
        close. </p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Such are the Materials of which THE FARMER’S BOY is constructed. Several of the topics, it will be
        perceiv’d are new to Poetry; and of those which are in their <hi rend="ital">title</hi> familiar to the readers of our descriptive Bards, it
        will be found that the imagery and adjunctive circumstances are original, and the effort of a mind practis’d in the rare art of selecting and
        combining the most striking and picturesque features of an object.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Dr. Drake after this well accounts for the poetic singularity that the Poetry of <hi rend="ital">Thomson
        </hi>should have past through a mind so enthusiastically enamor’d of it, without impairing the originality of its character, when exercis’d on
        a subject so much leading to imitation. This he explains, and justly, by the vivid impressions on a most sensible and powerful imagination in
        his earliest youth, anterior to the study of any Poet.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Dr. <hi rend="smcaps">Drake</hi> expresses his astonishment at the <hi rend="smcaps">Versification</hi>
        and <hi rend="smcaps">Diction</hi> of this Poem. And says most truly, ‘I am well aware that smooth and flowing lines are of easy purchase, and
        the property of almost every poetaster of the day: but the versification of Mr. <hi rend="ital">Bloomfield</hi> is of another character; it
        displays beauties of the most positive kind, and those witcheries of expression which are only to be acquir’d by the united efforts of Genius
        and Study.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <hi rend="ital">general</hi> characteristics of his versification are facility and sweetness; that
        ease which is, in fact, the result of unremitted labour, and one of the most valuable acquisitions of litterature. It displays occasionally
        likewise a vigour and a brilliancy of polish that might endure comparison with the high-wrought texture of the Muse of <hi rend="smcaps">Darwin</hi>.<note n="83" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802), physician, natural philosopher and poet of <title>The

        sparing hand: and it is not one of his least merits that his diction and harmony should so admirably correspond with the scene which he has
        chosen.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">To excel,’ Dr. <hi rend="smcaps">Drake</hi> continues, ‘in rural <hi rend="smcaps">Imagery</hi> it is
        necessary that the Poet should diligently study Nature for <hi rend="ital">himself</hi>; and not peruse her as is but too common, “<hi rend="ital">through the spectacles of Books.</hi>”<note n="84" place="foot" resp="editors"> [3rd and later edns add note:] The happy

        scenery with such distinctness and truth: and on this plan, while wandering through his native fields, attentive to “<hi rend="ital">each
          rural sight, each rural sound</hi>,” has Mr. <hi rend="smcaps">Bloomfield</hi> built his charming Poem.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It is a Work which proves how inexhaustible the features of the World we inhabit: how from objects which
        the mass of mankind is daily accustom’d to pass with indifference and neglect, <hi rend="smcaps">Genius</hi> can still produce pictures the
        most fascinating, and of the most interesting tendency. For it is not to <hi rend="ital">imagery </hi>alone, though such as here depicted
        might ensure the meed of Fame, that the Farmer’s Boy will owe its value with us and with posterity. A <hi rend="ital">Morality </hi>the most
          <hi rend="ital">pathetic </hi>and pure, the feelings of a heart alive to all the tenderest duties of humanity and religion, consecrate its
        glowing landscapes, and shed an interest over them, a spirit of devotion, that calm and rational delight which the goodness and greatness of
        the Creator ought ever to inspire.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Dr. <hi rend="smcaps">Drake</hi> confirms, by copious and very judicious <hi rend="ital">Extracts
        </hi>from the various parts of the Poem, as they offer themselves to critical selection, in accompanying the Farmer’s Boy through the Circle
        of his year, the Judgment which he has form’d with so much ability, taste, and feeling, and has so agreeably express’d, of the Merits of our
          <hi rend="smcaps">English Georgic</hi>. And he speaks in his <hi rend="ital">third </hi>and last Essay on it thus:</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘From the review we have now taken of <hi rend="smcaps">The Farmer’s Boy</hi>, it will be evident, I
        think, that owing to its harmony and sweetness of versification, its benevolence of sentiment, and originality of imagery, it is entitled to
        rank very high in the class of descriptive and <hi rend="ital">pastoral </hi>Poetry.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">He concludes with an highly animated and feeling anticipation of that public attention to the Poem and to
        its Author, merited in every view, and which already has manifested itself in such an extent.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I understand there is a Paper on ‘<title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>’ in a Work lately publish’d by Dr. <hi rend="smcaps">Anderson</hi>; and assuredly from its subject well entitled to attention, as well as from the abilities and public spirit of

            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In the <title>Critical Remarks</title> I intended I find myself so much agreeing in sentiment with Dr.
        Drake that I shall attempt little more than merely to offer some few observations. One of these relates to the <hi rend="ital">coincidences</hi> of thought and manner in the Farmer’s Boy with other writings. These, as would previously be expected from what has been
        said, are extremely few indeed. And almost all that are particularly of moment in appreciating the poetical excellences of the Work are most
        truly <hi rend="ital">coincidences</hi>, and cannot be otherwise consider’d.</p>

        Preface, removing Lofft’s voice and addressing the reader in his own person, while preserving some of the biographical information from former
        editions. He also introduced new material about the circumstances of the poem’s composition and publication.]</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
               <hi rend="smcaps">Eight</hi> years have elapsed since the first publication of ‘The Farmer’s Boy.’ It now
        assumes, together with the later Poems, a new form; and my friend Mr. Lofft, to whom I am so obviously and so materially indebted for success,
        with great liberality suggests, that a general publication of the works in connection seems to require something of a general Preface adapted
        to the occasion, and coming from myself. But as all that I have written will now be comprised in two volumes, some further remarks will be
        found in my second volume respecting the Tales and Ballads. What is here said relates to the Farmer’s Boy alone. </p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The plain, candid memoir, which has hitherto preceded the Poem, as given by my Brother to Mr. Lofft, has
        interested thousands in my favour, and spared me those painful feelings which must have arisen from a perpetual recurrence of the same
        questions in all companies, and from a perplexing wish to comply with the natural curiosity of strangers. Wherever I have been introduced,
        almost without exception, my history has been previously known, even to the ‘selling of my fiddle,’ and I have immediately been permitted to
        take my seat, and to join the conversation, if I found any thing to say; or to remain silent until I did. And this is no small privilege to a
        man swung at arm’s length into publicity with all his mechanical habits and embarrassments about him. How far such habits are, or ought to be,
        overcome, is a question upon which I have not decided: but I have been sometimes hurt, or amused, at witnessing the evident disappointment of
        such persons as appeared to expect in the writer of Pastoral poetry, and literally a Cow-boy, the brilliancy and the vivacity of polished
        conversation; to which I never had made the slightest pretences.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The memoir above mentioned has not only relieved me personally in many cases, but it has been accompanied
        by remarks from Mr. Lofft as to the promiscuous gifts which God has bestowed on his creatures, without regard to worldly rank, that I am
        confident will redound to the credit of the writer, and which came to the public with a thousand times more power and effect than they could
        have done had I been capable of writing them myself.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Much as I have been benefited by this biographical memoir, and gratified as I have been to find my path
        cleared before me, it would be ungenerous to the purchasers who may obtain this new and cheaper edition, and who may have no previous
        knowledge of the Author’s childhood, wholly to omit a narrative of facts which he himself declares to be of importance, and to carry with it
        an interest both connectedly and peculiarly its own. I will therefore give the substance of that narrative in my Brother’s words, with
        occasional explanations;—and then resume my own tale.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In Nov. 1798, G. B. writing to Mr. Lofft, says: ‘As I spent near five years with the Author, from the
        time he was fourteen years and a half years old till he was turned of twenty, the most interesting time of life (I mean the time that
        instruction is acquired, if acquired at all), I think I am able to give a better account of him than any one can, or than he can of himself:
        for his modesty would not let him speak of his temper, disposition, or morals.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Robert (born Dec. 3d, 1766,) was the younger child of George Bloomfield, a tailor, at Honington.<note n="102" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] This Village is between Euston and Troston, and about eight miles N. E. of Bury.
          There are three other sons, George, Nathaniel and Isaac, and two daughters.</note> His father died when he was an infant under a year old.
        His mother, Elizabeth, the daughter of Robert Manby, was born at Brandon, 1736. She was a schoolmistress, and instructed her own children with
        the others. He thus learned to read as soon as he learned to speak.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Though the mother was left a widow with six small children, yet with the help of friends she managed to
        give each of them a little schooling.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Robert was accordingly sent to Mr. Rodwell, of Ixworth, to be improved in writing: but he did not go to
        that school more than two or three months, nor was ever sent to any other; his mother again marrying when Robert was about seven years
        old.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">By her second husband, John Glover, she had another family.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">When Robert was not above eleven years old, the late Mr. W. Austin, of Sapiston,<note n="103" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] The little village adjacent to Honington.</note> took him. And though it is customary for
        farmers to pay such boys only 1s. 6d. per week, yet he generously took him into the house. This relieved his mother of any other expense than
        only of finding him a few things to wear: and this was more than she well knew how to do.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">She wrote therefore to me and my brother Nat (then in London), to assist her; mentioning that Robert was
        so small of his age that Mr. Austin said he was not likely to be able to get his living by hard labour.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The following anecdote must stand in Mr. Lofft’s words, as one of those tender fabrics which it would be
        very easy to spoil, and impossible to mend.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘Mr. G. Bloomfield on this informed his mother that, if she would let him take the boy with him, he would
        take him, and teach him to make shoes: and Nat promised to clothe him. The mother, upon this offer, took coach and came to London, to Mr. G.
        Bloomfield, with the boy: for she said, she never should have been happy if she had not put him herself into his hands.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">“She charged me,” he adds, “<hi rend="ital">as I valued a mother’s blessing, to watch over him, to set
          good examples for him, and never to forget that he had lost his father</hi>”. I religiously confine myself to Mr. G. Bloomfield’s own words;
        and I think I should wrong all the parties concerned, if, in mentioning this pathetic and successful admonition, I were to use any other.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Mr. G. Bloomfield then lived at Mr. Simm’s, No. 7, Pitcher’s-court, Bell-alley, Coleman-street. “It is
        customary,” he continues, “in such houses as are let to poor people in London, to have light garrets fit for mechanics to work in. In the
        garret, where we had two turn-up beds, and five of us worked, I received little Robert.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">As we were all single men, lodgers at a shilling per week each, our beds were coarse, and all things far
        from being clean and snug, like what <hi rend="ital">Robert</hi> had left at Sapiston. <hi rend="ital">Robert</hi> was our man, to fetch all
        things to hand. At noon he fetched our dinners from the cook’s shop: and any one of our fellow workmen that wanted to have any thing fetched
        in, would send him, and assist in his work and teach him, for a recompense for his trouble.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Every day when the Boy from the Public-house came for the pewter pots, and to hear what Porter was
        wanted, he always brought the yesterday’s newspaper. The <hi rend="ital">reading</hi> of the Paper we had been used to take by turns; but
        after <hi rend="ital">Robert</hi> came, he mostly read for us,—because his time was of least value.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">He frequently met with words that he was unacquainted with: of this he often complained. I one day
        happened at a book-stall to see a small dictionary, which had been very ill used. I bought it for him for 4d. By the help of this he in little
        time could read and comprehend the long and beautiful speeches of Burke, Fox, or North.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">One Sunday, after an whole day’s stroll in the country, we by accident went into a dissenting
        meeting-house in the Old Jewry, where a gentleman was lecturing. This man filled little Robert with astonishment. The house was amazingly
        crowded with the most genteel people; and though we were forced to stand still in the aisle, and were much pressed, yet Robert always
        quickened his steps to get into the town on a Sunday evening soon enough to attend this lecture.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The Preacher’s name was Fawcet.<note n="104" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] Author of
          a justly esteem’d Poem on War. [‘A War Elegy’, published in Joseph Fawcett, <title>The Art of War, a Poem, the Second Edition, to Which Is
            Added a War Elegy </title>(London, 1799).]</note> His language was just such as the Rambler is written in; his action like a person acting
        a tragedy; his discourse rational, and free from the cant of methodism.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Of him Robert learned to accent what he called <hi rend="ital">hard</hi> words; and otherwise improved
        himself; and gain’d the most enlarged notions of Providence.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">He went sometimes with me to a debating society at Coachmaker’s-hall, but not often; and a few times to
        Covent-garden theatre. These are all the opportunities he ever had to learn from public speakers. As to Books, he had to wade through two or
        three Folios: an History of England, British Traveller, and a Geography. But he always read them as a task, or to oblige us who bought them.
        And as they came in sixpenny numbers weekly, he had about as many hours to read as other boys spend in play.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I at that time read the <title>London Magazine</title>; and in that work about two sheets were set apart
        for a Review—Robert seemed always eager to read this review. Here he could see what the literary men were doing, and learn how to judge of the
        merits of the works that come out. And I observed that he always looked at the Poet’s Corner. And one day he repeated a Song which he composed
        to an old tune. I was much surprised that he should make so smooth verses; so I persuaded him to try whether the Editor of our Paper would
        give them a place in Poet’s Corner. And he succeeded, and they were printed. And as I forget his other early productions, I shall copy
        this.</p>

            </p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">“I remember,” says Mr. G. Bloomfield, continuing his Narrative, “a little piece which he called The
        Sailor’s Return:<note n="106" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] This, by a reference to the same papers, I find was entitled
          ‘The Soldier’s Return.’ It has been printed in a former edition of this work. [The full poem was included in the ‘Advertisement’ to the 8th
          edn]</note> in which he tried to describe the feelings of an honest Tar, who, after a long absence, saw his dear native Village first rising
        into view. This too obtain’d a place in the Poet’s Corner. And as he was so young, it shews some genius in him, and some industry, to have
        acquired so much knowledge of the use of words in so little time. Indeed at this time myself and my fellow workmen in the garret began to get
        instructions from him.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">About this time there came a man to lodge at our lodgings that was troubled with fits. Robert was so much
        hurt to see this poor creature drawn into such frightful forms, and to hear his horrid screams, that I was forced to leave the lodging. We
        went to Blue Hart-court, Bell-alley. In our new garret we found a singular character, James Kay, a native of Dundee. He was a middle-aged man,
        of a good understanding, and yet a furious Calvinist. He had many books,—and some which he did not value: such as the Seasons, Paradise Lost,
        and some Novels. These books he lent to Robert; who spent all his leisure hours in reading The Seasons, which he was now capable of reading. I
        never heard him give so much praise to any book as to that.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I think it was in the year 1784 that the question came to be decided between the journeymen shoemakers;
        whether those who had learn’d without serving an apprenticeship could follow the trade?</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The man by whom Robert and I were employ’d, Mr. Chamberlayne, of Cheapside, took an active part against
        the lawful journeymen; and even went so far as to pay off every man that worked for him that had joined their clubs. This so exasperated the
        men, that their acting committee soon looked for unlawful men (as they called them) among Chamberlayne’s workmen.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">A part of the Narrative here naturally turned upon the spiteful and contentious bickerings of men who
        were all angry together; which contentions ultimately forced me from London. At this moment I feel much obliged to them. They treated me with
        a visit to my friends, and a charming holiday; which George thus describes:</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘Robert naturally fond of Peace, and fearful for my personal safety, begged to be suffered to retire from
        the storm.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">He came home; and Mr. Austin kindly bade him take his house for his home till he could return to me. And
        here, with his mind glowing with the fine descriptions of rural scenery which he found in Thomson’s Seasons, he again retraced the very fields
        where first he began to think. Here, free from smoke, the noise, the contention of the city, he imbibed that love of rural simplicity and
        rural innocence, which fitted him, in a great degree, to be the writer of such a thing as “The Farmer’s Boy”.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Here he lived two months:—at length, as the dispute in the trade still remained undecided, Mr. Dudbridge
        offered to take Robert apprentice, to secure him, at all events, from any consequences of the litigation.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The indentures were avowedly for the above purpose only; and, after detailing the transaction, George
        proceeds thus: </p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘When I left London he was turned of twenty and much of my happiness since has arisen from a constant
        correspondence which I have held with him.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">After I left him, he studied music, and was a good player on the violin.<note n="107" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] This statement is rather too strongly worded; ‘a good player’ means a great deal, and probably more
          than the writer meant to express. The reader may qualify it with what he pleases.</note>
            </p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">But as my brother Nat had married a Woolwich woman, it happened that Robert took a fancy to Mary-Anne
        Church, a young woman of that town, whose father is a boat-builder in the Government yard there. He married 12th Dec. 1790.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Soon after he married, Robert told me, in a letter, that ‘he had sold his fiddle and got a wife.’ Like
        most poor men, he got a wife first, and had to get household stuff afterward. It took him some time to get out of ready-furnished lodgings. At
        length, by hard working, &amp;c he acquired a bed of his own, and hired the room up one pair of stairs at 14, Bell-alley, Coleman-street. The
        landlord kindly gave him leave to sit and work in the light garret, two pair of stairs higher.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In this garret, amid six or seven other workmen, his active mind employed itself in composing ‘The
        Farmer’s Boy.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In my correspondence I have seen several poetical effusions of his; all of them of a good moral tendency;
        but which he very likely would think do him little credit: on that account I have not preserved them.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Robert is a lady’s shoemaker, and works for Mr. Davies, Lombard-street. He is of a slender make; of about
        five feet four inches high; very dark complexion. His mother, who is a very religious member of the church of England, took all the pains she
        could in his infancy to make him pious: and, as his reason expanded, his love of God and man increased with it. I never knew his fellow for
        mildness of temper and goodness of disposition. And since I left him, universally is he praised by those who know him best, for the best of
        husbands, an indulgent father, and quiet neighbour. He is about thirty-two years old, and has three children’<note n="108" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] Now five; Hannah, born 25 Oct. 1791. Mary-Anne, 6 Sept. 1793, Charles, 15 Sept. 1798. Charlotte, 20

            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The following conclusion of George’s original Narrative I always thought peculiarly happy; and well might
        Mr. Lofft join with him cordially in his prayer, ‘that <hi rend="smcaps">God</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the Giver of thought</hi>, may, as mental

            </lg>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Further information was given soon after by my Brother in the following Letter to Mr. Lofft, and in the
        anecdote which closes this part of the history:</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘The late Mr. Austin’s wife was a Manby (my mother’s sister). And it may seem strange that, in “The
        Farmer’s Boy,” <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi> no where calls him Uncle, but Master. The treatment that my brother Robert experienced from Mr.
        Austin did not differ in any respect from the treatment that all the servant boys experienced who lived with him. Mr. Austin was the father of
        fourteen children by my aunt (he never had any other wife). He left a decent provision for the five children that survived him: so that it
        could not be expected he should have any thing to give to poor relations. And I don’t see a possibility of making a difference between <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi> and the boys that were not related to Mr. Austin: or he treated all his servants exactly as he did his sons. They all
        worked hard; all lived well. The Duke had not a better man tenant to him than the late Mr. Austin. I saw numbers of the husbandmen in tears
        when he was buried. He was beloved by all who knew him. But I imagine that Robert thought that when he was speaking of Benevolence that was
        universal, he had no occasion to mention the accidental circumstance of his being related to the good man of whom he sung.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">_______</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘I have him in my mind’s eye a little boy; not bigger than boys generally are at twelve years old. When I
        met him and his mother at the inn, he strutted before us, dressed just as he came from keeping sheep, hogs, &amp;c. his shoes filled full of
        stumps in the heels. He looking about him, slipped up—his nails were unused to a flat pavement. I remember viewing him as he scampered up: how
        small he was. Little thought, that little, fatherless boy would be one day known and esteemed by the most learned, the most respected, the
        wisest, and the best men of the kingdom.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">________</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Amongst the anecdotes interspersed in the foregoing Narrative, distinguished for ingenuousness and
        feeling, that which the reader has just seen, if worth correcting in a slight particular, may be done here; and I would not do it but that I
        find the fact, trifling as it may appear to some, has been repeatedly noticed. George states that he received his brother in London, ‘dressed
        just as he came from keeping sheep, hogs, &amp;c.’ Now the strict truth of the case is this; that I came (on the 29th of June, 1781) in my
        Sunday clothes, such as they were; for I well remember the palpitation of my heart on receiving his proposals to come to town, and how
        incessantly I thought of the change I was going to experience: remember well selling my smock frock for a shilling, and slyly washing my best
        hat in the horsepond, to give it a gloss fit to appear in the meridian of London. On entering Whitechapel, riding backwards on the coach, a
        long line of carriages in the centre of the street attracted my particular notice; and I anxiously looked for the principal object in that
        procession of which I conceived them to be a part: little dreaming that they all stood for hire! But these are surely trifling anecdotes; and
        I will endeavour to record something more important.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Taking it then for granted, that my history, so far as it has been stated, is fully and sufficiently
        known, I mean to elucidate a fact or two to which an allusion has been made in the former Preface, so as to throw an additional light on
        subjects which I am persuaded will not be deemed uninteresting by the lovers of literature.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It cannot be forgotten by any one who has thought of my history and success, that Mr. Lofft has said,
        when speaking of the MS. of this Poem, that ‘it had before been shown to some persons in London; whose indifference toward it may probably he
        explained, when it is considered that it came to their hands under no circumstances of adventitious recommendation. With some a person must be
        rich, or titled, or fashionable as a literary name, or at least fashionable in some respect, good or bad, before any thing which he can offer
        will be thought worthy of notice’.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Nothing surely can so effectually illustrate this fact as a plain account of my unsuccessful attempts in
        publicly stating which, on such an occasion as this, I see not the smallest impropriety; as it may teach men in my own station of life not to
        despair, if they feel themselves morally and intellectually worthy of notice; and at the same time teach them not to <hi rend="ital">rely</hi>
        on an untried and brittle support, by throwing away the honourable staff of mechanic independence.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The following papers, which I now transcribe from originals, and copies in my possession, accompanied the
        MS. of ‘The Farmer’s Boy’ to my brother George, at St. Edmund’s Bury, to whom they are addressed. I have endeavoured to arrange them so as to
        make the story as simple and as straight forward as possible.</p>

               <hi rend="smcaps">Dear George</hi>,</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I gave you a hint long ago that I was making rhymes.<note n="109" place="foot" resp="editors">
          [Bloomfield’s note:] The parts of the poem first composed, before any thought was entertained of going through with the Seasons, were the
          morning scene in Spring, beginning ‘This task had <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi>,’ and the description of the lambs at play. And if it be lawful
          for an author to tell his opinion, they have never lost an inch of ground in my estimation from that day to this.</note> I now send the
        Poem, as a present to my Mother. It coming through your hands, you will be at liberty to detain it as long as you please; and I have no doubt
        but some parts of it will please you. I would wish you to observe well the following remarks, and I wish you to be candid if it should ever
        draw any remarks from you.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">When I began it, I thought to myself that I could complete it in a twelvemonth, allowing myself three
        months for each quarter; but I soon found that I could not; and indeed I made it longer than I at first intended. Nine tenths of it were put
        together as I sat at work, where there are usually six of us. No one in the house has any knowledge of what I have employed my thoughts about
        when I did not talk.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I chose to do it in rhime for this reason; because I found always that when I put two or three lines
        together in blank verse, or something that sounded like it, it was ten to one if it stood right when it came to be written down. Winter and
        half of Autumn were done long before I could find leisure to write them. In the ‘Harvest Home’ you will find the essence of letters which you
        wrote formerly to London.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">When I had nearly done it, it came strongly into my mind that very silly things are sometimes printed;
        but by what means I knew not. To try to get at this knowledge, I resolved to make some efforts of that sort; and what encouraged me to go
        through with it was, that, if I got laughed at, no one that I cared for could know it, unless I myself told them. I sometimes thought of
        venturing it into the house of some person above a bookseller; but I never could find impudence enough to do it. So I carried it, accompanied
        with the following letter, to your magazine man. He kept it eight or ten days, and then sent a sober-looking, book faced man back with it,
        sending therewith the little note which follows the letter.</p>

        journeyman shoemaker, I have amused and exercised my mind, I hope innocently, in putting the little events of my boyage into metre; intending
        it as a present to an aged Mother, now living on the spot; to whom the Church, the Mad Girl, the Farm-house, and all the local circumstances
        of the piece, are intimately known. Before I send it away, something persuades me that I might possibly find some person capable, and
        possessing condescension enough to satisfy me in a desire I feel of knowing whether the little piece, particularly the latter half, Autumn and
        Winter, contains any thing like poetical merit; that is to say, to what excellence in others it makes the nearest approaches. I am fully
        sensible, from my situation in the world, from the nature of this application, and from the better employment of your time, Sir, that silent
        neglect is what I have most reason to look for. But in that case 1 am determined to rely on your justice so far as to let the copy be returned
        to me when I call for it, which I mean to do this day fortnight; when, if I should find a word of opinion inserted in the blank leaves, my end
        would be answered, and it shall always be held in grateful remembrance by one who, with the strictest truth, and with all possible deference

        fortunate enough to gain an hour of your leisure, you can then judge whether it is in itself worthy of publication; or, what is perhaps more
        to the point, whether there is any probability of its repaying you, Sir, or myself, the expense of publication. What that expense would be I
        know not; therefore can form no judgment by myself without further information. All I can say is, that I could wish to see it printed, if it
        were possible to have it done. If I hear nothing on these heads, shall conclude that the little piece is unworthy your notice, and shall take

            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I had now to find somebody who <hi rend="ital">did </hi>print poetry. I accordingly left it with Mr.
        *******, and with it a copy of the letter I had written to Mr. ******* (No. 3.) He kept it so long that I had to call several times before I
        could get it. At last I went when he was in the way. The shopman, knowing my errand, went into the compting-house, and presently came out with
        my book in his hand, and asked me to step that way (to the back of the shop). I hesitated—but I had gone too far to retreat. I went and took
        it, and was told to go into the compting-house. When I went in, Mr. ******* spoke thus, as nearly as I can recollect:—‘Your poetry, Mr.
        Bloomfield, I am afraid, won’t do for separate publication; unless you can get some person to revise it for you. As you wish to see it
        printed, I think you had better take it to some person who publishes a magazine. I think your wisest way would be to take it to Mr. ******;
        and I have no doubt but he will insert it for you,’ &amp;c.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I left him: and, as I should not like to buy my own rhimes, I did not take his advice. I could wish to
        say more on this subject, but the parcel is waiting for my budget. Pray remember this:—don’t give the book to my Mother, nor to any one else,
        till you hear from me again. </p>

               <hi rend="smcaps">Dear George</hi>,</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I Finished my last rather abruptly for want of time.—If I had given my little piece to Mr. *******, even
        supposing that he would have accepted it, it would then have taken perhaps six months at least, by monthly continuations, before it would all
        have been printed. My chief pride would have been to have sent my Mother <hi rend="ital">a printed copy</hi>; but, at the above rate, one copy
        only would have cost six shillings: I therefore send it as it is. I never wrote it out but once. I have no copy of it, except in my memory.
        You will find the copies of my letters to the parties miserably blotted, they were written in haste: I meant to have transcribed them, but had
        not time.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Having never been instructed in grammar, it may abound in faults of that kind which I am not aware of.
        The management of stops I don’t pretend to. I desired you not to show it for this reason; because I think it would look awkward to give it
        even to my Mother without some kind of introductory letter.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">You will perceive that the information I principally wanted to gain, I could not gain; that is, how to go
        about printing such a thing, and what it would cost. But as I could not send my Mother <hi rend="ital">a printed copy</hi>, I don’t trouble
        myself much to know whether it was want of merit, or want of patronage, that made me fail.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">You say you find pleasure in reading it; perhaps it arises principally from this: you know all the
        situations, circumstances, and persons introduced into it. I wish that pleasure may continue to you, and such of our friends as may happen to
        get hold of it.—All well.</p>

            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Such were the efforts which I found courage enough to make; and here <hi rend="ital">my</hi> efforts
        ended. Not so with my Brother. With the foregoing information in his hands, he asked me by letter whether I had any objection to his showing
        the Poem to his neighbour Mr. Lofft, whom I had never seen, nor of whose readiness to assist the poor or the ignorant had an equal knowledge
        with my Brother, who lived on the spot. I left it to him to do as he proposed, and not to miss so fair a chance of getting a sound critical
        opinion, and that accompanied with feeling and good manners. George immediately carried the Poem to Troston, with the following paper, which I
        now copy from his own hand-writing.</p>

            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Common fame speaks of the willingness that you show in giving your counsel and advice to the poor. This
        benevolent trait in your character has emboldened me to approach you, to petition you to give your opinion on the enclosed piece. I fancy I
        see beauties in it, and was thinking of applying to one of our printers to know, if, from the locality of it, it would pay for printing (for
        ’tis a Suffolk piece); but it struck my mind forcibly, that I should stand a better chance of meeting with that ingenuousness I wish for, by
        begging the opinion of a man of genius and taste, than by applying to a tradesman.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Since I have had the Poem in my hands I have never shown it to any one, nor spoke of it; nor does any one
        here know of this application.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">If, Sir, you will deign to give your opinion, I will never mention your name, unless by your permission.
        This, I hope, will not be deemed an impertinent intrusion; for ’tis the high rank you hold in the literary world prompted me to this, because
        on your judgment I can rely with satisfaction.</p>

            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The consequences which arose from this application are too well known to be repeated; yet there were
        circumstances attending the progress of the Poem through the press which are not known, but might be made known with honour to all the parties
        concerned.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The first letter I received from Mr. Lofft was to me a cordial not to be described. In others which
        immediately followed I found the ensuing remarks:</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘At the same time the example, as well as the Poem, may teach the rich, and the highly born or educated,
        not unnaturally to urge harsh and overbearing lines of distinction; but to be more attentive to the gifts bestowed by the common Father on
        mankind, than to an overweening conceit of their own privileges and advantages.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Their privileges and advantages would amply gain in good will and security, what they might thus
        sacrifice from the cold and degrading claims of unfeeling ostentation.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In another letter I read:—</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘It is truly a rural Poem, more so than any with which I am acquainted in our language; except Allan
        Ramsay’s Gentle Shepherd,<note n="110" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Allan Ramsay (1686–1758), the Scots poet who inspired both Burns and
          Bloomfield. <title>The Gentle Shepherd </title>(1725) was a pastoral drama.]</note> and <ref type="m"
                    target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BurnsRobert">Burns’</ref> Poems.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The first extract the reader will perceive to be of a nature highly grateful to the feelings of the
        mechanic who had been setting his mind to work as well as his hands; but with the second I felt otherwise; and I remember the feeling with the
        utmost precision. I had been charmed with Ramsey, but knew nothing of Burns, except by trifling quotations and by name.<note n="111" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] It may possibly be acceptable to some readers to know that I had been married six years,
          when, (after weathering the storm of domestic sickness described in the ‘<ref target="editions.2019.bloomfield_poems.21WildFlowersPt3.html#oaktable">Address to my Old Table</ref>’, in Vol. II.,) I began composing this
          Poem, which I find, by comparing dates, happened to be during the last illness of Robert Burns, and about three months before his death. If
          it should be suspected that I mention this with a view of strengthening an apparent approximation to so illustrious an example of intellect
          and poetic excellence, the reader will do a great injustice to me, and to the notions I entertain of his powers, and of his works.</note> I
        believed that my generous, and then only patron, had, in the warmth of his heart, overrated my performance; and I was even then prepared, for
        disappointment.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The printing was now going on, and that I knew little of its progress (which was the case) I have only to
        blame myself. I seldom called to enquire after it. I knew it to be in good hands. Yet, during the fifteen months which elapsed before its
        publication, the latter part of which time was attended by very bad health, I felt much anxiety; and, (having the Poem then perfect in my
        memory,) after a hard day’s work, with my back to the fire, and in the stillness of the night, I have often repeated aloud the whole, or
        greater part of the Poem, until my wife was fast asleep, before I could find resolution to put out the candle. The reader who disdains such
        little anecdotes had better lay down the book; for I shall proceed in my own way.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">At length, in March 1800, my brother Nathaniel (with whom I wish the world was better acquainted) called
        to say that he had seen, in a shop window, a book called The Farmer’s Boy, with a motto. I told him I supposed it must be mine; but I know
        nothing of the motto: and I the more believed it to be mine, having just received through the hands of Mr. Lofft a request to wait on the Duke
        of Grafton, in Piccadilly. I had a very slight personal remembrance of the Duke from my childhood; and I felt as most men would feel in my
        circumstances on a similar occasion.<note n="112" place="foot" resp="editors"> Presumably, Bloomfield has in mind the childhood incident in
          which he went squirrel hunting on the Duke’s land. See <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.349a.html">Letter 349a</ref>.</note> I met with condescension
        in its noblest features, and even with congratulations; and amongst the conversation was very naturally asked, ‘How I liked the execution of
        the work? Was it not beautifully printed?’&amp;c. I replied, that I had not yet seen it. The Duke himself then brought from the library one of
        the large paper copies, and spread it on the table. <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi> never was so hard put to it in his life to keep his face in
        order as at that moment. At that moment the Preface was <hi rend="ital">as new to me as the Poem was to the world</hi>. I could not read it
        there; but on my return home I saw the high praise which my Brother had given me, and which had been so advantageously laid before the public
        by Mr. Lofft. I thanked them both for having spared me the task of telling my own story, thanked God for his providential interposition, and
        felt my heart at ease.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">And here I trust I shall not be thought guilty of any impropriety in giving, from its immediate relation
        to the foregoing interview, an extract from a book of memorandums which I keep by me;<note n="113" place="foot" resp="editors"> Not found, but
          presumably the basis for the <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/anecdotes.html">‘Anecdotes and
            Observations, Reflections, and Critical Remarks’</ref> from <title>The Remains of Robert Bloomfield</title> (1824).</note> as but a short
        time after the above date I spent a delightful month at Wakefield Lodge, in Whittlebury Forest, Northamptonshire; upon which visit I find
        recorded the following remark:</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘When I was at Wakefield Lodge I conceited that I saw the workmen and neighbours look at me as at an idle
        fellow. I had nothing to do but to read, look at them, and their country and concerns. They did not seem to know how to estimate me. I was not
        a constant companion at the Duke’s table,<note n="114" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] This was my choice; for it gave me
          the calm enjoyment of liberty in my own way. See ‘<ref target="editions.2019.bloomfield_poems.15RuralTalesPt10.html#whittlebury">Lines written on a Visit to Whittlebury Forest, addressed to my children</ref>.’ Vol. II.</note>
        nor was I much in his company; yet, seeing me noticed with attention by the family, that attention was caught, and dealt out to me at
        second-hand. I sometimes thought of the Spectator when at Sir Roger De Coverly’s, and of the <hi rend="ital">silent gentleman</hi> whom nobody
        knew much about. Six months only before that time I was in sickness and trouble; sometimes two, sometimes three days in a week racked with a
        head-ach that nearly drove me distracted. To lie down almost destitute of the necessaries of life, tortured with pain till I cried out, and
        that pain augmented by the sight of a wife and three children whom I could not help, was certainly a hard trial for my philosophy. The Poem
        became public in two months after, and my first relief was from the hand of the right worthy owner of Wakefield Lodge. What a glorious thing
        is a present of ——— to a man in distress! If hundreds should arise from my writings, I question if hundreds will produce the exquisite
        sweetness of that ———.’</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">From the above date I found, however unfit to meet prosperity, and a total change of company and
        connections, that such a change could not be avoided. I became known to the literary, and esteemed by the good. Sir Charles Bunbury, and many
        worthy characters in Suffolk, gave me the welcome of a friend and a countryman. At Troston, under the hospitable roof of Mr. Lofft, I was
        every way at home. My London and country wellwishers have increased, until to name them would wear the appearance of ostentation, which I much
        wish to avoid. And yet, while I boast in my possession the hand-writing of the late Mr. Fox, I hardly know whether I am justified in
        altogether refraining. Let not then any of them imagine that I have failed to cherish a grateful regard for the zeal and endeavours of them
        all. I write with an overflowing heart: and could I feel otherwise than I do, should unquestionably be unworthy of their attention.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Very trifling emendations have taken place in this Stereotype Edition. One, however, may seem worthy of
        notice. In the description of the Mad Girl I had originally called her <hi rend="ital">Poll</hi>; but on my visit to Suffolk, after an absence
        of twelve years (which gave rise to the Lines that follow this Preface), I learned that her name was <hi rend="ital">Ann</hi>. I conversed
        with her, and found her greatly recovered, and sensible of her past calamity. Instead of giving this information in a note, I have, partly
        from choice, and partly from the nature of the printing, inserted <hi rend="ital">Ann</hi> for <hi rend="ital">Poll</hi> in the text.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I have the gratification to <hi rend="ital">know</hi> that this Poem has given pleasure to thousands, and
        to make a contrary pretence would be something worse than affectation. Upon this conviction I rest my claim (with all due submission to the
        learned) of exhorting all persons of acknowledged taste and ability, when they receive a poor man’s production, to read it with candour, and
        to judge of it with truth: so that, if it be found entitled to a share of public attention, the unlettered and the unfriended may not lose

              his benevolence to Animals in general, will dispose him to rejoice in whatever plea can be offered in stay of execution of this

                Rookeries in that County was thought to be the occasion of it. The many Rookeries with us is in some measure the reason why we have so
                few of these destructive animals.’ [Wallis’s History of Northumberland.]</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">‘Rooks,’ he subjoins, ‘are often accus’d of feeding on the corn just after it has been sown, and various contrivances have been made
                both to kill and frighten them away; but, in our estimation, the advantages deriv’d from the destruction which they make among grubs,
                earth-worms, and noxious insects of various kinds, will greatly overpay the injury done to the future harvest by the small quantity of
                corn they may destroy in searching after their favourite food’. [Lofft further notes:] Mr. Bewick does not seem to have been quite
                aware that much of the mischief, as I have been informed by a sensible neighbouring Farmer and Tenant, is done in the grub-state of
                the chaffer by biting through the <hi rend="ital">roots </hi>of grass, &amp;c. A latent, and imperceptibly, but rapidly spreading
                mischief, against which the <hi rend="ital">rooks </hi>and birds of similar instinct are, in a manner, the sole protection. C. L.]</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">‘In general they are sagacious, active, and faithful to each other. They live in pairs; and their mutual attachment is constant. They
                are a clamorous race: mostly build in trees, and form a kind of society in which there appears something like a regular government. A
                Centinel watches for the general safety, and gives notice on the appearance of danger.’</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">Under the Title, ‘<hi rend="smcaps">Rooks</hi>,’ (p. 71) Mr. <hi rend="smcaps">Bewick</hi> repeats his observations on the useful property of this Bird.</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">I
                confess myself solicitous for their safety and kind treatment. We have two which were lam’d by being blown down in a storm (a calamity
                which destroys great numbers almost every spring). One of them is perfectly domesticated. The other is yet more remarkable; since
                although enjoying his natural liberty completely, he recognizes, even in his flights at a distance from the house, his adoptive home,
                his human friends, and early protectors.</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">The <hi rend="smcaps">Rook</hi> is certainly a very beautiful and very sensible Bird;
                very confiding, and very much attach’d. It will give me a pleasure, in which I doubt not the Author of this delightful Poem will
                partake, if any thing here said shall avail them with the Farmer; and especially with the <hi rend="smcaps">Suffolk Farmer</hi>. C.

              nations, unhappy. Absolute want occasions the miseries of the lower class in some civilized states, and is the result of the unbounded
              voluptuousness of their superiors. At <hi rend="ital">Otaheite </hi>there is not, in general, that disparity between the highest and the
              meanest man, that subsists in England between a reputable tradesman and a labourer. The affection of the Otaheitans for their chiefs,
              which they never failed to express upon all occasions, gave us great reason to suppose that they consider themselves as one family, and
              respect their eldest born in the persons of their chiefs. The lowest man in the nation speaks as freely with his king as with his equal,
              and has the pleasure of seeing him as often as he likes. The king, at times, amuses himself with the occupations of his subjects; and
              not yet depraved by false notions of empty state, he often paddles his own canoe, without considering such an employment derogatory to
              his dignity. How long such an happy equality may last is uncertain, and how much the introduction of foreign luxuries may hasten its
              dissolution cannot be too frequently repeated to Europeans. If the knowledge of a few individuals can only be acquired at such a price
              as the happiness of nations, it were better for the discoverers and the discovered that the <hi rend="ital">South Sea </hi>had still
              remained unknown to <hi rend="ital">Europe </hi>and its restless inhabitants. <hi rend="smcaps">Reflections On Otaheite</hi>, Cook’s second Voyage. [fMS Eng
              776.1 comments:] ‘In reference to this passage, and as a thought, by way of illustration, I subjoind an extract from Cook’s Voyage, not
              knowing but it was written by Cook himself, which I now find was not the case. I was quite uncertain during the 15 Months which the poem
              remaind in the hands of Mr Lofft and the publishers, whither this note would be printed or not. I was pleading for kindness between the
              ranks of society, and it seemd to suit my purpose. And if I could believe that what I said of Letting “Labour have its due” would only
              in one instance perswade a Farmer to give his men more wages, instead of giving, or suffering him to buy cheap corn in the time of
              trouble, I should feel a pleasure of the most lasting sort, having no doubt but that an extra half Crown earned is worth, morally, and
              substantially, a five Shilling Gift; to those who in the house of their fathers work for bread.’</note> the social plan</l>

              ‘It was about this spot that I made my longest rest in writing the Original MS. I had done it at various opportunities thus far, but
              wrote no more untill I had composed the remainder of Autumn, and gone through the Winter. Much has been said to me in consequence of its
              being publickly known by means of <ref type="m"
                             target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SwanJames">Mr Swan’s</ref> letter. But I must think
              that Memory is not task’d so hard in retaining what itself is giving birth to, as in taking up and retaining the Ideas or writings of
              another. The chain of connection so long ponder’d on, and so long rivetted in the mind, is the grand reservoir of Memory, and persued,
              brings the words, the musick, and all extraneous ornaments readily into the compass of the tongue. Memory, (if that is the wonder)
              certainly went much further; for the whole of the poem was, while it was printing, very perfectly at my tongue’s end. I remember
              repeating it during a walk to Rotherhithe, through Tooly Street and round by the Kent Road. At this present time I could by no means
              repeat the whole poem, though I can feel and remember where it was alter’d.’</note>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Editorial Introduction</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield composed ‘To Immagination’ in May 1800 on the evidence of the surviving manuscript and of his correspondence. He
          was in the first flush of success as a published poet and was revisiting the village in which he had spent his boyhood and in which he had
          set <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>—<ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/places.html#Honington">Honington</ref>. ‘To Immagination’ was, in this context,
          something of an oblique tribute to the poetic imagination that had conjured up a Suffolk country boyhood from the distance of London’s
          rookeries and garrets. It was his first major composition after the appearance of <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>, an ambitious piece that
          was a considerable departure in style and subject-matter—an ode in the poetic territory marked out by poets renowned for their sublimity,
          such as Mark Akenside, Edward Young, William Collins and Erasmus Darwin, whose Popean couplets and machinery it echoed. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Problems began when Bloomfield showed the manuscript to his patron <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</ref>. Lofft did not want to prevent him reaching for a so-called higher genre—the ode. As a Foxite radical, a Whig of advanced liberal
          views, Lofft regarded it as part of his duty to represent the interests of the labouring classes. He wanted to show that the common people,
          if properly encouraged, could produce as sophisticated forms of poetic expression as their social superiors. The issue was the nature of
          this encouragement: Lofft wanted both to edit Bloomfield’s verse to fit his own notions of taste and to gain the credit for having
          shepherded the prodigy into print (see Introductions to <title>The Farmer’s Boy </title>and to <title>Rural Tales</title>). Now, Lofft added
          to the needy grandstanding in which he had indulged in <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> a well-meaning but coercive rewriting of Bloomfield’s
          new manuscript. The resultant tensions are evident in Bloomfield’s letters, the first reference coming in early 1801, when Bloomfield wrote
          to his brother <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref> to say that ‘Mr. L —is deafening me with solicitations to
          print “Imagination,” which I had rejected; he has set it to rights, and certainly made it Better by adding here and there a connective line
          as he calls them; he has written out the whole piece for me, and says I shall do an injury to him, to the public, to poetry, and to myself,
          if I do not publish it, there is a sufficient volume without it and I have not yet determined.’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.48.html">Letter 48</ref>). By the end of the year, Bloomfield
          had decided not to print the poem in his forthcoming collection <title>Rural Tales </title>and, in the wake of the increasingly bitter
          dispute with Lofft triggered by the publisher wishing to omit Lofft’s embarrassing prefatory remarks in the new edition of <title>The
            Farmer’s Boy</title>, was restoring his manuscripts to their pristine state. He sent George a manuscript of ‘To Immagination’, noting ‘I
          have copied it, and copied what Mr L would have added and withdrawn. I think you will not wonder at my rejecting it’ (30 November 1801, <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.69.html">Letter 69</ref>) </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s sensitivity over his ‘Immagination’ manuscript was clearly greater than over <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>
          which, after all, he had initially been content to publish with Lofft’s revisions. This stemmed not just from accumulated resentment over
          Lofft’s behaviour but also from the fact that the new poem was a departure from the Georgic into a loftier, more gentlemanly, voice.
          Bloomfield was aware that his social claim upon that voice was slight and was acutely sensitive to the interfering of his patron who,
          precisely because this poem was written in a gentlemanly voice, felt himself better qualified to modify it. Bloomfield had not the authority
          over this poetic voice to insist on his own words, whereas he had (albeit at a price) over his poems that dealt with rural labour and
          village tales. The outcome was that, after Lofft’s revisions, well-meaning though they were, Bloomfield felt alienated from his own language
          of the imagination. It fell dead in his hands and became a poem he could neither publish nor polish, written in a style he would never again
          attempt. He vented his feelings in a letter of April 1804 to <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BrayleyEdward">Edward Brayley</ref>: ‘Three
          years past I had written a long address “to Imagination,” in what I calld Blank Verse, but my friend Mr Lofft thinking it deficient, was for
          adding and explaining, and in effect perverting my meaning till I finish’d the contest by refusing to print the piece, and by ultimately
          destroying it’ (13 April 1804, <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.120.html">Letter
          120</ref>).</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Fortunately, Bloomfield did not destroy all the manuscripts of the poem. The manuscript, which is kept in the British
          Library (Add. MS 30809), and which we publish here, is decidedly Augustan in manner, while suggesting a relationship between nature and the
          poet’s creativity that is akin to <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth’s</ref>. In contrast to ‘Tintern Abbey’,
          imagination, stimulated by the view of nature, is personified but not self-consciously related to the poet. Instead, the personified faculty
          takes a topographic flight, a departure indeed for Bloomfield, formerly bard of a single Suffolk village, and a token of his desire to
          escape the labourer-poet tag (since labourers’ views were held to be limited to the local range within which their experience was
          confined). It is as if he deliberately set out to elaborate upon Dr Johnson’s maxim that the poet should ‘Let Observation with extensive
          view / Survey mankind from China to Peru’<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title>The Vanity of Human Wishes</title>, lines
            1–2.</note>—since in rhyming couplets and eighteenth-century diction he takes a shifting but apparently omniscient view of nature and
          humanity in South America (principally) and Africa. It is a less egotistical response to nature than Wordsworth’s, but nevertheless derives
          from it a comparable emotional and moral pressure. Bloomfield, learning from Pope’s <title>Windsor Forest </title>and Darwin’s
            <title>Botanic Garden</title>, disengages the poetic imagination from the personality of the poet and from his own limited viewpoint,
          allowing him vicariously a greater scope of comment. The voice allows the narrator to seem to rise above his own personal interest and
          moralise: this is not the egotistical sublime but a new version of the eighteenth-century poetic persona of narratorial independence of
          self. As such, it puts the Wordsworthian—the Romantic—imagination in a wider cultural context showing that imagination could be addressed
          via a renewal of an older Augustan discourse. In this, Bloomfield learned from Akenside, Young, Darwin and Joel Barlow, whose 1787
            <title>Vision of Columbus </title>surveys the American continent from the skies as Bloomfield does in ‘To Immagination’. Bloomfield’s poem
          contains verbal echoes of all these poets and it is intriguing to think that he may have derived his narrative device and main topic—the
          aerial flight over the Atlantic and South America—from one of the earliest American poets. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Pliable enough to allow heartfelt sympathy with exploited labourers (another sign of the respect for the realities of hard
          bodily labour that is present in many of Bloomfield’s poems) as well as generalising moral commentary about slavery, ‘To Immagination’
          reveals, despite Bloomfield’s fragile confidence in it, that it was possible to fuse Romantic-era aesthetics with Augustan style. It helps
          us see why Wordsworth’s autobiographical verse looked singular and perverse to critics as different as Jeffrey and Byron. The visionary
          revelation of inwardness was not the only discourse created, and seen to be created, by the Romantic-era imagination.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">As a poem that modifies eighteenth-century poetic language from a labouring-class perspective, ‘To Immagination’ has much to
          show us about that language’s continued potential as a sensitive medium for the expression of moral and emotional truth. It also reveals
          some of the limitations of that language: Bloomfield’s is certainly not a romantic-era poem on imagination that succeeds where others fail
          in displaying its own imbrication in social and political forces. Bloomfield does not—and he’s like <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ClareJohn">Clare</ref> in this—offer a communitarian model of imagination arising from a world of shared labour to
          counter the individual transcendentalism of Wordsworthian Romanticism. His imagination is disembodied—from himself and from others—a moral
          discourse that is divorced from the speaker’s position and from the context from which it arises. This might be judged, though Bloomfield
          never explicitly acknowledged as much, a sign of the alienation of the poet from a socially-produced poetic voice that he could call his own
          or call the voice of his class. Instead, he produced a simulacrum of poetic discourses previously produced by Augustan gentlemen for whom
          adopting an omniscient objectified voice was an unproblematic sign of cultural power—Young’s <title>Night Thoughts</title>, Akenside’s
            <title>Pleasures of the Imagination</title>, Darwin’s <title>Botanic Garden. </title>It is not surprising, then that ‘To Immagination’ has
          hesitancies and failings which are symptoms of the author’s unease with the position of authority in which his narratorial position places
          him. The fact that Bloomfield left it unpublished, meanwhile, is telling evidence of the crisis in poet-patron relationships caused by
          class-difference as it operated in poetic language. Equally, the fact that it languished in manuscript for so long suggests the continuing
          class bias and social exclusivity that attended the critical adoption of the Romantic imagination as a criterion of worth.</p>

            Farmer’s Boy </title>in 1798. <title>Rural Tales </title>was a departure from that work: it featured shorter narrative poems—titled
          ‘tales’ and ‘ballads’—about villagers rather than loco-descriptive Georgic; some meditative poems in Bloomfield’s own voice were included;
          there were also several songs. This array resembled that of <title>Lyrical Ballads</title>, which Bloomfield admired for the naturalness of
          its observation (i.e. its plain colloquial diction—see <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.52.html">Letters 52</ref> and <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.94.html">94</ref>): the similarity was, however, not a result

          traditional ‘folk’ genres. It also fed public curiosity about the author, whom <title>The Farmer’s Boy </title>had encouraged them to
          identify with ‘Giles’, the boyish, gentle rustic who ‘sang’ pastoral verses as he had once sung while milking cows and scaring crows. Indeed
          by 1802 Bloomfield had become known, in polite London society, as a latterday, English, Burns—a guest who could be persuaded to sing or say
          his poems from memory. In a letter of 17 December 1801 (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.71.html">Letter 71</ref>) he describes being invited to the
          salon of <ref type="m"

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">With Bloomfield the hottest commercial property in the book market, <title>Rural Tales </title>brought the tension between
          Hood, Bloomfield’s publisher, and Lofft, his patron, to breaking point. As with <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>, the dispute arose because
          Lofft wished to add comments of his own, framing the verse. In October 1801, Hood saw copies of the small octavo volumes from the first
          print run for a first edition that was to comprise small octavo, octavo, quarto and large quarto volumes at different prices. He at once
          pushed Bloomfield to gain Lofft’s consent to remove the notes, which consisted almost entirely of Lofft’s somewhat fulsome praise of the
          poems. The notes had been printed at the foot of the page, and Hood wished to exclude them from the print run of the octavo, quarto and
          large quarto volumes. Bloomfield sympathized, also finding the notes facile (‘a charming little story: excellently told’ is a typical
          example), and fearing that their inclusion would show him to be ‘not very averse to flattery’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.58.html">Letter 58</ref>). Writing to Lofft, however, brought
          only a piqued refusal either to alter the notes or to agree that they might be moved to the back of the book:</p>
               <quote>I will certainly not alter the form of the notes. I was excluded from any other part in this volume by your own express desire. I think
          I may say in future that it is not likely that I should thus strangely offend. I do not mean to write either note or essay to any future
          edition of any poems you may publish in my Life-time. I assure I can very ill spare the time short as the notes are. To have taken so avowed
          a part in the first publication and none except that of corrector of the press and occasional emendator in this would I think have had a
          strange and undesirable appearance for you and for the poems: as if I had changed my mind as to you or them or both. Mind, I could not well
          take any part that was more modest, or offer an opinion in fewer words. You, and you say your friends in general, are, or <hi rend="ital">will </hi>be, dissatisfied with them and dislike my occupying even so small a space in your works and so unobtrusive a station as the
          bottom of the page. (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.59.html">Letter 59</ref>)</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield tried to placate him, and to justify Hood’s opinion (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.60.html">Letter 60</ref>), but Lofft made it clear that if
          they were moved, or dropped, his name should be removed from the publication and he would have nothing more to do with Bloomfield (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.61.html">Letter 61</ref>). This declaration plunged
          Bloomfield into a crisis:</p>
               <quote>Never to attempt to write to Mr Lofft again on such matters—Rose by favour, must expect trouble—Destress of mind—Fame is a bubble—Would
          this instant stop the publication, and all destressing desputes with it, were it possible to be done—What use to burn the MS?—Those who envy
          the reputation I may have acquired should have a relish of what it is to hear my friend censured and then not allowd to tell him
          so—Deviations in opinion ascribed to mercenary motives—What shall I say to Mr Hood—What power have I—No kind friend to take my place a
          moment between contending parties, to mount the pedestal and kick away the Rubbish from around, that hides and involves my actions in
          obscurity—I must look base and criminal—How can I engage in a quarrel which I have studiously avoided, Between Bookseller and Editor?—Was
          ever poor poet fixt as I am!—But fretting will bring sickness, not conviction to others; so says my Wife—Truth is in a Fogg—How can I send
          the Quarto proofs to Mr Lofft; denied—The <hi rend="ital">place</hi> and not the <hi rend="ital">matter</hi> of the notes disputed—Is not Mr
          Lofft a lover of peace?——</quote>
               <quote>The matter stands thus—let me act which way I will, censure must ensue.—If I remain neuter, and give no answer should the subject of
          the notes be broachd by Mr Hood; that silence will give consent. If I say ‘you shall not omit them,’ how can I follow up the injunction?
          Should I say, ‘leave them out,’ Mr Lofft is no more amongst my correspondents!

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The soul-searching of this letter led Bloomfield to a moment of self-realisation that was pivotal. Writing to <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GloverElizabeth">his mother</ref> and seeking to relieve her worry about him, he declared</p>
               <quote>I know of no Better balm for your mind, than recommending the words of Old Richard in the Ballad ‘We’ve nothing for u’n but our
          prayers’. Believe me, dear Mother that the inexpressable pleasure I feel in composing these tales and Ballads; and the honest pride of
          haveing proved; (against the imperious and unnatural opinions of some of the learned,) that a poor man may possess qualities <hi rend="ital">which they are forced to admire</hi>, will allways be equal to any temporary vexations which are likely to fall to my lot (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.66.html">Letter 66</ref>, 1 November 1801)</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Here, quoting his own ‘Richard and Kate’ from <title>Rural Tales</title>, Bloomfield discovered he could rely on his own
          verse as a source of maxims to live by in difficult times—both for himself and for others. It was a resource of his own invention—closer to
          hand and more within his control than the God invoked by prayer. <title>Rural Tales</title>, he discovered, proved his worth: they had won
          the admiration even of those educated men who looked down on the uneducated. Thus they evidenced not only his own ability, despite class
          snobbery, but also that of the poor in general. Bloomfield understands his poetry as a vindication of the merits of his class—a work,
          implicitly, of social levelling—as well as a proper source of personal pride. After this, he had the resolution to resist Lofft’s demands,
          despite his fears. On 5 November he reported that ‘the publisher has been to the printer’s, and orderd the notes to stand at the end’ of the
          octavo, quarto and large quartos (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.67.html">Letter
          67</ref>). Correspondence with Lofft was then suspended.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">After publication, reviewers reacted much as Hood and Bloomfield had feared they would. While they liked the poems, finding
          them scarcely inferior to <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>, they saw no need for a patron to impose his own views so visibly. The
            <title>British Critic</title>, responding to the small octavo issue, where the notes were at the page foot, declared: </p>
               <quote>Those observations are certainly dictated by the same laudable zeal which led the writer first to protect and assist Bloomfield; but
          they are superfluous; and it is rather irksome to readers who can judge for themselves, to be told in every instance, what they ought to
          think, and how much they should admire. Bloomfield’s poetry does not require this aid; and it is hardly fair for the critic to jump up and
          ride behind him, wherever he may turn his Pegasus. (19 (April 1802), 338–43)</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                  <title>The Anti-Jacobin Review</title>, also dealing with the small octavos, was more acerbic:</p>
               <quote>We cannot help smiling at the self-importance of the man, who, throughout the volume, has tacked his criticism to the end of each
          piece. But the public, perhaps, may not be dissatisfied with this; as, with the poems, they have also the annotations of the critic, by the
          assistance of which they will certainly be competent to form an opinion of <hi rend="ital">their own</hi>. (11 (1802), 394–97)</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <title>Poetical Register </title>was forthright: </p>
               <quote>One thing only in the volume calls forth censure; but this censure does not affect Mr. Bloomfield. At the end of every poem, Mr. Capel
          Lofft has, with great kindness, given a sort of direction to the reader what opinion he must form on what he has just read. That
          impertinence of commentary cannot be too severely reprobated. We recommend to Mr. Bloomfield to expunge, as soon as possible, this obtrusive
          nonsense. ((January 1802), 426–27)</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Lofft’s response to these confirmations of Bloomfield’s and Hood’s fears, if he made one, has not survived in Bloomfield’s
          correspondence. In 1802, as the second edition went to press, Bloomfield gathered up his courage and informed Lofft that the notes would be
          dropped from it, also taking the opportunity to say ‘I told you so’:</p>
               <quote>You Sir, I remember, said of these notes that ‘publication would be the best proof’. They are published Sir! and I can neither shut my
          ears against a company, nor stop the postman from bringing me public opinions.—I am not permitted to particularize, and may only say that
          the dislike of readers is just as I said it would be, and that dislike expresst without reserve to me, and of course to those who own the
          other half of the property.—I am persuaded that if you would have heard me 4 months ago on this subject that I should not now have to write
          thus, but as it is, I feel myself to be performing a Duty, and cannot forbear. (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.82.html">Letter 82</ref>)</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">With largely positive reviews, and with the reputation garnered by <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>, <title>Rural Tales
          </title>was a success: as early as 16 February 1802, only five weeks after publication, Bloomfield was able to report that 5000 copies of
          the small octavos had been sold (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.80.html">Letter
          80</ref>). By October Vernor and Hood were so pleased with the sale that they presented him with £100, over and above royalties from his
          share of the copyright (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.98.html">Letter 98</ref>). </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The second edition (1802) was also a success, and a third followed in 1803 with Vernor and Hood now in partnership with <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LongmanThomasN">Longman</ref> and Rees. The same partnership brought out further editions in 1805, 1806,
          1809, and 1811. Vernor and Hood’s bankruptcy in 1812 (on which see the introduction to <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>) meant that Bloomfield
          lost three quarters of outstanding royalties. The eighth edition, of 1815, was published by a group of booksellers, Longmans having split
          its share in the collection with <ref type="m"

          Co., and Walker and Edwards. Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy handled printing, advertising and distribution and accounted with Bloomfield for
          costs and profits. In January 1816, copyright reverted to Bloomfield, and in the post-war depression, finding himself short of money, he
          wondered whether he would be forced to sell, rather than keep for himself, a half share—thereby foregoing future royalties in exchange for
          an upfront lump sum (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.298.html">Letters 298</ref>, <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.299.html">299</ref>). In the end he did not do so; in 1820 he
          expected royalties for half of the ninth edition of 2000 copies, although income from the eighth (of 1815) had been small, profits having
          largely been used up in advances and in the costs of printing new editions (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.325.html">Letter 325</ref>).</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                  <hi rend="smcaps">The</hi> Poems here offered to the Public were chiefly written during the interval between the concluding, and the publishing of
          ‘the Farmer’s Boy’, an interval of nearly two years. The pieces of a later date are, ‘<title>the Widow to her Hour-Glass</title>’,
            ‘<title>the Fakenham Ghost</title>’, ‘<title>Walter and Jane</title>’, &amp;c. At the time of publishing the Farmer’s Boy, circumstances
          occurred which rendered it necessary to submit these Poems to the perusal of my Friends: under whose approbation I now give them, with some
          confidence as to their moral merit, to the judgment of the public. And as they treat of village manners, and rural scenes, it appears to me
          not ill-tim’d to avow, that I have hopes of meeting in some degree the approbation of my Country. I was not prepar’d for the decided, and I
          may surely say extraordinary attention which The Public has shewn towards the Farmer’s Boy: the consequence has been such as my true friends
          will rejoice to hear; it has produc’d me many essential blessings. And I feel peculiarly gratified in finding that a poor man in England may
          assert the dignity of Virtue, and speak of the imperishable beauties of Nature, and be heard, and heard, perhaps, with greater attention for
          his being poor.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Whoever thinks of me or my concerns, must necessarily indulge the pleasing idea of gratitude, and join a thought of my first
          great friend <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Mr. Lofft</ref>. And on this head, I believe every reader, who has himself any
          feeling, will judge rightly of mine: if otherwise, I would much rather he would lay down this volume, and grasp hold of such fleeting
          pleasures as the world’s business may afford him. I speak not of that gentleman as a public character, or as a scholar. Of the former I know
          but little, and of the latter nothing. But I know from experience, and I glory in this fair opportunity of saying it, that his private life
          is a lesson of morality; his manners gentle, his heart sincere: and I regard it as one of the most fortunate circumstances of my life, that
          my introduction to public notice fell to so zealous and unwearied a friend.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> [1802 adds note:] I dare
            not take to myself a praise like this; and yet I was, perhaps, hardly at liberty to disclaim what should be mine and the endeavour of
            every one to deserve. This I can say, that I have reason to rejoice that Mr. <ref type="m"

          cordial advice, and almost a parental anxiety, for my safety under so great a share of public applause. I beg to refer such friends to the
          great teacher Time: and hope that he will hereafter give me my deserts, and no more.</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Preface to <title>Poems [Stereotype]</title>, Volume II</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">What now forms the first part of this Volume, was published in 1802 under the title of ‘Rural Tales,’ and the remainder in
          1806 under the name of ‘Wild Flowers’. Several pieces in the first collection, which the Public have sanctioned by a long and generous
          approbation, were written before the publication of the ‘Farmer’s Boy;’ and consequently before I had friends to thank, or failures to
          dread. The original MSS. of these Poems are now in my possession, and I find therein, that seven years ago, I made memorandums which are now
          useful. Two or three of these detached sentences, as they are unvarnished truths, may afford amusement:—</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘Remember having a great conceit of the “Miller’s Maid;”—but of “Richard and Kate” I expected to hear a different account;
          was afraid it might be <hi rend="ital">too low</hi>, as the critics call it, though for the life of me I can’t tell what they mean by it.
          ——— Began to think of the pleasure of an old couple meeting their grown-up children, and accordingly composed, or rather they composed
          themselves, the stanzas containing Richard’s speech to his Sons and Daughters, which always pleased me best of any in the Ballad; I then
          began the opening of the Ballad, and filled up the chinks; for I had arranged two or three stanzas descriptive of their journey,
          particularly the ninth and tenth.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">When I began the “Miller’s Maid” I had no thought of making so long, or so good, a story of it. Had not thought of any plot
          or developement, but first of all wrote the girl’s story, to try how far I could make a child’s language touch my own feelings. The
          execrable usage of some Workhouse-Children, as stated in the newspapers, gave the thought at first. This plan was enlarged till it became
          the favourite of my heart, and cost me more tears than all the rest. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">“The Widow,” though it stands next in the printed copies, was not written next; it has nothing remarkable belonging to it,
          but that it is the only piece in the book which was written quick. Had an Hour-glass before me; my wife singing softly; my girls at school.
          Made a shoe between dinner and tea-time, and composed the “Widow” beside.’</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The Reader will perceive, from these specimens, the design and tenor of my entries; they were private: and he is not
          troubled with them entirely without cause. Inquiries, such as these memorandums are calculated to satisfy, have often been made; and as the
          parties are as welcome to the Anecdotes as to the Poems, I find this the most ready and general way of compliance. It will also be
          recollected, that I am not here writing for the purpose of introducing the Poems to notice; they are already known, and must <hi rend="ital">stand or fall by themselves</hi>, in spite of this or any other kind of Preface.</p>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">BRIGHT was the summer sky, the Mornings gay, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And <hi rend="smcaps">Jane</hi> was young and chearful as the Day. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Not yet to Love but Mirth she paid her vows; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Echo mock’d her as she call’d her Cows. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Tufts of green Broom, that full in blossom vied, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And grac’d with spotted gold the upland side, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The level fogs o’erlook’d; too high to share; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">So lovely <hi rend="smcaps">Jane</hi> o’erlook’d the clouds of Care;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">No meadow-flow’r rose fresher to the view, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That met her morning footsteps in the dew; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where, if a nodding stranger ey’d her charms, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The blush of innocence was up in arms, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Love’s random glances struck the unguarded mind, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Beauty’s magic made him look behind.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Duly as morning blush’d or twilight came,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Secure of greeting smiles and Village fame, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She pass’d the Straw-roof’d Shed, in ranges where </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Hung many a well-turn’d Shoe and glitt’ring <hi rend="ital">Share</hi>; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where <hi rend="smcaps">Walter</hi>, as the charmer tripp’d along, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Would stop his roaring Bellows and his Song.— </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Dawn of affection; Love’s delicious sigh! </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Caught from the lightnings of a speaking eye, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That leads the heart to rapture or to woe, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas <hi rend="smcaps">Walter’s</hi> fate thy mad’ning power to know; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And scarce to know, ere in its infant twine, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">As the Blast shakes the tendrils of the Vine,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The budding bliss that full of promise grew </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The chilling blight of separation knew. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Scarce had he told his heart’s unquiet case, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And <hi rend="smcaps">Jane</hi> to shun him ceas’d to mend her pace, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And learnt to listen trembling as he spoke, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And fondly judge his words beyond a joke; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When, at the Goal that bounds our prospects here,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Jane’s widow’d Mistress ended her career:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Blessings attended her divided store,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The Mansion sold, (Jane’s peaceful home no more,)</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A distant Village own’d her for its Queen,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Another service, and another scene;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But could another scene so pleasing prove,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Twelve weary miles from Walter and from Love?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The Maid grew thoughtful: yet to Fate resign’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Knew not the worth of what she left behind.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">He, when at Eve releas’d from toil and heat, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Soon miss’d the smiles that taught his heart to beat,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Each sabbath-day of late was wont to prove </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Hope’s liberal feast, the holiday of Love: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But now, upon his spirit’s ebbing strength </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Came each dull hour’s intolerable length. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The next had scarcely dawn’d when Walter hied </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">O’er hill and dale, Affection for his guide: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">O’er the brown Heath his pathless journey lay, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where screaming Lapwings hail’d the op’ning day. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">High rose the Sun, the anxious Lover sigh’d; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His slipp’ry soles bespoke the dew was dried: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Her last farewell hung fondly on his tongue </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">As o’er the tufted Furze elate he sprung; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Trifling impediments; his heart was light, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For Love and Beauty glow’d in fancy’s sight; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And soon he gaz’d on Jane’s enchanting face, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Renew’d his passion,—but, destroy’d his peace. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Truth, at whose shrine he bow’d, inflicted pain; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Conscience whisper’d, ‘<hi rend="ital">never come again.</hi>’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For now, his tide of gladness to oppose,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A clay-cold damp of doubts and fears arose;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Clouds, which involve, midst Love and Reason’s strife,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The poor man’s prospect when he takes a wife.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Though gay his journeys in the Summer’s prime,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Each seem’d the repetition of a crime;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He never left her but with many a sigh,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When tears stole down his face, she knew not why.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Severe his task those visits to forego,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And feed his heart with voluntary woe.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet this he did; the wan Moon circling found</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His evenings cheerless, and his rest unsound;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And saw th’ unquenched flame his bosom swell:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What were his doubts, thus let the Story tell.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">A month’s sharp conflict only serv’d to prove </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The pow’r, as well as truth, of Walter’s love. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Absence more strongly on his mind portray’d </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His own sweet, injur’d, unoffending Maid.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Once more he’d go; full resolute awhile, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But heard his native Bells on every stile; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The sound recall’d him with a pow’rful charm, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The Heath wide open’d, and the day was warm; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">There, where a bed of tempting green he found, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Increasing anguish weigh’d him to the ground; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His well-grown limbs the scatter’d Daisies press’d, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">While his clinch’d hand fell heavy on his breast.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">‘Why do I go in cruel sport to say,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">“I love thee, Jane; appoint the happy day?”</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Why seek her sweet ingenuous reply, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then grasp her hand and proffer—poverty?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Why, if I love her and adore her name,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Why act like time and sickness on her frame? </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Why should my scanty pittance nip her prime,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And chace away the Rose before its time?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I’m young, ’tis true; the world beholds me free;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Labour ne’er show’d a frightful face to me; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nature’s first wants hard labour <hi rend="ital">should</hi> supply;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But should it fail, ’twill be too late to fly.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some Summers hence, if nought our loves annoy,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The image of my Jane may lisp her joy;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Or, blooming boys with imitative swing</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">May mock my arm, and make the Anvil ring;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then if in rags.—But, O my heart, forbear,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I love the Girl, and why should I despair?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And that I love her all the village knows;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Oft from my pain the mirth of others flows;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">As when a neighbour’s Steed with glancing eye</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Saw his par’d hoof supported on my thigh:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Jane pass’d that instant; mischief came of course;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I drove the nail awry and lam’d the Horse;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The poor beast limp’d: I bore a Master’s frown,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A thousand times I wish’d the wound my own.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When to these tangling thoughts I’ve been resign’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Fury or languor has possess’d my mind,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">All eyes have stared, I’ve blown a blast so strong;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Forgot to smite at all, or smote too long.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">If at the Ale-house door, with careless glee </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">One drinks to Jane, and darts a look on me;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I feel that blush which her dear name will bring, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I feel:—but, guilty Love, ’tis not thy sting!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet what are jeers? the bubbles of an hour;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Jane knows what Love can do, and feels its pow’r;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">In her mild eye fair Truth her meaning tells;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Tis not in looks like her’s that falsehood dwells.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">As water shed upon a dusty way</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I’ve seen midst downward pebbles devious stray;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">If kindred drops an adverse channel keep,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The crystal friends toward each other creep;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Near, and still nearer, rolls each little tide,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Th’ expanding mirror swells on either side:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They touch—’tis done—receding bound’ries fly,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">An instantaneous union strikes the eye:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">So ’tis with us: for Jane would be my bride; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Shall coward fears then turn the bliss aside?’ </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">While thus he spoke he heard a gentle sound, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That seem’d a jarring footstep on the ground: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Asham’d of grief, he bade his eyes unclose, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And shook with agitation as he rose;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">All unprepared the sweet surprise to bear, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His heart beat high, for Jane herself was there.— </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Flusht was her cheek; she seem’d the full-blown flower. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For warmth gave loveliness a double power; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Round her fair brow the deep confusion ran, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A waving handkerchief became her fan, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Her lips, where dwelt sweet love and smiling ease, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Puff’d gently back the warm assailing breeze. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘I’ve travell’d all these weary miles with pain, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To see my native village once again;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And show my true regard for neighbour <hi rend="ital">Hind</hi>;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Not like you, Walter, <hi rend="ital">she</hi> was always kind.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas thus, each soft sensation laid aside,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She buoy’d her spirits up with maiden pride;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Disclaim’d her love, e’en while she felt the sting;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘What, come for Walter’s sake!’ ’Twas no such thing.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But when astonishment his tongue releas’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Pride’s usurpation in an instant ceas’d:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">By force he caught her hand as passing by,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And gaz’d upon her half averted eye;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His heart’s distraction, and his boding fears</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She heard, and answer’d with a flood of tears;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Precious relief; sure friends that forward press</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To tell the mind’s unspeakable distress.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Ye Youths, whom crimson’d health and genuine fire</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Bear joyous on the wings of young desire,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Ye, who still bow to Love’s almighty sway,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What could true passion, what could Walter say?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Age, tell me true, nor shake your locks in vain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Tread back your paths, and be in love again;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">In your young days did such a favouring hour </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Show you the littleness of wealth and pow’r? </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Advent’rous climbers of the Mountain’s brow, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">While Love, their master, spreads his couch below— </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘My dearest Jane,’ the untaught Walter cried, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">As half repell’d he pleaded by her side; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘My dearest Jane, think of me as you may’—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Thus—still unutter’d what he strove to say, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They breath’d in sighs the anguish of their minds, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And took the path that led to neighbour <hi rend="ital">Hind’s</hi>.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">A secret joy the well-known roof inspir’d, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Small was its store, and little they desir’d; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Jane dried her tears; while Walter forward flew </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To aid the Dame; who to the brink updrew </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The pond’rous Bucket as they reach’d the well, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And scarcely with exhausted breath could tell </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How welcome to her Cot the blooming Pair, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">O’er whom she watch’d with a maternal care.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘What ails thee, Jane?’ the wary Matron cried; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With heaving breast the modest Maid reply’d, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Now gently moving back her wooden Chair </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To shun the current of the cooling air; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Not much, good Dame; I’m weary by the way; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Perhaps, anon, I’ve something else to say.’ </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Now, while the Seed-cake crumbled on her knee, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Snowy Jasmine peeped in to see; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And the transparent Lilac at the door, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Full to the Sun its purple honors bore, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The clam’rous Hen her fearless brood display’d, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And march’d around; while thus the Matron said: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Jane has been weeping, Walter;—prithee why? </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I’ve seen her laugh, and dance, but never cry.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But I can guess; with <hi rend="ital">her</hi> you should have been, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When late I saw you loit’ring on the green; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I’m an old Woman, and the truth may tell: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I say then, Boy, you have not us’d her well.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">
                     <hi rend="smcaps">Jane</hi> felt for <hi rend="smcaps">Walter</hi>; felt his cruel pain, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">While Pity’s voice brought forth her tears again. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Don’t scold him, Neighbour, he has much to say, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Indeed he came and met me by the way.’ </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The Dame resum’d—‘Why then, my Children, why </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Do such young bosoms heave the piteous sigh? </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The ills of Life to you are yet unknown; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Death’s sev’ring shaft, and Poverty’s cold frown: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I’ve felt them both, by turns:—but as they pass’d, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Strong was my trust, and here I am at last. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When I dwelt young and cheerful down the <hi rend="ital">Lane</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">(And, though I say it, I was much like <hi rend="smcaps">Jane</hi>,)</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">O’er flow’ry fields with <hi rend="ital">Hind,</hi> I lov’d to stray, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And talk, and laugh, and fool the time away:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Care defied; who not one pain could give,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Till the thought came of how we were to live; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And then Love plied his arrows thicker still: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And prove! victorious;—as he always will. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">We brav’d Life’s storm together; while that Drone,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Your poor old Uncle, <hi rend="smcaps">Walter</hi>, liv’d alone.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He died the other day: when round his bed</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">No tender soothing tear Affection shed—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Affection! ’twas a plant he never knew;—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Why should he feast on fruits he never grew?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">
                     <hi rend="smcaps">Walter</hi> caught fire: nor was <hi rend="ital">he</hi> charm’d alone</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With conscious Truth’s firm elevated tone;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">
                     <hi rend="smcaps">Jane</hi> from her seat sprang forward, half afraid, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Attesting with a blush what Goody said. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Her Lover took a more decided part:— </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">(O! ’twas the very Chord that touch’d his heart,)— </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Alive to the best feelings man can prize, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A Bridegroom’s transport sparkled in his eyes; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Love, conquering power, with unrestricted range </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Silenc’d the arguments of Time and Change; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And led his vot’ry on, and bade him view, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And prize the light-wing’d moments as they flew:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">All doubts gave way, all retrospective lore, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Whence cooler Reason tortur’d him before; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Comparison of times, the Lab’rer’s hire, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And many a truth Reflection might inspire, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Sunk powerless. ‘Dame, I am a fool,’ he cried; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Alone I might have reason’d till I died. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I caus’d those tears of Jane’s:—but as they fell </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How much I felt none but ourselves can tell. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">While dastard fears withheld me from her sight,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Sighs reign’d by day and hideous dreams by night;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas then the Soldier’s plume and rolling Drum</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Seem’d for a while to strike my sorrows dumb; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To fly from Care then half resolv’d I stood,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And without horror mus’d on fields of blood,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Around with silent reverence they stood; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A blameless reverence—the man was good. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Wealth he had some, a match for his desires, </l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Seeing the youthful pair with downcast eyes, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Unmov’d by Summer-flowers and cloudless skies, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Pass slowly by his Gate; his book resign’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He watch’d their steps and follow’d far behind, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Bearing with inward joy, and honest pride, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A trust of <hi rend="smcaps">Walter’s</hi> kinsman ere he died, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A hard-earn’d mite, deposited with care, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And with a miser’s spirit worshipt there.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">He found what oft the generous bosom seeks, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">In the Dame’s court’seys and <hi rend="smcaps">Jane</hi>’S blushing cheeks, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That consciousness of Worth, that freeborn Grace, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Which waits on Virtue in the meanest place.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">‘Young Man, I’ll not apologize to you,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Here, in this Purse, (what should have cheer’d a Wife,) </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Lies, half the savings of your Uncle’s life! </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I know your history, and your wishes know;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And love to see the seeds of Virtue grow. </l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Goody, her dim eyes wiping, rais’d her brow, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And saw the young pair look they knew not how; </l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Who gives them half a Kingdom gives them woe; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Comforts may be procur’d and want defied, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Heav’ns! with how small a Sum, when right applied! </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Give Love and honest Industry their way, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Clear but the Sun-rise of Life’s little day, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Those we term poor shall oft that wealth obtain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For which th’ ambitious sigh, but sigh in vain: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Wealth that still brightens, as its stores increase; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The calm of Conscience, and the reign of Peace. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Walter’s enamour’d Soul, from news like this, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Now felt the dawnings of his future bliss; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">E’en as the Red-breast shelt’ring in a bower, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Mourns the short darkness of a passing Shower, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then, while the azure sky extends around, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Darts on a worm that breaks the moisten’d ground, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And mounts the dripping fence, with joy elate,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And shares the prize triumphant with his mate; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">So did the Youth;—the treasure straight became </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">An humble servant to Love’s sacred flame; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Glorious subjection!—Thus his silence broke: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Joy gave him words; still quick’ning as he spoke. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">‘Want was my dread, my wishes were but few; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Others might doubt, but <hi rend="smcaps">Jane</hi> those wishes knew: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">This Gold may rid my heart of pains and sighs; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But her true love is still my greatest prize. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Long as I live, when this bright day comes round,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Beneath my Roof your noble deeds shall sound; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But, first, to make my gratitude appear,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I’ll shoe your Honour’s Horses for a Year;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">If clouds should threaten when your Corn is down, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I’ll lend a hand, and summon half the town; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">If good betide, I’ll sound it in my songs, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And be the first avenger of your wrongs: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Though rude in manners, free I hope to live: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">This Ale’s not mine, no Ale have I to give; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet, Sir, though Fortune frown’d when I was born,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Let’s drink eternal friendship from this Horn.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How much our present joy to you we owe, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Soon our three Bells shall let the Neighbours know;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The sound shall raise e’en stooping Age awhile, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And every Maid shall meet you with a smile; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Long may you <hi rend="ital">live</hi>’—the wish like lightning flew; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">By each repeated as the ’Squire withdrew. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Long may <hi rend="ital">you</hi> live,’ his feeling heart rejoin’d; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Leaving well-pleas’d such happy Souls behind. </l>

                  <l rendition="#indent3">The noblest Virtues cheer’d his lengthen’d days,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And all the Country echo’d with his praise:</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent3">Drew constant pray’rs and blessings round his door.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">One Summer’s night, (the hour of rest was come)</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Darkness unusual overspread their home;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">A chilling blast was felt; the foremost cloud</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Sprinkl’d the bubbling Pool; and thunder loud,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Though distant yet, menac’d the country round,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And fill’d the Heavens with its solemn sound.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Who can retire to rest when tempests lour?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Nor wait the issue of the coming hour?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Meekly resign’d she sat, in anxious pain;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">He fill’d his pipe, and listen’d to the rain</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">That batter’d furiously their strong abode,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Roar’d in the Damm, and lash’d the pebbled road:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">When, mingling with the storm, confus’d and wild,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">They heard, or thought they heard, a screaming <hi rend="ital">Child</hi>:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The voice approach’d; and ’midst the thunder’s roar,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Now loudly begg’d for Mercy at the door.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">MERCY was <hi rend="ital">there</hi>: the Miller heard the call;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">His door he open’d; when a sudden squall</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Drove in a wretched Girl; who weeping stood,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Whilst the cold rain dripp’d from her in a flood.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">With kind officiousness the tender Dame</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Rous’d up the dying embers to a flame;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Dry cloaths procur’d, and cheer’d her shiv’ring guest,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And sooth’d the sorrows of her infant breast.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">But as she stript her shoulders, lily-white,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">What marks of cruel usage shock’d their sight!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Weals, and blue wounds, most piteous to behold</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Upon a Child yet scarcely Ten years old.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The <hi rend="ital">Miller</hi> felt his indignation rise,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Yet, as the weary stranger clos’d her eyes,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And seem’d fatigu’d beyond her strength and years,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">‘Sleep, Child, (he said), and wipe away your tears.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">They watch’d her slumbers till the storm was done;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">When thus the generous Man again begun:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">‘See, fluttering sighs that rise against her will,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And agitating dreams disturb her still!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Dame, we should know before we go to rest,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Whence comes this Girl, and how she came distrest.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Wake her, and ask; for she is sorely bruis’d:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">I long to know by whom she’s thus misus’d.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Child, what’s your name? how came you in the storm?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Have you no home to keep you dry and warm?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Who gave you all those wounds your shoulders show?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Where are your Parents? Whither would you go?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The Stranger bursting into tears, look’d pale,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And this the purport of her artless tale.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘I have no Parents; and no friends beside:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">I well remember when my Mother died:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">My Brother cried; and so did I that day:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">We had no Father;—he was gone away;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">That night we left our home new cloaths to wear:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The <hi rend="ital">Work-house</hi> found them; we were carried there.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">We lov’d each other dearly; when we met</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">We always shar’d what trifles we could get.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">But <hi rend="ital">George</hi> was older by a year than me:—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">He parted from me and was sent to Sea.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">“Good-bye, dear Phoebe,” the poor fellow said!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Perhaps he’ll come again; perhaps he’s dead.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">When I grew strong enough I went to place,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">My Mistress had a sour ill-natured face;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And though I’ve been so often beat and chid,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">I strove to please her, Sir; indeed, I did.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Weary and spiritless to bed I crept,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And always cried at night before I slept.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">This Morning I offended; and I bore</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">A cruel beating, worse than all before.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Unknown to all the House I ran away;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And thus far travell’d through the sultry day;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And, O don’t send me back! I dare not go—.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">‘I send you back!’ (the Miller cried), ‘no, no.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Th’ appeals of Wretchedness had weight with him,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And Sympathy would warm him every limb;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">He mutter’d, glorying in the work begun,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">‘Well done, my little Wench; ’twas nobly done!’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Then said, with looks more cheering than the fire,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And feelings such as Pity can inspire,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">‘My house has childless been this many a year;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">While you deserve it you shall tarry here.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The Orphan mark’d the ardor of his eye,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Blest his kind words, and thank’d him with a sigh.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Thus was the sacred compact doubly seal’d;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Thus were her spirits rais’d, her bruises heal’d:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Thankful, and cheerful too, no more afraid,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Thus little <hi rend="smcaps">Phoebe</hi> was the Miller’s Maid.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Grateful they found her; patient of controul:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">A most bewitching gentleness of soul</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Made pleasure of what work she had to do:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">She grew in stature, and in beauty too.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Five years she pass’d in this delightful home;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Five happy years: but, when the sixth was come,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The <hi rend="ital">Miller</hi> from a Market Town hard by,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Brought home a sturdy Youth his strength to try,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">To raise the sluice-gates early every morn,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">To heave his powder’d sacks and grind his corn:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And meeting <hi rend="ital">Phoebe</hi>, whom he lov’d so dear,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">‘I’ve brought you home a Husband, Girl?—D’ye hear?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">He begg’d for work; his money seem’d but scant:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Those that will work ’tis pity they should want.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> [All edns add note:] A Maxim
              which all ought to remember. C. L.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">So use him well, and we shall shortly see</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Whether he merits what I’ve done, like thee.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Now throbb’d her heart,—a new sensation quite,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Whene’er the comely Stranger was in sight:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">For he at once assiduously strove</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">To please so sweet a Maid, and win her love.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">At every corner stopp’d her in her way;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And saw fresh beauties opening ev’ry day;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">He took delight in tracing in her face</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The mantling blush, and every nameless grace,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">That Sensibility would bring to view,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">When Love he mention’d;—Love, and Honour true,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">But <hi rend="ital">Phoebe</hi> still was shy; and wish’d to know</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">More of the honest Youth, whose manly brow</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">She verily believ’d was Truth’s own throne,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And all his words as artless as her own;</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent3">Divulging where, and how, he liv’d before;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And seem’d to strive his History to hide,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Till fair Esteem enlisted on his side.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The <hi rend="ital">Miller</hi> saw, and mention’d, in his praise,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent3">One day he joking cried, ‘Come here, my Son!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">’Tis pity that so good a Lad as you</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Beneath my roof should bring disorders new!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">But here’s my <hi rend="ital">Phoebe</hi>,—once so light and airy,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">She’d trip along the passage like a Fairy,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Has lost her swiftness quite, since here you came:—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And yet;. . . . I can’t perceive the Girl is lame!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The obstacles she meets with still fall thicker:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Old as I am I’d turn a corner quicker.’—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The <hi rend="ital">Youth</hi> blush’d deep; and <hi rend="ital">Phoebe</hi> hung her head:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The <hi rend="ital">good Man</hi> smil’d, and thus again he said:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">‘Not that I deem it matter of surprise,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">That you should love to gaze at <hi rend="ital">Phoebe’s</hi> eyes;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">But be explicit, Boy; and deal with honour:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">I feel my happiness depend upon her.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">When here you came you’d sorrow on your brow;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And I’ve forborne to question you till now.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">First, then, say what thou art.’ He instant bow’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And thus, in <hi rend="ital">Phoebe’s</hi> hearing, spoke aloud:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Thus far experienc’d, Sir, in you I find</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">All that is generous, fatherly, and kind;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And while you look for proofs of real worth,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">You’ll not regard the meanness of my birth.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">When, pennyless and sad, you met with me,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">I’d just escap’d the dangers of the Sea;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Resolv’d to try my fortune on the shore:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">To get my bread; and trust the waves no more.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Having no Home, nor Parents, left behind,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">I’d all my fortune, all my Friends, to find.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Keen disappointment wounded me that morn:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">For, trav’lling near the spot where I was born,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">I at the well-known door where I was bred,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Inquir’d who still was living, who was dead:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">But first, and most, I sought with anxious fear</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Tidings to gain of her who once was dear;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">A Girl, with all the meekness of the dove,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The constant sharer of my childhood’s love;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">She call’d me <hi rend="ital">Brother</hi>:—which I heard with pride,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Though now suspect we are not so allied.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Thus much I learnt; (no more the churls would say;)</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">She went to service, and she ran away.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And scandal added’—‘Hold!’ the <hi rend="ital">Miller</hi> cried,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And, in an instant, stood at <hi rend="ital">Phoebe’s</hi> side;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">For he observed, while list’ning to the tale,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Her spirits faulter’d, and her cheeks turn’d pale;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Whilst her clasp’d hands descended to her knee</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">She sinking whisper’d forth, ‘O <hi rend="ital">God</hi>, ’tis <hi rend="ital">he!</hi>’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The good Man, though he guess’d the pleasing truth,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Was far too busy to inform the Youth;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">But stirr’d himself amain to aid his Wife,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Who soon restor’d the trembler back to life.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Awhile insensible she still appear’d;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">But, ’<hi rend="ital">O my Brother</hi>,’ was distinctly heard:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The astonisht Youth now held her to his breast;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And tears and kisses soon explain’d the rest.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Past deeds now from each tongue alternate fell;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">For news of dearest import both could tell.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Fondly, from childhood’s tears to youth’s full prime,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">They match’d the incidents of jogging time;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And prov’d, that when with Tyranny opprest,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Poor <hi rend="ital">Phoebe</hi> groan’d with wounds and broken rest,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">
                     <hi rend="ital">George</hi> felt no less: was harassed and forlorn;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">A rope’s-end follow’d him both night and morn.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And in that very storm when <hi rend="ital">Phoebe</hi> fled,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">When the rain drench’d her yet unshelter’d head;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">That very Storm he on the Ocean brav’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The Vessel founder’d, and the Boy was sav’d!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Mysterious Heaven!—and O with what delight—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">She told the happy issue of her flight:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">To his charm’d heart a living picture drew;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And gave to hospitality its due!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">The list’ning Host observ’d the gentle Pair;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">And ponder’d on the means that brought them there:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Convinc’d, while unimpeach’d their Virtue stood,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">’Twas <hi rend="ital">Heav’n’s</hi> high Will that he should do them good.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But now the anxious Dame, impatient grown,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Demanded what the Youth had heard, or known,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Whereon to ground those doubts but just exprest;—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Doubts, which must interest the feeling breast;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">‘Her Brother wert thou, George?—how; prithee say:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">Canst thou forego, or cast that name away?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘No living proofs have I,’ the Youth reply’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">‘That we by closest ties are not allied;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent3">But in my memory live, and ever will,</l>

              and interesting narrative; sweet and full flow of verse; happy choice of the subject, and delightful execution of it. C. L.] omitted in

              by the rules of good fellowship, every person drinking out of one of these tankards was to swallow the quantity contained between two
              pins; if he drank more or less, he was to continue drinking till he ended at a pin: by this means persons unaccustomed to measure their
              draughts were obliged to drink the whole tankard. Hence when a person was a little elevated with liquor, he was said to have drunk to a

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Introduction</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s third major publication, <title>Good Tidings; or, News from the Farm </title>(1804), was a poem on the new
          medical treatment—vaccination—promoted since 1798 by the country doctor <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#JennerEdward">Edward Jenner</ref>. If this was unexpected from the poet of <title>The Farmer’s Boy </title>and <title>Rural Tales</title>, its form and content turned
          out to be familiar. In iambic pentameter couplets, the poem focused on the effects of smallpox in a rural village, relying on Bloomfield’s
          personal knowledge. As he wrote in the Advertisement, ‘it indulges in domestic anecdote. The account given of my infancy and of my father’s
          burial is not only poetically, but strictly true, and with me it has its weight accordingly. I have witnessed the destruction described in
          my brother’s family’. The manner and matter that made <title>The Farmer’s Boy </title>so full of conviction and appeal were thus re-created:
          Bloomfield wrote of his own childhood in the couplets used for ‘Giles’. An epigraph from <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ThomsonJames">Thomson</ref> also placed the new work in the same tradition as his first success. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The poem germinated from the enthusiasm of Jenner, who was a formidable self-promoter and wished to have his discovery
          recommended by the most fashionable poet of the day. Bloomfield, genuine in his gratitude for such a life-saving medical breakthrough, was
          somewhat disconcerted by Jenner’s pushiness. On 21 July 1802, he wrote to his brother <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref>, </p>
               <quote>I have seen Dr Jenner, and his kindness allmost induced me to shew him the little progress I have made in pursuit of his subject; but I
          suddenly determined to the contrary, and doubted of the propriety of so doing . . . This moment a Letter from Dr Jenner invites me to tea
          this evening. what shall I do? leave 150 lines of an unfinished subject in his hands? I am bound to consult <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref> and the <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Duke</ref> and to submit
          my pieces to their judgement; and never will do otherwise: and yet it is hard to say <hi rend="ital">no</hi> in such cases as this. I wish
          he would suspend his curiosity 6 months, and I would take my chance. He is a very amiable man, and perhaps rates my abilities too high. He
          is an enthusiast in his pursuit, and well he may; when it is taken up by every country in Europe and by the poor Cherokees of America. The
          blessing is surely immensely great!! (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.90.html">Letter
            90</ref>)</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Fearful of being supervised by yet another patron, and thus coming into conflict with his first patrons, Lofft and the Duke
          of Grafton, Bloomfield kept the unfinished draft to himself, and submitted it, when complete in April 1803, to Grafton for approval before
          letting Jenner see a copy. He did, however, compose and sing a song at the party held by the Royal Jennerian Society (Jenner’s campaigning
          organisation) celebrating Jenner’s birthday (17 May), thus becoming publicly associated with a man whose claim to be a benefactor of
          humanity was, while accepted by many, viewed by some as the self-advertisement of a mountebank.</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This piece was published in <title>The Gentleman’s Magazine </title>for June, (vol. 93, p. 551); it also appeared in
            <title>The Lady’s Magazine Or Entertaining Companion for the Fair Sex </title>in July (vol. 34, p. 383). Jenner, however, wanted it to be
          followed by the larger poem. He wrote to Bloomfield in summer 1803 ‘enquiring my determination as to the poem on Vaccination’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.113.html">Letter 113</ref>, 2 August 1803). Bloomfield,
          however, in the aftermath of the dispute caused by Lofft’s determination to supervise his publications, was wary of going to press. On 23
          December he wrote to Jenner’s neighbour, <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mary Lloyd Baker</ref>:</p>
               <quote>I have some time ago busied my brain and workd up my feelings to a great pitch in poetically celebrating the great victory obtain’d
          over the desease that kill’d my Father; and in which your neighbour and my friend <hi rend="ital">Dr Jenner</hi> is so immediately
          concern’d. The piece is still in existence, and I have allmost offended some worthy members of the medical world by keeping it
            unpublish’d. (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.119.html">Letter 119</ref>)</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It was not until May/June 1804 that the poem was published by <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#VernorThomas">Vernor</ref>

          Rees, and printed by Bloomfield’s friend <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SwanJames">James Swan</ref>. An extract from the poem, ‘recited
          at the anniversary meeting of the Royal Jennerian Society’ (1804) was published as a pamphlet. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Reviews were complimentary: discussing the description of the dying father and blinded child, the <title>Monthly
            Mirror</title> declared (17 (June 1804), 385–89 (p. 389)) ‘it is unnecessary to point out the several exquisite beauties of this passage.
          Those who feel them, need it not; and those who do not, could derive no advantage from it.—Give us the blind to instruct in colours, and the
          deaf in sounds, but let nothing be required of us, touching the man who is not sensible of the charms of these verses, except our pity’.
          Somewhat pointedly, it alluded to the disputes about the Preface to <title>The Farmer’s Boy </title>and notes to <title>Rural Tales</title>:
          ‘In this delightful labour of his Muse, Mr. <title>Bloomfield</title> has received no assistance from either his worthy and best friend Mr.
          Lofft or Dr. Jenner, but has depended entirely on himself for the notes subjoined’. The <title>British Critic</title>, (24 (1804), 314–15
          (p. 314)) endorsed this judgement that Bloomfield’s independent spirit was at full strength: the poem, it said, showed ‘new strong proof of
          his powers’.. ‘historical views of former ravages, and affecting narratives of private misfortune, all contribute to interest the reader in
          the great discovery’. It ‘contains beauties, which only a true genius for poetry could infuse’.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Jenner himself was delighted. On 21 October, he wrote expressing gratitude and offering a token of thanks: </p>
               <quote>I was in hopes long before this time to have been in town, and to have thank’d you in person for your very elegant &amp; pathetic poem
          on Vaccine Inoculation, which you have so handsomely dedicated to me and my Brethren of the Royal J. Society. It excited in me those
          emotions which all who read it must feel, that are not void of sensibility. I trust it will be as well received and gain as high
          commendation as the Farmers Boy—It need not obtain more.</quote>
               <quote>You must allow me to fix upon you some mark of my esteem &amp; friendship. Do me the favour then to accept a Silver Inkstand, into
          which the inclosed note may be soon converted, if you will call upon Messrs. Rundell &amp; Bridge, Silversmiths in Ludgate Hill, &amp; use
          my name. I should like the following plain Engraving upon it. Edward Jenner M.D. to Robert Bloomfield. (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.143.html">Letter 143</ref>)</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The method of publication was different from Bloomfield’s earlier volumes. Vernor and Hood only distributed the work, having
          bought no part of Bloomfield’s copyright. This deal seems to have reflected the publication’s purpose as a one-off piece of promotion for
          the campaign to popularize vaccination, it being intended to collect the poem in Bloomfield’s next major volume. The deal had consequences
          on sales, as Bloomfield noted in a letter to his brother (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.135.html">Letter 135</ref>) of 3 August 1804:</p>
               <quote>When you wonder that good tidings is not known or advertized, you have only to recolect that of the other works the Bookseler has <hi rend="ital">Half</hi>, and of this <hi rend="ital">nothing</hi>. The advertizing rests with myself, and I won’t do it, and Hood cannot be
          expected to push my work as he would his own, more particularly when he <hi rend="ital">knows</hi> that when in a vollumn he will have it
          partly his own property, when it will be worth his while to send it all over the empire? </quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">No second edition was called for, because from 1806 the poem was indeed incorporated in Bloomfield’s new collection,
            <title>Wild Flowers; or Pastoral and Local Poetry</title>, and was reissued in each edition of that volume. Here, the copytext is the
          first edition of 1804, collated with the 1806 text from <title>Wild Flowers </title>and with later editions of that publication and also
          with the 1809 stereotype <title>Poems of Robert Bloomfield </title>(and later editions thereof).</p>

            discovery, and the downfal of the Small-pox, it has generally and almost unexceptionably appeared a subject of little promise; peculiarly
            unfit indeed for poetry. My method of treating it has endeared it to myself, for it indulges in domestic anecdote. The account given of my
            infancy and of my father’s burial is not only poetically, but strictly true, and with me it has its weight accordingly. I have witnessed
            the destruction described in my brother’s family; and I have in my own insured the lives of four children by Vaccine Inoculation, who, I
            trust, are destined to look back upon the Small-pox as the scourge of days gone by. My hopes are high, and my prayers sincere, for its

                  <l rendition="#indent5">A wandering, way-worn, musing, singing guest. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">I claim the privilege of hill and plain; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Mine are the woods, and all that they contain; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">The unpolluted gale, which sweeps the glade; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">All the cool blessings of the solemn shade; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Health, and the flow of happiness sincere; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Yet there’s one wish,—I wish that thou wert here; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Free from the trammels of domestic care, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">With me these dear autumnal sweets to share;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">To share my heart’s ungovernable joy; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">And keep the birth-day of our poor lame boy. </l>

                  <l rendition="#indent5">That scenes like these, can soothe the harass’d mind,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent5">Thou know’st how much I love to steal away </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">From noise, from uproar, and the blaze of day; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">With double transport would my heart rebound </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">To lead thee, where the clustering nuts are found;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">No toilsome efforts would our task demand, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">For the brown treasure stoops to meet the hand. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Round the tall hazel, beds of moss appear</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">In green-swards nibbled by the forest deer, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Sun, and alternate shade; while o’er our heads </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">The cawing rook his glossy pinions spreads; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">The noisy jay, his wild-woods dashing through; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">The ring-dove’s chorus, and the rustling bough; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">The far resounding gate; the kite’s shrill scream; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">The distant ploughman’s halloo to his team.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">This is the chorus to my soul so dear; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">It would delight thee too, wert thou but here: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">For we might talk of home, and muse o’er days </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Of sad distress, and Heaven’s mysterious ways; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Our chequer’d fortunes, with a smile retrace, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">And build new hopes upon our infant race; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Pour our thanksgivings forth, and weep the while; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Or pray for blessings on our native isle. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">But vain the wish—Mary, thy sighs forbear, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Nor grudge the pleasure which thou canst not share;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Make home delightful, kindly wish for me, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">And I’ll leave hills, and dales, and woods for thee.</l>

                  <title>Wild Flowers; or, Pastoral and Local Poetry </title>(1806) was Bloomfield’s third collection. Slighter than its
          predecessor, <title>Rural Tales</title>, it continued in the same vein, comprising tales and ballads telling stories of villagers and
          village customs, loco-descriptive poems on local places and sentimental songs. To this familiar mixture Bloomfield added an ode, of
          sorts—‘To My Old Oak Table’, in which, in a lengthy prosopopeia, he addressed his writing desk and pondered the passing of time. <title>Wild
            Flowers</title> also collected the poem on vaccination, <title>Good Tidings; or, News from the Farm </title>that had been published alone
          in 1804.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The poems dated from the four-year period since <title>Rural Tales</title>, and they reflect Bloomfield’s
          professionalization. Having given up his shoemaking trade, and having been plied with books by literary gentlefolk who came to visit him, he
          had read more widely in poetry and poetics, and begun to formulate opinions concerning style and diction. Wordsworth was a positive
          influence, and Amelia Opie a negative one, as he explained in a letter to his brother of 2 September 1802 (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.94.html">Letter 94</ref>):</p>
               <quote>there is much truth in Wordsworth’s preface where he says that he had tried to come near the language of Men, and the language of Men
          is not backwards! I have a full persuasion that this is the greatest blemish of many poems, and has often a tendency to weaken the force of
          the line and diminish the ardour of the reader. Milton, no doubt, has done it to advantage; and when there comes another Milton he shall
          have my permission to do it too. Perhaps as inversions abound generally in sonnets, it may be the principal cause of my disrelish for
          them.</quote>
               <quote>The conclusion of poetical pieces, and the conclusion of sections and divisions therein certainly ought to improve, line by line, so as
          to finish with a twang, as the Boy said of his whip. A weak line at a close, is like a dying note of a weak voice when it should be full and
          sonorous; and full of soul; I could easily find instances but will leave the application to be made as you read whatever may next come into
          your hand.</quote>
               <quote>I have perhaps an unfounded aversion to tying three lines together in a measure where the ear expects but two. In Dryden’s Virgil I
          find it very frequent, and cannot see the advantage of it, you will of course not wonder that there are none to be found in what I have
          ventured into the world; and as I have thus far succeeded without, will not begin now.</quote>
               <quote>The choice of phrases in Ballads and Songs, and perhaps more in serious pieces, is of much importance; a common use of old worn out
          words I do not like, such as erst, whilom, and a thousand more; and yet to take up and use a word but just getting into circulation, newly
          adopted, or new coined, is like placing a new bright penny piece among a range of old ones, it will look like a broken rank, and besides run
          great hazard of rousing the risibility that arises from contempt rather than the smile due to true humour, suppose by way of illustrating
          this point, I had said originally in the Suffolk Ballad</quote>
               <quote>And laid aside her Lucks and twitches<lb/>
            And to the Hutch she reach’d her hand<lb/>
            And gave him out his Sunday <hi rend="ital">small-clothes</hi>! </quote>
               <quote>Perhaps <hi rend="ital">Breeches</hi> will one day be as old fashioned as doublet and jerkin, as in another case though the
          song says ‘With good old leathern bottle, and ale that looks so brown’ and yet I doubt that in another fifty years a leather bottle will not
          be found but in the song.</quote>
               <quote>Compound Epithets I do not much like; because they are often such as we never use in conversation; there are three in my
          ‘Word to the young ladies’ which I deem such as are often used in conversation, ‘full blown,’ ‘out-run’ but ‘half-expanded’ is not so
          common. In a poem by Mrs. Opie I find the following which are not used in conversation, Grief-impeded, fragrance-breathing, &amp;c and I
          think many may be found in most poems, but I am only telling you my notions of excellence, let every one chuse his own path.</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The poems in <title>Wild Flowers </title>practise what the letter preaches, completing a movement away from the Thomsonian
          diction of <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> that had begun in <title>Rural Tales.</title> ‘Barnham Water’, is an instance. Written shortly
          after this avowal of Wordsworthian rustic plainness, it bears traces of a reading of <title>Lyrical Ballads</title>, being a first-person
          account of a journey on foot through a familiar landscape, told in colloquial diction and featuring rhetorical questions and reflections on
          the place’s effect on the speaker’s reflective mind:</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Certainly the poem had begun as Bloomfield knew ‘Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey’ had begun: he recorded in a
          letter that it was the unexpected beauty of the landscape, experienced when <hi rend="ital">revisiting</hi> the area on a misty autumn day,
          that moved him to write a description of an earlier visit in the heat of summer.</p>
               <quote>The morning I left Bury turn’d out very foggy, and I was glad that I had determined to ride inside. At about half past six
          there appear’d a compleat semicircle or rainbow nearly in the West, which was evidently produced by the sun on the fog, the colour was pale,
          and not varied or mix’d. I observed particularly that as we ascended the high ground on the south of Sudbury we gradually surmounted the fog
          and found a fine clear morning; and that it has not dissipated, but lay on a level with the hill, filling up the whole valley; and watching
          its motions I perceived at many miles distance that as the day advanced, the fog had made a sensible and collected elevation and become a
          cloud, moving I believe nearly south-west—… Barnham Water has set my brains a-gadding, and I fear I shall not get rid of the subject untill

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The resultant poem seems almost self-consciously to consider embracing the role of the Wordsworthian nature-poet, only to
          stop at a self-erected barrier when Bloomfield concludes that his Muse is not fitted for lofty explorations of the imagination: the nature
          that moves him to verse is simply too flat and bare for Romanticism:</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">As when he withheld ‘To Immagination’ from publication, Bloomfield is evidently determined to set limits to his verse, to
          avoid using landscape description as a pretext to worship his own mind. Wordsworth was accused of puerility and egotism for doing so; a poet
          from the laboring classes was likely to attract even more damaging criticism of his pretensions.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘Shooter’s Hill’ was written in spring 1803 when Bloomfield went on a walking excursion to escape from the stress that a new
          job in the busy Seal Office was causing him. This poem was also Wordsworthian in theme: the hill walk in the country is an escape from
          physically and mentally destructive city life:</p>

               </lg>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">But again, Bloomfield recoils from identifying this insight with his own imaginative self, asserting instead that it is not
          for him to become the Bard of his native land:</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">He ends by rejecting the vanity involved in wishing that his work will make him revered by future generations, but is this
          merely to accede to, rather than protest against, or attempt to transcend, a comparative confinement of view that is forced upon him by a
          social status that puts the freedom to travel, and the confidence to speak, out of reach? Does Bloomfield too easily reconcile himself, in
          the name of virtue, to deference? Blake, another London artisan, might have thought so. If he did, it is nevertheless true that ‘Shooter’s
          Hill’ and ‘Barnham Water’, in their astute deployment of the language of empowerment that Wordsworth derived from topographical verse, put
          on display both his desire to achieve and difficulty in achieving a voice of personal and national authority. Self-assertive and
          self-denying by turns, they reveal his attraction to and refusal of ‘the internalization of the quest romance’ and in so doing they are
          symptomatic of the struggle of labouring-class poets to escape the subjects—rural life and labour—on which they were expected (and were
          themselves accustomed) to write.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘To My Old Oak Table’, begun in September and finished in December 1803, was more successful in maintaining a voice of
          personal authority than the topographical poems. The device of prosopopeia—speaking to an inanimate object—is justified by the symbolism of
          the table as being both a writing desk and a table for dining and household work. It places Bloomfield’s poetry, including this very poem,
          at the heart of family life, giving it the function of witnessing the joys and anxieties experienced over a span of years. Bloomfield gains
          confidence from this location, speaking frankly of poverty and illness, and their effect upon his mind and body, than ever before:</p>

               </lg>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Writing of himself writing in and through this domestic setting, he presents himself as a Romantic poet more confidently
          than he had at Shooter’s Hill and Barnham Water:</p>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">I pour’d the torrent of my feelings forth;</l>
                  <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">Conscious of <hi rend="ital">truth </hi>in Nature’s humble track,</l>
                  <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">And wrote ‘The Farmer’s Boy’ upon thy back!</l>
               </lg>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Here Bloomfield does not undercut his portrait of himself as inspired: he derives his verse from a spontaneous overflow of
          powerful feelings that is enabled by the act of writing upon a table that has been a stable presence in his domestic life for years. It
          allows him to take pride in the power of his poetry to bring things to life, and to preserve them from harm: </p>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">Enough, old friend:—thou’rt mine; and shalt partake,</l>
                  <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">While I have pen to write, or tongue to speak,</l>
                  <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">Whatever fortune deals me</l>
               </lg>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This assertion of friendship is implicitly a self-vindication as a father and as a man. It is notable that the egotism of
          this, and the self-absorbed history of feeling growing from ordinary life that prepares for it, are achieved in the pentameter couplets he
          had used in <title>The Farmer’s Boy. </title>Bloomfield remained a master of the couplet form, here adapting it to sustain his strongest
          meditation on himself—thereby Romanticising an eighteenth-century form.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Contrasting with the three first-person poems are three rural tales: ‘The Broken Crutch’, ‘The Horkey, and ‘Abner and the
          Widow Jones, a Familiar Ballad’. The last of these dates from August 1804, when Bloomfield notes that he was writing ‘a Ballad to be calld
          “the Ploughman,” in that stile in which I am best calculated to succeed’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.135.html">Letter 135</ref>). ‘That stile’ was comic and
          sentimental, in plain diction. The story concerns a middle-aged courtship and ends with a wedding. The ploughman gets the girl second time
          round, and the happy occasion is blessed when the farmer gives him his favourite old plough-horse, thus saving it from being killed for
          dog-meat. It’s a wish-fulfilment fantasy in which anxiety, poverty and social hierarchy are overcome: the rich help the poor and all ends
          happily. Bloomfield would write many tales of this kind, depicting villages as communities in which human need trumps financial
          self-interest and social division—moral economies. In ‘The Broken Crutch’ he even plays with the possibility of violence on the part of the
          labourers if their social superiors flagrantly infringe the traditional moral standards assumed to bind everyone in the community. But the
          spectre is raised only to be banished, as it turns out that the squire does not intend to seduce and abandon, but rather to marry, the lame
          labourer’s daughter. If these stories are sentimental, they are not merely fantastical. Bloomfield’s tales accord with Cobbett’s
            <title>Rural Rides </title>and Clare’s ‘Lament of Swordy Well’: each writer’s idealisation of the past as a better, kindlier place was
          rooted in experience of older ways of living being rapidly destroyed by the capitalisation of agriculture and resultant polarisation of
          social relations.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Raymond Williams, <title>The Country and the City </title>(London,
            1973).</note>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield suggests as much in ‘The Horkey’, his ballad about the festival held at harvest home, held at the squire’s and
          farmers’ expense, in which the labourers were encouraged, for one day a year, to eat, drink and party to excess. ‘These customs’, he wrote,
          ‘are going fast out of use; which is one great reason for my trying to tell the rising race of mankind that such were the customs when I was
          a boy’. Hone’s <title>Everyday Book </title>attempted a similar commemorative task, and proved very popular; Clare, inspired by Bloomfield,
          went on to celebrate the autumn festival of ‘St Martin’s Eve’. Clare’s poem was in one respect less authentic than Bloomfield’s: it did not,
          like ‘The Horkey’, use dialect words—a sign of Bloomfield’s taking further than before the Wordsworthian commitment to rural speech as a
          proper language for poetry. Terms such as ‘hake’, ‘sitch a mort’ and ‘cop’t’ required glossing in the notes: slang such as ‘by gom’ also
          featured, as did phonetically spelt corruptions like ‘arter’. This was highly unusual in polite verse printed in books, and relatively rare
          even in broadside ballads sold on the street: it aligned Bloomfield’s poetry with gossip, tale-telling and song-singing and with the tipsy
          tattler in the alehouse—a Burnsian turn that resonated differently in England, where a folk poet was not, as in Scotland, viewed as a
          revivalist of the national language against colonisation by southern English. <title>The Critical Review </title>was not alone in implying
          that such language was too vulgar for poetry—a complaint that Francis Jeffrey had made about <title>Lyrical Ballads </title>in 1802,
          although that collection included no labouring-class slang or Somerset dialect.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The volume was completed by ‘Mary’s Evening Sigh’, a slight lyric first published in the <title>Monthly Mirror </title>in
          September 1802, by a comic poem on visiting Ranelagh Gardens, by a hunting song, and by the revised ‘Good Tidings’ which, in this context,
          took on new resonance because, like ‘To My Old Oak Table’, and the Dedication, it dwelt on illness and disability in Bloomfield’s own
          family. Bloomfield’s son <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">Charles</ref> was lame, and in dedicating the volume to him he is both heartfelt and intimate to an unusual degree for a public
          format: ‘What a lasting, what an unspeakable satisfaction would it be to know that the Ballads, the Plowman Stories, and the “Broken Crutch”
          of your father would eventually contribute to lighten your steps to manhood, and make your own crutch, through life, rather a memorial of
          affection, than an object of sorrow’. The comic hero of ‘The Broken Crutch’ is helped by his brother to protect his daughter. The poems,
          that is, were Bloomfield’s paternalism in words, a fatherly legacy representing all he could do to lighten the burden of disability. The
          reader, at his point, feels as if intruding on a private, family affair: Bloomfield here presents himself and his family vulnerable, naked,
          an utter contrast to the framing of his poems and his life by patrons’ words in <title>The Farmer’s Boy </title>and<title> Rural
            Tales</title>.</p>

          confessional—Bloomfield apologized in it for having been moved to tears by his own recitation of his verse. Longmans referred Buchan’s

          honourable as it is, would involve consequences that I cannot explain. One of the most difficult tasks that arises from my extraordinary
          situation, for such perhaps with great truth I may call it, is so to act as not to wound the feelings of my good and voluntary friends, nor
          to violate my own. The Letter I long ago addrest to your Lordship is such perhaps as I ought not to be ashamed of, and such that no person
          would believe me did I pretend to it. But though I feel the intended honour, I feel too, other sensations that many perhaps could suppress:
          I feel that it would be a violation of my notions of delicacy to print it now. My object has been to abide by the most simple methods of
          acquiring reputation, the standing alone, as far as my abilities go, and as far as it can be done in justice to my friends. Thus it has
          happened that of the many letters which I have had from his <ref type="m"

          1806)</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Sales were a reason for Bloomfield’s feeling able to resist incorporating the recommendations of the great and good. He was
          able to tell <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BuchanLord">Buchan</ref> ‘A second edition of five thousand copies of “Wild Flowers”, is just now publishing’, meaning a first edition of that
          number was already close to selling out. Reviews were another reason: the consensus of the journals was that the collection proved
          Bloomfield’s consistency: he was no one-hit-wonder but a poet in command of his craft. Most praised ‘Good Tidings’; <title>The Monthly
            Magazine</title> especially admired the tales: ‘the genius and simplicity which marked the features of his first productions are equally
          observable in the poetry of the present volume. The Tale of the Broken Crutch, and the poem To my old Oak Table, are among the best of the
          local poetry mentioned in the title’ (24 Part 2 (1807), 629). The <title>Monthly Mirror</title> singled out the new emphasis on the poet
          himself, and his talent for comedy: ‘the humour with which it is intermixed, shews the poet under new circumstances, and the diffidence of
          his own abilities, perceivable in his former productions, is not so visible in the volume before us, which evinces an extraordinary portion
          of mental vigour and invention; and we can confidently predict, that so long as Mr. Bloomfield adheres to the present species of poetry, he
          need be under no apprehensions for the success of a “third,” or fourth “attempt”’ (21 (1806), 242–46). The <title>Critical Review</title> was
          more—critical—finding the prosopopeia of ‘To My Old Oak Table’ too extended to be credible and, echoing common criticisms of Wordsworth,
          judging the tales too commonplace and prosaic to be poetry:</p>
               <quote>There is a nerveless imbecility of conception which pervades the whole volume, a mediocrity of spirit which occasionally reaches a
          pretty thought, but never ventures to one that is bold or energetic. Without enthusiasm what is poetry? It is prose, not run mad, but
          unworthily held in the fetters of rhyme. The frenzy of inspiration, whether truly or falsely poetical, may for the peace and good order of
          the king’s English, be entrusted to the manacles of verse; but wherefore should trite thoughts and poor innocent expressions, guiltless of
          all fire and fury, be abridged of their natural liberty, and ‘<hi rend="ital">deprosed</hi>’ into rhyme? To versify such thoughts is like
          consigning a palsied patient to a keeper and a strait waistcoat.</quote>

          and Edwards were superseded by J. Booker; G. Cowie &amp; Co.; and Edwards and Knibb. The collection was still selling in the 1820s and a
          posthumous edition, negotiated by Bloomfield’s daughter Hannah, appeared in 1826. It was published, collected with <title>The Farmer’s Boy
          </title>and <title>Rural Tales</title>, many times in the 1830s and 1840s after copyright lapsed. All of the poems in <title>Wild Flowers</title>, with the exception of <title>Good Tidings</title>, which was included in a separate volume with <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>, were reprinted in the second volume of the Stereotype edition (1809).</p>

            back on your father’s poetical progress through life, you may conclude that he had many to boast as friends, whose names, in a dedication,
            would have honoured both him and his children; but you must also reflect, that to particularize such friends was a point of peculiar
            delicacy. The earliest patron of my unprotected strains has the warm thanks which are his due, for the introduction of blessings which
            have been diffused through our whole family, and nothing will ever change this sentiment. But amidst a general feeling of gratitude, which
            those who know me will never dispute, I feel for you, Charles, what none but parents can conceive; and on your account, my dear boy, there
            can be no harm in telling the world that I hope these ‘Wild Flowers’ will be productive of sweets of the worldly kind; for your
            unfortunate lameness (should it never be removed) may preclude you from the means of procuring comforts and advantages which might
            otherwise have fallen to your share. </hi>

            life, rather a memorial of affection, than an object of sorrow. </hi>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                  <hi rend="smcaps">A man</hi> of the first eminence, in whose day (fortunately perhaps for me) I was not destined to appear before the public, or to
          abide the Herculean crab-tree of his criticism, Dr. Johnson, has said, in his preface to Shakspeare, that— ‘Nothing can please many, and
          please long, but just representations of general nature.’ My representations of nature, whatever may be said of their <hi rend="ital">justness</hi>, are not <hi rend="ital">general</hi>, unless we admit, what I suspect to be the case, that nature in a village is very
          much like nature every where else. It will be observed that all my pictures are from humble life, and most of my heroines servant maids.
          Such I would have them: being fully persuaded that, in no other way would my endeavours, either to please or to instruct, have an equal
          chance of success.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The path I have thus taken, from necessity, as well as from choice, is well understood and approved by hundreds, who are
          capable of ranging in the higher walks of literature.—But with due deference to their superior claim, I confess, that no recompense has been
          half so grateful or half so agreeable to me as female approbation. To be readily and generally understood, to have my simple Tales almost
          instinctively relished by those who have so decided an influence over the lives, hearts, and manners of us all, is the utmost stretch of my
          ambition.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I here venture, before the public eye, a selection from the various pieces which have been the source of much pleasure, and
          the solace of my leisure hours during the last four years, and since the publication of the ‘Rural Tales.’ Perhaps, in some of them, more of
          mirth is intermingled than many who know me would expect, or than the severe will be inclined to approve. But surely what I can say, or can
          be expected to say, on subjects of country life, would gain little by the seriousness of a preacher, or by exhibiting fallacious
          representations of what has long been termed <hi rend="ital">Rural Innocence</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The Poem of ‘Good Tidings’ is partially known to the world, but, as it was originally intended to assume its present
          appearance and size, I have gladly availed myself of an endeavour to improve it; and, from its present extended circulation, I trust it will
          be new to thousands.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I anticipate some approbation from such readers as have been pleased with the ‘Rural Tales;’ yet, though I will not falsify
          my own feelings by assuming a diffidence which I do not conceive to be either manly or becoming, the conviction that some reputation is
          hazarded in ‘a third attempt,’ is impressed deeply on my mind.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">With such sentiments, and with a lively sense of the high honour, and a hope of the bright recompence, of applause from the
          good, when heightened by the self-approving voice of my own conscience, I commit the book to its fate.</p>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">I love thee like a child. Thou wert to me</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The dumb companion of my misery,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And oftner of my joys;—then as I spoke,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I shar’d thy sympathy, Old Heart of Oak!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For surely when my labour ceas’d at night,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With trembling, feverish hands, and aching sight,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The draught that cheer’d me and subdu’d my care,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">On thy broad shoulders thou wert proud to bear.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">O’er thee, with expectation’s fire elate,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I’ve sat and ponder’d on my future fate:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">On thee, with winter muffins for thy store,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I’ve lean’d, and quite forgot that I was poor.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Where dropp’d the acorn that gave birth to thee?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Can’st thou trace back thy line of ancestry?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">We’re match’d, old friend, and let us not repine,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Darkness o’erhangs thy origin and mine;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Both may be truly honourable: yet,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">We’ll date our honours from the day we met;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When, of my worldly wealth the parent stock,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Right welcome up the Thames from Woolwich Dock</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Thou cam’st, when hopes ran high, and love was young;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But soon our olive-branches round thee sprung;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Soon came the days that tried a faithful wife</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The noise of children, and the cares of life.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then, midst the threat’nings of a wintry sky,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">
                     <hi rend="ital">That cough</hi> which blights the bud of infancy,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The dread of parents, Rest’s inveterate foe,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Came like a plague, and turn’d my songs to woe.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Rest! without thee what strength can long survive,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What spirit keep the flame of Hope alive?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The midnight murmur of the cradle gave</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Sounds of despair; and chilly as the grave</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">We felt its undulating blast arise,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Midst whisper’d sorrows and ten thousand sighs.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Expiring embers warn’d us each to sleep,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">By turns to watch alone, by turns to weep,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">By turns to hear, and keep from starting wild,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The sad, faint wailings of a dying child.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But Death, obedient to Heav’n’s high command,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Withdrew his jav’lin, and unclench’d his hand;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The little sufferers triumph’d over pain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Their mother smil’d, and bade me hope again.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet Care gain’d ground, Exertion triumph’d less,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Thick fell the gathering terrors of Distress;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Anxiety, and Griefs without a name,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Had made their dreadful inroads on my frame;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The creeping Dropsy, cold as cold could be,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Unnerv’d my arm, and bow’d my head to thee.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Thou to thy trust, old friend, hast not been true;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">These eyes the bitterest tears they ever knew</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Let fall upon thee; now all wip’d away;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But what from memory shall wipe out that day?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The great, the wealthy of my native land,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To whom a guinea is a grain of sand,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I thought upon them, for my <hi rend="ital">thoughts </hi>were free,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But all unknown were then my woes and me.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Still, Resignation was my dearest friend,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Reason pointed to a glorious end;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With anxious sighs, a parent’s hopes and pride,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I wish’d to live—I trust I could have died!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But winter’s clouds pursu’d their stormy way,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And March brought sunshine with the length’ning day,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And bade my heart arise, that morn and night</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Now throbb’d with irresistible delight.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Delightful ’twas to leave disease behind,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And feel the renovation of the mind!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To lead abroad, upborne on Pleasure’s wing,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Our children, midst the glories of the spring;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Our fellow-sufferers, our only wealth,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To gather daisies in the breeze of health!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">’Twas then, too, when our prospects grew so fair,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Sabbath bells announc’d the morning pray’r;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Beneath that vast gigantic dome we bow’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That lifts its flaming cross above the cloud;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Had gain’d the centre of the chequer’d floor;—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That instant, with reverberating roar</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Burst forth the pealing organ—mute we stood;—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The strong sensation boiling through my blood,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Rose in a storm of joy, allied to pain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I wept, and worshipp’d  <hi rend="smcaps">God</hi>, and wept again;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And felt, amidst the fervor of my praise,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The sweet assurances of better days.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">In that gay season, honest friend of mine,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I marked the brilliant sun upon thee shine;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Imagination took her flights so free,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">
                     <hi rend="ital">Home</hi> was delicious with my book and thee,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The purchas’d nosegay, or brown ears of corn,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Were thy gay plumes upon a summer’s morn</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Awakening memory, that disdains control,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They spoke the darling language of my soul:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They whisper’d tales of joy, of peace, of truth,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And conjur’d back the sunshine of my youth:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Fancy presided at the joyful birth,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I pour’d the torrent of my feelings forth;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Conscious of <hi rend="ital">truth </hi>in Nature’s humble track,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And wrote ‘The Farmer’s Boy’ upon thy back!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Enough, old friend:—thou’rt mine; and shalt partake,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">While I have pen to write, or tongue to speak,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Whatever fortune deals me.—Part with thee!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">No, not till death shall set my spirit free;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For know, should plenty crown my life’s decline,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A most important duty may be thine:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then, guard me from Temptation’s base control,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">From apathy and littleness of soul.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The sight of thy old frame, so rough, so rude,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Shall twitch the sleeve of nodding Gratitude;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Shall teach me but to venerate the more</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Honest Oak Tables and their guests—the poor:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Teach me unjust distinctions to deride,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And falsehoods gender’d in the brain of Pride;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Shall give to Fancy still the cheerful hour,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To Intellect, its freedom and its power;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To Hospitality’s enchanting ring</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A charm, which nothing but thyself can bring.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The man who would not look with honest pride</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">On the tight bark that stemm’d the roaring tide,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And bore him, when he bow’d the trembling knee,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Home, through the mighty perils of the sea,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I love him not.—He ne’er shall be my guest;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nor sip my cup, nor witness how I’m blest;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nor lean, to bring my honest friend to shame,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A sacrilegious elbow on thy frame;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But thou through life a monitor shalt prove,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Sacred to Truth, to Poetry, and Love.</l>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">
                  <hi rend="smcaps">advertisement</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                  <hi rend="smcaps">In</hi> the descriptive ballad which follows, it will be evident that I have endeavoured to preserve the style of a gossip, and
          to transmit the memorial of a custom, the extent or antiquity of which I am not acquainted with, and pretend not to inquire.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In Suffolk husbandry the man who, (whether by merit or by sufferance I know not) goes foremost through the harvest with the
          scythe or the sickle, is honoured with the title of ‘<hi rend="ital">Lord</hi>,’ and at the Horkey, or harvest-home feast, collects what he
          can, for himself and brethren, from the farmers and visitors, to make a ‘frolick’ afterwards, called ‘the largess spending.’ By way of
          returning thanks, though perhaps formerly of much more, or of different signification, they immediately leave the seat of festivity, and
          with a very long and repeated shout of a ‘largess’ (the number of shouts being regulated by the sums given) seem to wish to make themselves
          heard by the people of the surrounding farms. And before they rejoin the company within, the pranks and the jollity I have endeavoured to
          describe, usually take place. These customs, I believe, are going fast out of use; which is one great reason for my trying to tell the
          rising race of mankind that such were the customs when I was a boy. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I have annexed a glossary of such words as may be found by general readers to require explanation: And will add a short
          extract from Sir Thomas Brown, of Norwich, M. D. who was born three years before Milton, and outlived him eight years.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘It were not impossible to make an original reduction of many words of no general reception in <hi rend="ital">England</hi>,
          but of common use in <hi rend="ital">Norfolk</hi>, or peculiar to the <hi rend="ital">East-Angle</hi> counties; as Baund, Bunny, Thurk,
          Enemis, Matchly, Sammodithee, Mawther, Kedge, Seele, Straft, Clever, Dere, Nicked, Stingy, Noneare, Feft, Thepes, Gosgood, Kamp, Sibret,
          Fangast, Sap, Cothish, Thokish, Bide-owe, Paxwax. Of these, and some others, of no easy originals, when time will permit, the resolution
          shall be attempted; which to effect, the Danish language, new, and more ancient, may prove of good advantage: which nation remained here
          fifty years upon agreement, and have left many families in it; and the language of these parts had surely been more commixed and perplex, if
          the fleet of <hi rend="ital">Hugo de Bones</hi> had not been cast away, wherein threescore thousand souldiers, out of Britany and Flanders,
          were to be wafted over, and were, by King <hi rend="ital">John</hi>’s appointment, to have a settled habitation in the counties of <hi rend="ital">Norfolk </hi>and <hi rend="ital">Suffolk</hi>.’—Tract the viii. on Languages, particularly the Saxon. Folio, 1686, page

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Of woodland birds that loud at day-break sing,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Of joyful import to the poor hard by,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">The moat remains; the dwelling is no more!</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Smil’d on his peace, and met his tranquil eye</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Inverted, from the foot-bridge on his way</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To that still house where all his fathers lay;</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">The stranger girl was just before his pew!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He saw her kneel, with meek, but cheerful air,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And whisper the response to every prayer;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And, when the humble roof with praises rung,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He caught the Hallelujah from her tongue,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Rememb’ring with delight the tears that fell</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When the poor father bade his child farewell;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And now, by kindling tenderness beguil’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He blest the prompt obedience of that child,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And link’d his fate with hers:—for, from that day,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Whether the weeks past cheerily away,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Or deep revolving doubts procur’d him pain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The same bells chim’d—and there she was again!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What could be done? they came not there to woo,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">On holy ground,—though love is holy too.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">They met upon the foot-bridge one clear morn,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She in the garb by village lasses worn;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He, with unbutton’d frock that careless flew,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And buskin’d to resist the morning dew;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With downcast look she courtsied to the ground,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Just in his path—no room to sidle round.</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Honour took charge of love so well begun,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Above control, pursued his generous way,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And talk’d to Peggy of the marriage day.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Poor girl! she heard, with anguish and with doubt,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What her too-knowing neighbours preach’d about,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That Herbert would some nobler match prefer,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And surely never, never marry her;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet, with what trembling and delight she bore</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The kiss, and heard the vow, ‘I’ll doubt no more;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Protect me, Herbert, for your honour’s sake</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">You will,’ she cried, ‘nor leave my heart to break.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then wrote to uncle Gilbert, joys, and fears,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And hope, and trust, and sprinkled all with tears.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Rous’d was the dormant spirit of the brave,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">E’en lameness rose to succour and to save;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For, though they both rever’d young Herbert’s name,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And knew his unexceptionable fame;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And though the girl had honestly declar’d</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet, that he truly meant to take for life</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The poor and lowly Peggy for a wife;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Or, that she was not doom’d to be deceiv’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Was out of bounds:—it <hi rend="ital">could not </hi>be believ’d.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Go, Gilbert, save her; I, you know, am lame;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Go, brother, go, and save my child from shame.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Haste, and I’ll pray for your success the while,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Go, go;’—then bang’d his crutch upon the stile:—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">It snapt.—E’en Gilbert trembled while he smote,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then whipt the broken end beneath his coat;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Ay, ay, I’ll settle them; I’ll let them see</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Who’s to be conqu’ror this time, I or he!’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Then off he set, and with enormous strides,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Rebellious mutterings and oaths besides,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">O’er clover-field and fallow, bank and briar,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Pursu’d the nearest cut, and fann’d the fire</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That burnt within him.—Soon the Hall he spied,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And the grey willows by the water side;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nature cried ‘halt!’ nor could he well refuse;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Stop, Gilbert, breathe awhile, and ask <hi rend="ital">the news</hi>.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘News?’ cried a stooping grandame of the vale,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Ay, rare news too; I’ll tell you such a tale;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But let me rest; this bank is dry and warm;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Do you know Peggy Meldrum at the farm?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Young Herbert’s girl? He’as cloth’d her all in white,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">You never saw so beautiful a sight!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Ah! he’s a fine young man, and such a face!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I knew his grandfather and all his race;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He rode a tall white horse, and look’d so big,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But how shall I describe his hat and wig?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Plague take his wig,’ cried Gilbert, ‘and his hat,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where’s Peggy Meldrum? can you tell me <hi rend="ital">that</hi>?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Ay; but have patience, man! you’ll hear anon,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For I shall come to her as I go on,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">So hark’ye friend; his grandfather I say,’—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Poh, poh,’—cried Gilbert, as he turn’d away.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Her eyes were fix’d, her story at a stand,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The snuff-box lay half open’d in her hand;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘You great, ill-manner’d clown! but I must bear it;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">You oaf; to ask the news, and then won’t hear it!’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But Gilbert had gain’d forty paces clear,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When the reproof came murmuring on his ear.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Again he ask’d the first that pass’d him by;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A cow-boy stopt his whistle to reply.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Why, I’ve a mistress coming home, that’s all,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They’re playing Meg’s diversion at the Hall;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For master’s gone, with Peggy, and his cousin,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And all the lady-folks, about a dozen,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">For that it seems is what they’re gone about;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I know it by their laughing and their jokes,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Tho’ they <hi rend="ital">wor’nt </hi>ask’d at church like other folks.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">Gilbert kept on, and at the Hall-door found</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The winking servants, where the jest went round:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">All expectation; aye, and so was he,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But not with heart so merry and so free.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The kitchen table, never clear from beef,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where hunger found its solace and relief,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Free to all strangers, had no charms for him,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For agitation worried every limb;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Ale he partook, but appetite had none,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And grey-hounds watch’d in vain to catch the bone.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">All sounds alarm’d him, and all thoughts perplex’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With dogs, and beef, himself, and all things vex’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Till with one mingled caw above his head,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Their gliding shadows o’er the court-yard spread,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The rooks by thousands rose: the bells struck up;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He guess’d the cause, and down he set the cup,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And listening, heard, amidst the general hum,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A joyful exclamation, ‘Here they come!’—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Soon Herbert’s cheerful voice was heard above,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Amidst the rustling hand-maids of his love,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Gilbert follow’d without thought or dread,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The broad oak stair-case thunder’d with his tread;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Light tript the party, gay as gay could be,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Amidst their bridal dresses—there came he!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And with a look that guilt could ne’er withstand,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Approach’d his niece and caught her by the hand,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Now are you married, Peggy, yes or no?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Tell me at once, before I let you go!’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Abrupt he spoke, and gave her arm a swing,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But the same moment felt the wedding ring,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And stood confus’d.—She wip’d th’empassion’d tear,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘I am, I am; but is my father here?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Herbert stood by, and sharing with his bride,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That perturbation which she strove to hide;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Come, honest Gilbert, you’re too rough this time,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Indeed here’s not the shadow of a crime;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But where’s your brother? When did you arrive?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">We waited long, for Nathan went at five!’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">All this was Greek to Gilbert, downright Greek;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He knew not what to think, nor how to speak.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The case was this; that Nathan with a cart</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To fetch them both at day-break was to start.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And so he did—but ere he could proceed,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He suck’d a charming portion with a reed,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Used a hollow reed as a drinking straw
              to siphon off enough wedding-ale (‘a charming portion’) to get drunk.]</note>
                  </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Of that same wedding-ale, which was that day</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To make the hearts of all the village gay;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Brim full of glee he trundled from the Hall,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And as for sky-larks, he out-sung them all;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Till growing giddy with his morning cup,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He, stretch’d beneath a hedge, the reins gave up;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The horse graz’d soberly without mishap,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Nathan had a most delightful nap</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For three good hours—Then, doubting, when he woke,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Whether his conduct would be deem’d a joke,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With double haste perform’d just half his part,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And brought the lame John Meldrum in his cart.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And at the moment Gilbert’s wrath was high,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And while young Herbert waited his reply,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The sound of rattling wheels was at the door;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘There’s my dear father now,’—they heard no more,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The bridegroom glided like an arrow down,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Gilbert ran, though something of a clown,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With his best step; and cheer’d with smiles and pray’rs,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They bore old John in triumph up the stairs:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Poor Peggy, who her joy no more could check,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Clung like a dewy woodbine round his neck.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And all stood silent—Gilbert, off his guard,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And marvelling at virtue’s rich reward,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Loos’d the one loop that held his coat before,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Down thumpt the broken crutch upon the floor!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They started, half alarm’d, scarce knowing why,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But through the glist’ning rapture of his eye</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The bridegroom smil’d, then chid their simple fears,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And rous’d the blushing Peggy from her tears;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Around the uncle in a ring they came,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And mark’d his look of mingled pride and shame.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent5">‘Now honestly, good Gilbert, tell us true,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What meant this cudgel? What was it to do?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I know your heart suspected me of wrong,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And that most true affection urg’d along</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Your feelings and your wrath; you were beside</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Till now the rightful guardian of the bride.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But why this cudgel?’—‘Guardian! that’s the case,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Or else to-day you had not seen my face,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> you . . . face] I had not seen this

                  <l rendition="#indent4">But John about the girl was so perplex’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And I, to tell the truth, so mortal vex’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That when he broke <hi rend="ital">this crutch</hi>, and stampt and cried,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For John and Peggy, Sir, I could have died,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Aye, that I could; for she was such a child,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent5">A burst of laughter rang throughout the Hall,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And Peggy’s tongue, though overborne by all,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Pour’d its warm blessings; for, without control</l>

            I would not willingly forget. [Shooter’s Hill is near Woolwich, south-east London, on the old London to Dover high road. It commands ‘a
            most extensive and variegated prospect, overlooking as large a city and as fine a country as any in the universe’ (Brayley, <title>Views
              in Suffolk</title>, p. 53). It was a favourite destination for artisan outings in the period.]</note>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">[Brayley’s note:]  <hi rend="smcaps">Bloomfield</hi> has favoured us with permission to copy the annexed portrait of his mother from a picture in
          his possession, and has himself subjoined the following account of the last stage of her life, together with his first essay in Blank verse,
          which he has addressed to the <hi rend="ital">Spindle </hi>that she left <hi rend="ital">half filled</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">[Bloomfield’s note:] The portrait of my mother was taken on her last visit to London, in the summer of 1804, and about six
          months previous to her dissolution. During the period of evident decline in her strength and faculties, she conceived, in place of that
          patient resignation which she had before felt, an ungovernable dread of ultimate want, and observed to a relative, with peculiar emphasis,
          that ‘to meet  <hi rend="smcaps">Winter, Old Age</hi>, and  <hi rend="smcaps">Poverty</hi>, was like meeting three giants.’</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">To the last hour of her life she was an excellent spinner; and latterly, the peculiar kind of wool she spun, was brought
          exclusively for her, as being the only one in the village, who exercised their industry on so fine a sort. During the tearful paroxysms of
          her last depression she spun with the utmost violence, and with vehemence exclaimed —‘<hi rend="ital">I must spin!</hi>’ A paralytic
          affection, struck her whole right side, while at work, and obliged her to quit her spindle when only half filled, and she died within a
          fortnight afterwards! I have that spindle now. She was buried on the last day of the year 1804. She returned from her visit to London, on
          Friday, the 29th of June, just to a day, twenty-three years after she brought me to London, which was also on a Friday, in the year
          1781.</p>

          Mother’s Picture. This fragment of Bloomfield forms a noble companion to them. It strikes me to be written in a loftier tone, and still more
          excellent manner than any of his other productions. Let him give new delight and astonishment to the world by a moral and descriptive poem
          in blank verse!</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s interest in music was of longstanding: he had, before marrying, been a fiddle player and he continued to write
          verse for composers to set. Many of his songs were arranged for piano and harp. It was not until 1806, however, that Bloomfield took up, as
          a trade, the manufacture of Aeolian harps, telling his friend <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#InskipThomas">Thomas Inskip</ref> that ‘I
          find such pleasure in the use of the saw and the plane that I am determined to … attack the Harps tomorrow’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.189.html">Letter 189</ref>; 27 June 1806). He gave harps to
          his genteel friends and sold them to their friends: <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ParkThomas">Thomas Park</ref>, the editor, and his
          wife Maria Hester, were amongst the earliest to receive an instrument. Mrs Park then published a sonnet in thanks. Her ‘Addressed to an
          Eolian Harp, constructed by the Author of “The Farmer’s Boy”, “Wild Flowers”, &amp;c.’ was published in <title>The Monthly Mirror</title>
          (21 (1806), 196):</p>

          Bloomfield to James Thomson’s poetic tributes to the instrument, ‘the charming lines in the “Castle of Indolence”,’ and ‘his exquisite “Ode

          1806). Thus edified, Bloomfield was able, in other letters, to make the instrument’s poetic heritage part of the package that would
          recommend it to his patrons and customers. Writing to the <ref type="m"

               <quote>I cannot conclude without informing your Lordship, whom I know to be possessd of a love for nature’s music, and a fund of fancys, that
          I have lately taken up a new and most agreeable trade, that of constructing Eolian Harps. I am become rather dextrous in the use of the
          plane and the glue-pot, and find a demand that I am hardly able to satisfy. Can any thing in Nature, or even in imagination, exceed the tone
          of that simple instrument? Your unrivalled Thompson knew it well. Witness his Castle of Indolence, the finest lines that can possibly be
          written on the subject.

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">From letters such as these came the idea of printing an anthology of writings on the Aeolian Harp to give out, with the

               <quote>your idea of my being in the road to <hi rend="ital">publish</hi> what I can gather as to the nature of the Harp, is wrong. I only
          thought of printing a few copies for private distribution to such of my customers as profess’d to know nothing on the subject, and just to
          make it pay its own expence, and stand as a profess’d compilation on that particular themes. It would save me much talking, and that to me
          is a material thing.</quote>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">By the winter of 1807 ill-health and delays at the engraver had left Bloomfield seriously in arrears with his harp orders,
          and although the manuscript was printed by his friend <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SwanJames">James Swan</ref> in 1808 for
          distribution with each harp sold, production began to languish. It picked up in December 1808, when Bloomfield’s musical brother <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac</ref> came to stay in London. ‘We are making Harps by the dozen’, Bloomfield
          recorded (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.234.html">Letter 234</ref>). This flurry of
          manufacture did not last, however, as Bloomfield succumbed to migraines, eye problems and rheumatism, and became plagued by poverty. His
          last mention of building harps comes in a letter of 1811. <title>Nature’s Music</title> also languished until in 1822, Bloomfield, by now in
          dire financial straits, wondered whether it might be reprinted, and perhaps form a means of raising money through subscription (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.365.html">Letter 365</ref>). This did not occur.</p>

                  <hi rend="smcaps">If</hi> we look into Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary, we find that ‘Æolus, the King of Storms and Winds, was the son of
          Hippotas: he reigned over Æolia<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] This Æolia was either a country of Asia Minor,
            near the Ægean sea, or the seven islands lying between Sicily and Italy, now called the Lipari islands, which Virgil calls the kingdom of
            Æolus, the God of Storms and Winds.</note>; and because he was the inventor of sails, and a great astronomer, the poets have called him
          the God of the Wind. It is said that he confined in a bag, and gave Ulysses, all the winds that could blow against his vessel when he
          returned to Ithaca. The companions of Ulysses untied the bag, and gave the winds their liberty. Æolus was indebted to Juno for his royal
          dignity, according to Virgil.’ </p>

          that, when my friends call, none but Æolus himself can oblige them with the vibration of a single string. But let them take the instrument

          and to give the unguarded a crick in the neck.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">A satisfactory account of this instrument may be found in Sir John Hawkins’s ‘General History of the Science and Practice of
          Music,’ published in 1776, in five volumes, 4to.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In a preliminary discourse I find the following information:</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘The Harp of Æolus, as it is called, on which so much has been lately said and wrote, was constructed by Kircher above a
          century ago, and is accurately described in his Musurgia Universalis.’<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Athanasius Kircher, Musurgia
            Universalis, 2 vols (Rome, 1650).]</note> And in vol. iv. p. 218, Sir John makes the following remark, together with a translated extract
          from Kircher’s work:</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘In book ix, in a chapter entitled <title>De Sympathia</title>, &amp;c. Kircher mentions a contrivance of his own, an
          instrument which a few years ago was obtruded upon the public as a new invention, and called the Harp of Æolus, of which he thus speaks: </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">As the following instrument is new, so also is it easy to construct, and pleasant; and is heard in my museum to the great
          admiration of every one. It is silent as long as the window in which it is placed remains shut, but, as soon as it is opened, behold an
          harmonious sound on the sudden arises, that astonishes the hearers: for they are not able to perceive from whence the sound proceeds, nor
          yet what kind of instrument it is, for it resembles neither the sound of a stringed, nor yet of a pneumatic instrument, but partakes of
          both. The instrument is made of pine wood; it is five palms long, two broad, and one deep; it may contain fifteen or more chords, all equal,
          and composed of the intestines of animals. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The method of tuning it now remains, which is not, as in other instruments, by thirds, fourths, fifths, or eighths; but all
          the chords are to be tuned to an unison, or in octaves. It is very wonderful, and nearly paradoxical, that chords thus tuned should
          constitute different harmony. As this musical phenomenon has not as yet been observed by any one that I know of, I shall describe the
          instrument very minutely, to the end that it may be searched into very narrowly, and the effects produced by it accounted for; but first I
          shall show the conditions of the instrument, and where it ought to be fixed.”</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">These conditions differ from modern usage; and it is worthy of remark that the length of Kircher’s harp (if he called it a
          harp, for the name seems to be more modern) was but five palms, or fifteen inches; which is not more than half the usual width of our common
          sashes. That a greater length of string gives a sonorous and organ-like tone to the instrument I know by experience, and therefore conclude
          that its power and compass are thereby proportionably increased. Perhaps it is not impossible, or unlikely, that improvements may still be
          made, and its powers called forth in a much higher degree. Kircher goes on to describe a method of conducting the air through the strings of
          his instrument by means of what he terms valves, or boards so placed as to concentrate the breeze. This method I think too cumbersome and
          difficult to be practised in a dwelling-house, except a window could be set apart on purpose: but perhaps would answer in a garden, or open
          situation. I have made no attempt hitherto to reduce it to practice: but as this is intended to be a book of extracts, I shall proceed to
          another pleasing and circumstantial account of the Eolian harp, to be found in Jones’ ‘Physiological Disquisitions,’ page 338.—1781.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [William Jones (1726–1800), <title>Physiological Disquisitions: Or, Discourses on the Natural
              Philosophy of the Elements </title>(1781).]</note>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘It was observed above, that as action and reaction are equal, the effect is the same, whether the sonorous body strikes the
          air, or the air strikes the sonorous body. In the case of a musical pipe this is plain enough; but it was not so well known, nor could it be
          so familiarly proved, till of late years, that the air can begin of itself to produce the effect, and fetch music out of a string, as a
          string fetches music out of the air. We have now a curious illustration of this fact from the instrument called an Eolian harp. How far the
          ancients were masters of this experiment is uncertain; but it has long been known that the wind would bring musical sounds from the strings
          of an instrument. In the Jewish Talmud, where we should scarcely expect to find any thing valuable in philosophy, the wind is reported to
          have brought music out of the harp of David; which, as it is there said, “being every midnight constantly blown upon by the north wind,
          warbled of itself”.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Jones’s note:] Talmud in Berac, folio 6.</note>

          afford him, I see nothing of it. To the best of my knowledge, it was not taken from either of these authors when it was revived of late
          years in England. When Mr. Pope was translating Homer,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Alexander Pope’s translations of <title>The
              Iliad </title>(1715–20) and <title>Odyssey </title>(1726).</note> he had frequent occasion to consult the Greek commentary of
          Eustathius; where he met with a passage, in which it was suggested that the blowing of the wind against musical strings would produce
          harmonious sounds.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Eustathius of Thessalonica (c. 1115–9/6) mentioned the fact in his Commentary on
            Homer, first printed Rome, 1542–50.</note> This was communicated to Mr. Oswald,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> James Oswald
            (1711–69).</note> a master of the violoncello, from North Britain, and an ingenious composer in the Scotch style, who himself gave me the
          following account many years ago, when I was under him as a practitioner in music. When he had received the hint of Mr. Pope’s discovery in
          Eustathius, he determined to try whether he could reduce it to practice. Accordingly, he took an old lute, and put strings upon it; he
          exposed it to the wind in every manner he could think of; but all without effect. When he was about to give the matter up as a mystery or a
          fable, he received some encouragement to a farther trial from an accident which happened to a harper on the Thames; who, having his
          instrument with him in a house-boat, perceived that a favourable stroke of the wind brought some momentary sounds from the strings, as if
          they had been suddenly touched after that manner, which, from the genius of this instrument, is called <hi rend="ital">arpeggio</hi>. The
          man was alarmed with the accident, and made many trials to procure a repetition of the same sounds from a like turn of the wind, but could
          never succeed; the music was vanished like an apparition. Upon this ground, however, Mr. Oswald persevered; and it came at last into his
          mind, that perhaps the strings ought to be exposed to a more confined current of air. With this view he drew up the sash of his
          chamber-window, so as to let in a shallow stream of air, and exposed his lute to it. In the middle of the night the wind rose, and the
          instrument sounded; which being heard by the artist, he sprang out of bed to examine all the circumstances of its situation, and noted down
          every thing with the most scrupulous precision; after which, as the principle was now ascertained, he never failed of the effect.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Jones’s note:] That the effect of the Eolian harp must often have been heard by accident seems
            undeniable from what I was lately informed of by Mr. Stanley, composer to his Majesty [Charles John Stanley, 1712–86, Master of the King’s
            Musicians under George III]; that two wires, stretched across an area before a house at London, had been heard to make very fine music,
            equal to the best Eolian harp. </note>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The construction of an Eolian harp is very simple. Nothing more is necessary than a long and narrow box of deal, with a thin
          belly, and eight or ten strings of catgut lightly stretched over two bridges, placed near the extremities, and all tuned in unison. When it
          plays, the unison itself is plainly heard as the lowest tone, and the combinations of concords, though consisting chiefly of the <hi rend="ital">harmonic </hi>notes, are by no means confined to them, but change, as the wind is more or less intense, with a variety and
          sweetness which is past description. I know not how to account for the compass of its notes on the principles of the harmonics but by
          admitting a new species of sounds, which I call <hi rend="ital">harmonics of the harmonics</hi>; or, <hi rend="ital">secondary
            harmonics</hi>. The sharp seventh is very commonly heard, which, if deduced as an harmonic, must be of the second species, as the 17th of
          the 12th; as also the 9th, which is as frequently heard, may be taken for the 12th of the 12th; and thus perhaps we may account for all its
          varieties.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">If we consider the quality of its harmony, it very much resembles that of a chorus of voices at a distance, with all the
          expressions of the <hi rend="ital">forte</hi>, the <hi rend="ital">piano</hi>, and the <hi rend="ital">swell</hi>; in a word, its harmony is
          more like to what we might imagine the aërial sounds of magic and enchantment to be, than to artificial music. We may call it, without a
          metaphor, the music of inspiration.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">With respect to the peculiar nature and causes of this phenomenon, I dare not promise entire satisfaction from my own
          speculations, being well aware of the difficulty. The principles I shall offer for solving this wonderful effect are founded on the analogy
          between light and air.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">1. And first I lay it down, that music is in air as colours are in light. When any body inflects the rays of light, or
          refracts them, it does not give the colours that are seen, but it makes the light give them; so a sonorous body does not give musical
          sounds, but makes the air give them.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">2. That as colours are produced by inflections and refractions of the rays of light; so musical sounds are produced by
          similar refractions of the air. There is no reason to suppose that air is homogeneous in its parts any more than light; and if air consists
          of heterogeneous parts, they will be differently refrangible, according to their magnitudes, and excite different sounds, as they are
          accommodated to different vibrations, and capable of different velocities; as the parts of light which are differently refrangible give
          different colours. The parts of air most refrangible will excite the most acute sounds, and the smallest parts will be most
            refrangible.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Jones’s note:] This notion concerning the different degrees of subtilty in the
            parts of air occurred to Mr. Derham [William Derham (1657–1735)]; who argued, that as sound moves near 1200 feet in a second, and the most
            violent wind not more than sixty miles in an hour, which is at the rate of eighty-eight feet in a second, the particles of air which
            communicate sound must be more subtile than those which constitute the winds. See Hales’ Doctr. Son. p. 47. [William Hales (1747–1831),
              <title>Sonorum Doctrina Rationalis et Experimentalis</title> (1778)]. If wind acts by the grosser parts of air, and sound by the finer,
            this may be a reason why they do not interfere nor disturb one another’s motions.*<lb/>
                     <lb/> [Bloomfield’s note:] * The following is taken from
            an old book published before Sir Isaac Newton received the honour of knighthood.<lb/>
                     <lb/> Mr. Isaac Newton demonstrates (in prop. 43, book ii.
            of his Principles) that sounds, because they arise from the tremulous motion of bodies, are nothing else but the propagation of the pulse
            of the air, and this, he saith, is confirmed by those great tremors that strong and grave sounds excite in bodies round about; as the
            ringing of bells, noise of cannon, &amp;c.<lb/>
                     <lb/> And in another place he concludes, that sounds do not consist in the motion of any aether,
            or finer air, but in the agitation of the whole common air; because he found by experiments, that the motion of sounds depended on the
            density of the whole air.’—Harris’ Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, printed in 1704. R. B. [John Harris (1666–1719), <title>Lexicon
              Technicum, Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences</title>]</note>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">3. That as light shows no particular colour but by means of some other intervening body to separate and modify its rays, so
          the air yields no particular musical tone without the assistance of some sonorous body to separate its parts, and put them into a vibratory
          motion.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">4. That as light is refracted into colours, not only on dioptric principles, by passing through a prism of glass, or some
          other refracting medium, but also by passing near the edge of some solid body which inflects it out of its course; so is the air subject to
          be refracted by a similar inflection. It would require much time and observation, more than I have had leisure to bestow, to expand this
          principle into a theory, and confirm it by proper experiments; but the fact seems clear, that sound is produced, and that air becomes <hi rend="ital">vocal</hi> on this principle of a <hi rend="ital">refraction</hi>. As the Eolian harp plays by an inflection of a current of
          air over the edge of an aperture, so the column of air in an organ-pipe becomes vocal by means of a shallow current which strikes against
          the edge of the aperture, and is thence inflected into the cavity of the pipe. In the German flute also, the breath gives the tone by
          passing over the edge of the aperture; and according to its intensity, it produces higher or lower tones as the wind does in the Eolian
          harp. It would be endless to pursue this effect under all the various shapes in which it appears to us. It is sufficient for our purpose,
          that we have many instances in which air becomes vocal and musical by suffering a kind of refraction against the edge of some solid bodies;
          for this is the case with the Eolian harp; the wind passes to the strings of the instrument by the edge of an aperture; whence it is
          inflected partly at a greater, partly at a lesser angle; and that portion of the current of air which makes a different angle with the plane
          in which the strings lie, excites a different tone.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This hypothesis for the solution of Eolian sound, by a refraction of the air, is recommended by an experiment, which
          demonstrates that such a relation between air and light, as we have here supposed, is not imaginary. For as light when refracted affords us
          seven colours, and no more; so the air yields seven degrees of sound within the system of the octave; of which all successive sounds,
          however multiplied, are but repetitions. I met with this comparison in an ancient English author; but the sagacity of Newton hit upon it in
          his optical experiments, and he has carried it much further, by showing us that the analogy extends even to the respective intervals of
          each. The prismatic spectrum, under his accurate examination of it, was found to exhibit the same degrees with the series of tones and
          semitones in an octave; but they do not answer to the degrees of the octave either in a flat or sharp key, as these keys are commonly now
          used; because the third is minor and the sixth major. However, these degrees of the optical octave may be justified, and the old masters
          have composed according to them; of which we have an instance in the old creed of Tallis;<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Thomas
            Tallis (1505–85), the composer of choral music.]</note> and there are many others. The diatonic scale affords us two octaves with the
          minor third, which differ in their degrees; the one from A to A, with the minor third and minor sixth; the other from D to D, with the minor
          third and major sixth. This latter has the advantage in two respects: First, It is more simple and natural, because the two tetrachords
          which make up the octave are similar; that is, they both have the hemitone in the same place, as it happens in the two tetrachords of the
          major key. Second, It leads to a greater variety of modulation; and though the harmonies by some are accounted harsh, yet, in my opinion,
          they are more stately and pleasing than in the flat key with its two dissimilar tetrachords, as now managed by modern masters; who have
          entirely dropped the other form, though it has excellencies peculiar to itself, and therefore deserves to be retained.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The analogy between sounds and colours is very strict, and may be carried very far. In the order of the seven colours, three
          of them are simple and primary, the <hi rend="ital">red</hi>, the <hi rend="ital">yellow</hi>, and the <hi rend="ital">blue</hi>; so in the
          seven degrees of the octave, there are three principal tones which constitute its harmony, the <hi rend="ital">unison</hi>, the <hi rend="ital">third</hi>, and the <hi rend="ital">fifth</hi>; and these have the same places in the series as the three simple colours have
          in the prismatic spectrum; <hi rend="ital">red </hi>is in the place of the <hi rend="ital">unison</hi>, <hi rend="ital">yellow </hi>in the
          place of the <hi rend="ital">third</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">blue </hi>in the place of the <hi rend="ital">fifth. </hi>All harmony, though
          the parts are ever so many, is made up of these three sounds, as all hues are composed of those three colours.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Upon the whole, the Eolian harp may be considered as an air-prism, for the physical separation of musical sounds. The form
          of it may be improved, so as to give a farther illustration to the principles I have adopted. Instead of fixing the strings to the outside,
          I dispose them upon a sounding board, or belly, within side a wooden case, and admit the wind to them through a horizontal aperture, so that
          the affinity of the instrument to an organ-pipe appears at first sight; and thus it becomes portable and useful any where in the open air,
          instead of being confined to the house; which is a great advantage; and it is probable this new form may lead hereafter to some new
          experiments.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">No person of a musical ear can listen to the Eolian harp without discovering that the sound varies with the <hi rend="ital">intensity </hi>of the wind. The unison with a sudden gust will change immediately into the octave on the same string; which happens in
          other instruments: the common and German flutes give the octaves with a more intense blast of the breath. What seemed to me most
          inexplicable of all was this, that if the Eolian harp is exposed to the air with a single string, that string, without any change in its
          situation, will be heard to sound all the harmonic notes, which are seven or eight, besides the unison; and several of them will be heard at
          the same time. When many strings, which the wind meets at different angles, sound together, we have not only the harmonics of the unison
          variously produced, but harmonics of the harmonics, as above mentioned.’</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Mr. Jones has given plates to illustrate his subject, and mentions, in a note, that, of his portable harp, he sent a model,
          on a small scale, to Messrs. <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LongmanThomasN">Longman </ref> and Broderip, with orders for its being
          constructed for sale. Although I have never seen one of that construction, I readily perceive the advantages which he ascribes to them, and
          hope some day to prove it by experience.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The harps I have hitherto made have been, though of greater length, on the same principle with those seen at the music
          shops; but, where circumstances would admit of it, I have endeavoured to divide the strings into separate octaves. I have however proved, at
          least to my own satisfaction, that the top, or covering board, is of little use, if any, and that the strings ought to catch the wind in an
          inclination more approaching to a perpendicular than to a horizontal level. For this reason, I suppose, I find the instrument, when placed
          with the strings towards the window, always performs better than in the usual position. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Strings covered with silver wire I have tried in various ways, but am not prepared to say whether they perform their part.
          Perhaps the metallic covering is not adapted to the action of the breeze. Strings covered with oil will not sound. Silk strings will give a
          most delicate tone, but I never yet could make them stand to their tension. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I have tried catgut about the size, or larger than the third string of the violin, but being strained to only the width of a
          common sash, they appeared to want <hi rend="ital">length </hi>in proportion to their <hi rend="ital">diameter</hi>, and therefore I
          conclude, that could such strings be placed at the length of eight or ten feet, so as to catch a current of wind, the effect would be
          increased proportionably. But as I am no musician, I advance this conjecture with diffidence, remembering that I have been repeatedly
          disappointed in my expectations, and as often found results that have been beyond my comprehension. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Dr. Smollet, in the heyday of his strange imagination, has given the following description of this instrument in his Count
          Fathom, vol. i.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Tobias Smollett (1721–71), <title>The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom
            </title>(1753).]</note>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘Some years ago, a twelve-stringed instrument was contrived by a very ingenious musician, by whom it was aptly entitled the
          harp of Eolus;<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] Most probably he alludes to Mr. Oswald, a better account of
            whom we have just given, by Mr. Jones.</note> because, being properly applied to a stream of air, it produces a wild, irregular variety of
          harmonious sounds, that seem to be the effect of enchantment, and wonderfully dispose the mind for the most romantic situations. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The strings no sooner felt the impression of the balmy zephyr, than they began to pour forth a stream of melody more
          ravishingly delightful than the song of Philomel, the warbling brook, and all the concert of the wood. The soft and tender notes of peace
          and love were swelled up with the most delicate and insensible transition, into a loud hymn of triumph and exultation, joined by the
          deep-toned organ, and a full choir of voices, which gradually decayed upon the ear until it died away in distant sound, as if a flight of
          angels had raised the song in their ascent to heaven.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Yet the chords hardly ceased to vibrate after the expiration of this overture, which ushered in a composition in the same
          pathetic style; and this again was succeeded by a third, almost without pause or intermission, as if the artist’s hand had been
          indefatigable, and the theme never to be exhausted.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">His heart must be quite callous, and his ear lost to all distinction, who could hear such harmony without emotion.’</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I question whether this music, which Smollet so truly describes, was ever, or ever will be used for the villanous purpose
          which he has recorded in his novel. It deserves much higher employment. It will be observed that Smollet deemed the thing <hi rend="ital">of
            modern invention</hi>, and as he died, I believe, in 1771, five years before the publication of Sir John Hawkins’s work,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Hawkins (1719–89) was the author of <title>A General History of the Science and Practice of Music
            </title>(1776).]</note> the latter was right when he calls it ‘an instrument which has been obtruded on the public as a new invention,’
          &amp;c. and did justice to Kircher, the oldest claimant on the subject. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The following observations appeared a few years since in a periodical work, and are, I believe, from the pen of Charles
          Bucke, Esq.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Charles Bucke (1781–1846), ‘Aeolian Harp’, <title>Monthly Mirror</title>, 14 (1802),

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘As nothing can be deemed natural but what proceeds from the actual principles of nature, we may safely pronounce the Eolian
          lyre to be the only natural instrument of emitting harmony. Other instruments, sending forth sounds by the assistance of the fingers, or by
          some other mechanical means, may be consequently termed artificial. This affords another instance of the truth of the old-established adage,
          that Simplicity is the nearest relative of Beauty, since the Eolian harp is the “most musical, most melancholy,” and most bewitching of all
          melodies.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Of the antiquity of this instrument it is difficult to decide: it had slept about a hundred years when it was accidentally
          discovered by Mr. Oswald.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It has been asserted (by Sir John Hawkins in his History of Music, v. iv. b. 2. c. b. p. 221, and by Mr. Jones in his
          Physiological Disquisitions, p. 338) that this instrument was invented by Father Kircher, and this statement has been generally adopted as
          true: it appears however that Kircher was not the inventor; neither does he himself assume that merit; but says, in express terms, that the
          reason he is so particular in enlarging upon it is, <hi rend="ital">because no one had given any description of it before </hi>(De
          Sympathiae et Antipathiae Sonorum ratione, b. ix.).—The knowledge of the operation of air upon strings is doubtless of very high antiquity;

          bleeding head upon it. The harp, touched with the wind, breathed forth a solemn strain. Still swimming down the Egean sea, the mournful
          concert arrived at Lesbos, where the inhabitants, taking them up, buried the head where now stands the Temple of Bacchus, and suspended the
          lyre in the Temple of Apollo.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] To this incident Spenser alludes in a beautiful

          has nothing to do with the vibration of a string, is at the same time so strictly nature’s music, that it deserves a place where we are
          following the vagaries of Æolus. When at the Dutch island of Amboyna, in September, 1792, the author says,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [Jacques-Julien Houtou de La Billardière, <title>Voyage in Search of La Pérouse: Performed by Order of the Constituent

          dissonances by no means displeasing. Those fine and harmonious sounds seemed to come from such a distance as to make me believe, for some
          time, that the natives were entertaining themselves with their music, on the other side of the road, and near five thousand toises from the
          place where I stood.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> [A toise is a French unit of measurement equating to roughly 6 feet.]</note>
          My ear was much deceived as to the distance, for I was not fifty toises from the instrument. It was a bamboo, at least sixty feet in height,
          fixed in a vertical position, close to the sea. Between every joint was a hole near an inch and two-tenths long, and somewhat above half an
          inch broad. These holes formed so many mouths, which, by the action of the wind, emitted agreeable and varied sounds. As the joints of this
          long bamboo were very numerous, care had been taken to pierce it in different directions; so that, from whatever point the wind blew, it
          always meets with some holes. The sound of this instrument more nearly resembles that of the harmonica than any other to which I can compare

THE MAN IN THE MOON LOOK’D DOWN ONE NIGHT (c. 1812)<note type="headnote" place="foot" resp="editors">The tune, ‘Ligrum cus’, appears in Volume V of Aird’s <title>Selection of Scotch, English, Irish and Foreign Airs</title> (Glasgow, 1801). The title, apparently corrupt Irish Gaelic, may be translated as ‘Let go my foot’ and is
          taken to refer to excessive rents. However, earlier versions of the tune are given the Jacobite title of ‘Over the Water to Charlie’ and
          appear in Robert Bremner, <title>A Collection of Scots Reels and Country Dances</title> (Edinburgh and London, 1759), and James Johnson,
          <title>Scots Musical Museum</title> (Edinburgh, 1787–1803). Later reworkings may be found in James Hogg, <title>Jacobite Relics</title>,
          2nd series (Edinburgh, 1821). Thanks to Keri Davies for this information.</note>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Introduction</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s story for children looks at first like the cautionary tales of the new generation of children’s writers on
          which it is modelled. In the Preface to the second edition, he acknowledges Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Priscilla Wakefield, Maria Edgeworth and
          Sarah Trimmer, among others: these were the didactic, moralizing authors whose tales were disliked by Blake, Coleridge and other Romantic
          poets for equating goodness with prudential self-interest and imagination with improper license. While Coleridge pointedly preferred the old
          folk tale Jack the Giant Killer to this new, pious, conformist, middle-class and female literature, Bloomfield takes the opposite view. In
          the Preface he notes that his mother, the village schoolmistress, taught him ‘to prize “Goody Two Shoes” for its excellent hits at
          superstition; and to read the “History of Jack the Giant Killer” for the purpose of remarking its abominable absurdities’. He had, he
          declared ‘never found cause to alter this early opinion’, and he larded his story of a poor village boy given charity by the well-to-do
          daughter of a wealthy farmer with maxims designed to teach morality, or at least the kind of conduct that polite people regarded as a sign
          of respectability.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Despite its occasional primness, <title>The History of Little Davy’s New Hat</title>, does not, in the end, read like the
          tales of Trimmer and Barbauld, because Bloomfield is able, as they were not, to represent rural life from the point of view of the poor
          labourers. Instead of exhorting the poor to reform, or regarding them as victims to be pitied, Bloomfield displays an intimate knowledge of
          their culture—and in particular of the many expedients they use to sustain family life, and give a loving upbringing to their children, in
          face of want so extreme that the slightest accident—the loss of a hat, the breaking of a teapot—is a major problem. Their poverty is quietly
          shown to be a result neither of their fecklessness nor their laziness, but of economic changes that have driven small farmers out of
          business while benefitting wealthy landowners (the inflated price of corn during the wartime economy). A major theme is the effect of
          poverty on dress, and of this on family self-esteem: little Davy is painfully aware that, because his parents cannot afford a hat, he does
          not look respectable; his father will not go to church because he knows his ragged dress will be mocked by the better-off gamekeeper who is
          clothed by the squire who employs him. Independence and self-belief is shown to be increasingly precarious: the servants of the wealthy are
          the only villagers who flourish. Food is another theme: Bloomfield gives us a close-up view of shortage when Davy’s family cannot accept the
          gift of a puppy because unable to feed it and when Davy, visiting the wealthy farm, thinks the bone thrown to a dog by a kitchen maid would
          have served for a joint for his whole family. In face of this want, Davy’s elder brother has enlisted in a regiment going to the highly
          dangerous West Indies: villagers are fodder for cannon or tropical disease; his mother is worn down by the worry that she will never see him
          again.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The tale is not, in the end, a tragedy, or a work of social realism like <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>’s ‘Last of the Flock’. It records poverty from the inside but it also indulges a
          wish-fulfilment fantasy. Because little Davy is charming and naïve he is taken up by the kindly Miss Wideland who relieves the worst of the
          family’s poverty. Class difference and economic self-interest is overcome by feminine and maternal tenderness for the innocent child, who is
          to her as the puppy is to him, a winning example of youthful life that deserves care. The puppy is named Pity, and the name is significant:
          Bloomfield displaces onto the animal the emotional dynamic on which his rosy vision of rural harmony in the human village relies. By doing
          so, he avoids the appearance of condescension and the recognition of improbability. Wealthy farmers’ daughters’ acts of charity did not, as
          he knew from experience by 1815, successfully assuage poverty or restore harmony. Charitable donations involved demands for servile
          obedience to the ideology of the giver, as Bloomfield discovered in 1821 when the squire Thomas Lloyd Baker made a gift dependent upon
          Bloomfield’s going regularly to church and publicly disavowing radical politics (although he had never, in fact, avowed them). Parish
          relief, which Davy’s family also receives, in practice brought the likelihood of the workhouse. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield wrote the tale in 1801 in London when the success of <title>The Farmer’s Boy </title>had lifted him and his
          extended family out of poverty and sweated labour; he published it in 1815, when living poverty-stricken in a Bedfordshire village to which
          he had retreated to reduce his expenses, his royalties having failed to provide for his own and his brothers’ families needs. <title>Little
            Davy</title>, that is, spoke of and was written from rural poverty: publication was an effort to stave off debts, just as, in the story,
          Mr Woodly goes to market to sell the brooms he has made, knowing his profits will be consumed by what he already owes. And if the story
          reflected Bloomfield’s own circumstances, it includes a Bloomfield figure: Grandfather Woodly is in poor health, as the author often was,
          and is a poet. He shows little Davy a ballad he has written (a ballad that Bloomfield had published in 1807: ‘The Butcher’s Horse and the
          Bees’). The story also includes another ballad, given by the kitchen maid to Davy’s mother as a broadside and sung at home. In this way it
          gives a rare glimpse as to how ballads and songs commonly circulated, in print and performance, among the rural population. Bloomfield’s
          ‘The Fakenham Ghost’ had itself been printed as a broadside and circulated in this manner.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The history of composition and publication is traceable in Bloomfield’s letters. On 30 November 1801 he told his brother
          George that ‘My present amusement is writing a Child’s Book “the History of Little Davy’s new hat,” dedicated to my Mother’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.70.html">Letter 70</ref>). On 31 January 1802 he sent the
          manuscript to <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref>, for him to show to <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</ref> (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.77.html">Letter 77</ref>) and then wrote to his sister asking
          for ‘your opinion upon it, as to its language and construction, is it too silly, or only simple enough for a young reader?’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.78.html">Letter 78</ref>; 31 January 1802). By 30 May 1802 he
          was happy enough with it to leave the manuscript at Devonshire House in Piccadilly, town house of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire and
          social centre of the Whig party, including <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Charles James Fox</ref> who had admired
            <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.88.html">Letter
            88</ref>).</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">For reasons we do not know, Bloomfield then left the tale unpublished for thirteen years. Perhaps his dispute with Lofft
          over patronly interference in his works made him reluctant to go to press (although he published several collections of poems in this
          interval). In 1810 his interest in the story revived as he basked in the attention of the sisters of <ref type="m"

                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SharpCatherine">Catharine Sharp</ref> and
            <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mary Lloyd Baker</ref>. These friendly gentlewomen had invited him to accompany them on
          a tour of the river Wye in 1807; they acted as muses, fostering his verse by their friendly concern. A letter of 9–12 January 1810 (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.247.html">Letter 247</ref>) reveals that he had sent the
          manuscript to both sisters, and received comments from them. Responding to these comments, Bloomfield clarifies his own view of the
          tale:</p>

          specialized in stories and instructional books for children and who also published Priscilla Wakefield. They were also the printers.
          Bloomfield was not named as author, but the initials R.B. were placed at the end of the Preface. He recorded receiving copies in a letter of
          15–17 December (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.299.html">Letter 299</ref>). Reviews were
          sparse but the<title> Eclectic Review </title>was complimentary, and wrote that ‘there are touches of nature in this <hi rend="ital">rural
            tale</hi>, an artlessness of expression, and an air of intimacy with “the short and simple annals of the poor,” which sufficiently
          designate the author, whose initials, R. B. are affixed to the Preface: but the reader, to be pleased with it, must descend in feeling to
          the level of childhood and poverty, and fancy he is listening to the tones which had power in infancy to fix his attention to the most
          humble incidents of real life’ (NS 5 (1816), 76–77).</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">A second edition, which acknowledged Bloomfield’s authorship and was accompanied by a new preface, appeared in 1817, and a
          third in 1824.</p>

                  <hi rend="smcaps">Trifling</hi> as the subject may appear to the young and the thoughtless, when a new book for children is introduced into a
          family it becomes the indispensable duty of parents, or their superintendents of the nursery, to know its contents. If it inculcates false
          principles, the pride of wealth, or, more particularly, superstition, let them, for mercy’s sake, use it for lighting the fire. This notion
          I imbibed forty years ago from my mother, a village school-mistress, and I have never found cause to alter this early opinion. It was then I
          was taught to prize ‘Goody Two Shoes’ for its excellent hits at superstition; and to read the ‘History of Jack the Giant Killer’ for the
          purpose of remarking its abominable absurdities.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In the year 1801 I wrote the following little story, for the purpose of trying its effects on the minds of my own children.
          I sunk the language to the level of their understandings, and succeeded beyond my expectation. After lying idle on my shelf for fourteen
          years, ‘<hi rend="smcaps">Davy</hi>’ makes his appearance, to take his chance of pleasing more extensively. Perhaps the characters are too good—too perfect—for
          what we unfortunately see in real life; but that their poverty is not beyond truth, I am certain. The story is best adapted for village
          children; and will be most approved by those who promote good nature and charity.</p>

                  <hi rend="smcaps">The</hi> following little story has already been circulated very considerably, and I have to assure the reader that when it was
          first published, I had not the least idea of its being noticed by the regular reviewers; for I live in a sequestered corner, not very
          accessible to literary intelligence. I find, however, that they have condescended to notice it, and the only fault which I have seen pointed
          out by them, I have endeavoured to correct in this second edition, and feel a pleasure in doing it.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In the first instance, I felt a reluctance to subscribing my name as its author; but have since discovered that such
          reluctance arose from a feeling of vanity, or some other feeling quite as unjustifiable. I really believe that reviewers are as well
          employed in overlooking and censuring these minor efforts of literature, intended for a rising generation, as in some of their more abstruse
          and metaphysical disquisitions, which the readers of this story, for instance, will not be able to understand for these thirty years to
          come.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The longer I live, the more I am convinced of the importance of children’s books. The feeling seems to be universal; and I
          never talk with a man or woman of fifty years of age, without hearing that what they read in their infancy was very inferior to the juvenile
          publications of later days. Reader, ask yourself if this is not the case, and remember the exalted names of my betters, who have helped to
          turn, or perhaps have entirely turned, the scale in favour of your children and mine; and then, when you recollect the names of Dr. Watts,

                  <hi rend="smcaps">It</hi> was very dark—not a star to be seen; the wind blew cold, and large drops were falling from the trees, when Miss Wideland,
          returning home in her chaise through a dark lane, met a little boy alone. The young lady was alarmed, and cried: ‘Who are you? What are you?’
          A voice answered: ‘It is Davy, ma’am.’ ‘Why, you quite frightened me, Davy. What can you be doing here at this time of night?’ ‘I am but
          just come out,’ said Davy, ‘to meet my mother, who is coming home from the shop.’ At that moment, looking closely at the boy, the lady, with
          much concern, said: ‘Why, bless the child, you have no hat on!’ ‘No, ma’am,’ answered he; ‘but my father says he will buy me a hat soon.’
          ‘Poor boy!’ said she very tenderly, and stooping down gave him sixpence, though she could hardly see his little white face in the dark. Then
          bidding him stand out of the way of the wheels, she drove home slowly, thinking about Davy all the way.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Now, though the boy did not ride home, he went as speedily and as lightly as if he had, and opening the door in great haste,
          did not stop to shut it (a fault which little boys are often guilty of), but ran to his father, who was sitting by the fire, and holding out
          his hand said, very loud, and with his eyes wide open with joy. ‘Father, I have got sixpence!’ This stopped his father from scolding him, as
          he deserved, for leaving the door open on a cold night. At that moment his mother returning, said: ‘What! in the name of patience, are you
          so hot as to sit with the door open? This is your doings, Davy.’ But here again he succeeded in stopping any further remarks on that
          subject, by saying: ‘Mother, Miss Wideland has given me sixpence!’ ‘Has she, indeed?’ said the good woman; ‘she was always a kind girl. She
          has given your poor brother <hi rend="smcaps">Will</hi> many a sixpence, before he went for a soldier. She will never be the poorer for it, I know.’ ‘I don’t know
          about that,’ said Davy; ‘but I know that I have got it.’ And here he was just unbuttoning his pocket, when his father put some further
          questions to him, saying: ‘How came the young lady to see you, Davy? And what did she say to you?’ ‘Why,’ said he, ‘I was in the lane, and I
          believe she gave it to me because I had no hat, for she said “Poor boy!”‘ ‘Ay, poor boy indeed,’ said his father and mother, both at the
          same time; ‘but we will buy you one soon, Davy.’ ‘I told her so, father,’ said Davy; ‘and this sixpence, you know, will help to buy it.’</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Davy’s father and mother were very poor; and so was old Master Woodly, his grandfather, who lived with them, and whose hair
          was as white as snow. They got their living by making birchbrooms; but his grandfather was very feeble, and his father seldom well long
          together, so that they could hardly get bread, with all they could do. His mother wore a petticoat that was mended with pieces which did not
          exactly match; but she did not mind that so long as it was whole. One end of the house they lived in had fallen down, for want of timely
          repairs; but they had plenty of room for their family. The ground rose so high behind the house that the upper end of the garden was nearly
          as high as the chimney, and the grandfather, who was a sensible old man, and remembered a great deal, was fond of sitting there in an old
          wicker chair which he had made in his youth. The sun would shine pleasantly here, even on a winter’s day, and the hill kept the cold off
          behind. Here Davy would set off his hoop, and it would run, of itself, down to the back-door, and sometimes through the house into the
          road.</p>
               <lb/>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">CHAP. II.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Miss <hi rend="smcaps">Wideland’s</hi> father was a farmer, and kept a great many horses and cows, and two flocks of sheep; and all the stock of
          hay and corn, the produce of five hundred acres of land, was his own. Both Mr. and Mrs. Wideland were esteemed good-natured and
          condescending to every one, but all the poor neighbours said that Miss Wideland was the best in the family; for she would often beg of her
          mother for the skimmed milk for them, when the dairy-maid dare not part with it, because it was wanted for the hogs. Whether it is quite
          right to give milk to pigs, while poor children go without, I will not say; but it happened one morning that Davy got up earlier than usual,
          and being very hungry, he longed for a dish of milk for breakfast, for he was very fond of it. His mother told him that she had been
          herself, the evening before, to Mr. Wideland’s, but could get none, the dairy-maid saying she must not sell it. ‘I wanted a little milk as
          well as you, Davy, to make a pudding, for I am not very well; but I must make shift without it.’ ‘Shall I go and try?’ said Davy. ‘You go,
          child! What good can you do by going?’ ‘Why,’ said Davy, ‘I think if I can see Miss Wideland, mother, I can get some milk.’ He set off
          directly, with a pitcher that would hold about three pints, and began to whistle as soon as he got out at the door.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The pasture-ground he had to cross was covered with shining dew-drops, and he found that his feet, brushing in the grass,
          left a mark or track behind him; he accordingly tried to walk exactly straight to a tree at the bottom of the field, and thereby make a kind
          of furrow, as he had seen the men do at plough. He had pleased himself with walking very straight a long way when a large turkey-cock, with
          his red head and a loud gobbling noise, attacked him and drove him out of his path. Davy had nothing to defend himself with but his pitcher.
          He was half angry and half frightened, and would certainly have thrown his hat at him if he had had one; but he was forced to run away as
          fast as he could. As he crossed the farm-yard to the dairy, he had to go just by the parlour window, where Miss Wideland used to sit, and
          she happened to be there that morning. When Davy saw that she looked at him, he made a handsome bow—one of his best. His face had been
          washed, and his flaxen hair combed, before he set out. He was a very pretty boy, and, what is much better, he was, upon the whole, a very
          good boy. ‘Well, Davy, what do you want?’ said she, though she could pretty well guess his errand by his pitcher. Davy only held up his
          pitcher, and answered, ‘Ma’am, I have had no breakfast.’ He was ordered into the dairy, where he not only had his pitcher filled, but the
          maid gave him a handful of cheese-curd to eat as he went home.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The magpie which was kept at Mr. Wideland’s could talk almost anything, and would hop after strangers, and sometimes peck
          their heels, especially those of girls who had holes in their stockings. Davy was delighted to hear the bird ask him, ‘What’s o’clock?’ and
          then say, ‘Quick, quick, Jack.’ To enjoy this prating bird’s company the better, Davy walked backwards down the yard, and by so doing struck
          his pitcher against a post. A blow a little harder would have broken it; but idle talk, like that of the magpie, will sometimes put wise
          people off their guard. However, when he had got into the field again he thought himself safe, for the turkey-cock was gone. But here, as he
          strolled along under the hedge, he saw a long straight bough of elder, which would make very excellent whistles. Though he wanted his
          breakfast, he could not help stopping to cut this tempting bough, which he could as well have obtained at any other time. Most little
          country boys carry a knife in their pockets, though they are seldom very sharp. He set down his pitcher in the grass, and had but just cut
          the bough down when he saw Mr. Wideland’s sow and pigs come trotting down towards him. They soon surrounded his pitcher, and he thought it
          was all over with his breakfast. He halloed to them, and made great haste to get down; but in his haste let go his hold, and fell headlong
          into the ditch. The rustling he made in his fall frightened the pigs, and saved his milk. He went home, thinking about these misfortunes,
          for boys and girls, as well as men and women, know when they have done wrong. It was wrong to loiter and make whistles when he should have
          carried his milk home; and Davy’s heart told him that it would have served him right to have lost his breakfast. However, he carried home
          his milk and his elder too. His mother was highly pleased to see the pitcher full; but Davy was ashamed to relate all that had happened, and
          therefore only mentioned the turkey-cock and the cheese-curd.</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">CHAP. III.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">After breakfast, Davy reminded his mother that now he had put the sixpence Miss Wideland had given him into his box on the
          top of the cupboard, it made just seventeen-pence halfpenny; for he had been saving his money a long time to buy a hat. His mother heard him
          with a mixture of pleasure and pain; for she knew, though Davy did not, that his box was empty. She had been forced to borrow Davy’s money
          to make up enough to buy a loaf, for Mr. Snapgroat at the shop had trusted her a few shillings during the winter, and would not trust any
          more. But it being now the middle of March, she had strong hopes of paying him, and of doing better, when the weather grew fine. She did not
          much like the baker’s bread from the shop, but though she had an oven in her own house it was not always that she could get flour; and it
          was because all their money went for bread and flour that the boy went bareheaded.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Old Master Woodly had been round the home-close for a walk, and had brought home a whole handful of primroses. The sight of
          these flowers always gives poor people a hint that winter is going, and that the hardships they endure will be less and less every day; and
          so it proved with this family. Davy had been to school but little, but his grandfather used to teach him to read and spell. They were
          sitting together on the bench at the door, and Davy was trying to spell three syllables when they heard the gate open at the top of the
          hill, and saw Miss Wideland gently walking down to the door. As she approached the grandfather bowed, rising from his seat; but Davy bowed
          as soon as he saw her, and two or three times afterwards. Just as Miss Wideland came to the door, Davy’s sister Jane, about three years old,
          fell over the threshold, and her mother, in trying to save her, let fall a favourite tea-pot, which she had used many years. This was a bad
          misfortune on that account, but Mrs. Woodly was not one of those who are in the habit of making troubles out of trifles.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The child’s forehead was bruised, but her brother, who loved her dearly, had been used to nursing her, and could always
          quiet her sooner than her mother. When all was hushed again, Miss Wideland came in and sat down; and old Master Woodly, following her, also
          sat down in his elbow-chair, and was so pleased to see the good young lady call upon them that he almost forgot the rheumatism in his
          shoulder, which had troubled him all the morning. They thanked her over and over again for the kindness she had shown to them and others in
          the parish; but she turned the discourse, and now cast a look of pity on poor Mrs. Woodly, who was turning and matching the fragments of her
          broken tea-pot. ‘Mrs. Woodly,’ said she, smiling, ‘let Davy go to the shop and choose another, and say that I will pay for it.’ He went
          instantly, and said he would bring a blue one. When the boy was gone, they all began to talk very freely, and Miss Wideland inquired of Mrs.
          Woodly when she heard from her son <hi rend="smcaps">Will</hi>. This question made the poor woman low-spirited, for she had not heard of him for a whole
          twelvemonth.’But,’ said she, ‘I live in hopes that I shall see him again; only my husband says that Jamaica is a sad, unhealthy place.’ Here
          old Master Woodly said that he ‘had a brother once, a fine young man, who died there; but a great many came home, and why may not my
          grandson? If we could but have a peace, I should reckon upon seeing him again, old as I am.’ ‘Ay,’ said Mrs. Woodly, as she took a pinch of
          snuff, ‘but Heaven only knows when we shall have that blessing. I am sure the flour has been so dear, and they say it is because of the war,
          that I don’t know how we can live another half year as we have done this. I do so long for a bit of meat, when the butcher rides by with his
          basket! To be sure, my husband may be better now, as the spring comes on; and I always find a comfort in hoping, though my hopes are often
          disappointed.’ ‘And are you not able to buy meat?’ said Miss Wideland. ‘I hope you have had some allowance these hard times.’ ‘Why, I will
          tell you how it is, young lady,’ said the old man (for Mrs. Woodly was obliged to go after Jane); ‘the rich part of our parish call our
          broom-making a trade, and I believe we have had less help on that account. We tried to persuade our son to go and plead our cause to the
          farmers, but I verily believe he would starve first, though he never was much richer than he is now, which is not exactly the case with me.
          I once held a farm—’ While the old man was thus speaking, in came Davy with the tea-pot. ‘Here’s a nice blue one, mother! Mr. Snapgroat
          asked me if I broke the old one; but I told him you broke it yourself.’ They now made Davy be silent, and the old man went on with his story
          thus: ‘I was saying, miss, that I once held a farm; I did not live in this house, it is true; but the old man is now living in a workhouse,
          about ten miles off, who lived as a farmer in this very house. You see, miss, that it has been much larger than it is now.’ ‘Ay,’ said Davy,
          ‘and my mother says that the room where I sleep was the cheese-chamber.’ ‘Hold your tongue, boy,’ said his mother and grandfather; ‘it is
          very rude to talk while other people are speaking.’ Miss Wideland was much affected at what she heard, and, indeed, did not like to hear of
          troubles which she could not prevent; but promised that if they still found themselves distressed, and would tell her so, she would state
          their case to her father and the other farmers, and do all she could to help them. Mrs. Woodly wiped her eyes, and Davy looked as if he was
          going to make some remark about it; but at that moment he saw something stir in a bundle which the young lady held on her lap, and, without
          taking his eyes off, went close to see what it was.</p>
               <lb/>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">CHAP. IV.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘<hi rend="smcaps">What</hi> can it be alive in this handkerchief?’ thought Davy; ‘I should like to know.’</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Miss Wideland saw that he had discovered something living, and could not help smiling to see him peeping round her bundle so
          closely. She told him to have patience, and she would show him what it was. ‘But,’ said she, ‘if your mother is so poor that she cannot
          afford to buy meat for her self, I doubt she can never afford to keep this poor little animal, which was just going to be drowned. I could
          not bear to see it go to the pond, so I brought it to your mother, to see if you could keep it amongst you. It is but a little creature; it
          will not eat much.’ She then untied the bundle, and set down a very handsome little puppy, and then they all looked at it with pity. And
          when it ran round the cat and barked, Davy was even more delighted than he had been with the sixpence. ‘O mother, we will keep it. I know my
          father will like it; I will go and fetch him.’ Away he ran to the shed, where his father was making brooms, and persuaded him to come in and
          see the puppy. His father, finding that Miss Wideland was there, came with him; but more to see the young lady who had been Davy’s friend,
          than to see the little dog. They all thus met together, and Mrs. Woodly and her husband both thought what pleasure they should have found in
          bringing out a mug of their own ale; but malt had been too dear for that for many months past, so they said nothing about it, but agreed
          with Davy that it was a very pretty dog. But when he talked of keeping it, his mother whispered to him that they had nothing to feed it
          with, and could not think of starving it, for that would be worse than drowning. Davy rubbed his head, and his eyes shone as he turned them
          from his mother, and without speaking another word, he went to Miss Wideland’s knee, and looking up, said, ‘Ma’am, will not you let me have
          some milk for the puppy every morning, if I come for it?’ ‘Yes, Davy,’ said she, ‘that I will; and some for your mother too, if she will
          keep the dog.’ ‘I will come, then,’ said he briskly: ‘I wonder if it will grow big enough to draw my turnip-cart, as Jack Greenway’s dog
          does. And oh, mother, what shall its name be?’ ‘Why,’ said she, ‘I think it ought to be <hi rend="smcaps">Pity</hi>, for pity saved his life.’ So they all agreed
          to call him so, and to keep him for pity’s sake.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">All this time they minded nothing but the boy and the puppy; but it was now time for Miss Wideland to tell what she called
          for, besides bringing the dog. She was going to a village about seven miles off, to visit her aunt; and she meant to go in her little
          chaise, and there being many gates to open, she wanted Davy to go with her, which would be a charming ride, she promising to take care of
          him, if his parents would let him go. They all said that he would be a very little footman; but they could not refuse her, for she had been
          very good to them. She was to go the next morning, and when she left them they promised that the boy should be ready. This was a longer
          journey than he had ever taken, and he kept thinking to himself what he should see—what shapes the trees, the fields, and bridges would be,
          which they might have to pass. In short, he dreamed all night of riding.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">When the morning came he made himself as smart as he could, and was setting off, when he put his hand to his head! It was
          very odd that when it was agreed that he should go, neither Davy, nor his father nor mother, had thought of one thing, which was, that he
          had no hat to go in! They were all vexed, and could hardly help laughing at their own folly and forgetfulness. But Davy was not in a
          laughing mood, when his father declared that he could not go, and said at the same time: ‘You know, my boy, that I wish you had a hat; but
          wishing will not buy one, and I am sure I have no money.’ Davy cried heartily. Perhaps there is not a little boy in England who would not
          have cried, had he been in his place. But in the midst of his tears, he begged that they would let him go to Miss Wideland: ‘Perhaps,’ said
          he, ‘she will take me without a hat.’ His father said that, at any rate, he must go to Mr. Wideland’s, if it was only to say that he could
          not go the journey. ‘So I will then,’ answered Davy, and ran out of the house, wiping his eyes with the skirt of his coat. He went down the
          pasture-ground as quick as he had ever done in his life, and found the chaise at the door. The young lady was just going to step up, with
          the reins in her hand, saying, ‘Come, Davy, get up.’ But at that moment, she too bethought herself that the boy could not go seven miles
          from home bareheaded. What was to be done? All the old hats in the house were a great deal too big for him; even Abel Cloutham, the farmer’s
          boy, had a head as big again as Davy’s. But Abel’s head had grown a great deal, and he had upstairs an old cap, which he had made long ago
          out of a cat’s skin, with the hair on. He was ordered to bring it down; and when they had dusted it and knocked out the ear wigs, it was
          found to be just the size, and would make a very good shift. So up he got, and sat close by Miss Wideland, and the horse being very willing
          to go, they set off in good spirits. And well they might, for the trees began to show their new leaves, the air was mild, the sun shone
          delightfully, and in half an hour Davy found himself on strange ground, and began to ask a great many questions.</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                  <hi rend="smcaps">As</hi> Davy was not at all afraid to speak what he thought to his friend Miss Wideland, he made many remarks on what he passed
          by, and what he saw at a distance. They had to ride over a hill where they could see a long way round, and where Davy found that the world
          was much larger than he had thought it was. Amongst other things, they talked on the subject of hats; and Miss Wideland asked him how long
          he had been without one, and how it happened? ‘Why,’ said he, ‘I had a hat last summer. It was a pretty good one: it had but one hole in it,
          and I could have mended that. But Jack Greenway and I went to gather nuts, a long while ago, before the snow came, you know. We were got
          into the middle of the wood, and found a great many. We soon gathered our hats full, and we wanted to fill our pockets besides. So we set
          down our hats under a tree, and went from them to gather more, until I said it was time to go home; but Jack would not go. We stayed a
          little longer, and then it was almost night; and we went to look for our hats, but could not find the tree where we had left them. We both
          cried a little, because it grew darker, but were forced to make haste home without them. But we talked a great deal about it as we went
          along, and I believe Jack’s father beat him for it; but he soon got another hat, for his father keeps the <hi rend="ital">Dragon</hi>, and
          gets more money than mine.’ ‘So you lost your nuts as well as your hat, Davy,’ said Miss Wideland. ‘Yes, ma’am,’ said he; ‘and I should not
          have had any supper, I believe, if my grandfather had not taken my part. My father said it was a sad affair, and that if I could not find it
          the next day I must go without a hat, and so I have ever since; for Jack and I went in the morning and searched about the wood, but could
          not find the tree where we had left them. Perhaps some other boys had found them, and some of them might want a hat as much as I have done
          since: and so my grandfather says.’ ‘And don’t your father sometimes take a stick to your back, Davy?’ ‘No, ma’am, only when he is very
          angry he talks to me, and tells me that I don’t love him, and will not hear me when I tell him that I do; and I am sure I do, for all
          that.’</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">While he was thus telling his story, they rode over a fine bridge, with a broad clear water beneath it, before a gentleman’s
          house. There happened to be a pleasure-boat with a sail spread, carrying a party of ladies, and a gentleman playing a clarionet. This was
          all new to Davy. He had never thought of such a thing as that the wind would blow people along upon the water. Miss Wideland told him that a
          ship on the great sea was moved in the same manner, and that some of them would carry a hundred great guns, and a thousand men. ‘And shall
          we see any such as we go along?’ said Davy. It was a simple question; but the first notion we get of things is very often simple enough. The
          chaise now rattled along a turnpike-road, and they met a fine regiment of horse soldiers. This was a noble sight, and Davy asked if his
          brother <hi rend="smcaps">Will</hi> wore a coat like theirs. ‘No,’ said Miss Wideland, ‘your brother is a foot soldier, and is gone abroad in such a ship as we
          were talking about.’ Davy now looked across the country till his eyes ached; but Miss Wideland looked at nothing but a horseman coming down
          the hill before them; and though her footman pointed here and there at flocks, trees, and churches within sight, she took no notice of him
          or of what he said.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The gentleman soon met them. He was mounted on a beautiful bay horse, and no sooner came to the side of the chaise than he
          turned about and rode back with them; but hinted that perhaps Davy could ride his horse, and himself ride with the lady. But Miss Wideland
          would by no means trust Davy on so spirited an animal, for she had promised his parents to take care of him.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This gentleman’s name was <hi rend="smcaps">Stanmore</hi>. He often leaned over the side of the chaise, and said he was very glad to meet her. He
          was a young man, and seemed as full of spirits as his horse. They rode very gently along for the last mile, and at length came to Mrs.
          <hi rend="smcaps">Meadowly’s</hi>, which was the end of their journey, for this good lady was aunt to Miss Wideland. Mr. Stanmore was off his horse, and had lifted
          the young lady from the chaise, before any servant could come to wait on them. At last came Mrs. Meadowly’s man, old John Harrows, who took
          charge of the horses and carriage; and Mr. Stanmore led the young lady into the parlour, while Davy was sent into the kitchen to have some
          cake and warm ale.</p>
               <lb/>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">CHAP. VI.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                  <hi rend="smcaps">The</hi> maid’s name was Betty. She was a kind-hearted, good servant, but liked to know as much as she could about every body.
          She was quite pleased with Davy’s little fair face, and gave him a stool by the fire, and then asked him a great many questions; as, how
          many brothers and sisters he had? how old he was? and then asked all she could about who that gentleman was who came riding with them? Davy
          said that they met that gentleman on the road. ‘And did you hear his name?’ said Betty. ‘Yes,’ answered Davy; ‘Miss Wideland called him Mr.
          Stanmore.’ ‘I thought so,’ said she; ‘I have heard something of him: I shall see him when I carry the dinner in. And did the lady speak
          kindly to him? What did she say?’ ‘I did not hear all that she said,’ answered Davy, ‘but she looked pleased.’</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">They were talking thus, when in came a dog of a monstrous size, and walked towards Davy, who got up from his seat; for, as
          he sat, the dog’s head was as high as his own, and he was sadly afraid of him. But Betty halloed: ‘Get out, you great beast, and take that
          with you!’ throwing down a large bone which had not been picked very clean. It was so large that Davy at first verily believed it to be a
          joint of meat; and when the dog was gone, said that his mother would have been glad of it. He told her that he had a dog at home, but it was
          not so big as that, and he hoped it never would be; but if he could get a bit of meat off that great dog’s dinner, he would carry it home
          for <hi rend="smcaps">Pity</hi>. Betty gave him a bit directly, which he carefully put in his pocket.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">There was time enough before dinner for Davy to take a walk, and Betty called the servant-boy to go with him, and show him
          about; but he no sooner came in than he stared like a fool. This Jack Bramble was an ill-mannerly and an ill-natured boy, and was laughing
          at Davy’s cap. He did not much mind Betty, or any one else, but called Davy <hi rend="ital">Cat’s Head</hi>, and some other names, for which
          Betty threw the rolling-pin after him with all her might, which rattled on his head and shoulders as he shut the door, saying, ‘that it was
          a shame for a great boy like him to insult a little one, and a stranger too.’ Betty was very right, for of all ill-manners insulting a
          stranger is the worst. Davy, therefore, took a walk by himself, but was careful not to go out of sight of the house. When he returned he
          said he had been talking with two boys, who were keeping sheep upon the hill, and they had been disputing about the sheep, for they were not
          like Mr. Wideland’s sheep: these had white faces and no horns. The two boys would have it that their sheep were the best in England; but he
          did not believe they were better than Mr. Wideland’s. It was now dinner-time, and Betty could not stop to hear all he had to say.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">When dinner was done in the parlour, Davy had his in the kitchen with Betty, and John Harrows, and Jack Bramble. The latter
          again began to laugh at Davy’s cap, which lay on the dresser; but he remembered the rolling-pin, and was soon quiet.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">After they had dined, Betty, as she did her work, amused herself by singing a song which Davy had never heard before. It was
          quite new, she said, for she bought the ballad at the last fair; and when she learned from Davy that his brother <hi rend="smcaps">Will</hi> was a soldier, and
          that his mother sung sometimes when his father was well, she gave him the ballad, and charged him to give it to his mother. Betty still kept
          singing and working, when in came Miss Wideland and took Davy by the hand and led him into the parlour to her aunt and Mr. Stanmore.’This is
          my footman,’ said she, ‘and I assure you he has more sense than many a clumsy boy of twice his size.’</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Davy had to answer many questions, and after drinking half a glass of wine, had to give an account of what he had seen by
          the way, which he did, to the great amusement of the party. But he was not so happy as he would have been at home, and was glad to hear Miss
          Wideland say it was time to get the chaise ready, as she wished to be home by daylight. Mr. Stanmore gave him sixpence as he came out of the
          parlour, and Mrs. Meadowly gave him another, and a cheesecake to carry home for Jane; and when he went into the kitchen for his cap, Betty
          filled his coat-pockets with apples, and again charged him to give the ballad to his mother. With a heart as light as a feather, he took his
          seat in the chaise; and when Miss Wideland could get away from Mr. Stanmore, they drove off towards home.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The young lady returned by a different road to that by which they came; for they now passed through a large park, over the
          smooth grass for three miles together, where was many a beautiful clump of fir-trees, and many a herd of deer. As the chaise approached the
          deer, they ran into a cluster with such fantastic skips, that Davy observed they looked as if they were jumping for a wager. And now,
          indeed, the boy talked more and faster than he had done during his morning’s ride; and having learned part of the tune of Betty’s song, he
          was occasionally singing half the way home. Miss Wideland asked him if Betty had given him anything to drink in the kitchen.’Yes,’ said he,
          very innocently, ‘I had some small beer twice.’ ‘Then you are not tipsy?’ said she. ‘No, ma’am; only I am so very glad, that I can hardly
          help crying.’ They arrived at Mr. Wideland’s about sunset, and Davy went merrily up the pasture ground to tell his good fortune and his
          adventures to his parents. </p>
               <lb/>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">CHAP. VII.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘<hi rend="smcaps">Here</hi> I am, mother,’ said Davy, giving Jane her present, and placing his apples on the table; ‘and I have got something
          besides!’ Here he pulled out his money, when they all said, ‘We see you are here, but what have you got upon your head? You have not been in
          that cap, have you?’ ‘Yes, I have; and it is my own, too.’ They were highly delighted with the account he gave of his journey, and his
          mother made him tell all about Mr. Stanmore, for she knew nothing of him; but she found from Davy that Miss Wideland talked more to him than
          she did to her aunt; and asking him further, as to whether he had ever seen this Mr. Stanmore at Mr. Wideland’s, Davy said ‘No,’ but he
          thought Miss Wideland must have seen him before, because, as he turned back into the parlour to make a bow, he saw their two faces close
          together and Mr. Stanmore said ‘Get along, you rogue.’ Mrs. Woodly could not help smiling, but Davy went on saying: ‘I wonder if my
          grandfather was ever further from home than I have been to-day?’ In this manner did the poor boy express his pleasure, and it did their
          hearts good to find that he loved those who were kind to them as well as to himself. In the midst of his joy, the dog crept from under the
          stool in the corner, and put his feet upon his knee; when he directly bethought himself of the meat which Betty had given him, and Pity had
          a good supper. Old Master Woodly made the smoke fly faster than usual from his pipe, and said: ‘That’s a good boy; your father was just such
          another, only he was so stubborn with it.’ They now handled and looked at the cap, and all agreed that it would do well for a time, and that
          he must take care of it. Davy answered, ‘I like it well enough; but you know, father, it is not a new hat.’</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This was very true, and his father assured him that he should have a hat at <hi rend="ital">Brookside fair</hi>, where he
          should go with a load of brooms, in the month of May. This was a long time to look for; and besides, his mother said, with a deep sigh, she
          was afraid that Mr. Snapgroat would have most of that money for the bread they had been eating during the winter. However, she was not
          willing to vex Davy, and so said no more about it, but thought much of this young Mr. Stanmore, whom the boy had been speaking of; for she
          saw plainly of what amazing consequence it is to the poor to have their rich neighbours kind and tender-hearted.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Davy now sat considering to himself, as if he had not done all that he was bidden to do; then, fumbling in all his pockets,
          he pulled out the ballad, and said: ‘O mother, I have got something for you. Betty gave me this ballad, it is about a soldier; and she can
          sing a great deal louder than you. I wish you could hear her.’ His mother took the ballad, and began to read it aloud, but stopped in the
          middle, because it was about <hi rend="ital">Soldier Will</hi>, and throwing it on the floor went hastily into the other room. The old man
          took up the ballad, and looked with utmost tenderness and concern on Mrs. Woodly. But Davy could not tell what to make of all this. He had
          often seen his mother cry, as he called it, when she was very much pleased; but he could not see anything in the song that could please her,
          unless it was about his brother <hi rend="smcaps">Will</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The old man then read the ballad to them all, as follows; for Mrs. Woodly soon returned, and Davy was very quiet.</p>

          was not one of this sort. He was almost asleep before he could say his prayers, and his father being unwell, went to bed at the same time;
          but Mrs. Woodly had all her irons at the fire, (for this was Saturday night), and the old man sat up with her, and read several chapters of
          the book of Job, until both of them felt their minds quite easy and composed, and at a late hour retired to rest, offering up as pure and
          earnest a prayer as ever flowed from the patient or the good.</p>

                     <hi rend="smcaps">Sunday</hi>, a day of rest. A country village is still and quiet at all times; but on a Sunday morning it is still more
          peaceable. You do not hear the miller’s cart go by, nor the ploughman’s horses with their clinking chains, going to the field. Even the
          cowboys, though they drive the cows to and from the meadows, know better than to sing and halloo as they go. All the people, though they do
          not dress fine and gay, make themselves as clean as they can. Soon after breakfast the clerk of the parish goes by, with the great church
          key in his hand, and you soon hear the bells begin to chime. This is not heard as we hear it in great cities and towns, along with many
          other bells and other noises; but, as it comes only once a week, the sound is always pleasing, always new, and everybody knows what it
          means.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The Woodlys’ family lived at some distance from the church; but they heard the bells, and Davy and his grandfather set off
          together, as they always did. Mrs. Woodly was getting ready, and, as she put on her cap, and shook her clean apron, Mr. Woodly, who was
          reading the Bible, said, in a low voice, ‘Good Heaven deliver me from trouble.’ He had staid away from church several Sundays before, and
          did not mean to go now; but when his wife asked him to go with her, he said: ‘I can’t find the pleasure I used to do in going to church. I
          am sunk in poverty: I have no decent clothes. These times have ruined me, and I cannot be what I was; and though in my heart I despise the
          sneer of a fool, yet I know that the ’Squire’s gamekeeper, and some others, will let me know that they have better coats than mine, although
          perhaps not of their own buying.’ </p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Mrs. Woodly was vexed to hear him talk so, though she knew what he said to be true, and still asked him tenderly to go with
          her, saying it would ease his mind; and at any rate would be better than sitting at home. But he still answered ‘No.’ ‘Well,’ said she, ‘I
          will go if it were only to pray for <hi rend="smcaps">Peace</hi>, and that I may see my poor boy <hi rend="smcaps">Will</hi>, before I die.’ At the sound of peace and his son’s name, he
          rose instantly from his seat, brushed his hat and shoes, and went to church with his wife. He was one of the psalm-singers, and there were
          several neighbours glad to see him; and he has often said since that he never sung better, nor felt more pleasure than he did that day.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The sun shone in at every window, and cheered the hearts of the people; and there was no noise, except some loud whispering
          amongst the boys, partly about Davy’s cap, which was handed from one end of the bench to the other; but the clerk soon set them to rights,
          for it is very rude and scandalous to talk at church.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The clergyman was an old gentleman who had known the family of the Woodlys for many years, and as he came through the
          church-yard, after service was over, he nodded to Mr. Woodly, and said he was very glad to see him so well, and to see him there, and asked
          after all his family. Just at this instant <hi rend="ital">Will Haynes</hi>, the gamekeeper passed them, and gave a look of contempt and
          scorn on poor Woodly and his wife, who thus saw the wide difference between a wise man and a fool.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The greatest news in the churchyard to-day, was a whisper that Miss Wideland was going to be married, but nobody knew
          when.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">A young woman whose name was Lydia Downs, walked part of the way home with Mrs. Woodly, and asked very earnestly after her
          son <hi rend="smcaps">Will</hi>; for he had spent his Sundays, and all his leisure hours with Lydia, before he met with the party of recruits that took him from
          home, and persuaded him to be a soldier. Lydia said that the ’Squire, her master, believed that war would be over in six months, and, ‘Who
          knows,’ said she, ‘but he may come home again?’</p>

                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">CHAP. IX.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                     <hi rend="smcaps">It</hi> has already been said that Davy was to have a new hat at the fair in the month of May, and his father worked hard for
          many weeks, until the time was nearly come.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The load of brooms lay ready in the shed, but how was a cart to be had? Old John Headland was the only <hi rend="ital">little</hi> farmer now left in the village, and he used a cart to do his work. He had brought up a large family, but they were all gone
          from him to seek their own living; he was, therefore, glad of the help of any of his neighbours in harvest time to get his corn in. A
          bargain was soon made, founded on that excellent old truth, that ‘one good turn deserves another.’ The little farmer lent his horses and
          cart to the broom-maker for the day, on condition that when his field of barley should be ripe the broommaker would come and help him to get
          it home.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Davy was to have gone with his father to the fair, but who can foresee what may happen to disappoint us when we expect a
          pleasure? Old Master Woodly about two days before the time was taken ill, and was forced to keep his bed; and how could Mrs. Woodly look
          after and attend a sick man and nurse Jane besides? So Davy had to stay at home to wait on his grandfather; and he did it cheerfully because
          he knew that had he himself been ill his grandfather would have waited on him.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">His father drove away the cartload of brooms, and Davy sat down by his grandfather’s bedside, and as he heard his mother say
          something about going to the doctor’s for something to cure his grandfather, he did not expect his new hat.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The poor old man groaned and complained sadly, but still he found Davy a good companion, and made him read several parts of
          the Prayer Book and the Testament and told him where to look for them; for by this time the little fellow had learned to read well, because
          he was constantly trying. The old man told Davy many things which happened when he was a little boy, and seemed fond of talking of past
          times; and when Davy asked him how long it was ago, he was quite concerned to see the tears run down his grandfather’s cheeks while he
          answered: ‘How long ago, my boy? Why about sixty-five years! I had then brothers and sisters, but I have outlived them all, and here I am a
          trouble to your father and mother, but <hi rend="ital">God’s will be done!</hi>’ Davy stood up by the bed and cried too, though he hardly
          knew what for. The old man said that his pains came so thick upon him they put him in mind of the horse that was stung to death by bees.
          Davy asked when that was, and where, and how long ago? Master Woodly told him to look in the bottom of his wig-box, and there he would find
          some verses he had made about it; ‘and,’ said he, ‘put the other pillow under my head, and I will read it to you; it may make me forget my
          pains a little while. This is a true story, Davy; for I assure you I saw the poor horse die.’</p>

                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">While Davy was pitying the poor horse, and Master Woodly laying down the paper and groaning sadly, as before, in came Abel
          Cloutham, who lived at Mr. Wideland’s, and set down a basket containing a bottle of wine and a small chicken, saying that Mr. Stanmore was
          at their house, and had been talking about Davy; and, hearing that Master Woodly was ill, he and his young mistress had sent a little
          present, and desired to know how he did. ‘I do very badly,’ said the old man; ‘but they are very good, and I thank them.’ Then as he turned
          his face to the pillow, said, more softly: ‘I know this comes from that good soul, Miss Wideland; and, if I ever live to walk again, I will
          use the first strength I have to go down myself to thank her.’</p>
                  <lb/>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">CHAP. X.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                     <hi rend="smcaps">Late</hi> at night Mr. Woodly came home, having left the cart and horses at neighbour Headland’s. He brought a phial of medicine
          from the doctor’s, which cost two shillings; and as two other such were taken by his father, he paid as much for them as would have bought
          the boy two new hats. But they had the pleasure to see the sick man grow better every day, and he was soon able to walk out, or to sit in
          his favourite chair at the top of the garden. Here he would listen to Davy’s chat, or sometimes sing psalms. It had a strange sound to sing
          psalms in the open air; but they had a blackbird, which always sung in the garden hedge, and linnets and thrushes without number, were
          within hearing, all singing from morning till night, and what was theirs but singing psalms? The hedges were white with the May-blossom, and
          you could not set your foot in the pasture without treading on a cowslip. The heart which could not rejoice at such a sight must surely be
          either very unhappy, very insensible, or very wicked.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Everything seemed to smile on this family once again. Thus the summer passed on, week after week, and nothing could give
          more pleasure than to see that the coming harvest was likely to bring a general blessing; and when it was ripe, even the farmers themselves
          said that finer crops had not been seen for many years.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The busy time of harvest soon began. Mr. Woodly, according to his bargain, helped neighbour Headland home with his barley,
          while Mrs. Woodly and Davy went every day to glean in such wheat-fields as were cleared along with all the poor women and children in the
          parish. Jane went too, and when she was sleepy was laid down on some sunny bank, where she slept as sound as in a bed. They got, during the
          harvest, a quantity of good corn, and had hopes of meeting the winter without such dread as they had felt before.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It was the talk amongst the gleaners that Miss Wideland was to be married when harvest was over, and that Mr. Stanmore was
          to have the farm which the ’Squire held, as the ’Squire was going to live in London. All this proved true, which is more than can always be
          said of tales told in the field or in the church-yard. Nobody liked Will Haynes, the gamekeeper: he was an insolent fellow, and they were
          glad he was going; nay, it was a certain fact that the ’Squire, his master, had not done so much good in the neighbourhood as his wealth and
          station enabled him to do, and such squires might as well live in London as anywhere else.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">September was now come. The days grew shorter, and every face was tanned with the sun, but every heart was glad of the
          plenty which the earth afforded; and both the rich and the poor began to think of providing wood and furze to lay up for winter firing.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">But the most particular thing which happened to the Woodlys’ family was this: Miss Wideland called one morning, and said
          that Mr. Stanmore would soon be their neighbour, and then he would take Davy to live with him, and would provide him in clothes, and teach
          him writing and figures; ‘and,’ said she, ‘I know Davy will be a good boy, because I have tried him.’ Mrs. Woodly thanked her, as we often
          do, more with our looks than our words; and Miss Wideland had a good mind to sit down and tell the poor woman all that was going on; but she
          did not, thinking, perhaps, that young women ought to hold their tongues on such occasions, for a wedding in a village is sure to be known
          time enough. Mrs. Woodly, therefore, who understood her meaning, only said: ‘I do believe that the gentleman is worthy of you, and I wish
          you a long life of happiness.’</p>

                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">CHAP. XI.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                     <hi rend="smcaps">Davy</hi> was not at home when the young lady called; but he was highly delighted when he heard that he was to live with his old
          friend Miss Wideland, and told his mother that he knew she was to be married on Wednesday morning, for he heard the maid say so. And so it
          proved; for the clergyman came to the church, and a gay company from Mr. Wideland’s, amongst whom was Mr. Stanmore, who was full of mirth
          and good-will, and the sensible, modest, Charlotte Wideland. Half the people in the parish were in the church-yard by the time the ceremony
          was over, and most of the young women curtsied and nodded, with as much freedom as they dared. The boys halloed and tumbled on the grass,
          and the men set the bells a-ringing. It was too late in the year to have flowers to strew in their path; but who would not rather have his
          path strewn with good wishes than with the sweetest flowers that ever grew?</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Lydia Downs, though she lived in the ’Squire’s family, was not going with them to London, but had agreed to live at Mr.
          Stanmore’s; so that she only had a new master and mistress: but the ’Squire’s family were not going away until the middle of October. She
          knew that Davy was to live with her at Mr. Stanmore’s; but she thought much more of Will Woodly than she did of Davy.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">About a fortnight after the marriage of Miss Wideland, Mr. Snapgroat brought a letter from the town, where he had been to
          buy goods for his shop. It was directed: ‘<title>To Lydia Downs, at Peter Broughton’s, Esq.</title>,’ and dated ‘<hi rend="ital">Jamaica,
            June 10th</hi>, 1801.’</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">How rejoiced was she to find the truth and constancy of her lover!</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The first words of the letter were the sweetest she had ever read in her life:</p>
                  <lb/>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">‘My Dear Lydia,</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent2">I write to you because you were the last person I saw who was dear to me when I left England. A vast and dangerous ocean
          rolls between us; yet, my dear girl, I hope to see you again. I shall never be happy till I do. If ever I should come home, and find you and
          my parents, and my poor old grandfather alive, I shall be crazy with joy. And though I have been a fool, and left you, may I hope, Lydia,
          that you will not marry another, until you are sure that I am dead! Sometimes amongst my comrades I forget for awhile that I am so far from
          home; but I am sure to think of you all when I am alone. If my relations are living tell them that if I could hear of peace, I should be
          almost sure of seeing them and you again, for our regiment is to return to England. I wish I could see you read this letter; I could then
          tell whether you still thought or cared for your old friend and true lover,</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent5">
                     <hi rend="smcaps">William Woodly</hi>.</p>
                  <lb/>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">P.S. Tell my friends that I am well. A thousand blessings on you, my dear girl. If I write any more I shall cry, and my
          fellow-soldiers will laugh at me.’</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">____</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">If Will had really seen Lydia reading this letter, he must have been blind if he had not found that she remembered him
          truly. With her eyes full of tears she hastily put the letter into her bosom, and set off to Mrs. Woodly’s; but had to turn back for her
          bonnet, which she had forgot in her hurry. She then began her journey again, and, as people often run when they are pleased, so did Lydia;
          and when she got there was so out of breath that she could only say ‘Your son Will!’ But she soon gave Mr. Woodly the letter, who read it
          through, but was so much affected that he went into the yard and left them to themselves.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">Mrs. Woodly then read it with all the tenderness of a mother; and old Master Woodly put on his spectacles, and read it
          again, and said, ‘I knew the boy would be true to you, Lydia; I knew he would! And we may very likely all see him again, and be happier than
          we have been.’</p>
                  <lb/>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">CHAP. XII.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                     <hi rend="smcaps">Lydia</hi> went home with a heart full of pleasure and expectation; and it was not more than ten days, as she waited at table,
          that she heard the news from London, that <hi rend="smcaps">Peace</hi> was signed. The ’Squire read it himself, and as he had laid a wager upon how long the war
          would continue, and had now won it, he got up from table, and shouted as loud as he could. Lydia trembled all over; and, without stopping to
          consider who would fill her place, or wait on her master, directly left the room, and went as quick as before to Mrs. Woodly, who thanked
          God for the news, in a manner that would have moved a stone to have heard and seen her.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Davy, understanding that his brother Will was coming home, asked more questions than any of them had time to answer. They
          talked so loud that <hi rend="smcaps">Pity</hi> barked along with them. The new-married Mrs. Stanmore now came, almost as fast as Lydia had done, and brought the
          same news; and said that the price of corn would fall, and they would have better times.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">All this time Mr. Woodly was gone out, and nobody knew whither. The truth was that he had been overjoyed at what he heard,
          and had set out instantly to a little market-town at a distance of two miles to hear for a certainty whether it was true, and to buy
          something which he had long wanted for his boy Davy. While they were speaking of him, they saw him coming over a field at the distance of
          half a mile.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">He soon came in and looked full of joy too; for he had there heard the news of peace, and had left the town all in an
          uproar. They thus all talked together, except old Master Woodly, who sat in his elbow-chair, and talked to himself, and perhaps enjoyed as
          much pleasure as any of them.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Mrs. Stanmore and Lydia stayed to talk over the good news as long as they could, and then left them as rich in happiness as
          any family in England.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It grew almost dark, and as Mr. Woodly had been walking, and they had dined long before, Davy took the bellows and made the
          fire roar; and his mother put two extra spoonsful of tea into the blue tea-pot, to make a comfortable cup. The fire shone cheerfully round
          upon the floor, and Davy began to ask what his father had been from home for, and what he had brought in that brown paper parcel under the
          table? His father answered: ‘Why, I have been, my boy, to please myself as well as you. I would not tell you anything of my going, for fear
          you should be disappointed, as you have been before.’ Here the old man said, slily, ‘Davy, I think I can guess what it is;’ and so said his
          mother. ‘Why, yes, father,’ said Mr. Woodly, ‘you may guess, and my wife too, for she knows how I had set my heart upon it; and you both
          know too, that the poor boy has been without a hat this twelvemonth. And while we were obliged to receive help of the parish, I should not
          have valued the hat if I could have bought it then, so much as I do now I buy it with my own money. Come here, Davy.’ Then, putting the <hi rend="smcaps">Hat</hi>
          on the boy’s head, he seemed full as pleased as Davy himself. It was a conquest over poverty:—his heart glowed with a father’s pride; and,
          without some such pride, no father will buy new hats for his boys, nor will any boy try to be foremost in his learning. If, therefore, any
          good boy should read this story, and should have been very poor, and often disappointed, I earnestly advise him to have patience, and to
          remember <title>Little Davy’s New Hat</title>.</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">By 1811, Bloomfield was finding that, despite the enormous sales of his first three collections, the
          income from his poetry was no longer sufficient to provide him and his family with a living. There were many mouths to feed—not just his
          immediate family but those of his brothers Isaac and George. There were also spiralling expenses repairing <ref type="m"

          sought to reduce outgoings by moving from London to the Bedfordshire village of <ref type="m"

          placedness in village life that he recalled in his Suffolk youth. But in Shefford poverty loomed as <ref type="m"

          retrenched. From 1816, the postwar economic recession made matters worse, making it hard to interest publishers in new works. Changing
          taste, in a nation used to daily news of battles, played a part: Byron’s and Scott’s chivalric tales, full of thrilling, heroic action,
          became the new vogue; Bloomfield’s village tales, bucolic and comic, seemed tame by comparison.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s eclipse was gradual but irreversible. In 1814 the onetime market leader was tentative but
          hopeful: ‘I somtimes dream’, he wrote, ‘that I shall one day venture again before the public somthing in my old manner, some country tales,
          and spiced with love and courtship might yet please, for Rural life by the art of Cooking may be made a relishing and high flavourd dish,
          whatever it may be in reality’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.294.html">Letter
          294</ref>, 4 October 1814). Advancing arthritis, partial blindness, and debilitating migraines impeded his capacity to write however, and no
          new publication appeared in the next seven years. By 1819, he at least had manuscript material to offer publishers, but found them
          unenthusiastic, telling his daughter ‘I am grieved to wound your feelings, but I realy doubt that myself and my poetry are out of fashion
          from the taste of the times. <ref type="m"

          Moore) did not bite, and nothing from Bloomfield’s pen appeared in 1819, 1820 or 1821.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
            publication of Crabbe’s <title>Tales of the Hall</title> in 1819, for which he was paid £3,000 by Murray, may have prompted Bloomfield to

            September 1819) and may also partly explain his decision to change the title of the work from ‘Oakly Hall’ to <title>May-Day with the

          illumination the repression by which the ruling classes maintained their grip on power, all the while fearing revolution. Bloomfield knew he
          was now living through a reactionary era, in which the classes were polarised, and his public response was to create, in his final
          collection of poems <title>May-Day with the Muses</title> (1822), a pastoral fantasy wherein the literary circle once offered him by

          reconstituted in an idealised village. </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Lloyd Baker’s insensitive letter reached Bloomfield when <title>May-Day</title> was already in press
          with Baldwin, Cradock and Joy. Writing to Baldwin on 5 June (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.355.html">Letter 355</ref>), Bloomfield made plain his
          financial plight, and the reduced worth of his poetry. He noted that Baldwin had been uninterested in buying a share of the copyright, not
          wanting to risk the firm’s money on the publication: this was not the arrangement that had operated for <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>,
            <title>Rural Tales</title>, and <title>Wild Flowers</title>. He needed money so badly that he asked Baldwin for a loan, to be repaid in
          instalments from future sales receipts: effectively giving up, in all but name, a quarter of his copyright. Baldwin agreed to this, and to a
          later request to buy a further quarter, for which Bloomfield received £100. In spring 1822 a first edition of a thousand copies was
          published, priced at two shillings and sixpence (3000 had been printed for both the first and second editions of <title>Wild
          Flowers</title>). A second edition, in duodecimo at four shillings, also of a thousand copies, appeared later in the year—but this was not
          enough to redeem Bloomfield’s fortunes. He was a poor man when he died the following summer, dying so indebted that his family had to hold,
          in their home village, a public sale of his books and household goods.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                  <title>May-Day</title> is a collection set in a village in which poetry is able to substitute for money
          and rent can be paid in verse. Built on a conceit, it is ostensibly the fruit of a poetry slam organized to celebrate the traditional May
          Day festivities. The local squire, Sir Ambrose Higham, Bloomfield imagines, invites the villagers to recite poems about village life,
          accepting them in lieu of rent. Thus the landowner renews old customs, preferring poetry to money as a sign of value, and patronizes, in the
          best sense, rustics who are able to voice their rural experience as verse. The squire respects his tenants and they him: the ideal village,
          for Bloomfield, is self-policing. This was an old-fashioned and forlorn hope, perhaps, in face of the capitalization of farming and the
          coerciveness of squires such as Lloyd Baker, but it was one to which Wordsworth, Southey, and Gilpin also subscribed as did Cobbett: despite
          their political differences, their common commitment to the superiority of the remembered rural society of their youth over the capitalist
          one of the present led them all to romanticize a rural paternalism that was both radical and conservative in its opposition to the liberal,
          laissez faire ideology of ‘improvement’ that enriched the landowning classes while impoverishing their labourers.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Comprising ballads and lyrics, <title>May-Day</title> is effectively a conservative revisiting of
            <title>Rural Tales</title> and <title>Lyrical Ballads</title>, with a frame narrative that, like <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth’s</ref> Preface (which
          Bloomfield had admired in 1802), was designed to outline the poems’ social import and to prepare for their proper reception by the reader.
          Wordsworth himself had embarked on a conservative reworking of the radical <title>Lyrical Ballads</title> in his ‘Song at the Feast of
          Brougham Castle’ (1807), in which the poet is imagined as a having the valued role of a bard singing of the deeds of the local Lord Clifford
          in the presence of that lord, his retainers, and tenants. In <title>May-Day</title> not only does it seem that to be a rural poet is to be a
          cherished villager and vice versa, but also that poetry is a face-to-face oral activity of a united community. The benevolent squire,
          moreover, respects tradition and exacts no political toll for his benevolence, which he in fact regards as his duty. Meanwhile, the
          individual poems that the villagers recite also tell of a traditional society in which authority is vested, at local level, in the community
          at large, presided over by a single figure who can therefore be addressed, appealed to, and even, potentially, rebuked and chastised face to
          face—the squire.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The community at large is invoked in ‘The Drunken Father’, a comic tale narrating a potentially tragic
          story of paternal neglect. The poem evokes ‘The Idiot Boy’ because it features a mother worrying about her young child, out on an errand at
          night. As in that poem, the errand is a comic journey that might have been tragic—the child rescues his drunken father from the alehouse and
          navigates him safely home in the dark. The mother is relieved; her emotion, however, is the center of the drama. Domestic harmony is
          endorsed; the father agrees to reform and become, in the eyes of the villagers, an upstanding family man. If this ending imagines the
          village as being largely free of exploitation and mostly capable of healing its own social ills, then ‘The Forester’ offers a more critical
          view, implicitly endorsing a radical politics of nature. Bloomfield has his narrator use the oak-tree motif that had served to legitimize
          the monarchy since the time of Charles II. A mighty oak in the squire’s park has fallen:</p>

                          target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GraftonGeorgeHenry4">4th Duke of Grafton</ref>, who
            wrote to express his regrets that ‘Mr. B’s muse should have been so long silent’, and mentioned ‘an occurrence such as was witnessed by
            several persons in a neighbouring forest (Salcey), [which] might have roused her from her lethargy, if she had been within reach of
            surveying the remains of the largest oak in the forest, which fell with a prodigious crash, a few days ago, within a hundred yards of the
            principal lodge, of which it had been for an age the chief ornament; the noise attracted the notice of all, but of none more than the
            forest deer, which assembled &amp; remained for some hours around it, as if to perform the funeral obsequies of a departed &amp; reverend
            friend; at last, they seemed mournfully to retire, their movements being silent and slow’ (10 February 1817, <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.308.html">Letter 308</ref>).</note>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The astonished deer, keen to ‘learn and muse’ what the unexpected change means, stand in for the local
          rustics. They also prompt an act of political interpretation by the narrator: he reminds his audience—and us, the readers—that monarchs,
          however mighty, are dependent on the people. There is a hint of Jacobinism about this lesson; the royal oak can represent a ‘bigot’ as well
          as a ‘sage’ king, and bigots can be swept away. The political resonances of this passage were picked up on by the reviewer for
            <title>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine </title>(vol. 11, no. 55 (June 1822), 722–31), who noted that the poem’s speaker ‘seems somewhat
          radically disposed’, and added: ‘We presume from the opinions of his Keeper, that old Sir Ambrose Higham was a Whig, and voted with the
          majority.’ The poem concludes not with a patriotic declaration of loyalty to king and country, but by imagining nature as a levelling
          principle that guarantees individual liberty:</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent5">(lines 89–96)</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s position here is close to that of Wordsworth in 1798: the wilds and forests are a reliable
          refuge and resource for revolutionary freedom, at least for the individual poet if not for the masses. Cowper’s rural radicalism stands
          behind both writers, and Bloomfield honours it by borrowing the oak-tree symbol through which Cowper had most searchingly interrogated
          power.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The next poem, ‘The Shepherd’s Dream: or, Fairies’ Masquerade’, was arguably even more contentious.
          This was read, in spite of Bloomfield’s description of it as ‘a lay, / Harmless and wild and fitting for the day’ (lines 23–4), as a parable
          on the recent wars with France. As the <title>Monthly Review</title> (99 (1822), 89–94) succinctly put it: ‘The shepherd now repeats a very
          fanciful dream, which is in fact an allegorical description of the French Revolution and the great political events that have followed it.’
          Critical opinion on this poem was mixed. <title>The Literary Gazette, and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, &amp;c. </title>(277
          (11 May 1822), 289–91) dismissed it as ‘a sort of allegorical account of Buonaparte’s last campaigns; and furnishes no extract we could wish
          to adduce’, while <title>The Literary Speculum</title> (2 (1822), 1–12) stated that ‘the political allusion’ to Napoleon’s fate ‘might have
          been spared, as it is out of place’. As above, the review in <title>Blackwood’s</title> is enlightening. ‘The old shepherd’, it admitted, is
          ‘beautifully introduced’, but the poem itself was a more difficult proposition. ‘It must have puzzled the audience not a little’, claimed
          the reviewer, ‘and on the first reading it was to us an enigma’:</p>
               <quote>It is no less an affair than a poetical summary of some of the principal events in the later parts of Napoleon’s life—the Russian
          expedition—his subsequent campaigns, his banishment to Elba—return to Paris—Waterloo—and St Helena.—It will be remembered, that Mr
          Bloomfield was the protegé of Capel Loft [<hi rend="ital">sic</hi>], a gentleman who believed with Sir Richard Phillips, that Napoleon was a
          man of pacific disposition, fond of home-comforts, and an empassioned lover of freedom. It is laughable to observe honest Robert Bloomfield
          adopting such insane absurdities: but the poem, notwithstanding, is excellent.</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Within <title>May-Day</title> as a whole, however, radical statements are few, and most reviewers did
          not regard the collection as being jacobinical so much as sentimental. ‘Alfred and Jennet’, a ‘father’s tale’ about his daughter’s first
          love for a local youth who is blind, and written in the couplet form of The Farmer’s Boy, won many plaudits.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The longest poem in the book, ‘Alfred and Jennet’ was probably the earliest written. ‘I long to be at home to finish <hi rend="ital">Jennet</hi> &amp;c.’, Bloomfield informed his wife in May 1813, ‘for I am determined to get more money for my rhymes’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.282.html">Letter 282</ref>).</note>
                  <title>The Eclectic
            Review</title> (NS 27 (1822), 548–51) thought it the ‘best thing in the volume’ but, in a sign of the times, felt it necessary to make a
          case for Bloomfield, neglected as he now was:</p>
               <quote>
                  <hi rend="smcaps">Few</hi> poets have more honestly won, or more meekly worn their honours than Robert Bloomfield. That he is a poet,
          we will maintain in the face of all critics Northern and Southern, who would insinuate to the contrary. Had he been so fortunate as to come
          into the world fifty years earlier, no one would have thought of depreciating his claims. But the literary world has been of late pampered
          into daintiness. The Farmer’s Boy was too <hi rend="ital">loftily</hi> bepraised at its first appearance. It owed, it is true, much of its
          temporary success to the well-meant endeavours of its Editor and Commentator; and so far the Poet was under great obligations to his
          Maecenas. But the ebb-tide of popular feeling has fallen proportionably below the mark, and has left the poet scarcely afloat.</quote>
               <quote>It has been brought as a heavy and annihilating charge against Bloomfield, that he is not either <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BurnsRobert">Burns</ref> or <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ClareJohn">Clare</ref>. To compare him with the former,
          were absurd, for Burns was not an uneducated man; and it were not less invidious to set up young Lubin to the disparagement of old Giles.
          But, as such a comparison has been hinted at, we will just take the liberty to remark, that had Giles been left to follow the plough,
          instead of stooping over the last in Bell Alley, or vegetating at the Shepherd and Shepherdess in the City Road,—had he remained a peasant
          and a pupil of Nature till his limbs had acquired their full development, his frame had been strung to health, and his education as a poet
          had been completed by the woods and the streams, the winds and the sunshine, and the quiet of the country, our Farmer’s Boy would have led
          off with the Muses on May-day in a far higher style than must now be expected from him. The man has brain enough, as his ample forehead
          testifies. The ‘anterior cerebral lobes,’ as Mr. Lawrence would say, are sufficiently developed to admit of his excelling as a poet. And he
          has certainly heart enough, for never was a more passionate lover of rural Nature. All that seems wanted is, a greater portion of physical
          elasticity, that should have given a healthful vigour to his thoughts, and tone to his feelings. The feebleness which is occasionally
          betrayed in his productions, is that induced by the languid action of a crazy frame, originally unworthy of the mind which it serves, and
          rendered still more inadequate to the higher functions of imagination by perpetual ill-health and concomitant anxieties, ‘I have written
          these tales,’ he tells us, ‘in anxiety and in a wretched state of health; and if these formidable foes have not incapacitated me, but left
          me free to meet the public eye with any degree of credit, that degree of credit I am sure I shall gain.’ They have not incapacitated him for
          pleasing those who are disposed to be pleased with wild-flowers and May-blossom, and such simple things as go to form a May-day wreath; and
          he must be a ruthless and a heartless critic who would by rough handling doom them to fade a moment before their time.</quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This was special pleading. Readers are asked to look kindly on the poems because they pity Bloomfield’s
          disability and recognise the difficult circumstances in which he had learned to write: condescension is sought because admiration is not to
          be expected. Bloomfield’s vogue has given way to the fashion for Clare, the new ‘peasant poet’ (who, ironically enough, was influenced by
          Bloomfield not simply as an example of a labourer poet but as a craftsman in verse).</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <title>Monthly Review</title>, reviewing the second edition, also acknowledged Bloomfield’s
          ‘yesterday’s man’ status, but offered a more robust endorsement of his powers, though suggesting, between the lines, that his rural tales
          were good because they ignored the realities of pain and poverty that other poets confronted: </p>
               <quote>
                  <hi rend="smcaps">While</hi> in Italy we find poets and scholars assuming the character of shepherds, and emulously enrolling
          themselves among <hi rend="ital">Gli Arcadi</hi>, in England our villagers and yeomen not unfrequently exchange the plough for the lyre, and
          the pruning-hook for the pen. Of the two metamorphoses, undoubtedly the latter is the most natural and rational; and it is an honorable
          proof of the extensive influence which our free institutions exert over our habits and feelings, that our literary history affords so many
          instances of eminent authors who have risen to such celebrity from the lowest situations. This is as it should be in the ‘Republic of
          Letters,’ where genius and talent are the only title to superior distinction.—The English public have always recognized the claims of merit,
          however nameless and humble; and among those who have been raised from their obscurity by the public approbation and encouragement, no one
          has deserved his elevation more justly than Robert Bloomfield.</quote>
               <quote>As the author of ‘The Farmer’s Boy,’ this votary of the Muses has long been a favorite with those whose feelings are calm and healthy
          enough to be delighted with poetry, which borrows its only charm from the innocence and simplicity of rural occupations, and the exhibition
          of homely affections. In these quiet and unobtrusive descriptions, no writer has been happier than Bloomfield. Unlike Crabbe, who is always
          most successful when he is painting some scene of wretchedness or knavery,—a young girl breaking her heart at the faithlessness of her
          lover, or a parish-apprentice cheating the overseers,—Bloomfield delights to describe the virtues and happiness of rural life, and thus
          affords us most certainly a more pleasant and more satisfactory picture. We rejoice, therefore, to find him once more appearing before the
          public; giving a proof not only that he is not dead, but that he has not forgotten how to weave together his village rhymes as pleasingly as
          heretofore. </quote>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Noting that there were several poems in Bloomfield’s best, ballad style, there were also some in which
          ‘we observe a straining to reach a higher tone of feeling than is natural to the poet’, the reviewer concluded by ‘assuring our readers that
          they will not find many pleasanter modes of whiling away a gloomy afternoon in Autumn than in the perusal of May-Day with the Muses.’ This
          was to offer modest, if not faint, praise.</p>

          have found a character in the Rambler, No. 82, who made a very different bargain, and who says, ‘And as Alfred received the tribute of the
          Welsh in wolves’ heads, I allowed my tenants to pay their rents in butterflies, till I had exhausted the papilionaceous tribe. I then
          directed them to the pursuit of other animals, and obtained, by this easy method, most of the grubs and insects which land, air, or water
          can supply. . . . . . . . . I have, from my own ground, the longest blade of grass upon record, and once accepted, as a half year`s rent for

          left me free to meet the public eye with any degree of credit, that degree of credit I am sure I shall gain.</p>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">A general feast shall cheer us all </l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">With tents for shelter, laurel boughs</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And wreaths of every flower that blows.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The months are wending fast away;</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Surprise, and mirth, and gratitude, and jeers,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The clown’s broad wonder, th’enthusiast’s tears,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Fresh gleams of comfort on the brow of care,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The sectary’s cold shrug, the miser’s stare,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Were all excited, for the tidings flew </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">As quick as scandal the whole country through.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Rent paid by rhymes at Oakly may be great,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But rhymes for taxes would appal the state,’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Exclaim’d th’ exciseman,—‘and then tithes, alas!</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Thus all still ventured, as the whim inclined,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Remarks as various as the varying mind:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For here Sir Ambrose sent a challenge forth,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That claim’d a tribute due to sterling worth;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And all, whatever might their host regale, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Agreed to share the feast and drink his ale.</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Now shot through many a heart a secret fire,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A new born spirit, an intense desire</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For once to catch a spark of local fame,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And bear a poet’s honourable name!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Already some aloft began to soar,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And some to think who never thought before;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But O, what numbers all their strength applied,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then threw despairingly the task aside</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With feign’d contempt, and vow’d they’d never tried. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Did dairy-wife neglect to turn her cheese,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Or idling miller lose the favouring breeze;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Did the young ploughman o’er the furrows stand,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Or stalking sower swing an empty hand,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">One common sentence on their heads would fall, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas Oakly banquet had bewitch’d them all.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Loud roar’d the winds of March, with whirling snow,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">One brightening hour an April breeze would blow;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Now hail, now hoar-frost bent the flow’ret’s head,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Now struggling beams their languid influence shed, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That scarce a cowering bird yet dared to sing</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Midst the wild changes of our island spring.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet, shall the Italian goatherd boasting cry,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Poor Albion! when hadst thou so clear a sky!’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And deem that nature smiles for him alone; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Her renovated beauties all his own?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">No:—let our April showers by night descend,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Noon’s genial warmth with twilight stillness blend;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The broad Atlantic pour her pregnant breath,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And rouse the vegetable world from death; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Our island spring is rapture’s self to me,</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Thus came the jovial day, no streaks of red</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">O’er the broad portal of the morn were spread,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But one high-sailing mist of dazzling white,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A screen of gossamer, a magic light,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Doom’d instantly, by simplest shepherd’s ken,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To reign awhile, and be exhaled at ten.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">O’er leaves, o’er blossoms, by his power restored,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Forth came the conquering sun and look’d abroad;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Millions of dew-drops fell, yet millions hung,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Like words of transport trembling on the tongue</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Too strong for utt’rance:—Thus the infant boy,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With rosebud cheeks, and features tuned to joy,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Weeps while he struggles with restraint or pain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But change the scene, and make him laugh again,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His heart rekindles, and his cheek appears</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A thousand times more lovely through his tears.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">From the first glimpse of day a busy scene</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Was that high swelling lawn, that destined green,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Which shadowless expanded far and wide,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The mansion’s ornament, the hamlet’s pride;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To cheer, to order, to direct, contrive,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Even old Sir Ambrose had been up at five;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">There his whole household labour’d in his view,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But light is labour where the task is new.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some wheel’d the turf to build a grassy throne</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Round a huge thorn that spread his boughs alone,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Rough-rin’d and bold, as master of the place;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Five generations of the Higham race </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Had pluck’d his flowers, and still he held his sway,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Waved his white head, and felt the breath of May.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some from the green-house ranged exotics round,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To bask in open day on English ground:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And ’midst them in a line of splendour drew</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Long wreaths and garlands, gather’d in the dew.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some spread the snowy canvas, propp’d on high</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">O’er shelter’d tables with their whole supply;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some swung the biting scythe with merry face,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And cropp’d the daisies for a dancing space. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some roll’d the mouldy barrel in his might,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">From prison’d darkness into cheerful light,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And fenced him round with cans; and others bore</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The creaking hamper with its costly store,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Well cork’d, well flavour’d, and well tax’d, that came</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">From Lusitanian mountains, dear to fame,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">To eastern triumphs and the realms of day.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A thousand minor tasks fill’d every hour,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Till the sun gain’d the zenith of his power, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When every path was throng’d with old and young,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And many a sky-lark in his strength upsprung</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To bid them welcome.—Not a face was there</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But for May-day at least had banish’d care;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">No cringing looks, no pauper tales to tell,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">No timid glance, they knew their host too well,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Freedom was there, and joy in every eye:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Such scenes were England’s boast in days gone by.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Beneath the thorn was good Sir Ambrose found,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His guests an ample crescent form’d around; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nature’s own carpet spread the space between,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where blithe domestics plied in gold and green.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The venerable chaplain waved his wand,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And silence follow’d as he stretch’d his hand,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And with a trembling voice, and heart sincere,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Implored a blessing on th’ abundant cheer.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Down sat the mingling throng, and shared a feast</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With hearty welcomes given, by love increased;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A patriarch family, a close-link’d band,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">True to their rural chieftain, heart and hand: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The deep carouse can never boast the bliss,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The animation of a scene like this.</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">At length the damask cloths were whisk’d away,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Like fluttering sails upon a summer’s day;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The hey-day of enjoyment found repose;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The worthy baronet majestic rose;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They view’d him, while his ale was filling round,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The monarch of his own paternal ground.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His cup was full, and where the blossoms bow’d</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Over his head, Sir Ambrose spoke aloud, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nor stopp’d a dainty form or phrase to cull—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His heart elated, like his cup, was full:—</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Dull must that clown be, dull as winter’s sleet,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Who would not instantly be on his feet:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">An echoing health to mingling shouts gave place,</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">And eat the very heart of social joy;—</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Each eye inquiring through the ring was glanced</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To see who dared the task, who first advanced;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That instant started Philip from the throng,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Philip, a farmer’s son, well known for song,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And, as the mingling whispers round him ran,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He humbly bow’d, and timidly began:—</l>

                     <hi rend="smcaps">I had</hi> folded my flock, and my heart was o’erflowing,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I loiter’d beside the small lake on the heath;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The red sun, though down, left his drapery glowing,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And no sound was stirring, I heard not a breath:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I sat on the turf, but I meant not to sleep, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And gazed o’er that lake which for ever is new,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where clouds over clouds appear’d anxious to peep</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">From this bright double sky with its pearl and its blue.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Forgetfulness, rather than slumber, it seem’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When in infinite thousands the fairies arose</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">All over the heath, and their tiny crests gleam’d</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">In mock’ry of soldiers, our friends and our foes.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">There a stripling went forth, half a finger’s length high,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And led a huge host to the north with a dash;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Silver birds upon poles went before their wild cry, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">While the monarch look’d forward, adjusting his sash.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Soon after a terrible bonfire was seen,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The dwellings of fairies went down in their ire,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But from all I remember, I never could glean</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Why the woodstack was burnt, or who set it on fire.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The flames seem’d to rise o’er a deluge of snow,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That buried its thousands,—the rest ran away;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For the hero had here overstrain’d his long bow,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet he honestly own’d the mishap of the day.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then the fays of the north like a hailstorm came on, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And follow’d him down to the lake in a riot,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where they found a large stone which they fix’d him upon,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And threaten’d, and coax’d him, and bade him be quiet.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He that conquer’d them all, was to conquer no more,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But the million beheld he could conquer alone;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">After resting awhile, he leap’d boldly on shore,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When away ran a fay that had mounted his throne.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas pleasant to see how they stared, how they scamper’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">By furze-bush, by fern, by no obstacle stay’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And the few that held council, were terribly hamper’d, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For some were vindictive, and some were afraid.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I saw they were dress’d for a masquerade train,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Colour’d rags upon sticks they all brandish’d in view,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And of such idle things they seem’d mightily vain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Though they nothing display’d but a bird split in two.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then out rush’d the stripling in battle array,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And both sides determined to fight and to maul:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Death rattled his jawbones to see such a fray,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And glory personified laugh’d at them all.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Here he fail’d,—hence he fled, with a few for his sake, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And leap’d into a cockle-shell floating hard by;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">It sail’d to an isle in the midst of the lake,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where they mock’d fallen greatness, and left him to die.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Meanwhile the north fairies stood round in a ring,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Supporting his rival on guns and on spears,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Who, though not a soldier, was robed like a king;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet some were exulting, and some were in tears.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A lily triumphantly floated above,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The crowd press’d, and wrangling was heard through the whole;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some soldiers look’d surly, some citizens strove </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To hoist the old nightcap on liberty’s pole.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But methought in my dream some bewail’d him that fell,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And liked not his victors so gallant, so clever,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Till a fairy stepp’d forward, and blew through a shell,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Bear misfortune with firmness, you’ll triumph for ever.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I woke at the sound, all in silence, alone,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The moor-hens were floating like specks on a glass,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The dun clouds were spreading, the vision was gone,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And my dog scamper’d round ’midst the dew on the grass.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I took up my staff, as a knight would his lance, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And said, ‘Here’s my sceptre, my baton, my spear,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And there’s my prime minister far in advance,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Who serves me with truth for his food by the year.’</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">A glorious harvest fill’d my eager sight, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Half shock’d, half waving in a flood of light;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">On that poor cottage roof where I was born</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The sun look’d down as in life’s early morn.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I gazed around, but not a soul appear’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I listen’d on the threshold, nothing heard; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I call’d my father thrice, but no one came;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">It was not fear or grief that shook my frame,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But an o’erpowering sense of peace and home,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Of toils gone by, perhaps of joys to come.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The door invitingly stood open wide, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I shook my dust, and set my staff aside.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How sweet it was to breathe that cooler air,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And take possession of my father’s chair!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Beneath my elbow, on the solid frame,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Appear’d the rough initials of my name, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Cut forty years before!—the same old clock</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Struck the same bell, and gave my heart a shock</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I never can forget. A short breeze sprung,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And while a sigh was trembling on my tongue,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Caught the old dangling almanacks behind, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And up they flew, like banners in the wind;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then gently, singly, down, down, down, they went,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And told of twenty years that I had spent</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Far from my native land:—that instant came</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A robin on the threshold; though so tame, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">At first he look’d distrustful, almost shy,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And cast on me his coal-black stedfast eye,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And seem’d to say (past friendship to renew)</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Ah ha! old worn-out soldier, is it you?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Through the room ranged the imprison’d humble bee, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And bomb’d, and bounced, and struggled to be free,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Dashing against the panes with sullen roar,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That threw their diamond sunlight on the floor;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That floor, clean sanded, where my fancy stray’d</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">O’er undulating waves the broom had made, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Reminding me of those of hideous forms</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That met us as we pass’d the <hi rend="ital">Cape of Storms</hi>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> [An early name
              for the Cape of Good Hope, the southernmost point of Africa.]</note>
                  </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where high and loud they break, and peace comes never;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They roll and foam, and roll and foam for ever.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But <hi rend="ital">here </hi>was peace, that peace which home can yield; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The grasshopper, the partridge in the field,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And ticking clock, were all at once become</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The substitutes for clarion, fife, and drum.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">While thus I mused, still gazing, gazing still</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">On beds of moss that spread the window sill, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I deem’d no moss my eyes had ever seen</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Had been so lovely, brilliant, fresh, and green,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And guess’d some infant hand had placed it there,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And prized its hue, so exquisite, so rare.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Feelings on feelings mingling, doubling rose, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">My heart felt every thing but calm repose;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I could not reckon minutes, hours, nor years,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But rose at once, and bursted into tears;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then, like a fool, confused, sat down again,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And thought upon the past with shame and pain; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I raved at war and all its horrid cost,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And glory’s quagmire, where the brave are lost.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">On carnage, fire, and plunder, long I mused,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And cursed the murdering weapons I had used.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Two shadows then I saw, two voices heard, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">One bespoke age, and one a child’s appear’d.—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">In stepp’d my father with convulsive start,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And in an instant clasp’d me to his heart.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Close by him stood a little blue-eyed maid,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And, stooping to the child, the old man said, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Come hither, Nancy, kiss me once again,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">This is your uncle Charles, come home from Spain.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The child approach’d, and with her fingers light,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Stroked my old eyes, almost deprived of sight.—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But why thus spin my tale, thus tedious be? </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Happy old Soldier! what’s the world to me?</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Change is essential to the youthful heart,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">It cannot bound, it cannot act its part</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To one monotonous delight a slave;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">E’en the proud poet’s lines become its grave: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">By innate buoyancy, by passion led,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">It acts instinctively, it will be fed.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A troop of country lasses paced the green,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Tired of their seats, and anxious to be seen;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They pass’d Sir Ambrose, turn’d, and pass’d again, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some lightly tripp’d, to make their meaning plain:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The old man knew it well, the thoughts of youth</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Came o’er his mind like consciousness of truth,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Or like a sunbeam through a lowering sky,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">It gave him youth again, and ecstacy; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He joy’d to see them in this favourite spot,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Who of fourscore, or fifty score, would not?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He wink’d, he nodded, and then raised his hand,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas seen and answer’d by the Oakly band.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Forth leap’d the light of heart and light of heel, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">E’en stiff limb’d age the kindling joy could feel.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They form’d, while yet the music started light;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The grass beneath their feet was short and bright,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where thirty couple danced with all their might.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The Forester caught lasses one by one, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And twirl’d his glossy green against the sun;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The Shepherd threw his doublet on the ground,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And clapp’d his hands, and many a partner found:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His hat-loops bursted in the jocund fray,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And floated o’er his head like blooming May. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Behind his heels his dog was barking loud,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And threading all the mazes of the crowd;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And had he boasted one had wagg’d his tail,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And plainly said, ‘What can my master ail?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To which the Shepherd, had he been more cool, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Had only said, ‘’Tis Oakly feast, you fool.’</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">But where was Philip, he who danced so well?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Had he retired, had pleasure broke her spell?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">No, he had yielded to a tend’rer bond,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He sat beside his own sick Rosamond, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Whose illness long deferr’d their wedding hour;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She wept, and seem’d a lily in a shower;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She wept to see him ’midst a crowd so gay,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For her sake lose the honours of the day.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But could a gentle youth be so unkind? </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Would Philip dance, and leave his girl behind?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She in her bosom hid a written prize,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Inestimably rich in Philip’s eyes;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The warm effusion of a heart that glow’d</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With joy, with love, and hope by Heaven bestow’d.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He woo’d, he soothed, and every art assay’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To hush the scruples of the bashful maid,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Drawing, at length, against her weak command,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Reluctantly the treasure from her hand:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And would have read, but passion chain’d his tongue, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He turn’d aside, and down the ballad flung;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And paused so long from feeling and from shame,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That old Sir Ambrose halloo’d him by name:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Bring it to me, my lad, and never fear,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I never blamed true love, or scorn’d a tear;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They well become us, e’en where branded most.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He came, and made a proxy of his host,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Who, as the dancers cooling join’d the throng,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Eyed the fair writer as he read her song.</l>

                     <hi rend="smcaps">Yes</hi>, let me tell of Jennet, my last child;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">In her the charms of all the rest ran wild,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And sprouted as they pleased. Still by my side,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I own she was my favourite, was my pride, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Since first she labour’d round my neck to twine,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Or clasp’d both little hands in one of mine:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And when the season broke, I’ve seen her bring</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Lapfuls of flowers, and then the girl would sing</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Whole songs, and halves, and bits, O, with such glee!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">If playmates found a favourite, it was she.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Her lively spirit lifted her to joy;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To distance in the race a clumsy boy</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Would raise the flush of conquest in her eye,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And all was dance, and laugh, and liberty.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet not hard-hearted, take me right, I beg,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The veriest romp that ever wagg’d a leg</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Was Jennet; but when pity soothed her mind,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Prompt with her tears, and delicately kind.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The half-fledged nestling, rabbit, mouse, or dove, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">By turns engaged her cares and infant love;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And many a one, at the last doubtful strife,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Warm’d in her bosom, started into life.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">At thirteen she was all that Heaven could send,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">My nurse, my faithful clerk, my lively friend;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Last at my pillow when I sunk to sleep,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">First on my threshold soon as day could peep:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I heard her happy to her heart’s desire,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With clanking pattens, and a roaring fire.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then, having store of new-laid eggs to spare, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She fill’d her basket with the simple fare,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And weekly trudged (I think I see her still)</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To sell them at yon house upon the hill.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Oft have I watch’d her as she stroll’d along,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Heard the gate bang, and heard her morning song;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And, as my warm ungovern’d feelings rose,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Said to myself, ‘Heaven bless her! there she goes.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Long would she tarry, and then dancing home,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Tell how the lady bade her oft’ner come,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And bade her talk and laugh without control;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For Jennet’s voice was music to the soul,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">My tale shall prove it:—For there dwelt a son,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">An only child, and where there is but one,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Indulgence like a mildew reigns, from whence</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Mischief may follow if that child wants sense. </l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Once on a sunbright morning, ’twas in June,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I felt my spirits and my hopes in tune,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And idly rambled forth, as if t’ explore</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The little valley just before my door; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Down by yon dark green oak I found a seat</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Beneath the clustering thorns, a snug retreat</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For poets, as I deem’d, who often prize</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Such holes and corners far from human eyes;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I mark’d young Alfred, led by Jennet, stray</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Just to the spot, both chatting on their way:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They came behind me, I was still unseen;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He was the elder, Jennet was sixteen.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">My heart misgave me, lest I should be deem’d</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A prying listener, never much esteem’d, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But this fear soon subsided, and I said,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘I’ll hear this blind lad and my little maid.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That instant down she pluck’d a woodbine wreath,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The loose leaves rattled on my head beneath;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">This was for Alfred, which he seized with joy,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘O, thank you, Jennet,’ said the generous boy.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Much was their talk, which many a theme supplied,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">As down they sat, for every blade was dried.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I would have skulk’d away, but dare not move,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Besides,’ thought I, ‘they will not talk of love;’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But I was wrong, for Alfred, with a sigh,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A little tremulous, a little shy,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But, with the tenderest accents, ask’d his guide</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A question which might touch both love and pride.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘This morning, Jennet, why did you delay,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And talk to that strange clown upon your way,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Our homespun gardener? how can you bear</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His screech-owl tones upon your perfect ear?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I cannot like that man, yet know not why,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He’s surely quite as old again as I;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He’s ignorant, and cannot be your choice,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And ugly too, I’m certain, by his voice,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Besides, he call’d you pretty.’—‘Well, what then?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I cannot hide my face from all the men;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Alfred, indeed, indeed, you are deceived,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He never spoke a word that I believed;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nay, can he think that I would leave a home</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Full of enjoyment, present, and to come,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">While your dear mother’s favours daily prove</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How sweet the bonds of gratitude and love?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">No, while beneath her roof I shall remain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I’ll never vex you, never give you pain.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Enough, my life,’ he cried, and up they sprung;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">By Heaven, I almost wish’d that I was young;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">It was a dainty sight to see them pass,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Light as the July fawns upon the grass,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Pure as the breath of spring when forth it spreads,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Love in their hearts, and sunshine on their heads.</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Next day I felt what I was bound to do,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To weigh the adventure well, and tell it too;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For Alfred’s mother must not be beguiled,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He was her earthly hope, her only child;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I had no wish, no right to pass it by,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">It might bring grief, perhaps calamity.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She was the judge, and she alone should know</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Whether to check the flame or let it grow.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I went with fluttering heart, and moisten’d eye,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But strong in truth, and arm’d for her reply.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Well, master Bowman, why that serious face?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Exclaim’d the lovely dame, with such a grace, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That had I knelt before her, I had been</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Not quite the simplest votary ever seen.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I told my tale, and urged that well-known truth,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That the soft passion in the bloom of youth</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Starts into power, and leads th’ unconscious heart</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A chase where reason takes but little part;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nothing was more in nature, or more pure,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And from their habits nothing was more sure.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Whether the lady blush’d from pride or joy,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I could but guess;—at length she said—‘My boy </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Dropp’d not a syllable of this to me!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What was I doing, that I could not see?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Through all the anxious hours that I have known,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His welfare still was dearer than my own;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How have I mourn’d o’er his unhappy fate! </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Blind as he is! the heir to my estate!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I now might break his heart, and Jennet’s too;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What must I, Bowman, or what can I do?’—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Do, madam?’ said I, boldly, ‘if you trace</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Impending degradation or disgrace </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">In this attachment, let us not delay;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Send my girl home, and check it while you may.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘I will,’ she said, but the next moment sigh’d;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Parental love was struggling hard with pride.</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I left her thus, deep musing, and soon found</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">My daughter, for I traced her by the sound</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Of Alfred’s flageolet; no cares had they,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But in the garden bower spent half the day.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">By starts he sung, then wildest trillings made,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To mock a piping blackbird in the glade.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I turn’d a corner and approach’d the pair;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">My little rogue had roses in her hair!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She whipp’d them out, and with a downcast look,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Conquer’d a laugh by poring on her book.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">My object was to talk with her aside,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But at the sight my resolution died;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They look’d so happy in their blameless glee,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That, as I found them, I e’en let them be;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Though Jennet promised a few social hours</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Midst her old friends, my poultry, and my flowers.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She came,—but not till fatal news had wrung</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Her heart through sleepless hours, and chain’d her tongue.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She came, but with a look that gave me pain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For, though bright sunbeams sparkled after rain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Though every brood came round, half run, half fly,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I knew her anguish by her alter’d eye;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And strove, with all my power, where’er she came,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To soothe her grief, yet gave it not a name.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">At length a few sad bitter tears she shed,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And on both hands reclined her aching head.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas then my time the conqueror to prove,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I summon’d all my rhetoric, all my love.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Jennet, you must not think to pass through life</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Without its sorrows, and without its strife;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Good, dutiful, and worthy, as you are,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">You must have griefs, and you must learn to bear.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Thus I went on, trite moral truths to string,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">All chaff, mere chaff, where love has spread his wing:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She cared not, listen’d not, nor seem’d to know</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What was my aim, but wiped her burning brow, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where sat more eloquence and living power</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Than language could embody in an hour.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With soften’d tone I mention’d Alfred’s name,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His wealth, our poverty, and that sad blame</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Which would have weigh’d me down, had I not told</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The secret which I dare not keep for gold,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Of Alfred’s love, o’erheard the other morn,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The gardener, and the woodbine, and the thorn;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And added, ‘Though the lady sends you home,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">You are but young, child, and a day may come’—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘She has <hi rend="ital">not </hi>sent me home,’ the girl replied,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And rose with sobs of passion from my side;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘She has <hi rend="ital">not </hi>sent me home, dear father, no;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She gives me leave to tarry or to go;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She has not <hi rend="ital">blamed </hi>me,—yet she weeps no less,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And every tear but adds to my distress;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I am the cause,—thus all that she has done</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Will bring the death or misery of her son.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Jealous he might be, could he but have seen</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How other lads approach’d where I have been;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But this man’s voice offends his very soul,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">That strange antipathy brooks no control;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And should I leave him now, or seem unkind,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The thought would surely wreck his noble mind;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To leave him thus, and in his utmost need! </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Poor Alfred! then you will be blind indeed!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I will not leave him.’—‘Nay, child, do not rave,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What, would you be his menial, be his slave?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Yes,’ she exclaim’d, and wiped each streaming eye,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Yes, be his slave, and serve him till I die;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He is too just to act the tyrant’s part,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He’s truth itself.’ O how my burthen’d heart</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Sigh’d for relief!—soon that relief was found;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Without one word we traced the meadow round,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Her feverish hand in mine, and weigh’d the case,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nor dared to look each other in the face;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Till, with a sudden stop, as if from fear,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I roused her sinking spirit, ‘Who comes here?’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Down the green slope before us, glowing warm,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Came Alfred, tugging at his mother’s arm;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Willing she seem’d, but he still led the way,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She had not walk’d so fast for many a day;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His hand was lifted, and his brow was bare,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For now no clust’ring ringlets wanton’d there,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">He threw them back in anger and in spleen,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And shouted ‘Jennet’ o’er the daisied green.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Boyish impatience strove with manly grace</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">In ev’ry line and feature of his face;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His claim appear’d resistless as his choice,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And when he caught the sound of Jennet’s voice,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And when with spotless soul he clasp’d the maid,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">My heart exulted while my breath was staid.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Jennet, we must not part! return again;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What have I done to merit all this pain?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Dear mother, share my fortune with the poor,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Jennet is mine, and <hi rend="ital">shall </hi>be—say no more;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Bowman, you know not what a friend I’ll be;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Give me your daughter, Bowman, give her me;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Jennet, what will my days be if you go?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A dreary darkness, and a life of woe: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">My dearest love, come <hi rend="ital">home</hi>, and do not cry;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">You are my daylight, Jennet, I shall die.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To such appeals all prompt replies are cold,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And stately prudence snaps her cobweb hold.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Had the good widow tried, or wish’d to speak,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">This was a bond she could not, dared not break;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Their hearts (you never saw their likeness, never)</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Were join’d, indissolubly join’d for ever.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Why need I tell how soon our tears were dried,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How Jennet blush’d, how Alfred with a stride </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Bore off his prize, and fancied every charm,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And clipp’d against his ribs her trembling arm;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How mute we seniors stood, our power all gone?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Completely conquer’d, Love the day had won,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And the young vagrant triumph’d in our plight,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And shook his roguish plumes, and laugh’d outright.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet, by my life and hopes, I would not part</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">With this sweet recollection from my heart;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I would not now forget that tender scene</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To wear a crown, or make my girl a queen.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Why need be told how pass’d the months along,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How sped the summer’s walk, the winter’s song,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How the foil’d suitor all his hopes gave up,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">How Providence with rapture fill’d their cup?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">No dark regrets, no tragic scenes to prove,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The gardener was too old to die for love.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A thousand incidents I cast aside</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To tell but one—I gave away the bride—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Gave the dear youth what kings could not have given;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then bless’d them both, and put my trust in Heaven.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">There the old neighbours laugh’d the night away,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Who talk of Jennet’s wedding to this day.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And could you but have seen the modest grace,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The half-hid smiles that play’d in Jennet’s face,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Or mark’d the bridegroom’s bounding heart o’erflow,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">You might have wept for joy, as I could now:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I speak from memory of days long past;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Though ’tis a father’s tale, I’ve done at last.</l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">Here rest thee, rest thee, Muse, review the scene</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where thou with me from peep of dawn hast been: </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">We did not promise that this motley throng</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Should every <hi rend="ital">one </hi>supply a votive song,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nor every tenant:—yet thou hast been kind,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For untold tales must still remain behind,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Which might o’er listening patience still prevail, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Did fancy waver not, nor daylight fail.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘The Soldier’s Wife,’ her toils, his battles o’er,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Love in a Shower,’ the riv’let’s sudden roar;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then, ‘Lines to Aggravation’ form the close,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Parent of murders, and the worst of woes.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But while the changeful hours of daylight flew,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some homeward look’d, and talk’d of evening dew;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some watch’d the sun’s decline, and stroll’d around,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some wish’d another dance, and partners found;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">When in an instant every eye was drawn </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To one bright object on the upper lawn;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A fair procession from the mansion came,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Unknown its purport, and unknown its aim.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">No gazer could refrain, no tongue could cease,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">It seem’d an embassy of love and peace. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nearer and nearer still approach’d the train,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Age in the van transform’d to youth again.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Sir Ambrose gazed, and scarce believed his eyes;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas magic, memory, love, and blank surprise,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">For there his venerable lady wore </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The very dress which, sixty years before,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Had sparkled on her sunshine bridal morn,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Had sparkled, ay, beneath this very thorn!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Her hair was snowy white, o’er which was seen,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Emblem of what her bridal cheeks had been, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A twin red rose—no other ornament</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Had pride suggested, or false feeling lent;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">She came to grace the triumph of her lord,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And pay him honours at his festive board.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nine ruddy lasses follow’d where she stepp’d; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">White were their virgin robes, that lightly swept</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The downy grass; in every laughing eye</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Cupid had skulk’d, and written ‘victory.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">What heart on earth its homage could refuse?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Each tripp’d, unconsciously, a blushing Muse.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">A slender chaplet of fresh blossoms bound</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Their clustering ringlets in a magic round.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And, as they slowly moved across the green,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Each in her beauty seem’d a May-day queen.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The first a wreath bore in her outstretch’d hand, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The rest a single rose upon a wand;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Their steps were measured to that grassy throne</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Where, watching them, Sir Ambrose sat alone.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">They stopp’d,—when she, the foremost of the row,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Curtsied, and placed the wreath upon his brow; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The rest, in order pacing by his bower,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">In the loop’d wreath left each her single flower,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then stood aside.—What broke the scene’s repose?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The whole assembly clapp’d their hands and rose.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The Muses charm’d them as they form’d a ring, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And look’d the very life and soul of Spring!</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But still the white hair’d dame they view’d with pride,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Her love so perfect, and her truth so tried.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Oh, sweet it is to hear, to see, to name,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Unquench’d affection in the palsied frame— </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">To think upon the boundless raptures past,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And love, triumphant, conquering to the last!</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Silenced by feeling, vanquish’d by his tears,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The host sprung up, nor felt the weight of years;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet utterance found not, though in virtue’s cause, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But acclamations fill’d up nature’s pause,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Till, by one last and vigorous essay,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">His tide of feeling roll’d itself away;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The language of delight its bondage broke,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And many a warm heart bless’d him as he spoke. </l>

                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Neighbours and friends, by long experience proved,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Pardon this weakness; I was too much moved:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">My dame, you see, can youth and age insnare,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">In vain I strove, ’twas more than I could bear,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Yet hear me,—though the tyrant passions strive, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The words of truth, like leading stars, survive;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I thank you all, but will accomplish more,—</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Your verses shall not die as heretofore;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Your local tales shall not be thrown away,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nor war remain the theme of every lay. </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Ours is an humbler task, that may release</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The high-wrought soul, and mould it into peace.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">These pastoral notes some victor’s ear may fill,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Breathed amidst blossoms, where the drum is still:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">I purpose then to send them forth to try </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The public patience, or its apathy.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The world shall see them; why should I refrain?</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Tis all the produce of my own domain.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Farewell!’ he said, then took his lady’s arm,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">On his shrunk hand her starting tears fell warm; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Again he turn’d to view the happy crowd,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And cried, ‘Good night, good night, good night,’ aloud,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Health to you all! for see, the evening closes,’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Then march’d to rest, beneath his crown of roses.</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">‘Happy old man! with feelings such as these, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The seasons all can charm, and trifles please.’</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">An instantaneous shout re-echoed round,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">’Twas wine and gratitude inspired the sound:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Some joyous souls resumed the dance again,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The aged loiter’d o’er the homeward plain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And scatter’d lovers rambled through the park,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And breathed their vows of honour in the dark;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Others a festal harmony preferr’d,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Still round the thorn the jovial song was heard;</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Dance, rhymes, and fame, they scorn’d such things as these, </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">But drain’d the mouldy barrel to its lees,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">As if ’twere worse than shame to want repose:</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Nor was the lawn clear till the moon arose,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And on each turret pour’d a brilliant gleam</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">Of modest light, that trembled on the stream; </l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">The owl awoke, but dared not yet complain,</l>
                  <l rendition="#indent4">And banish’d silence re-assumed her reign.</l>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s only play, <title>Hazelwood-Hall</title> (1823), the last new work published in his lifetime, was never staged.
          Finished only a few months before, and published in the month of, Bloomfield’s death (August) by <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BaldwinRobert">Baldwin</ref>, Cradock and Joy, it appeared in a smaller edition than his previous works (750 in
          duodecimo, priced 3 shillings). It was reviewed badly and sold so poorly that, writing to <ref type="m"
                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldHannah">Bloomfield’s daughter</ref> after his death, the publishers were unwilling to put any value on the
          copyright, of which Bloomfield had sold them a half share (see <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.369.html">Letter 369</ref>, 2 May 1823 and <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.373.html">Letter 373</ref>, 1 October 1823).</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The drama was clearly a product of the same years of poverty, illness and anxiety as <title>May-Day with the Muses</title>,
          for it too conjured up a village in which the vulnerability of the labouring classes to exploitation—sexual and social—is a spectre summoned
          only to be banished by collective action by the poor. Thus, Mary, a poor, innocent village girl is the target of the seducer Jack Whirlwind,
          a visiting rake who represents fast, fashionable, urban values. Whirlwind is defeated as he tries to abduct Mary in his latest-model
          carriage: Joel Spokeum, the reliable, honest village wheelwright cudgels him. In the end, a proper marriage is made, a legacy having been
          discovered, presided over by Squire Morrison. In effect, the villagers are enabled to enforce traditional standards of behaviour (a moral
          economy) because the community is protected by a benevolent, paternalist squire of the old school, rather than an ‘improving’
          agriculturalist who encloses the land or a profligate absentee landlord. By 1823, the public had encountered this scenario many times before
          in Bloomfield’s work, and to many it now seemed quaintly nostalgic, out of touch with both social conditions on the ground and with the
          increasingly cosmopolitan tastes of the educated classes. It was limited, too, by Bloomfield’s inexperience as a dramatist: the plot is
          hackneyed, depending upon unconvincing reversals of fortune; the characters are flat, lacking individual ways of speaking; there is little
          on-stage action. <title>The British Magazine </title>(1 (1823), 210–12) was blunt: ‘it is more like a Sunday-school tract in dialogue than a
          drama … at the best, puerile: there is nothing in it to deserve criticism’. <title>Gentleman’s Magazine </title>(93, part 2 (1823), 499),
          writing after Bloomfield’s death, was politer, but concurred: it ‘has nothing but simplicity and the name of <hi rend="ital">Bloomfield</hi>
          to recommend it’ it declared, lamenting the fact that Bloomfield’s last publication should have been his weakest. </p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                  <hi rend="smcaps">This</hi> little dramatic sketch is not so new as it may appear to be. So long ago as the year 1805, a gentleman met me on the
          sands at Worthing, and asked me to his house, &amp;c. but I never saw him afterwards. He gave his address, ‘Mr. Goldhawk, Hazelwood-Hall,
          Leith-Hill, Surrey.’ The names never left my mind, and I then thought of trying them in a village tale, or drama, which I actually began.
          The subject has slept ever since, until the publication of my ‘May Day,’ last spring, left me leisure and inclination to put it into its
          present form. I make no pretensions to a knowledge of the ‘dramatic unities,’ or of what is called ‘stage effect.’ It may be like twenty
          plays, which I have never seen. The characters are exclusively villagers, with the exception of <hi rend="ital">Jack Whirlwind</hi>; through
          whom I have endeavoured to censure the horrible vice of seducing unguarded females, and then leaving them to scorn and misery.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">If the more fastidious reader should by chance lay his hand on this trifle, and should object to the very name of play, or
          drama, such reader is assured that he will not find in it either an oath, a pun, or an innuendo. Whatever may be its fate, even if it should
          ultimately get upon the stage, and be subjected to what may be thought the necessary bolsters, stays, and clippings, and these should be
          actual improvements, I shall have nothing to do with them. It is very natural that, thus situated, I should wish to be answerable for
          nothing but what I here print: and I remain the reader’s</p>

                       target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">Charles</ref> who was training to be schoolmaster in London and
          Kent, was in progress by autumn 1822. On 28 October (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.364.html">Letter 364</ref>), Bloomfield advised his son ‘do
          not fail to send me whatever you may have written, I mean <hi rend="ital">all</hi> that you have written about the “Birds and Insects” that
          I may shew Mr Harvey a specimen of the work at Christmas if possible . . . I do what I can at it’. Harvey was the bookseller who specialised
          in children’s literature and who had published <title>The History of Little Davy’s New Hat. </title>Bloomfield, however, was sick and
          depressed, and in a sad letter begun on 23 December 1822 but not finished until 1 February 1823 (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.366.html">Letter 366</ref>) confesses he has not yet sent the
          manuscript to Harvey. On 2 May 1823 he told Charles that ‘I have written more letters for our “post Office”and think it will do well
          considered as a minor concern in our persuits’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.369.html">Letter 369</ref>), but it remained unpublished at his death in August: no deal with Darton and Harvey was done. The work appeared in 1824
          in <title>The Remains of Robert Bloomfield</title>, edited by Bloomfield’s friend Joseph Weston and published for the benefit of
          Bloomfield’s family by Baldwin, Cradock and Joy.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">
                  <title>The Birds’ and Insects’ Post Office </title>is a delightful text book for children, teaching natural history and
          moral conduct by using the charming conceit of having birds and insects write letters to each other: exactly the kind of gentle humour at
          which Bloomfield excels. As Bridget Keegan has shown, it follows in a tradition dating back to Aesop but more recently revived by the
          children’s writers whom he credited in the Preface to <title>Little Davy</title>—Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Sarah Trimmer among them:
          ‘Bloomfield’s prefatory remarks are comparable to those of many Romantic-period children’s writers, such as Sarah Trimmer, who writes in the
          introduction to her The History of Robins (first published as <title>Fabulous Histories</title> in 1786) that it should be taken “not as
          containing the real conversation of birds, (for that is impossible we should ever understand) but as a series of fables intended to convey
          moral instructions applicable to themselves”’.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/praxis/bloomfield/HTML/praxis.2011.keegan.html">‘Bloomfield’s Writing for Children’, in <title>Robert
              Bloomfield: The Inestimable Blessing of Letters</title>, <title>Romantic Circles Praxis.</title>
                     </ref>
                  </note> Bloomfield’s text, it should be
          noted, is full of detailed observation of fauna in its habitat: it is for that reason less ostensible in its moral didacticism than
          Trimmer’s work.</p>
