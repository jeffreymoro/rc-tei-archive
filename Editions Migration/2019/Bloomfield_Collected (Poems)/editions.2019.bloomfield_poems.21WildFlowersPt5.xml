          <l rendition="#indent4">A hawthorn hedge, with wild briars thick entwin’d,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Where unseen trav’llers down a shady way</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Journey’d beside the swaths of new-mown hay,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘I tell you, Peggy, ’tis a time to prove</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Your fortitude, your virtue, and your love.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">From honest poverty our lineage sprung,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Your mother was a servant quite as young;—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">You weep; perhaps <hi rend="ital">she </hi>wept at leaving home;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Courage, my girl, nor fear the days to come.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Go still to church, my Peggy, plainly drest,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And keep a living conscience in your breast;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Look to yourself, my lass, the maid’s best fame,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Beware, nor bring the Meldrums into shame:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Be modest, to the voice of age<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Age] truth <title>Poems
              [Stereotype]</title></note> attend,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Be honest, and you’ll always find a friend:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Your uncle Gilbert, stronger far than I,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Will see you safe; on him you must rely:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I’ve walk’d too far; this lameness, oh! the pain;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Heav’n bless thee, child! I’ll halt me back again;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But when your first fair holiday may be,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Rise with the lark,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rise with the lark,] Do, dearest Peggy, <title>Poems

          <l rendition="#indent5">Young Herbert Brooks, in strength and manhood bold,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Who, round the meads, his own possessions, stroll’d,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">O’erheard the charge, and with a heart so gay,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Whistled his spaniel, and pursu’d his way.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Soon cross’d his path, and short obeisance paid,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Stout Gilbert Meldrum and a country maid;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A box upon his shoulder held full well</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Her worldly riches, but the truth to tell</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She bore the chief herself; that nobler part,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That beauteous gem, an uncorrupted heart.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And then that native loveliness! that cheek!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">It bore the very tints her betters seek;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">At such a sight the libertine would glow</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With all the warmth that <hi rend="ital">he </hi>can ever<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> ever] never
                <title>Poems [Stereotype]</title></note> know;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Would send his thoughts abroad without control,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The glimmering moon-shine of his little soul.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Above the reach of justice I shall soar,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Her friends may weep,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> weep] rail <title>Poems [Stereotype]</title></note> not
            punish; they’re too poor:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That very thought the rapture will enhance,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Poor, young, and friendless; what a glorious chance!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A few spare guineas may the conquest make,—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I love the treachery for treachery’s sake,—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And when her wounded honour jealous grows,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I’ll cut away ten thousand oaths and vows,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And tell my comrades, with a manly stride,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">How I, <hi rend="ital">a girl out witted and out-lied.</hi>’<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> And . . . out-lied]
              And bravely boast, all snarling fools defying, / How I, <hi rend="ital">a girl out-witted</hi>,—just by lying. <title>Poems
                [Stereotype]</title></note></l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Such was not Herbert—he had never known</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Love’s genuine smiles, nor suffer’d from his frown;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And as to that most honourable part</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Of planting daggers in a parent’s heart,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A novice quite:—he past his hours away,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Free as a bird, and buxom as the day;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Yet, should a lovely girl by chance arise,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Think not that Herbert Brooks would shut his eyes.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent5">On thy calm joys with what delight I dream,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Thou dear green valley of my native stream!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Fancy o’er thee still waves th’ enchanting wand,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And every nook of thine is fairy land,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And ever will be, though the axe should smite</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">In Gain’s rude service, and in Pity’s spite,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Thy clustering alders, and at length invade</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The last, last poplars, that compose thy shade:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Thy stream shall then<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> then] still <title>Poems [Stereotype]</title></note> in
            native freedom stray,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And undermine the willows in its way,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">These, nearly worthless, may survive this storm,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">This scythe of desolation call’d ‘Reform.’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">No army past that way! yet are they fled,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The boughs that, when a school-boy, screen’d my head:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I hate the murderous axe; estranging more</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The winding vale from what it was of yore,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Than e’en mortality in all its rage,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And all the change of faces in an age.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Warmth,’ will they term it, that I speak so free;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">They strip thy shades,—thy shades so dear to me!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">In Herbert’s days woods cloth’d both hill and dale;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But peace, Remembrance! let us tell the tale.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent5">His home was in the valley, elms grew round</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">His moated mansion, and the pleasant sound</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Of woodland birds that loud at day-break sing,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With the first cuckoos that proclaim the spring,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Flock’d round his dwelling; and his kitchen smoke,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That from the towering rookery upward broke,</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">But where’s the maid, who in the meadow-way</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Met Herbert Brooks amongst the new-mown hay?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent5">Th’ adventure charm’d him, and next morning rose</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The Sabbath, with its silence and repose;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The bells ceas’d chiming, and the broad blue sky</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Smil’d on his peace, and met his tranquil eye</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Inverted, from the foot-bridge on his way</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To that still house where all his fathers lay;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">There in his seat, each neighbour’s face he knew—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The stranger girl was just before his pew!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He saw her kneel, with meek, but cheerful air,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And whisper the response to every prayer;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And, when the humble roof with praises rung,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He caught the Hallelujah from her tongue,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Rememb’ring with delight the tears that fell</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">When the poor father bade his child farewell;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And now, by kindling tenderness beguil’d,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He blest the prompt obedience of that child,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And link’d his fate with hers:—for, from that day,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Whether the weeks past cheerily away,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Or deep revolving doubts procur’d him pain,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The same bells chim’d—and there she was again!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">What could be done? they came not there to woo,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">On holy ground,—though love is holy too.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent5">They met upon the foot-bridge one clear morn,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">She in the garb by village lasses worn;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He, with unbutton’d frock that careless flew,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And buskin’d to resist the morning dew;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With downcast look she courtsied to the ground,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Just in his path—no room to sidle round.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent5">‘Well, pretty girl, this early rising yields</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">With youth, and wealth, and candour on his side?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Honour took charge of love so well begun,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And accidental meetings, one by one,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Increas’d so fast midst time’s unheeded flight,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That village rumour married them outright;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Though wiser matrons, doubtful in debate,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Pitied deluded Peggy’s hapless fate.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Friends took th’ alarm, ‘And will he then disgrace</l>

          <l rendition="#indent4">Others, more lax in virtue, not in pride,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Sported the wink of cunning on one side;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘He’ll buy, no doubt, what Peggy has to sell,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A little gallantry becomes him well.’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Meanwhile the youth, with self-determin’d aim,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Disdaining fraud, and pride’s unfeeling claim,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Above control, pursued his generous way,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And talk’d to Peggy of the marriage day.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Poor girl! she heard, with anguish and with doubt,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">What her too-knowing neighbours preach’d about,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That Herbert would some nobler match prefer,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And surely never, never marry her;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Yet, with what trembling and delight she bore</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The kiss, and heard the vow, ‘I’ll doubt no more;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Protect me, Herbert, for your honour’s sake</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">You will,’ she cried, ‘nor leave my heart to break.’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Then wrote to uncle Gilbert, joys, and fears,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And hope, and trust, and sprinkled all with tears.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent5">Rous’d was the dormant spirit of the brave,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">E’en lameness rose to succour and to save;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For, though they both rever’d young Herbert’s name,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And knew his unexceptionable fame;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And though the girl had honestly declar’d</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Love’s first approaches, and their counsel shar’d,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Yet, that he truly meant to take for life</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The poor and lowly Peggy for a wife;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Or, that she was not doom’d to be deceiv’d,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Was out of bounds:—it <hi rend="ital">could not </hi>be believ’d.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Go, Gilbert, save her; I, you know, am lame;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Go, brother, go, and save my child from shame.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Haste, and I’ll pray for your success the while,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Go, go;’—then bang’d his crutch upon the stile:—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">It snapt.—E’en Gilbert trembled while he smote,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Then whipt the broken end beneath his coat;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Ay, ay, I’ll settle them; I’ll let them see</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Who’s to be conqu’ror this time, I or he!’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent5">Then off he set, and with enormous strides,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Rebellious mutterings and oaths besides,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">O’er clover-field and fallow, bank and briar,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Pursu’d the nearest cut, and fann’d the fire</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That burnt within him.—Soon the Hall he spied,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And the grey willows by the water side;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Nature cried ‘halt!’ nor could he well refuse;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Stop, Gilbert, breathe awhile, and ask <hi rend="ital">the news</hi>.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘News?’ cried a stooping grandame of the vale,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Ay, rare news too; I’ll tell you such a tale;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But let me rest; this bank is dry and warm;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Do you know Peggy Meldrum at the farm?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Young Herbert’s girl? He’as cloth’d her all in white,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">You never saw so beautiful a sight!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Ah! he’s a fine young man, and such a face!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I knew his grandfather and all his race;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He rode a tall white horse, and look’d so big,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But how shall I describe his hat and wig?’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Plague take his wig,’ cried Gilbert, ‘and his hat,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Where’s Peggy Meldrum? can you tell me <hi rend="ital">that</hi>?’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Ay; but have patience, man! you’ll hear anon,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For I shall come to her as I go on,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">So hark’ye friend; his grandfather I say,’—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Poh, poh,’—cried Gilbert, as he turn’d away.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Her eyes were fix’d, her story at a stand,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The snuff-box lay half open’d in her hand;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘You great, ill-manner’d clown! but I must bear it;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">You oaf; to ask the news, and then won’t hear it!’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But Gilbert had gain’d forty paces clear,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">When the reproof came murmuring on his ear.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent5">Again he ask’d the first that pass’d him by;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A cow-boy stopt his whistle to reply.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Why, I’ve a mistress coming home, that’s all,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">They’re playing Meg’s diversion at the Hall;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For master’s gone, with Peggy, and his cousin,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And all the lady-folks, about a dozen,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To church, down there; he’ll marry <hi rend="ital">one </hi>no doubt,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For that it seems is what they’re gone about;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">I know it by their laughing and their jokes,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Tho’ they <hi rend="ital">wor’nt </hi>ask’d at church like other folks.’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent5">Gilbert kept on, and at the Hall-door found</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The winking servants, where the jest went round:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">All expectation; aye, and so was he,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But not with heart so merry and so free.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The kitchen table, never clear from beef,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Where hunger found its solace and relief,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Free to all strangers, had no charms for him,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For agitation worried every limb;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Ale he partook, but appetite had none,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And grey-hounds watch’d in vain to catch the bone.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">All sounds alarm’d him, and all thoughts perplex’d,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With dogs, and beef, himself, and all things vex’d,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Till with one mingled caw above his head,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Their gliding shadows o’er the court-yard spread,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The rooks by thousands rose: the bells struck up;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He guess’d the cause, and down he set the cup,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And listening, heard, amidst the general hum,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">A joyful exclamation, ‘Here they come!’—</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Soon Herbert’s cheerful voice was heard above,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Amidst the rustling hand-maids of his love,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And Gilbert follow’d without thought or dread,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The broad oak stair-case thunder’d with his tread;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Light tript the party, gay as gay could be,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Amidst their bridal dresses—there came he!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And with a look that guilt could ne’er withstand,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Approach’d his niece and caught her by the hand,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Now are you married, Peggy, yes or no?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Tell me at once, before I let you go!’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Abrupt he spoke, and gave her arm a swing,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But the same moment felt the wedding ring,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And stood confus’d.—She wip’d th’empassion’d tear,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘I am, I am; but is my father here?’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Herbert stood by, and sharing with his bride,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">That perturbation which she strove to hide;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘Come, honest Gilbert, you’re too rough this time,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Indeed here’s not the shadow of a crime;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But where’s your brother? When did you arrive?</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">We waited long, for Nathan went at five!’</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">All this was Greek to Gilbert, downright Greek;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He knew not what to think, nor how to speak.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The case was this; that Nathan with a cart</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To fetch them both at day-break was to start.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And so he did—but ere he could proceed,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He suck’d a charming portion with a reed,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Used a hollow reed as a drinking straw
              to siphon off enough wedding-ale (‘a charming portion’) to get drunk.]</note></l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Of that same wedding-ale, which was that day</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">To make the hearts of all the village gay;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Brim full of glee he trundled from the Hall,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And as for sky-larks, he out-sung them all;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Till growing giddy with his morning cup,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">He, stretch’d beneath a hedge, the reins gave up;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The horse graz’d soberly without mishap,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And Nathan had a most delightful nap</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">For three good hours—Then, doubting, when he woke,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Whether his conduct would be deem’d a joke,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With double haste perform’d just half his part,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And brought the lame John Meldrum in his cart.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And at the moment Gilbert’s wrath was high,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And while young Herbert waited his reply,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The sound of rattling wheels was at the door;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">‘There’s my dear father now,’—they heard no more,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The bridegroom glided like an arrow down,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And Gilbert ran, though something of a clown,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">With his best step; and cheer’d with smiles and pray’rs,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">They bore old John in triumph up the stairs:</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Poor Peggy, who her joy no more could check,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Clung like a dewy woodbine round his neck.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And all stood silent—Gilbert, off his guard,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And marvelling at virtue’s rich reward,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Loos’d the one loop that held his coat before,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Down thumpt the broken crutch upon the floor!</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">They started, half alarm’d, scarce knowing why,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">But through the glist’ning rapture of his eye</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">The bridegroom smil’d, then chid their simple fears,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And rous’d the blushing Peggy from her tears;</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">Around the uncle in a ring they came,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">And mark’d his look of mingled pride and shame.</l>
          <l rendition="#indent5">‘Now honestly, good Gilbert, tell us true,</l>
          <l rendition="#indent4">What meant this cudgel? What was it to do?</l>
