               <!--anchor--></a><p class="noCount">Introduction</p>
            <p class="noCount"><em>Wild Flowers; or, Pastoral and Local Poetry </em>(1806) was Bloomfield’s third collection. Slighter than its predecessor, <em>Rural Tales</em>, it continued in the same vein, comprising tales and ballads telling stories of villagers
               and village customs, loco-descriptive poems on local places and sentimental songs.
               To this familiar mixture Bloomfield added an ode, of sorts—‘To My Old Oak Table’,
               in which, in a lengthy prosopopeia, he addressed his writing desk and pondered the
               passing of time. <em>Wild Flowers</em> also collected the poem on vaccination, <em>Good Tidings; or, News from the Farm </em>that had been published alone in 1804.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The poems dated from the four-year period since <em>Rural Tales</em>, and they reflect Bloomfield’s professionalization. Having given up his shoemaking
               trade, and having been plied with books by literary gentlefolk who came to visit him,
               he had read more widely in poetry and poetics, and begun to formulate opinions concerning
               style and diction. Wordsworth was a positive influence, and Amelia Opie a negative
               one, as he explained in a letter to his brother of 2 September 1802 (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.94.html">Letter 94</a>):
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">there is much truth in Wordsworth’s preface where he says that he had tried to come
               near the language of Men, and the language of Men is not backwards! I have a full
               persuasion that this is the greatest blemish of many poems, and has often a tendency
               to weaken the force of the line and diminish the ardour of the reader. Milton, no
               doubt, has done it to advantage; and when there comes another Milton he shall have
               my permission to do it too. Perhaps as inversions abound generally in sonnets, it
               may be the principal cause of my disrelish for them.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote">The conclusion of poetical pieces, and the conclusion of sections and divisions therein
               certainly ought to improve, line by line, so as to finish with a twang, as the Boy
               said of his whip. A weak line at a close, is like a dying note of a weak voice when
               it should be full and sonorous; and full of soul; I could easily find instances but
               will leave the application to be made as you read whatever may next come into your
               hand.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote">I have perhaps an unfounded aversion to tying three lines together in a measure where
               the ear expects but two. In Dryden’s Virgil I find it very frequent, and cannot see
               the advantage of it, you will of course not wonder that there are none to be found
               in what I have ventured into the world; and as I have thus far succeeded without,
               will not begin now.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote">The choice of phrases in Ballads and Songs, and perhaps more in serious pieces, is
               of much importance; a common use of old worn out words I do not like, such as erst,
               whilom, and a thousand more; and yet to take up and use a word but just getting into
               circulation, newly adopted, or new coined, is like placing a new bright penny piece
               among a range of old ones, it will look like a broken rank, and besides run great
               hazard of rousing the risibility that arises from contempt rather than the smile due
               to true humour, suppose by way of illustrating this point, I had said originally in
               the Suffolk Ballad
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote">And laid aside her Lucks and twitches<br/> And to the Hutch she reach’d her hand<br/> And gave him out his Sunday <span class="ital">small-clothes</span>!
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote">Perhaps <span class="ital">Breeches</span> will one day be as old fashioned as doublet and jerkin, as in another case though
               the song says ‘With good old leathern bottle, and ale that looks so brown’ and yet
               I doubt that in another fifty years a leather bottle will not be found but in the
               song.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote">Compound Epithets I do not much like; because they are often such as we never use
               in conversation; there are three in my ‘Word to the young ladies’ which I deem such
               as are often used in conversation, ‘full blown,’ ‘out-run’ but ‘half-expanded’ is
               not so common. In a poem by Mrs. Opie I find the following which are not used in conversation,
               Grief-impeded, fragrance-breathing, &amp;c and I think many may be found in most poems,
               but I am only telling you my notions of excellence, let every one chuse his own path.
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noCount">The poems in <em>Wild Flowers </em>practise what the letter preaches, completing a movement away from the Thomsonian
               diction of <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> that had begun in <em>Rural Tales.</em> ‘Barnham Water’, is an instance. Written shortly after this avowal of Wordsworthian
               rustic plainness, it bears traces of a reading of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, being a first-person account of a journey on foot through a familiar landscape,
               told in colloquial diction and featuring rhetorical questions and reflections on the
               place’s effect on the speaker’s reflective mind:
            </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="noCount">What was it rous’d my soul to love?</div>
               <div class="noCount">What made the simple brook so dear?</div>
               <div class="noCount">It glided like the weary dove,</div>
               <div class="noCount">And never brook seem’d half so clear.</div>
               <div class="noCount">Cool pass’d the current o’er my feet,</div>
               <div class="noCount">Its shelving brink for rest was made,</div>
               <div class="noCount">But every charm was incomplete,</div>
               <div class="noCount">For Barnham Water wants a shade.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="noCount">There, faint beneath the fervid sun,</div>
               <div class="noCount">I gaz’d in ruminating mood;</div>
               <div class="noCount">For who can see the current run</div>
               <div class="noCount">And snatch no feast of mental food?</div>
               <div class="noCount">‘Keep pure thy soul,’ it seem’d to say,</div>
               <div class="noCount">‘Keep that fair path by wisdom trod,</div>
               <div class="noCount">That thou may’st hope to wind thy way,</div>
               <div class="noCount">To fame worth boasting, and to God.’</div>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">Certainly the poem had begun as Bloomfield knew ‘Lines Composed a Few Miles Above
               Tintern Abbey’ had begun: he recorded in a letter that it was the unexpected beauty
               of the landscape, experienced when <span class="ital">revisiting</span> the area on a misty autumn day, that moved him to write a description of an earlier
               visit in the heat of summer.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">The morning I left Bury turn’d out very foggy, and I was glad that I had determined
               to ride inside. At about half past six there appear’d a compleat semicircle or rainbow
               nearly in the West, which was evidently produced by the sun on the fog, the colour
               was pale, and not varied or mix’d. I observed particularly that as we ascended the
               high ground on the south of Sudbury we gradually surmounted the fog and found a fine
               clear morning; and that it has not dissipated, but lay on a level with the hill, filling
               up the whole valley; and watching its motions I perceived at many miles distance that
               as the day advanced, the fog had made a sensible and collected elevation and become
               a cloud, moving I believe nearly south-west—… Barnham Water has set my brains a-gadding,
               and I fear I shall not get rid of the subject untill I have given it a suit of cloaths.
               (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.96.html">Letter 96</a>; 1 October 1802)
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noCount">The resultant poem seems almost self-consciously to consider embracing the role of
               the Wordsworthian nature-poet, only to stop at a self-erected barrier when Bloomfield
               concludes that his Muse is not fitted for lofty explorations of the imagination: the
               nature that moves him to verse is simply too flat and bare for Romanticism:
            </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="noCount">Whatever hurts my country’s fame,</div>
               <div class="noCount">When wits and mountaineers deride,</div>
               <div class="noCount">To me grows serious, for I name</div>
               <div class="noCount">My native plains and streams with pride.</div>
               <div class="noCount">No mountain charms have I to sing,</div>
               <div class="noCount">No loftier minstrel’s rights invade;</div>
               <div class="noCount">From trifles oft <span class="ital">my </span>raptures spring;
               </div>
               <div class="noCount">—Sweet Barnham Water wants a shade.</div>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">As when he withheld ‘To Immagination’ from publication, Bloomfield is evidently determined
               to set limits to his verse, to avoid using landscape description as a pretext to worship
               his own mind. Wordsworth was accused of puerility and egotism for doing so; a poet
               from the laboring classes was likely to attract even more damaging criticism of his
               pretensions.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">‘Shooter’s Hill’ was written in spring 1803 when Bloomfield went on a walking excursion
               to escape from the stress that a new job in the busy Seal Office was causing him.
               This poem was also Wordsworthian in theme: the hill walk in the country is an escape
               from physically and mentally destructive city life:
            </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="noCount">To hide me from the public eye,</div>
               <div class="noCount">To keep the throne of Reason clear,</div>
               <div class="noCount">Amidst fresh air to breathe or die,</div>
               <div class="noCount">I took my staff and wander’d here:</div>
               <div class="noCount">Suppressing every sigh that heaves,</div>
               <div class="noCount">And coveting no wealth but thee,</div>
               <div class="noCount">I nestle in the honied leaves,</div>
               <div class="noCount">And hug my stolen liberty.</div>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">The hilltop view gives a sense of freedom and power, as in Dyer’s ‘Grongar Hill’ (1726)
               and the more recent ‘Lewesdon Hill’ (1788) by William Crowe:
            </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="noCount">O’er eastward uplands, gay or rude,</div>
               <div class="noCount">Along to Erith’s ivied spire,</div>
               <div class="noCount">I start, with strength and hope renew’d,</div>
               <div class="noCount">And cherish life’s rekindling fire.</div>
               <div class="noCount">Now measure vales with straining eyes,</div>
               <div class="noCount">Now trace the church-yard’s humble names;</div>
               <div class="noCount">Or, climb brown heaths, abrupt that rise,</div>
               <div class="noCount">And overlook the winding Thames.</div>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">But the simplicity and naivety of the confessional verse that follows, and the intimation
               of divinity in ‘the meanest flower that blows’, is from <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>:
            </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="noCount">I love to mark the flow’ret’s eye,</div>
               <div class="noCount">To rest where pebbles form my bed,</div>
               <div class="noCount">Where shapes and colours scatter’d lie,</div>
               <div class="noCount">In varying millions round my head.</div>
               <div class="noCount">The soul rejoices when alone,</div>
               <div class="noCount">And feels her glorious empire free;</div>
               <div class="noCount">Sees God in every shining stone,</div>
               <div class="noCount">And revels in variety.</div>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">But again, Bloomfield recoils from identifying this insight with his own imaginative
               self, asserting instead that it is not for him to become the Bard of his native land:
            </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="noCount">Of Cambrian mountains still I dream,</div>
               <div class="noCount">And mouldering vestiges of war;</div>
               <div class="noCount">By time-worn cliff or classic stream</div>
               <div class="noCount">Would rove,—but Prudence holds a bar.</div>
               <div class="noCount">Come then, O Health! I’ll strive to bound</div>
               <div class="noCount">My wishes to this airy stand;</div>
               <div class="noCount">’Tis not for <span class="ital">me</span> to trace around
               </div>
               <div class="noCount">The wonders of my native land.</div>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">He ends by rejecting the vanity involved in wishing that his work will make him revered
               by future generations, but is this merely to accede to, rather than protest against,
               or attempt to transcend, a comparative confinement of view that is forced upon him
               by a social status that puts the freedom to travel, and the confidence to speak, out
               of reach? Does Bloomfield too easily reconcile himself, in the name of virtue, to
               deference? Blake, another London artisan, might have thought so. If he did, it is
               nevertheless true that ‘Shooter’s Hill’ and ‘Barnham Water’, in their astute deployment
               of the language of empowerment that Wordsworth derived from topographical verse, put
               on display both his desire to achieve and difficulty in achieving a voice of personal
               and national authority. Self-assertive and self-denying by turns, they reveal his
               attraction to and refusal of ‘the internalization of the quest romance’ and in so
               doing they are symptomatic of the struggle of labouring-class poets to escape the
               subjects—rural life and labour—on which they were expected (and were themselves accustomed)
               to write.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">‘To My Old Oak Table’, begun in September and finished in December 1803, was more
               successful in maintaining a voice of personal authority than the topographical poems.
               The device of prosopopeia—speaking to an inanimate object—is justified by the symbolism
               of the table as being both a writing desk and a table for dining and household work.
               It places Bloomfield’s poetry, including this very poem, at the heart of family life,
               giving it the function of witnessing the joys and anxieties experienced over a span
               of years. Bloomfield gains confidence from this location, speaking frankly of poverty
               and illness, and their effect upon his mind and body, than ever before:
            </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="noCount">Thick fell the gathering terrors of Distress;</div>
               <div class="noCount">Anxiety, and Griefs without a name,</div>
               <div class="noCount">Had made their dreadful inroads on my frame;</div>

            </div>
            <p class="noCount">Writing of himself writing in and through this domestic setting, he presents himself
               as a Romantic poet more confidently than he had at Shooter’s Hill and Barnham Water:
            </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="noCount">I pour’d the torrent of my feelings forth;</div>
               <div class="noCount">Conscious of <span class="ital">truth </span>in Nature’s humble track,

               <div class="noCount">And wrote ‘The Farmer’s Boy’ upon thy back!</div>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">Here Bloomfield does not undercut his portrait of himself as inspired: he derives
               his verse from a spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings that is enabled by the
               act of writing upon a table that has been a stable presence in his domestic life for
               years. It allows him to take pride in the power of his poetry to bring things to life,
               and to preserve them from harm: 
            </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="noCount">Enough, old friend:—thou’rt mine; and shalt partake,</div>

               <div class="noCount">Whatever fortune deals me</div>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">This assertion of friendship is implicitly a self-vindication as a father and as a
               man. It is notable that the egotism of this, and the self-absorbed history of feeling
               growing from ordinary life that prepares for it, are achieved in the pentameter couplets
               he had used in <em>The Farmer’s Boy. </em>Bloomfield remained a master of the couplet form, here adapting it to sustain his
               strongest meditation on himself—thereby Romanticising an eighteenth-century form.
            </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Contrasting with the three first-person poems are three rural tales: ‘The Broken Crutch’,
                  ‘The Horkey, and ‘Abner and the Widow Jones, a Familiar Ballad’. The last of these
                  dates from August 1804, when Bloomfield notes that he was writing ‘a Ballad to be
                  calld “the Ploughman,” in that stile in which I am best calculated to succeed’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.135.html">Letter 135</a>). ‘That stile’ was comic and sentimental, in plain diction. The story concerns a
                  middle-aged courtship and ends with a wedding. The ploughman gets the girl second
                  time round, and the happy occasion is blessed when the farmer gives him his favourite
                  old plough-horse, thus saving it from being killed for dog-meat. It’s a wish-fulfilment
                  fantasy in which anxiety, poverty and social hierarchy are overcome: the rich help
                  the poor and all ends happily. Bloomfield would write many tales of this kind, depicting
                  villages as communities in which human need trumps financial self-interest and social
                  division—moral economies. In ‘The Broken Crutch’ he even plays with the possibility
                  of violence on the part of the labourers if their social superiors flagrantly infringe
                  the traditional moral standards assumed to bind everyone in the community. But the
                  spectre is raised only to be banished, as it turns out that the squire does not intend
                  to seduce and abandon, but rather to marry, the lame labourer’s daughter. If these
                  stories are sentimental, they are not merely fantastical. Bloomfield’s tales accord
                  with Cobbett’s <em>Rural Rides </em>and Clare’s ‘Lament of Swordy Well’: each writer’s idealisation of the past as a better,
                  kindlier place was rooted in experience of older ways of living being rapidly destroyed
                  by the capitalisation of agriculture and resultant polarisation of social relations.

            </div>
            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield suggests as much in ‘The Horkey’, his ballad about the festival held at
               harvest home, held at the squire’s and farmers’ expense, in which the labourers were
               encouraged, for one day a year, to eat, drink and party to excess. ‘These customs’,
               he wrote, ‘are going fast out of use; which is one great reason for my trying to tell
               the rising race of mankind that such were the customs when I was a boy’. Hone’s <em>Everyday Book </em>attempted a similar commemorative task, and proved very popular; Clare, inspired by
               Bloomfield, went on to celebrate the autumn festival of ‘St Martin’s Eve’. Clare’s
               poem was in one respect less authentic than Bloomfield’s: it did not, like ‘The Horkey’,
               use dialect words—a sign of Bloomfield’s taking further than before the Wordsworthian
               commitment to rural speech as a proper language for poetry. Terms such as ‘hake’,
               ‘sitch a mort’ and ‘cop’t’ required glossing in the notes: slang such as ‘by gom’
               also featured, as did phonetically spelt corruptions like ‘arter’. This was highly
               unusual in polite verse printed in books, and relatively rare even in broadside ballads
               sold on the street: it aligned Bloomfield’s poetry with gossip, tale-telling and song-singing
               and with the tipsy tattler in the alehouse—a Burnsian turn that resonated differently
               in England, where a folk poet was not, as in Scotland, viewed as a revivalist of the
               national language against colonisation by southern English. <em>The Critical Review </em>was not alone in implying that such language was too vulgar for poetry—a complaint
               that Francis Jeffrey had made about <em>Lyrical Ballads </em>in 1802, although that collection included no labouring-class slang or Somerset dialect.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The volume was completed by ‘Mary’s Evening Sigh’, a slight lyric first published
               in the <em>Monthly Mirror </em>in September 1802, by a comic poem on visiting Ranelagh Gardens, by a hunting song,
               and by the revised ‘Good Tidings’ which, in this context, took on new resonance because,
               like ‘To My Old Oak Table’, and the Dedication, it dwelt on illness and disability
               in Bloomfield’s own family. Bloomfield’s son <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">Charles</a> was lame, and in dedicating the volume to him he is both heartfelt and intimate to
               an unusual degree for a public format: ‘What a lasting, what an unspeakable satisfaction
               would it be to know that the Ballads, the Plowman Stories, and the “Broken Crutch”
               of your father would eventually contribute to lighten your steps to manhood, and make
               your own crutch, through life, rather a memorial of affection, than an object of sorrow’.
               The comic hero of ‘The Broken Crutch’ is helped by his brother to protect his daughter.
               The poems, that is, were Bloomfield’s paternalism in words, a fatherly legacy representing
               all he could do to lighten the burden of disability. The reader, at his point, feels
               as if intruding on a private, family affair: Bloomfield here presents himself and
               his family vulnerable, naked, an utter contrast to the framing of his poems and his
               life by patrons’ words in <em>The Farmer’s Boy </em>and<em>Rural Tales</em>.

            <p class="noCount"><em>Wild Flowers </em>was published in March 1806 by <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#VernorThomas">Vernor</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#HoodThomas">Hood</a> and their new partner <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SharpeC">Sharpe</a>, in alliance with <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LongmanThomasN">Longman</a>, Hurst, Rees, and Orme. Bloomfield presented a copy to the Whig leader <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Charles James Fox</a>, as Wordsworth had <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, Fox having admired <em>Rural Tales </em>(<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.177.html">Letter 177</a>). On 11 March another Whig, the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BuchanLord">Earl of Buchan</a>, a patron of poets and painters, expressed his admiration, not directly to Bloomfield
               but to the booksellers Longmans. His suggestion was that he would help the sale of
               a second edition by prefacing it with a letter that Bloomfield had written to him
               in 1802 and with his own anecdotes about the poet (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.178.html">Letter 178</a>). The letter (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.75.html">Letter 75</a>) was confessional—Bloomfield apologized in it for having been moved to tears by his
               own recitation of his verse. Longmans referred Buchan’s suggestion to Bloomfield who
               in turn sent it to <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Lofft</a>, seeking advice. Lofft replied that it was a handsome, if slightly vain, tribute
               and that to refuse to use it as the preface to the second edition would leave Bloomfield
               open to imputations of arrogance and ingratitude.

               speak directly to the reader without gentlemanly packaging. He would no longer be
               patronised, however well meaning the patron:

            <blockquote class="quote">It will be observed that the Dedication to my Boy (who is eight years old this day)
               contains more meaning than is there exprest. I have with great truth spoken there
               of a ‘peculiar delicacy’, and I since feel it more than I did at that time. To adopt

               feelings of my good and voluntary friends, nor to violate my own. The Letter I long
               ago addrest to your Lordship is such perhaps as I ought not to be ashamed of, and
               such that no person would believe me did I pretend to it. But though I feel the intended

               to abide by the most simple methods of acquiring reputation, the standing alone, as
               far as my abilities go, and as far as it can be done in justice to my friends. Thus

            </p>
            <p class="noCount">Sales were a reason for Bloomfield’s feeling able to resist incorporating the recommendations
               of the great and good. He was able to tell <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BuchanLord">Buchan</a> ‘A second edition of five thousand copies of “Wild Flowers”, is just now publishing’,
               meaning a first edition of that number was already close to selling out. Reviews were
               another reason: the consensus of the journals was that the collection proved Bloomfield’s
               consistency: he was no one-hit-wonder but a poet in command of his craft. Most praised
               ‘Good Tidings’; <em>The Monthly Magazine</em> especially admired the tales: ‘the genius and simplicity which marked the features
               of his first productions are equally observable in the poetry of the present volume.
               The Tale of the Broken Crutch, and the poem To my old Oak Table, are among the best
               of the local poetry mentioned in the title’ (24 Part 2 (1807), 629). The <em>Monthly Mirror</em> singled out the new emphasis on the poet himself, and his talent for comedy: ‘the
               humour with which it is intermixed, shews the poet under new circumstances, and the
               diffidence of his own abilities, perceivable in his former productions, is not so
               visible in the volume before us, which evinces an extraordinary portion of mental
               vigour and invention; and we can confidently predict, that so long as Mr. Bloomfield
               adheres to the present species of poetry, he need be under no apprehensions for the
               success of a “third,” or fourth “attempt”’ (21 (1806), 242–46). The <em>Critical Review</em> was more—critical—finding the prosopopeia of ‘To My Old Oak Table’ too extended to
               be credible and, echoing common criticisms of Wordsworth, judging the tales too commonplace
               and prosaic to be poetry:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">There is a nerveless imbecility of conception which pervades the whole volume, a mediocrity
               of spirit which occasionally reaches a pretty thought, but never ventures to one that
               is bold or energetic. Without enthusiasm what is poetry? It is prose, not run mad,
               but unworthily held in the fetters of rhyme. The frenzy of inspiration, whether truly
               or falsely poetical, may for the peace and good order of the king’s English, be entrusted
               to the manacles of verse; but wherefore should trite thoughts and poor innocent expressions,
               guiltless of all fire and fury, be abridged of their natural liberty, and ‘<span class="ital">deprosed</span>’ into rhyme? To versify such thoughts is like consigning a palsied patient to a keeper
               and a strait waistcoat.

               The booksellers shared half the copyright; Bloomfield kept the other half. In 1816
               a further edition was released in which <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LongmanThomasN">Longman</a>, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown were joined by Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, by Darton,

               by Bloomfield’s daughter Hannah, appeared in 1826. It was published, collected with
               <em>The Farmer’s Boy </em>and <em>Rural Tales</em>, many times in the 1830s and 1840s after copyright lapsed. All of the poems in <em>Wild Flowers</em>, with the exception of <em>Good Tidings</em>, which was included in a separate volume with <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em>, were reprinted in the second volume of the Stereotype edition (1809).

                  both him and his children; but you must also reflect, that to particularize such friends
                  was a point of peculiar delicacy. The earliest patron of my unprotected strains has
                  the warm thanks which are his due, for the introduction of blessings which have been

                  which might otherwise have fallen to your share. </span></p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">What a lasting, what an unspeakable satisfaction would it be to know that the Ballads,
                  the Plowman Stories, and the ‘Broken Crutch’ of your father would eventually contribute
                  to lighten your steps to manhood, and make your own crutch, through life, rather a
                  memorial of affection, than an object of sorrow. </span></p>

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">R.B.</span></p><br/><br/><p class="noCount">PREFACE</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">A man</span> of the first eminence, in whose day (fortunately perhaps for me) I was not destined
               to appear before the public, or to abide the Herculean crab-tree of his criticism,
               Dr. Johnson, has said, in his preface to Shakspeare, that— ‘Nothing can please many,
               and please long, but just representations of general nature.’ My representations of
               nature, whatever may be said of their <span class="ital">justness</span>, are not <span class="ital">general</span>, unless we admit, what I suspect to be the case, that nature in a village is very
               much like nature every where else. It will be observed that all my pictures are from
               humble life, and most of my heroines servant maids. Such I would have them: being
               fully persuaded that, in no other way would my endeavours, either to please or to
               instruct, have an equal chance of success.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The path I have thus taken, from necessity, as well as from choice, is well understood
               and approved by hundreds, who are capable of ranging in the higher walks of literature.—But
               with due deference to their superior claim, I confess, that no recompense has been
               half so grateful or half so agreeable to me as female approbation. To be readily and
               generally understood, to have my simple Tales almost instinctively relished by those
               who have so decided an influence over the lives, hearts, and manners of us all, is
               the utmost stretch of my ambition.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">I here venture, before the public eye, a selection from the various pieces which have
               been the source of much pleasure, and the solace of my leisure hours during the last
               four years, and since the publication of the ‘Rural Tales.’ Perhaps, in some of them,
               more of mirth is intermingled than many who know me would expect, or than the severe
               will be inclined to approve. But surely what I can say, or can be expected to say,
               on subjects of country life, would gain little by the seriousness of a preacher, or
               by exhibiting fallacious representations of what has long been termed <span class="ital">Rural Innocence</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The Poem of ‘Good Tidings’ is partially known to the world, but, as it was originally
               intended to assume its present appearance and size, I have gladly availed myself of
               an endeavour to improve it; and, from its present extended circulation, I trust it
               will be new to thousands.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">I anticipate some approbation from such readers as have been pleased with the ‘Rural
               Tales;’ yet, though I will not falsify my own feelings by assuming a diffidence which
               I do not conceive to be either manly or becoming, the conviction that some reputation
               is hazarded in ‘a third attempt,’ is impressed deeply on my mind.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">With such sentiments, and with a lively sense of the high honour, and a hope of the
               bright recompence, of applause from the good, when heightened by the self-approving
               voice of my own conscience, I commit the book to its fate.
            </p>
