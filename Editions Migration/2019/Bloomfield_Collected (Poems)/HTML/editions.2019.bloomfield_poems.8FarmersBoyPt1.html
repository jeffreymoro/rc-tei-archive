            <p class="noCount">Editorial Introduction</p>
            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield’s most famous poem, one of the greatest as well as latest Georgics to be
               written in English, was also his most popular. In his lifetime, it went through fourteen
               official editions (pirated editions were published in France and America), was translated
               into Latin, and sold an estimated 51000 copies – putting it on a par with <em>Childe Harold</em> and <em>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</em> as one of the bestselling poems of the Romantic era. This popularity lasted: new
               editions regularly appeared until 1877; only in the twentieth century did interest
               decline. Admired by poets, including Southey and Wordsworth, as well as by the public,
               the poem was a critical success. It was also a seminal piece for labouring-class writers,
               including <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ClareJohn">John Clare</a>; its representation of Suffolk, meanwhile, influenced <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ConstableJohn">John Constable</a>’s art.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">Composition</p>
            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield himself is the main source concerning the history of the poem’s composition.
               In the Preface he wrote for the edition that appeared in the 1809 <em>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</em>, he quoted a letter he had written from London to his <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">brother George</a> in Suffolk on <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.10.html">16 September 1798</a> sending the manuscript he had completed in June, and declaring
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">When I began it, I thought to myself that I could compleat it in a twelvemonth, allowing
               myself three months for each quarter; but I soon found that I could not, and indeed
               I made it longer than I at first intended. Nine tenths of it was put together as I
               sat at work, where there are usually six of us; no one in the house have any knowledge
               of what I have employed my thoughts about when I did not talk.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote">I chose to do it in rhime for this reason; because I found allways that when I put
               two or three lines together in blank verse, or something that sounded like it, it
               was a great chance if it stood right when it came to be wrote down, for blank verse
               have ten syllables in a line, and this particular I could not adjust, nor bear in
               memory as I could rhimes. Winter, and half of Autumn were done long before I could
               find leisure to write them. In the Harvest Home you will find the essence of letters
               you have wrote formerly to London.
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noCount">These remarks date the poem’s origins to between May and December 1796; they also
               reveal the extraordinary circumstances of its composition: Bloomfield produced it
               not on the farm in Suffolk but in a crowded shoemakers’ garret in London -– the mental
               process hindered, or perhaps helped, by the repetitive noises of hammering and stitching,
               and by the patterns of his workmates’ conversation. This origin in urban labour and
               in labourers’ sociability, so different from the leisure and solitude in which the
               typically gentlemanly activity of poetic composition usually occurred, had its effect
               on the poem’s form and content: Bloomfield chose rhyming couplets because they helped
               him not only to attain prosodic regularity but also to memorise the verse; he depicted
               the harvest home not from first hand experience as a reaper but because his brother
               George, who had left London for Suffolk in 1784, had described it to him in letters.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">Despite its paperless origin, the poem was not affiliated to oral poetry. It was not
               based on the work songs or folk ballads that were performed on city street and in
               village pub, but on the highly literary form of the Georgic as represented by James
               Thomson’s <em>The Seasons </em>(issued in parts between 1725–30 and first collected in 1748) which had been among
               Bloomfield’s favourite reading since he had acquired a copy from a fellow London shoemaker
               in 1783 or 1784. His poem had, he explained, begun in set-piece episodes:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">The parts of the poem first composed, before any thought was entertained of going
               through with the Seasons, were the morning scene in Spring, beginning ‘This task had <span class="ital">Giles</span>,’ and the description of the lambs at play.
            </blockquote>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>From these initial scenes, the poem grew to four books, one for each season, totaling,
                  by November 1797, just over 1500 lines. Initially committed to memory, these were
                  transcribed in the manuscript that Bloomfield patiently compiled and sent to George,
                  warning him, in a <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.11.html">letter of 7 November 1798</a>, that ‘Having never been instructed in grammar, it may abound in faults of that kind
                  which I am not aware of. The management of stops I don’t pretend to’ (a disclaimer
                  also made by <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> about the manuscript of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>). The MS survives and is held at the Houghton Library, Harvard University, MS Eng
                  FMS 776.

            <p class="noCount">Publication</p>
            <p class="noCount">By November 1798, Bloomfield had already hawked the manuscript around London publishers
               without success. One, probably <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BentWilliam">William Bent</a>, declined and suggested magazine publication in instalments; another, most likely
               <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LaneWilliam">William Lane</a>, refused because he specialized in pulp novels (see letters <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.6.html">6</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.7.html">7</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.8.html">8</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.9.html">9</a> of the <em>Letters of Robert Bloomfield</em>)
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">Frustrated, Bloomfield sent the manuscript to George so that his mother should be
               able to read it. George, however, took it to a local gentleman who was unknown to
               Bloomfield – <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</a> (1751–1824). Lofft was a radical Whig, and as such believed himself to be a ‘friend
               of the people’, an opinion that recommended the poem to him. He was an astute choice
               on George’s part, for he was not simply a traditional patron, prepared to offer a
               local man of talent a small donation or pension as part of his duty, but also an author
               and editor with influence in the expanding publishing market in which magazines and
               journals—the new means of publicizing books—had begun to flourish. He had commercial
               experience as well as the paternalist attitudes of a traditional Whig squire. He wrote
               to Bloomfield, declaring that ‘the example, as well as the Poem, may teach the rich,
               and the highly born or educated, not unnaturally to urge harsh and overbearing lines
               of distinction; but to be more attentive to the gifts bestowed by the common Father
               on mankind, than to an overweening conceit of their own privileges and advantages’
               (see Preface to the stereotype <em>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</em>, 1809). Impressed by the poem both in its own right and as evidence that the poor
               and poorly educated were not naturally inferior, he sent it to <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#HillThomas">Thomas Hill</a> (1760–1840), a man of letters who was well-connected on the London literary scene.
               Hill arranged to have it published by the firm of <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#VernorThomas">Vernor</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#HoodThomas">Hood</a>, publishers of the journal he edited, <em>The Monthly Mirror</em>. While little direct information survives as to the terms of the arrangement, a dispute
               that arose between Lofft and Hood in November 1800 suggests that the firm spent £190
               on the printing, giving Bloomfield £20 as an advance, and taking, it considered, a
               half interest in the copyright not just for the first but also for subsequent editions
               (meaning that royalties would be split 50/50 with Bloomfield). This, as Hood told
               Lofft when Lofft argued that the firm’s half interest did not outlast the first edition,
               was a handsome arrangement (see <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.45.html">Letter 45</a>, 26 November 1800, of <em>LRB</em>). It was more typical for unknown, first-time writers either to pay the costs of
               printing themselves, with the bookseller/publisher handling distribution, or to publish
               by subscription. That this was not the case with <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> must have been a result of Lofft’s strategy of showing the poem to Hill, an experienced
               editor of magazine verse with influence over a publishing house. Hill’s imprimatur
               assured Vernor and Hood that it would find a sale sufficient to repay their costs
               – not least because it could be puffed in the magazines they also published and in
               which Hill and Lofft reviewed. It was a bargain that Bloomfield, advised by <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SwanJames">James Swan</a> (d. 1818), a London printer, accepted at a meeting with Hood.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">What Hood published on 1 March 1800 was not quite the manuscript as submitted by George
               Bloomfield to Lofft in 1798. Lofft took it upon himself to revise what he read, as
               he noted in his Preface to the first edition:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">My part has been this, and it has been a very pleasing one: to revise the MS. Making
               occasionally corrections with respect to Orthography, and sometimes in the grammatical
               construction. The corrections, in point of Grammar, reduce themselves almost wholly
               to a circumstance of provincial usage, which even well educated persons in Suffolk
               and Norfolk do not wholly avoid; and which may be said, as to general custom, to have
               become in these Counties almost an established Dialect:…that of adopting the plural
               for the singular termination of verbs, so as to exclude the s. But not a line is added
               or substantially alter’d through the whole Poem. (Preface)
            </blockquote>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As Peter Cochran has pointed out,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Lofft’s final sentence here was not quite correct. In fact, he did alter phrases that
                  he found too colloquial or too earthy, in favour of a more conventional and polite
                  language. The effect of these changes was to make the poem more ‘tasteful’, more detached
                  from the labouring-class locutions, and more generic (because its language was deracinated
                  from the language community of rural Suffolk). Although these changes were not extensive,
                  Bloomfield himself having largely mastered the gentlemanly style of his model James
                  Thomson, they were significant. In <span class="ital">Summer</span>, for example, Bloomfield’s focus on the ‘writhing loins’ of the ‘sturdy Mower’ proved
                  all too close-up: Lofft changed ‘loins’ to ‘form’ (142–3). In <span class="ital">Autumn</span> Bloomfield’s description of the mad girl who left her cottage each night ‘in filth
                  to lie, / Where the swine grunting yields up half his sty’ became ‘unhous’d to lie,
                  / Or share the swine’s impure and narrow sty’ (136–8). Lofft’s farm was to have no
                  hint of sex or shit about it.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">Whether Bloomfield knew of these changes while the work was in production, is unclear,
               for he did not supervise the printing (by Thomas Bensley, who would print all of the
               first six editions), and relied on the press to discover details about the forthcoming
               volume. In a letter to George of 8 September–6 October 1799 (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.16.html">Letter 16</a>), he noted
            </p>

               and several other young men have carried the art to very great perfection; their performances
               rival in brilliancy and spirit the finest productions on copper. Every one acquainted
               with the trouble and delays of printing with plates of Copper is sensible of the advantages

                  would meet their taste. This was an early use of the marketing technique of name recognition.
                  Lofft’s prefatory framing patronised Bloomfield, but thereby made him suitable both
                  for aristocratic patrons who wished to reward natural genius from their regions and
                  for middle-class patrons of booksellers’ shops who could support him by buying the
                  poem. It left Bloomfield embarrassed, however, because it put his private life on
                  parade and used the rural simplicity that he had shown when he first came to London
                  as a boy to define his character as a man.

                  </div> They relayed the story of Bloomfield’s deserving life. In doing so, they were responding
                  to Lofft’s presentation of the poet, and also to Bloomfield’s own choice of a child
                  narrator, highly unusual for a locodescriptive and Georgic poem in the Thomsonian
                  tradition. Instead of Thomson’s disembodied, distant narrator, Bloomfield chose not
                  simply a farmworker, as in Stephen Duck’s and Mary Collier’s labouring-class revisions
                  of the Georgic tradition, but a boy. This choice gave him a narrator who could be
                  present without being wholly involved in the grown-up world he witnessed—as if an
                  unobserved observer. In the gap between the adult writer and his boy narrator, and
                  between the boy and the adults within the poem, distance, loneliness and pathos enter.
                  This is not the pathos of time having past—the Wordsworthian lost hour of splendour
                  in the grass that the <em>Prelude</em> was written to record and redeem (the temporal distance between the urban, adult author
                  and the rural, child narrator was fundamental to Bloomfield’s writing but is not explicitly
                  discussed). It is more a matter of a certain alienation in situ: unlike Duck, who
                  conveyed rural life directly to the reader as a man’s personal and collective experience
                  of labour, Bloomfield’s boy stands at a remove, looking on. He is not quite one of
                  the lads and certainly not a man, and when he speaks of work with the authority born
                  of experience he does so not to challenge the poetic idealisations that depict peasants
                  as fortunate sons of the soil who are contented in their labour, but to record his
                  misery and fear when tasked with spending hour after hour alone in the field scaring
                  crows. Rural labour, this implies, can be isolating and soul destroying even if not
                  backbreaking. Unlike the ploughmen and the threshers, or the milkmaids and the washerwomen,
                  the boy does not get to be one of a team that communally takes pride in its strength,
                  skill and usefulness. Thus part of the poem’s appeal lay in its narrator’s ability
                  to mobilise pity, whereas an adult narrator might have raised awkward issues of class
                  difference, seeming either obsequious or truculent—anxious to soothe or keen to shock
                  the feelings of a polite reader brought face to face with the uncouth farmyard and
                  the uncouth bodies—human and animal—that it places side by side in the muck.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">The public’s sympathies were engaged and it began to buy the poem in larger numbers
               than anyone expected, making Bloomfield the first publishing sensation of the nineteenth-century
               mass-market press. Vernor and Hood astutely catered to different income levels, selling
               <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> in large quartos on fine Whatman paper for the wealthy, in quartos (at half a guinea),
               and in smaller octavos for those with more modest means. The book’s success, then,
               owed much to commercial acumen on its editors’ and publishers’ parts. Second and third
               editions followed later in 1800, in cheaper demi octavo and octavo sizes. In the third,
               Lofft made a major addition to the paratextual material that would turn out to have
               severe consequences for his relationship with the poem and its author. He added an
               appendix in which he complained at length about his having been removed from his role
               as a justice of the peace on the grounds, he suspected, of his radical politics. The
               removal had little or nothing to do with Bloomfield’s poem; the appendix therefore
               did nothing more than reveal Lofft’s egotism and his proprietorial attitude towards
               the work he had brought to public attention. <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> was, the appendix suggested, a place for Lofft to parade his goodwill and air his
               grievances. It was his, the patron’s, work almost as much as that of Bloomfield, who
               was his client and was to be approached through him, his verse bracketed by Lofft’s
               prose.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The Appendix distressed Bloomfield and the publisher, Hood, because it put Lofft’s
               personal affairs between the poet and the reader, and introduced contentious political
               matters to a volume they had tried to keep free of radicalism so as not to alarm reviewers
               and purchasers. In the fifth edition (1801), they persuaded Lofft to add this note
               exculpating Bloomfield: 
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">I wish it to be understood, that neither for my political Sentiments, Opinions, and
               Conduct, nor for any thing which I have said that personally concerns myself in the
               introductory part of this <span class="ital">Appendix</span>, is Mr. <span class="smcaps">Bloomfield</span> in the smallest degree responsible. Those therefore who dislike either the sentiments
               or the mode of expression must, in mere justice, impute them to me alone, and in no
               respect as any way implicating him. He wishes, I believe, to decline <span class="ital">Politics</span> and <span class="ital">Controversy</span> altogether; and I wish no man to mix in either farther than he feels it to be a Duty.
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noCount">A tension was now evident: the power relations of patron and client did not harmonise
               with those of editor and author. Lofft’s underlying conception of what and who the
               publication was for (fellow Suffolk gentlefolk who bought the book so as to support
               worthy local causes) was at odds with Hood’s eye on the wider reading public, whom
               he supposed to want uncontroversial pastoral pleasure. The split became wider in October
               1801, as Vernor and Hood prepared a sixth edition. Hill and Hood pressured Bloomfield
               to gain Lofft’s consent to drop the appendix (Lofft having by this point been restored
               to the bench). They also desired the removal of a note approving of the debating societies
               that, anti-Jacobins believed, were hotbeds of labouring class radicalism. Lofft’s
               reply to the request, Bloomfield reported, made it clear that ‘The infalible result
               of any inovation <span class="ital">now</span> made in “the Farmer’s Boy”, would infix in the mind of Mr L the deepest and the most
               rooted dislike to me’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.69.html">Letter 69</a>; see also letters <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.63.html">63</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.64.html">64</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.65.html">65</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.67.html">67</a>). Lofft let him know that if the cuts were made he would ensure Bloomfield became
               known as an ingrate: Bloomfield, having so little social status, could not risk appearing
               thus to the gentlemen and aristocrats who had supported the work, and was left pleading
               with Hill and Hood to leave the appendix and the note in place. Caught between patron
               and publisher, Bloomfield found himself to be the property of others (Hood retained
               half the copyright)—his case a symptom of the changes produced by the rapid expansion
               of the book market and the concomitant diminution of the role of patron and rise of
               that of the bookseller. Although Bloomfield’s plea worked, and Lofft’s embarrassing
               grandstanding was left in place in the sixth and seventh editions, printed by James
               Swan (1802 and 1803), the difficulty was not resolved. By 1803 he and Lofft were estranged,
               Lofft having been offended by the removal of his footnotes commenting on the poems
               in Bloomfield’s second collection <em>Rural Tales</em> (1802). In the eighth edition, of 1805, Lofft’s insertions concerning debating societies,
               concerning his tenure on the bench, and concerning his marriage were removed; Lofft’s
               voice presenting the biographical account of Bloomfield’s early life was replaced
               by Bloomfield’s own; some of the flattering commentary on the poem by Lofft’s friends
               was deleted. Bloomfield did call another literary gentleman to his aid, including
               in the edition a list compiled by <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ParkThomas">Thomas Park</a> (1759–1834; an editor and antiquarian) of all the alterations that Lofft had, in
               1799, made to the manuscript of the poem. The aim, apparently, was not just to strip
               Lofft from the paratext, but also to chart what he had done to the text. As a result,
               Lofft’s words no longer prepared the reader to encounter the boyish rustic poet: that
               poet appeared as an intelligent, straightforward man speaking to men (he had by then
               read Wordsworth’s preface to that relatively poorly-selling collection of rural poems,
               <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>).
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The tussle was not over: in the ninth edition (1806) Lofft reasserted himself, adding
               notes indicating his displeasure at the omission of his words from the eighth and
               again delivering his political opinions. After an earlier remark regretting the restriction
               of newspapers and popular print was dropped, Lofft now added ‘I spoke in the former
               Editions of the effect of <span class="ital">Newspapers</span>, and other means of popular Information; and I now say, I have no doubt that the
               opportunity of reading them contributed much to form the mind of the Author of the
               <span class="ital">Farmer’s Boy</span>. Genius profits greatly by small daily aids and excitements. A wise and good Government
               will render those aids as free and as generally accessible as it can. From such sparks
               not only the spirit of the former <span class="ital">Poet</span>, but of the Artist in various branches, of the future sailor and soldier is awakened’.
               He also added a new note endorsing debating societies, after his former one was excised,
               and occasional snide comments such as ‘Mr. Bloomfield having omitted in the eighth
               Edition what I had said in the seventh, of the satisfaction I had in 1800 in being
               made personally acquainted with him here at <span class="ital">Troston</span>, I shall not restore it against his will’. Thus the struggle for supervision of Bloomfield’s
               verse and biography, and, still more, the resentment of poet and publisher by patron,
               was made apparent to all readers. Lofft’s remarks remained in later lifetime stand-alone
               editions of the poem (1808, 1810, 1811, 1815, 1820): he had, it might seem, the last
               (and first) word.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">Not so: in 1809 the <em>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</em> was published – a collection of all the poet’s major publications to that date. Produced
               by the new stereotype method, so that it could be reissued again and again without
               the need to set up new type, this collected edition was supervised by Bloomfield himself,
               and featured a <span class="ital">Farmer’s Boy</span> from which Lofft’s voice was largely excised. For the first time, Lofft’s 1799 alterations
               of the verse were largely removed in favour of what Bloomfield had written in the
               original MS. Poem as well as preface was now in Bloomfield’s words, and these words
               were plainer and more colloquial than anything previously published in his name. For
               example, in the first edition the phrase about mud, ‘Till dirt usurp the empire of
               his shoes’, became ‘dirt adhesive loads his clouted shoes’ (<span class="ital">Spring</span> 82)—’clouted’ smacking of Suffolk rustic speech. The ‘shepherd idling’ became the
               ‘idling shepherd’ (<span class="ital">Spring</span> 281)—the poetic inversion gone. The phrase about the sheep longing for familiar fields,
               ‘Instinctively they haunt the homeward gate’ was changed to ‘Bleating around the homeward
               gate they meet’ (<span class="ital">Spring</span> 297). Since the stereotype edition was reissued in 1814, 1817 and 1821 there were
               effectively two competing versions of <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> in circulation, vividly demonstrating the contested status of the poem and the inability
               of a labouring-class author, even when supported by his publisher, to extricate himself
               from a gentleman patron.

            <p class="noCount">for the next three, this hundred pounds is more than I had expected.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The extra payment of £100 for the first six editions, Bloomfield regarded as generous.
               But the profits were large. Bloomfield told his brother on 30 November 1801 that ‘The
               5th and 6th edition of Giles comprize together 10,000 copies, the new work [<em>Rural Tales</em>] 7,000, so that I have at any rate to share the profits of 17,000 books, for which
               (at full price) the publick, if they are goodnaturd enough to buy them, will pay no
               less than £36,025!’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.70.html">Letter 70</a>). The ninth edition, printed by William Wilson (as were the tenth and eleventh) was
               of 4000 copies. This brought the total printed to 26100. This success was important
               to Vernor and Hood, but they nonetheless faced increasing financial difficulties and
               from the sixth edition of 1802 divided their half share of the profits equally with
               <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LongmanThomasN">Longman</a>, Hurst, Rees, and Orme (this arrangement was still in operation for the twelfth edition
               of 1811). In 1812, after Hood’s death, the firm failed and the surviving partner,
               <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SharpeC">C. Sharpe</a>, sold off his share in the poem to <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#CrosbyBenjamin">B. Crosby</a> and Co, and unloaded 4500 unsold copies of Bloomfield’s publications at a discount
               (thus reducing the value of Bloomfield’s half-share of the profits and making the
               volumes inaccessible to him). The bankruptcy, and Sharpe’s death soon afterwards,
               meant that Bloomfield, as one of many creditors, received only 4s 6d for each pound
               of the £372, 12s and 4d owed him in royalties (23%: and this to be staggered into
               four payments stretching from 1813 to 1816). He took legal advice from Lofft and from
               the eminent Whig lawyer Samuel Romilly and discovered that copyright for the poem
               would revert to him, if living, fourteen years after first publication. He hoped that
               this would be worth ‘not less than £2000’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.273.html">Letter 273</a>). The reversion occurred in March 1814, and he then sold to London publishers a half
               share in the copyright for the next fourteen years, though obtaining only ‘about half
               the sum which I suppose their chance is worth’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.294.html">Letter 294</a>). The publishers’ half share was in turn divided, so that the risk was spread across
               several firms. Thus in 1815 the thirteenth edition, printed by Samuel Hamilton in
               Weybridge, was published by a group of booksellers in which Longman, Hurst, Rees,
               Orme and Brown took the lead. Both for these editions and for the 1814, 1820 and 1821
               stereotype editions of the <em>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</em> Bloomfield kept a half share in the profits; a quarter was held by Longmans, while
               the remaining quarter was divided between several booksellers (Crosby was named among
               them for the 1814 <em>Poems</em> only—and went bankrupt in that year of recession in the book trade). Of these <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BaldwinRobert">Baldwin</a>, Cradock and Joy took responsibility for printing, distribution and payment of royalties
               (see <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.310.html">Letter 310</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.350.html">Letter 350</a>). They printed 2000 copies of the fourteenth edition of <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> (1820) and 2000 of the 1821 <em>Poems</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The poem was popular enough for editions to be published beyond the reach of British
               copyright law. There were two editions in New York, and others in Philadelphia and
               Leipzig, in 1801; in 1802 an edition was published in Dublin; in 1803 editions appeared
               in New York, Dublin and Baltimore; further editions came out in Paris in 1804; and
               in Albany, N.Y., in 1814. After copyright expired in 1828, the poem, either alone
               or combined with editions of other out-of-copyright works by Bloomfield, was frequently
               published, throughout the nineteenth century. B. C. Bloomfield reveals that ‘The firm
               of Milner, for instance, under its various names and in its various series, sold 65,550
               copies of Bloomfield between 1835 and 1895, and he was fifth in popularity, as measured
               by sales, during that period. The figures are:

            <p class="noCount">This Edition</p>
            <p class="noCount">This edition is the first ever to collate all the lifetime editions of the poem. It
               also collates the manuscript that Bloomfield wrote out from memory in 1801 (Houghton
               Library Eng fMS 776.1) in an effort to recreate the original manuscript that in 1798
               he had sent to George Bloomfield, who had passed it to Lofft who emended it and sent
               it to Thomas Hill and thence to press (now Houghton Library Eng fMS 776). The press
               set up type from this original manuscript, and it was then kept by Hill and not returned
               to Bloomfield, who was thus left without a manuscript of his own poem—hence the need
               to write out a new one from memory, one free of Lofft’s emendations that had made
               their way into the first published edition (1800). Bloomfield explained his reasons
               for creating a new manuscript in a letter of 30 November 1801 (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.70.html">Letter 70</a>): ‘I am writing a fair copy of the Farmer’s Boy exactly as you saw it in MS., and
               marking the alterations made by Mr Lofft; and adding notes of information, &amp;c., this
               I do that as I have not the original, something in <span class="ital">my own hand</span> may be found hereafter, and I do it too to improve my handwriting: I shall have it
               bound carefully’. By collating this manuscript (fMS 776.1) and all the lifetime editions,
               and displaying variants, it is for the first time possible to trace the many alterations
               made to the poem and its paratext as a result of the growing tensions between Bloomfield,
               Lofft and the publishers Vernor and Hood. We display, in effect, the history of <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> as a battleground between parties seeking success and authority with an expanded
               literary public shaped by a commercial book market.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">While our copytext is the 1800 first edition, on the grounds it was this that gave
               the poem its major public impact, it is possible to trace the Lofftian emendations
               that the 1800 edition made to the original manuscript by examining the variants. Lofft’s
               additional remarks in successive editions of the Preface and Appendix, and in notes,
               are now traceable; so are the prunings of these remarks in the eighth edition, and
               Lofft’s responses to these prunings in the ninth and subsequent editions. The text
               and paratext as brought under Bloomfield’s control, with much of Lofft’s input excised,
               in the 1809, 1814, 1817 and 1821 stereotype <em>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</em> is also recorded in variants.

            <p class="noCount">Manuscripts</p>
            <p class="noCount">The Houghton Library, Harvard University, holds two manuscripts of the poem. </p>
            <p class="noCount">fMS Eng 776 is the manuscript sent by Bloomfield to George, and taken by George to
               Lofft, in 1798. It was then transmitted to Thomas Hill, who kept it after its use
               by the printer. A fair copy of the whole poem, it contains emendations in pen and
               pencil identified by Bloomfield as the work of Lofft. 
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">MS Eng 776.1 is from 1801. It has no line-numbers, and is of white, laid paper, of
               higher quality than fMS Eng 776, measuring 31 x 19cm. It begins with an explanation:
               
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">City Road, London. Octr 8th 1801. The Original Manuscript of my ‘Farmer’s Boy’ is
               not likely ever to be in my possession again; it being left, by Mr Lofft’s desire,
               in the hands of T Hill Esq. of Henrietta Street Covent Garden; where it now remains;
               except about two hundred and Sixty lines of the commencement of the Poem which are
               lost. Wishing to possess a Manuscript like the Original, I meen that the right hand
               page of this Book shall contain a genuine Copy of the Poem As I wrote it at first;
               and that the left hand page shall shew the amendments and alterations introduced by
               Mr Lofft. This I can do now while my memory retains the deviations; but, some years
               hence, I may not be able, and may then wish that I had done it when it was in my power.
               Robert Bloomfield
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noCount">Lofft’s verbal emendations of the original, 1798, manuscript are entered on the verso,
               together with several notes, and Bloomfield’s reconstitution from memory of the original
               manuscript is written out on the recto.
