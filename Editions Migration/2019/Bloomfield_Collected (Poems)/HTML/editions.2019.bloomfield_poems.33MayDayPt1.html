            <p class="noCount">Introduction</p>
            <p class="noCount">By 1811, Bloomfield was finding that, despite the enormous sales of his first three
               collections, the income from his poetry was no longer sufficient to provide him and
               his family with a living. There were many mouths to feed—not just his immediate family
               but those of his brothers Isaac and George. There were also spiralling expenses repairing
               <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GloverElizabeth">his mother’s</a> house in Suffolk. He sought to reduce outgoings by moving from London to the Bedfordshire
               village of <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/places.html#Shefford">Shefford</a>, hoping to rediscover the placedness in village life that he recalled in his Suffolk
               youth. But in Shefford poverty loomed as <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#VernorThomas">Vernor</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#HoodThomas">Hood</a> went bankrupt and the book trade retrenched. From 1816, the postwar economic recession
               made matters worse, making it hard to interest publishers in new works. Changing taste,
               in a nation used to daily news of battles, played a part: Byron’s and Scott’s chivalric
               tales, full of thrilling, heroic action, became the new vogue; Bloomfield’s village
               tales, bucolic and comic, seemed tame by comparison.
            </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Bloomfield’s eclipse was gradual but irreversible. In 1814 the onetime market leader
                  was tentative but hopeful: ‘I somtimes dream’, he wrote, ‘that I shall one day venture
                  again before the public somthing in my old manner, some country tales, and spiced
                  with love and courtship might yet please, for Rural life by the art of Cooking may
                  be made a relishing and high flavourd dish, whatever it may be in reality’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.294.html">Letter 294</a>, 4 October 1814). Advancing arthritis, partial blindness, and debilitating migraines
                  impeded his capacity to write however, and no new publication appeared in the next
                  seven years. By 1819, he at least had manuscript material to offer publishers, but
                  found them unenthusiastic, telling his daughter ‘I am grieved to wound your feelings,
                  but I realy doubt that myself and my poetry are out of fashion from the taste of the
                  times. <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BaldwinRobert">Baldwin</a> is cold, and I have tried through <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ParkThomas">Mr Park</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#RogersSamuel">Mr Rogers</a> to get the poem into the hands of <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#MurrayJohn">Murry</a>. If he too says the same, good bye fine prospects!’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.344.html">Letter 344</a>, 17 September 1819). Despite the influence of Bloomfield’s old literary friends,
                  John Murray (publisher of Byron and Thomas Moore) did not bite, and nothing from Bloomfield’s
                  pen appeared in 1819, 1820 or 1821.

                           1819) and may also partly explain his decision to change the title of the work from
                           ‘Oakly Hall’ to May-Day with the Muses.</span></div>

            <p class="noCount">It was at the nadir of Bloomfield’s fortunes that one of his old gentlemen friends
               got in touch with him again. <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ">Thomas Lloyd Baker</a>, a wealthy Gloucestershire landowner, wrote in 1821, sending a banknote, but also
               presuming on their past membership of a companionate circle centered on his wife and
               her sisters to lecture Bloomfield about his conduct:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">It has been remarked that for some time past neither yourself nor any of your family
               have been in the habit of attending any place of worship whatsoever. It has also been
               observed that you are in the habit of reading some periodical works which are very
               hostile to the government of this country. Perhaps from these two circumstances coupled
               together has originated the idea that you have imbibed both Deistical &amp; Republican
               principles. The latter tending to the subversion of that Government under which we
               have all lived so long free from those calamities which have befallen almost every
               other part of Europe—The former tending to the destruction of Christianity, &amp; herein
               of every thing most valuable to us all (but most of all endangering the eternal welfare
               of those who are unhappy enough to become its Dupes) and both being so frequently
               united in the same persons—These considerations have induced many of your friends
               &amp; patrons upon principle to withhold from you their accustomed protection &amp; assistance,
               thinking that by doing as they had done, &amp; as they still wish to do, they should be
               giving countenance to a dangerous man. I cannot think they are right. I cannot adopt
               such an opinion of you. In full hope that all maybe explained away, &amp; that you may
               again stand as high in the esteem of your friends as the religious and moral tendency
               of your former life &amp; works had placed you, I take advantage of being in your neighbourhood
               to give you this information, &amp; to assure you that I shall have much pleasure in making
               known to your former friends any answer to this letter which you may think it right
               to favor me with for this purpose. (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.351.html">Letter 351</a>, 23 May 1821)
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noCount">The letter is one example of the ideological strife of post-Waterloo Britain: it places
               in stark illumination the repression by which the ruling classes maintained their
               grip on power, all the while fearing revolution. Bloomfield knew he was now living
               through a reactionary era, in which the classes were polarised, and his public response
               was to create, in his final collection of poems <em>May-Day with the Muses</em> (1822), a pastoral fantasy wherein the literary circle once offered him by literary
               gentlemen and women—<a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">the Duke of Grafton</a>, Lloyd Baker and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LloydBakerMary">his wife</a> and sisters-in-law—is reconstituted in an idealised village.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">Lloyd Baker’s insensitive letter reached Bloomfield when <em>May-Day</em> was already in press with Baldwin, Cradock and Joy. Writing to Baldwin on 5 June
               (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.355.html">Letter 355</a>), Bloomfield made plain his financial plight, and the reduced worth of his poetry.
               He noted that Baldwin had been uninterested in buying a share of the copyright, not
               wanting to risk the firm’s money on the publication: this was not the arrangement
               that had operated for <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em>, <em>Rural Tales</em>, and <em>Wild Flowers</em>. He needed money so badly that he asked Baldwin for a loan, to be repaid in instalments
               from future sales receipts: effectively giving up, in all but name, a quarter of his
               copyright. Baldwin agreed to this, and to a later request to buy a further quarter,
               for which Bloomfield received £100. In spring 1822 a first edition of a thousand copies
               was published, priced at two shillings and sixpence (3000 had been printed for both
               the first and second editions of <em>Wild Flowers</em>). A second edition, in duodecimo at four shillings, also of a thousand copies, appeared
               later in the year—but this was not enough to redeem Bloomfield’s fortunes. He was
               a poor man when he died the following summer, dying so indebted that his family had
               to hold, in their home village, a public sale of his books and household goods.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><em>May-Day</em> is a collection set in a village in which poetry is able to substitute for money
               and rent can be paid in verse. Built on a conceit, it is ostensibly the fruit of a
               poetry slam organized to celebrate the traditional May Day festivities. The local
               squire, Sir Ambrose Higham, Bloomfield imagines, invites the villagers to recite poems
               about village life, accepting them in lieu of rent. Thus the landowner renews old
               customs, preferring poetry to money as a sign of value, and patronizes, in the best
               sense, rustics who are able to voice their rural experience as verse. The squire respects
               his tenants and they him: the ideal village, for Bloomfield, is self-policing. This
               was an old-fashioned and forlorn hope, perhaps, in face of the capitalization of farming
               and the coerciveness of squires such as Lloyd Baker, but it was one to which Wordsworth,
               Southey, and Gilpin also subscribed as did Cobbett: despite their political differences,
               their common commitment to the superiority of the remembered rural society of their
               youth over the capitalist one of the present led them all to romanticize a rural paternalism
               that was both radical and conservative in its opposition to the liberal, laissez faire
               ideology of ‘improvement’ that enriched the landowning classes while impoverishing
               their labourers.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">Comprising ballads and lyrics, <em>May-Day</em> is effectively a conservative revisiting of <em>Rural Tales</em> and <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, with a frame narrative that, like <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth’s</a> Preface (which Bloomfield had admired in 1802), was designed to outline the poems’
               social import and to prepare for their proper reception by the reader. Wordsworth
               himself had embarked on a conservative reworking of the radical <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> in his ‘Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle’ (1807), in which the poet is imagined
               as a having the valued role of a bard singing of the deeds of the local Lord Clifford
               in the presence of that lord, his retainers, and tenants. In <em>May-Day</em> not only does it seem that to be a rural poet is to be a cherished villager and vice
               versa, but also that poetry is a face-to-face oral activity of a united community.
               The benevolent squire, moreover, respects tradition and exacts no political toll for
               his benevolence, which he in fact regards as his duty. Meanwhile, the individual poems
               that the villagers recite also tell of a traditional society in which authority is
               vested, at local level, in the community at large, presided over by a single figure
               who can therefore be addressed, appealed to, and even, potentially, rebuked and chastised
               face to face—the squire.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The community at large is invoked in ‘The Drunken Father’, a comic tale narrating
               a potentially tragic story of paternal neglect. The poem evokes ‘The Idiot Boy’ because
               it features a mother worrying about her young child, out on an errand at night. As
               in that poem, the errand is a comic journey that might have been tragic—the child
               rescues his drunken father from the alehouse and navigates him safely home in the
               dark. The mother is relieved; her emotion, however, is the center of the drama. Domestic
               harmony is endorsed; the father agrees to reform and become, in the eyes of the villagers,
               an upstanding family man. If this ending imagines the village as being largely free
               of exploitation and mostly capable of healing its own social ills, then ‘The Forester’
               offers a more critical view, implicitly endorsing a radical politics of nature. Bloomfield
               has his narrator use the oak-tree motif that had served to legitimize the monarchy
               since the time of Charles II. A mighty oak in the squire’s park has fallen:

            <p class="noCount">The astonished deer, keen to ‘learn and muse’ what the unexpected change means, stand
               in for the local rustics. They also prompt an act of political interpretation by the
               narrator: he reminds his audience—and us, the readers—that monarchs, however mighty,
               are dependent on the people. There is a hint of Jacobinism about this lesson; the
               royal oak can represent a ‘bigot’ as well as a ‘sage’ king, and bigots can be swept
               away. The political resonances of this passage were picked up on by the reviewer for
               <em>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine </em>(vol. 11, no. 55 (June 1822), 722–31), who noted that the poem’s speaker ‘seems somewhat
               radically disposed’, and added: ‘We presume from the opinions of his Keeper, that
               old Sir Ambrose Higham was a Whig, and voted with the majority.’ The poem concludes
               not with a patriotic declaration of loyalty to king and country, but by imagining
               nature as a levelling principle that guarantees individual liberty:

            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield’s position here is close to that of Wordsworth in 1798: the wilds and forests
               are a reliable refuge and resource for revolutionary freedom, at least for the individual
               poet if not for the masses. Cowper’s rural radicalism stands behind both writers,
               and Bloomfield honours it by borrowing the oak-tree symbol through which Cowper had
               most searchingly interrogated power.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The next poem, ‘The Shepherd’s Dream: or, Fairies’ Masquerade’, was arguably even
               more contentious. This was read, in spite of Bloomfield’s description of it as ‘a
               lay, / Harmless and wild and fitting for the day’ (lines 23–4), as a parable on the
               recent wars with France. As the <em>Monthly Review</em> (99 (1822), 89–94) succinctly put it: ‘The shepherd now repeats a very fanciful dream,
               which is in fact an allegorical description of the French Revolution and the great
               political events that have followed it.’ Critical opinion on this poem was mixed.
               <em>The Literary Gazette, and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, &amp;c. </em>(277 (11 May 1822), 289–91) dismissed it as ‘a sort of allegorical account of Buonaparte’s
               last campaigns; and furnishes no extract we could wish to adduce’, while <em>The Literary Speculum</em> (2 (1822), 1–12) stated that ‘the political allusion’ to Napoleon’s fate ‘might have
               been spared, as it is out of place’. As above, the review in <em>Blackwood’s</em> is enlightening. ‘The old shepherd’, it admitted, is ‘beautifully introduced’, but
               the poem itself was a more difficult proposition. ‘It must have puzzled the audience
               not a little’, claimed the reviewer, ‘and on the first reading it was to us an enigma’:

            <blockquote class="quote">It is no less an affair than a poetical summary of some of the principal events in
               the later parts of Napoleon’s life—the Russian expedition—his subsequent campaigns,
               his banishment to Elba—return to Paris—Waterloo—and St Helena.—It will be remembered,
               that Mr Bloomfield was the protegé of Capel Loft [<span class="ital">sic</span>], a gentleman who believed with Sir Richard Phillips, that Napoleon was a man of
               pacific disposition, fond of home-comforts, and an empassioned lover of freedom. It
               is laughable to observe honest Robert Bloomfield adopting such insane absurdities:
               but the poem, notwithstanding, is excellent.

               That he is a poet, we will maintain in the face of all critics Northern and Southern,
               who would insinuate to the contrary. Had he been so fortunate as to come into the
               world fifty years earlier, no one would have thought of depreciating his claims. But
               the literary world has been of late pampered into daintiness. The Farmer’s Boy was
               too <span class="ital">loftily</span> bepraised at its first appearance. It owed, it is true, much of its temporary success
               to the well-meant endeavours of its Editor and Commentator; and so far the Poet was
               under great obligations to his Maecenas. But the ebb-tide of popular feeling has fallen
               proportionably below the mark, and has left the poet scarcely afloat.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote">It has been brought as a heavy and annihilating charge against Bloomfield, that he
               is not either <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BurnsRobert">Burns</a> or <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ClareJohn">Clare</a>. To compare him with the former, were absurd, for Burns was not an uneducated man;
               and it were not less invidious to set up young Lubin to the disparagement of old Giles.
               But, as such a comparison has been hinted at, we will just take the liberty to remark,
               that had Giles been left to follow the plough, instead of stooping over the last in
               Bell Alley, or vegetating at the Shepherd and Shepherdess in the City Road,—had he
               remained a peasant and a pupil of Nature till his limbs had acquired their full development,
               his frame had been strung to health, and his education as a poet had been completed
               by the woods and the streams, the winds and the sunshine, and the quiet of the country,
               our Farmer’s Boy would have led off with the Muses on May-day in a far higher style
               than must now be expected from him. The man has brain enough, as his ample forehead
               testifies. The ‘anterior cerebral lobes,’ as Mr. Lawrence would say, are sufficiently
               developed to admit of his excelling as a poet. And he has certainly heart enough,
               for never was a more passionate lover of rural Nature. All that seems wanted is, a
               greater portion of physical elasticity, that should have given a healthful vigour
               to his thoughts, and tone to his feelings. The feebleness which is occasionally betrayed
               in his productions, is that induced by the languid action of a crazy frame, originally
               unworthy of the mind which it serves, and rendered still more inadequate to the higher
               functions of imagination by perpetual ill-health and concomitant anxieties, ‘I have
               written these tales,’ he tells us, ‘in anxiety and in a wretched state of health;
               and if these formidable foes have not incapacitated me, but left me free to meet the
               public eye with any degree of credit, that degree of credit I am sure I shall gain.’
               They have not incapacitated him for pleasing those who are disposed to be pleased
               with wild-flowers and May-blossom, and such simple things as go to form a May-day
               wreath; and he must be a ruthless and a heartless critic who would by rough handling
               doom them to fade a moment before their time.
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noCount">This was special pleading. Readers are asked to look kindly on the poems because they
               pity Bloomfield’s disability and recognise the difficult circumstances in which he
               had learned to write: condescension is sought because admiration is not to be expected.
               Bloomfield’s vogue has given way to the fashion for Clare, the new ‘peasant poet’
               (who, ironically enough, was influenced by Bloomfield not simply as an example of
               a labourer poet but as a craftsman in verse).
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The <em>Monthly Review</em>, reviewing the second edition, also acknowledged Bloomfield’s ‘yesterday’s man’ status,
               but offered a more robust endorsement of his powers, though suggesting, between the
               lines, that his rural tales were good because they ignored the realities of pain and
               poverty that other poets confronted:

               lyre, and the pruning-hook for the pen. Of the two metamorphoses, undoubtedly the
               latter is the most natural and rational; and it is an honorable proof of the extensive
               influence which our free institutions exert over our habits and feelings, that our
               literary history affords so many instances of eminent authors who have risen to such
               celebrity from the lowest situations. This is as it should be in the ‘Republic of
               Letters,’ where genius and talent are the only title to superior distinction.—The
               English public have always recognized the claims of merit, however nameless and humble;
               and among those who have been raised from their obscurity by the public approbation
               and encouragement, no one has deserved his elevation more justly than Robert Bloomfield.

            <blockquote class="quote">As the author of ‘The Farmer’s Boy,’ this votary of the Muses has long been a favorite
               with those whose feelings are calm and healthy enough to be delighted with poetry,
               which borrows its only charm from the innocence and simplicity of rural occupations,
               and the exhibition of homely affections. In these quiet and unobtrusive descriptions,
               no writer has been happier than Bloomfield. Unlike Crabbe, who is always most successful
               when he is painting some scene of wretchedness or knavery,—a young girl breaking her
               heart at the faithlessness of her lover, or a parish-apprentice cheating the overseers,—Bloomfield
               delights to describe the virtues and happiness of rural life, and thus affords us
               most certainly a more pleasant and more satisfactory picture. We rejoice, therefore,
               to find him once more appearing before the public; giving a proof not only that he
               is not dead, but that he has not forgotten how to weave together his village rhymes
               as pleasingly as heretofore.

            <p class="noCount">Noting that there were several poems in Bloomfield’s best, ballad style, there were
               also some in which ‘we observe a straining to reach a higher tone of feeling than
               is natural to the poet’, the reviewer concluded by ‘assuring our readers that they
               will not find many pleasanter modes of whiling away a gloomy afternoon in Autumn than
               in the perusal of May-Day with the Muses.’ This was to offer modest, if not faint,
               praise.

               but merely state, that I once met with a lady in London, who, though otherwise of
               strong mind and good information, would maintain that ‘it is impossible for a blind
               man to fall in love.’ I always thought her wrong, and the present tale of ‘Alfred
               and Jennet’ is written to elucidate my side of the question.

            <p class="noCount">I have been reported to be dead; but I can assure the reader that this, like many
               other reports, is not true. I have written these tales in anxiety, and in a wretched
               state of health; and if these formidable foes have not incapacitated me, but left
               me free to meet the public eye with any degree of credit, that degree of credit I
               am sure I shall gain.

               make this approach (see <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.340.html">Letter 340</a>, 3 September 1819) and may also partly explain his decision to change the title of
               the work from ‘Oakly Hall’ to <em>May-Day with the Muses</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">This poem was almost certainly prompted by a letter Bloomfield received from his patron,
               the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GraftonGeorgeHenry4">4th Duke of Grafton</a>, who wrote to express his regrets that ‘Mr. B’s muse should have been so long silent’,
               and mentioned ‘an occurrence such as was witnessed by several persons in a neighbouring
               forest (Salcey), [which] might have roused her from her lethargy, if she had been
               within reach of surveying the remains of the largest oak in the forest, which fell
               with a prodigious crash, a few days ago, within a hundred yards of the principal lodge,
               of which it had been for an age the chief ornament; the noise attracted the notice
               of all, but of none more than the forest deer, which assembled &amp; remained for some
               hours around it, as if to perform the funeral obsequies of a departed &amp; reverend friend;
               at last, they seemed mournfully to retire, their movements being silent and slow’
