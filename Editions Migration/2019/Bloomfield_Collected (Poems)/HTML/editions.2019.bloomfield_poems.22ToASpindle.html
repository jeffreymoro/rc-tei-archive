            <p class="noCount">[Brayley’s note:] <span class="smcaps">Bloomfield</span> has favoured us with permission to copy the annexed portrait of his mother from a
               picture in his possession, and has himself subjoined the following account of the
               last stage of her life, together with his first essay in Blank verse, which he has
               addressed to the <span class="ital">Spindle </span>that she left <span class="ital">half filled</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">[Bloomfield’s note:] The portrait of my mother was taken on her last visit to London,
               in the summer of 1804, and about six months previous to her dissolution. During the
               period of evident decline in her strength and faculties, she conceived, in place of
               that patient resignation which she had before felt, an ungovernable dread of ultimate
               want, and observed to a relative, with peculiar emphasis, that ‘to meet <span class="smcaps">Winter, Old Age</span>, and <span class="smcaps">Poverty</span>, was like meeting three giants.’
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">To the last hour of her life she was an excellent spinner; and latterly, the peculiar
               kind of wool she spun, was brought exclusively for her, as being the only one in the
               village, who exercised their industry on so fine a sort. During the tearful paroxysms
               of her last depression she spun with the utmost violence, and with vehemence exclaimed
               —‘<span class="ital">I must spin!</span>’ A paralytic affection, struck her whole right side, while at work, and obliged her
               to quit her spindle when only half filled, and she died within a fortnight afterwards!
               I have that spindle now. She was buried on the last day of the year 1804. She returned
               from her visit to London, on Friday, the 29th of June, just to a day, twenty-three
               years after she brought me to London, which was also on a Friday, in the year 1781.

            <p class="noCount">[Brydges’ critical summary:] There is no reader of English poetry, who does not recollect
               Cowper’s exquisite lines on his Mother’s Picture. This fragment of Bloomfield forms
               a noble companion to them. It strikes me to be written in a loftier tone, and still
               more excellent manner than any of his other productions. Let him give new delight
               and astonishment to the world by a moral and descriptive poem in blank verse!
