        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Introduction</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s interest in music was of longstanding: he had, before marrying, been a fiddle player and he continued to write
          verse for composers to set. Many of his songs were arranged for piano and harp. It was not until 1806, however, that Bloomfield took up, as
          a trade, the manufacture of Aeolian harps, telling his friend <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#InskipThomas">Thomas Inskip</ref> that ‘I
          find such pleasure in the use of the saw and the plane that I am determined to … attack the Harps tomorrow’ (<ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.189.html">Letter 189</ref>; 27 June 1806). He gave harps to
          his genteel friends and sold them to their friends: <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ParkThomas">Thomas Park</ref>, the editor, and his
          wife Maria Hester, were amongst the earliest to receive an instrument. Mrs Park then published a sonnet in thanks. Her ‘Addressed to an
          Eolian Harp, constructed by the Author of “The Farmer’s Boy”, “Wild Flowers”, &amp;c.’ was published in <title>The Monthly Mirror</title>
          (21 (1806), 196):</p>

          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">As on each string he breathes a trembling kiss;</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">His viewless pinion wafts the music round,</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">Whose swell is ecstasy, whose close is bliss!</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">Oh sweetly raise thy more than mortal tone</l>

          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">Since pure and artless is, like thine, his song.</l>
        </lg>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The sonnet claimed the attention of <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</ref>, who wrote alerting
          Bloomfield to James Thomson’s poetic tributes to the instrument, ‘the charming lines in the “Castle of Indolence”,’ and ‘his exquisite “Ode
          to the Aeolian Harp”‘ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.188.html">Letter 188</ref>; June
          1806). Thus edified, Bloomfield was able, in other letters, to make the instrument’s poetic heritage part of the package that would
          recommend it to his patrons and customers. Writing to the <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BuchanLord">Earl of Buchan</ref> on 15
          September 1806 (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.191.html">Letter 191</ref>) he
          declared</p>
        <quote>I cannot conclude without informing your Lordship, whom I know to be possessd of a love for nature’s music, and a fund of fancys, that
          I have lately taken up a new and most agreeable trade, that of constructing Eolian Harps. I am become rather dextrous in the use of the
          plane and the glue-pot, and find a demand that I am hardly able to satisfy. Can any thing in Nature, or even in imagination, exceed the tone
          of that simple instrument? Your unrivalled Thompson knew it well. Witness his Castle of Indolence, the finest lines that can possibly be
          written on the subject.
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">Ah me, what hand can touch the strings so fine?</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">Who up the lofty diapason roll</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">Such sweet, such sad, such solemn airs divine</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">Then let them down again into the soul?</l>
        </lg>
        </quote>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">From letters such as these came the idea of printing an anthology of writings on the Aeolian Harp to give out, with the
          harps he constructed. He told <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mary Lloyd Baker</ref> on 14 March 1807 (<ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.203.html">Letter 203</ref>)</p>
        <quote>your idea of my being in the road to <hi rend="ital">publish</hi> what I can gather as to the nature of the Harp, is wrong. I only
          thought of printing a few copies for private distribution to such of my customers as profess’d to know nothing on the subject, and just to
          make it pay its own expence, and stand as a profess’d compilation on that particular themes. It would save me much talking, and that to me
          is a material thing.</quote>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">By September 1807 he had compiled a manuscript, only to lose it in a fire. Replacing it from his sources (it was drawn
          largely from a journal article and from Sir John Hawkins’s <title>General History of the Science and Practice of Music</title>), he gave a
          history of the instrument, a description of his own construction,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> On this see John Goodridge,
            ‘Bloomfield and the Aeolian harp: a conversation with Alan and Nina Grove’, <title>Robert Bloomfield Society Newsletter</title>, 3 (March,
            2002), 7–13.</note> a theoretical discussion of its modus operandi and a brief anthology of literature concerning it.<note n="2"
            place="foot" resp="editors"> See Shelley Trower, <ref target="https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/ravon/2009-n54-ravon3401/038761ar/"
              >‘Nerves, Vibration and the Aeolian Harp’</ref>, <title>Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net</title>, 54 (2009).</note></p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">By the winter of 1807 ill-health and delays at the engraver had left Bloomfield seriously in arrears with his harp orders,
          and although the manuscript was printed by his friend <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SwanJames">James Swan</ref> in 1808 for
          distribution with each harp sold, production began to languish. It picked up in December 1808, when Bloomfield’s musical brother <ref
            type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac</ref> came to stay in London. ‘We are making Harps by the dozen’, Bloomfield
          recorded (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.234.html">Letter 234</ref>). This flurry of
          manufacture did not last, however, as Bloomfield succumbed to migraines, eye problems and rheumatism, and became plagued by poverty. His
          last mention of building harps comes in a letter of 1811. <title>Nature’s Music</title> also languished until in 1822, Bloomfield, by now in
          dire financial straits, wondered whether it might be reprinted, and perhaps form a means of raising money through subscription (<ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.365.html">Letter 365</ref>). This did not occur.</p>
