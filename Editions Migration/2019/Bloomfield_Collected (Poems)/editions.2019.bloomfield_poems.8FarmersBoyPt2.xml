            rendition="#indent0">Hitherto the biographical narrative, as given originally by my brother, in letters to my good friend <ref type="m"
              target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Mr. Lofft</ref>, has gone undisturbed.
            Though I have often doubted the accuracy of the dates, the facts themselves remain unimpeachable. I had, indeed, convinced my brother,
            that he inadvertently mis-stated my age, on coming to London; and, by my wish, the reader was told, in the preface to the former editions,
            that my juvenile pieces, there referred to, and of which fragments are given, were written in the year 1784. As I certainly transgressed
            in rhyme from the age of fifteen years and a half until twenty, writing pieces of various descriptions, the doubt on my mind was, whether
            my brother, who saw them all, could tell, any more than myself, on being questioned fourteen years after the time, at what particular date
            the pieces were actually written or published, which he had mentioned to Mr. Lofft; for I well remember, more than once, to have received
            the sentence of, ‘R. B. is inadmissible.’</p><p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">To satisfy my curiosity, and arrive at the truth, I
            have examined the files of old newspapers, as they are preserved at Peel’s Coffee-house, Fleet-street; beginning with 1784; at which time,
            in my seventeenth year, I supposed them to have been written. My trouble was repaid, by finding the objects of my search under the date of
            1786. Whatever merit or puerility may be found in the pieces I have thus unexpectedly regained, and which I had endeavoured to recollect,
            they appear to have been written, or at least published, between the ages of nineteen and twenty; and, consequently, any reader of taste
            will believe, on perusing them, that they are here given to the world, more from the love of truth than the love of praise; and will, at
            the same time, observe, that the copy of ‘A Village Girl,’ as given from memory by <ref type="m"
              target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">my brother</ref>, was not quite
            correct.</p><p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I lay down all reputed juvenile excellence with infinite satisfaction; and, though some
            may blame this kind of self exposure, I can make up the account to my own conscience, and am determined to believe, that, whatever
            different opinions may be entertained as to the nature and proper limits of biography, to rectify mistakes is to do right; and to tell
            truth, the first duty of us all.</p><p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">If it should be asked, why I did not make the search before the
            publication of the ‘Farmer’s Boy’ I answer, that I did well to trust to the kind hand which was about to lift me from obscurity and
            distress; that I had then no doubt of the accuracy of the dates, nor the least knowledge that such newspapers were any where in existence;
            and, lastly, I had not then a Coffee-house coat to my back, to carry me through the enquiry.</p><p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0"
            >There will be found in these little pieces, obscurities and bad grammar, they are exact copies from the papers, and as I wrote them;
            except in the instances marked at the foot of each piece, the editors of the papers not thinking it worth their while to correct them. The
            reader will recognise in them the ‘provincial usage’ mentioned by Mr. Lofft, at page xvi. of the following preface.</p><p rend="noCount"

              <hi rend="smcaps">George Bloomfield</hi></ref>, the Brother of the Author, and he had recommended it with a very modest, sensible, and
          candid Letter.</note> It had before been shewn to some persons in <hi rend="ital">London</hi>: whose indifference toward it may probably be
        explained when it is considered that it came to their hands under no circumstances of adventitious recommendation. With some a person must be
        rich, or titled, or fashionable as a literary name, or at least fashionable in some respect, good or bad, before any thing which he can offer
        will be thought worthy of notice.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I had been a little accustomed to the effect of prejudices: and I was determined to judge, in the only
        just and reasonable way, of the Work, by the Work itself.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">At first I confess, seeing it divided into the four Seasons, I had to encounter a prepossession not very

          parts of it. C.L.</note> but so injudiciously and unhappily made, of transmuting that noble Poem from Blank Verse into Rhime;…from its own
        pure native Gold into an alloyed Metal of incomparably less splendor, permanence, and worth.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I had soon, however, the pleasure of finding myself relieved from that apprehension: and of discovering
        that, although the delineation of <hi rend="smcaps">Rural Scenery</hi> naturally branches itself into these divisions, there was little else
        except the General Qualities of a musical ear; flowing numbers, Feeling, Piety, poetic Imagery and Animation, a taste for the picturesque, a
        true sense of the natural and pathetic, force of thought, and liveliness of imagination, which were in common between Thomson and this Author.
        And these are qualities which whoever has the eye, the heart, the awakened and surrounding intellect, and the diviner sense of the Poet; which
        alone can deserve the name, must possess.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">But, with these general Characters of true Poetry, ‘<title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>’ has, as I have said,
        a character of its own. It is discriminated as much as the circumstances and habits, and situation, and ideas consequently associated, which
        are so widely diverse in the two Authors, could make it different. Simplicity, sweetness, a natural tenderness, that <title>molle atque

        appear’d in <hi rend="ital">March</hi> last, I intimated a design of accompanying it with some <hi rend="smcaps">Critical Remarks</hi>. With
        that design various Engagements have since greatly interfer’d. From one of the most laborious and constant of those, that of the office of a
        Justice of the Peace for the County of Suffolk, I am now discharg’d. Why those who are in power have done this, they have not explain’d: and
        it being an office from which any one who holds it is removable at <hi rend="ital">pleasure</hi>, they are not call’d to explain. Had it been
        for Crime or Misconduct as a Magistrate, of course Trial and Conviction should have preceded my Removal. As it is, I feel, as I have publicly
        declar’d, no shame in the removal. I have held an office honorable because extensively useful; because unprofitable and burthensome to the
        individual; because independently and conscientiously exercis’d, with a devotion, such as it requir’d, of my time, my thoughts, and my best
        faculties, daily to its discharge. My Colleagues,—and they are and have been, during a course of seventeen years, those of them who now act,
        and those who are dead or absent, men with whom to have acted was indeed satisfactory and pleasant,—my late Colleagues part with me, and I
        with them regrettingly. Our reciprocal Esteem is not lessen’d by this abruption of our official intercourse. And as every man who feels what
        Society is, ought to determine to be serviceable to the Public, my removal from this office neither weakens the determination, nor probably
        will be found to have impair’d the means of effecting it. I am therefore well content;—as I ought to be. I sought not the office. I have never
        sought any. It solicited my acceptance; unask’d and unexpected. I owe my appointment to the <ref type="m"
          target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Duke of <hi rend="smcaps"
            >Grafton</hi></ref>, very soon after I came to reside in this County. He was then <hi rend="ital">Lord Lieutenant</hi>. I have not yielded
        that appointment to disgust; though there were those who were not sparing in their endeavours to disgust me with it: I have not relinquish’d
        it to suit my convenience; though in times like these an office of no little expence, and which shut me out from sources of professional
        emolument, was to me certainly not convenient: I have not consulted my ease or health by a voluntary retirement. I am remov’d, I am
        superseded, I am struck out from an office of incredible and hourly increasing anxiety. Circumstances like this are not new. They have
        repeatedly taken place in relation to very high offices; and the Public remembers men to whom they have happen’d whose internal dignity and
        worth is above any official dignity. Had I felt that I <hi rend="ital">merited</hi> to be remov’d, I should not have thought myself a fit
        Editor of the <hi rend="smcaps">Farmer’s Boy</hi>; a Poem which breathes every where modest independence, benevolence, innocence, and virtue.
        As it is, I think myself no way less fit than ever for any laudable and becoming employ. And I have accordingly announc’d my intention of
        resuming my profession as a <hi rend="smcaps">Barrister</hi>.<note n="66" place="foot" resp="editors"> [5th, 6th, and 7th edns add note:]
          Since this was written I have accordingly resum’d it. And I cordially thank my Brethren of the Profession, and my late Brethren of the
          Bench, and the Public, for a reception which has made my return to the Bar very pleasant after so long an Absence. And here I have to
          remark, that whatever <hi rend="ital">political </hi>Sentiments or <hi rend="ital">personal </hi>Feelings I have exprest, either in the <hi
            rend="smcaps">Preface</hi> or the <hi rend="smcaps">Appendix</hi>, I trust they have not occupied a disproportion’d Space; nor have been
          unsuitable either to the place in which they are introduced, or to the subject or the occasion. That occasion, I am convinced, is just and
          urgent: and that it is becoming of a man, and of me in particular, and consonant to the whole course of my life, to speak openly even in
          these times what I think of moment to my Country and to human Society. As to what is personal to myself, I should have passed it entirely
          here, if that also did not concern the <hi rend="smcaps">Public</hi>; and if it did not concern the <hi rend="smcaps">Farmer’s Boy</hi> on

          the sentiments or the mode of expression must, in mere justice, impute them to me alone, and in no respect as any way implicating him. He
          wishes, I believe, to decline <hi rend="ital">Politics </hi>and <hi rend="ital">Controversy </hi>altogether; and I wish no man to mix in

        this purpose I obtain’d his address, and found him … the modest, the unambitious person you describe; wondering at the praise and admiration
        with which his Poem has been receiv’d; whose utmost ambition was to have presented a fair copy to his aged Mother, as a pledge of filial
        affection, and a picture of his juvenile avocations. So unexpected was the fame of his production, that the whole of his good fortune appears
        to him as a dream.—“I had no more idea,” says he, “to be sent for by the Duke of Grafton, and be so kindly and generously treated, than of the

      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Among other subjects of conversation respecting the <hi rend="ital">Farmer’s Boy</hi>, I wish’d to be
        inform’d of his manner of composition. I enquir’d, as he compos’d it in a garret, amid the bustle and noise of six or seven fellow workmen,
        whether he us’d a slate; or wrote it on paper with a pencil, or pen and ink. But what was my surprize when told that he had us’d neither.—My
        business, during the greatest part of my life having led me into the line of litterary pursuits, and made me acquainted with litterary men, I
        am, consequently, pretty well inform’d of the methods us’d by authors for the retention of their productions. We are told, if my recollection
        is just, that Milton took his Daughters as his amanuenses; that Savage, when his poverty precluded him the conveniency of pen, ink, and paper,
        us’d to study in the streets, and go into shops to record the productions of his fertile genius; that Pope, when on visits at Lord
        Bolingbroke’s, us’d to ring up the servants at any hour in the night for pen and ink, to write any thought that struck his lively and wakeful
        imagination; that Dr. Blacklock, though blind, had the happy faculty of writing down, in a very legible hand, the chaste and elegant
        productions of his Muse.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">With these and many other methods of composition we are acquainted; but that of a great part of <hi

        well acquainted with the treacherousness of memory, and how soon the most happy ideas, for want of sufficient quickness in noting down, are
        lost in the rapidity of thought.</p>

        a tame and servile adherence to classical imagery and costume; at the same time totally overlooking that profusion of picturesque beauty, and

        operations of the dairy, occupy the chief part of this Season: which is clos’d by a beautiful Personification of the Spring and her
        attendants, and an admirable delineation of the sportive pleasures of the young Lambs.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <hi rend="ital">second</hi> Book, or <hi rend="ital">Summer</hi>, commences with a characteristic
        sketch of the prudent yet benevolent Farmer. The genial influence of the rain is then welcom’d; to which succeeds a most delicious picture of
        a green and woody covert with all its insect tribe. The ascension of the sky-lark, the peaceful repose of <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi>, a view
        of the ripening harvest, with some moral reflections on Nature and her great Creator, are introduced: followed by animated descriptions of
        reaping, gleaning, the honest exultation of the Farmer, the beauty of the Country Girl, and the wholesome refreshment of the field. Animals
        teazed by insects, the cruelty of docking horses, the insolence of the gander, the apathy of the swine, are drawn in a striking manner: and
        the Book concludes with masterly pictures of a twilight repose, a midnight storm of thunder and lightning, and views of the ancient and
        present mode of celebrating Harvest-home.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <hi rend="ital">third</hi> Book, <hi rend="ital">Autumn</hi>, is introduc’d with a delineation of
        forest scenery, and pigs fattening on fallen acorns. Sketches of wild ducks and their haunts, of hogs settling to repose in a wood, and of
        wheat sowing, succeed. The sound of village bells suggests a most pleasing digression: of which the church and its pastor, the rustic
        amusements of a Sunday, the Village Maids, and a most pathetic description of a distracted Female, are the prominent features. Returning to
        rural business, <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi> is drawn guarding the rising wheat from birds:—his little hut, with his preparation for the
        reception of his playmates, their treachery and his disappointment, are conceiv’d and colour’d in an exquisite style. Fox-Hunting, the
        Fox-hound’s epitaph, the long autumnal evenings, a description of domestic fowl, and a welcome to the snowy nights of Winter, form the
        concluding topics of this Season. </p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <hi rend="ital">fourth</hi> Book, under the appellation of <hi rend="ital">Winter</hi>, is usher’d in
        by some humane injunctions for the treatment of storm-pinch’d cattle. The frozen turnips are broken for them: and the cowyard at night is
        describ’d. The conviviality of a Christmas evening, and the conversation round the fire, with the admonitions from the Master’s chair, are
        depicted in a manner truly pleasing. The <hi rend="ital">Sea Boy</hi> and the <hi rend="ital">Farmer’s Boy</hi> are contrasted with much
        effect:—and the ploughman feeding his horses at night, with the comparison between the cart-horse and post-horse, have great merit. The
        mastiff turn’d sheep-biter is next delineated; succeeded by a description of a moon-light night, and the appearance of a spectre. </p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The counting of the Sheep in the fold, and the adopted Lambs, are beautiful paintings: and with the
        Triumph of <hi rend="smcaps">Giles</hi> on the conclusion of the Year, and his Address to the <hi rend="smcaps">Deity</hi>, the Book and Poem
        close. </p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Such are the Materials of which THE FARMER’S BOY is constructed. Several of the topics, it will be
        perceiv’d are new to Poetry; and of those which are in their <hi rend="ital">title</hi> familiar to the readers of our descriptive Bards, it
        will be found that the imagery and adjunctive circumstances are original, and the effort of a mind practis’d in the rare art of selecting and
        combining the most striking and picturesque features of an object.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Dr. Drake after this well accounts for the poetic singularity that the Poetry of <hi rend="ital">Thomson
        </hi>should have past through a mind so enthusiastically enamor’d of it, without impairing the originality of its character, when exercis’d on
        a subject so much leading to imitation. This he explains, and justly, by the vivid impressions on a most sensible and powerful imagination in
        his earliest youth, anterior to the study of any Poet.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Dr. <hi rend="smcaps">Drake</hi> expresses his astonishment at the <hi rend="smcaps">Versification</hi>
        and <hi rend="smcaps">Diction</hi> of this Poem. And says most truly, ‘I am well aware that smooth and flowing lines are of easy purchase, and
        the property of almost every poetaster of the day: but the versification of Mr. <hi rend="ital">Bloomfield</hi> is of another character; it
        displays beauties of the most positive kind, and those witcheries of expression which are only to be acquir’d by the united efforts of Genius
        and Study.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <hi rend="ital">general</hi> characteristics of his versification are facility and sweetness; that
        ease which is, in fact, the result of unremitted labour, and one of the most valuable acquisitions of litterature. It displays occasionally
        likewise a vigour and a brilliancy of polish that might endure comparison with the high-wrought texture of the Muse of <hi rend="smcaps"
          >Darwin</hi>.<note n="83" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802), physician, natural philosopher and poet of <title>The

        sparing hand: and it is not one of his least merits that his diction and harmony should so admirably correspond with the scene which he has
        chosen.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">To excel,’ Dr. <hi rend="smcaps">Drake</hi> continues, ‘in rural <hi rend="smcaps">Imagery</hi> it is
        necessary that the Poet should diligently study Nature for <hi rend="ital">himself</hi>; and not peruse her as is but too common, “<hi

          rural sight, each rural sound</hi>,” has Mr. <hi rend="smcaps">Bloomfield</hi> built his charming Poem.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It is a Work which proves how inexhaustible the features of the World we inhabit: how from objects which
        the mass of mankind is daily accustom’d to pass with indifference and neglect, <hi rend="smcaps">Genius</hi> can still produce pictures the
        most fascinating, and of the most interesting tendency. For it is not to <hi rend="ital">imagery </hi>alone, though such as here depicted
        might ensure the meed of Fame, that the Farmer’s Boy will owe its value with us and with posterity. A <hi rend="ital">Morality </hi>the most
          <hi rend="ital">pathetic </hi>and pure, the feelings of a heart alive to all the tenderest duties of humanity and religion, consecrate its
        glowing landscapes, and shed an interest over them, a spirit of devotion, that calm and rational delight which the goodness and greatness of
        the Creator ought ever to inspire.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Dr. <hi rend="smcaps">Drake</hi> confirms, by copious and very judicious <hi rend="ital">Extracts
        </hi>from the various parts of the Poem, as they offer themselves to critical selection, in accompanying the Farmer’s Boy through the Circle
        of his year, the Judgment which he has form’d with so much ability, taste, and feeling, and has so agreeably express’d, of the Merits of our
          <hi rend="smcaps">English Georgic</hi>. And he speaks in his <hi rend="ital">third </hi>and last Essay on it thus:</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘From the review we have now taken of <hi rend="smcaps">The Farmer’s Boy</hi>, it will be evident, I
        think, that owing to its harmony and sweetness of versification, its benevolence of sentiment, and originality of imagery, it is entitled to
        rank very high in the class of descriptive and <hi rend="ital">pastoral </hi>Poetry.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">He concludes with an highly animated and feeling anticipation of that public attention to the Poem and to
        its Author, merited in every view, and which already has manifested itself in such an extent.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I understand there is a Paper on ‘<title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>’ in a Work lately publish’d by Dr. <hi

      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In the <title>Critical Remarks</title> I intended I find myself so much agreeing in sentiment with Dr.
        Drake that I shall attempt little more than merely to offer some few observations. One of these relates to the <hi rend="ital"
          >coincidences</hi> of thought and manner in the Farmer’s Boy with other writings. These, as would previously be expected from what has been
        said, are extremely few indeed. And almost all that are particularly of moment in appreciating the poetical excellences of the Work are most

      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It will be seen, from this minute statement, that the Editor’s emendations were very inconsiderable,
        though most of them appear highly judicious, and many of them absolutely necessary, for the purpose of removing certain grammatical

      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">PREFACE (1809)</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">[In the stereotype <title>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</title>, 1809, Bloomfield heavily revised the
        Preface, removing Lofft’s voice and addressing the reader in his own person, while preserving some of the biographical information from former
        editions. He also introduced new material about the circumstances of the poem’s composition and publication.]</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0"><hi rend="smcaps">Eight</hi> years have elapsed since the first publication of ‘The Farmer’s Boy.’ It now
        assumes, together with the later Poems, a new form; and my friend Mr. Lofft, to whom I am so obviously and so materially indebted for success,
        with great liberality suggests, that a general publication of the works in connection seems to require something of a general Preface adapted
        to the occasion, and coming from myself. But as all that I have written will now be comprised in two volumes, some further remarks will be
        found in my second volume respecting the Tales and Ballads. What is here said relates to the Farmer’s Boy alone. </p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The plain, candid memoir, which has hitherto preceded the Poem, as given by my Brother to Mr. Lofft, has
        interested thousands in my favour, and spared me those painful feelings which must have arisen from a perpetual recurrence of the same
        questions in all companies, and from a perplexing wish to comply with the natural curiosity of strangers. Wherever I have been introduced,
        almost without exception, my history has been previously known, even to the ‘selling of my fiddle,’ and I have immediately been permitted to
        take my seat, and to join the conversation, if I found any thing to say; or to remain silent until I did. And this is no small privilege to a
        man swung at arm’s length into publicity with all his mechanical habits and embarrassments about him. How far such habits are, or ought to be,
        overcome, is a question upon which I have not decided: but I have been sometimes hurt, or amused, at witnessing the evident disappointment of
        such persons as appeared to expect in the writer of Pastoral poetry, and literally a Cow-boy, the brilliancy and the vivacity of polished
        conversation; to which I never had made the slightest pretences.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The memoir above mentioned has not only relieved me personally in many cases, but it has been accompanied
        by remarks from Mr. Lofft as to the promiscuous gifts which God has bestowed on his creatures, without regard to worldly rank, that I am
        confident will redound to the credit of the writer, and which came to the public with a thousand times more power and effect than they could
        have done had I been capable of writing them myself.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Much as I have been benefited by this biographical memoir, and gratified as I have been to find my path
        cleared before me, it would be ungenerous to the purchasers who may obtain this new and cheaper edition, and who may have no previous
        knowledge of the Author’s childhood, wholly to omit a narrative of facts which he himself declares to be of importance, and to carry with it
        an interest both connectedly and peculiarly its own. I will therefore give the substance of that narrative in my Brother’s words, with
        occasional explanations;—and then resume my own tale.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In Nov. 1798, G. B. writing to Mr. Lofft, says: ‘As I spent near five years with the Author, from the
        time he was fourteen years and a half years old till he was turned of twenty, the most interesting time of life (I mean the time that
        instruction is acquired, if acquired at all), I think I am able to give a better account of him than any one can, or than he can of himself:
        for his modesty would not let him speak of his temper, disposition, or morals.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Robert (born Dec. 3d, 1766,) was the younger child of George Bloomfield, a tailor, at Honington.<note
          n="102" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] This Village is between Euston and Troston, and about eight miles N. E. of Bury.
          There are three other sons, George, Nathaniel and Isaac, and two daughters.</note> His father died when he was an infant under a year old.
        His mother, Elizabeth, the daughter of Robert Manby, was born at Brandon, 1736. She was a schoolmistress, and instructed her own children with
        the others. He thus learned to read as soon as he learned to speak.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Though the mother was left a widow with six small children, yet with the help of friends she managed to
        give each of them a little schooling.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Robert was accordingly sent to Mr. Rodwell, of Ixworth, to be improved in writing: but he did not go to
        that school more than two or three months, nor was ever sent to any other; his mother again marrying when Robert was about seven years
        old.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">By her second husband, John Glover, she had another family.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">When Robert was not above eleven years old, the late Mr. W. Austin, of Sapiston,<note n="103"
          place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] The little village adjacent to Honington.</note> took him. And though it is customary for
        farmers to pay such boys only 1s. 6d. per week, yet he generously took him into the house. This relieved his mother of any other expense than
        only of finding him a few things to wear: and this was more than she well knew how to do.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">She wrote therefore to me and my brother Nat (then in London), to assist her; mentioning that Robert was
        so small of his age that Mr. Austin said he was not likely to be able to get his living by hard labour.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The following anecdote must stand in Mr. Lofft’s words, as one of those tender fabrics which it would be
        very easy to spoil, and impossible to mend.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘Mr. G. Bloomfield on this informed his mother that, if she would let him take the boy with him, he would
        take him, and teach him to make shoes: and Nat promised to clothe him. The mother, upon this offer, took coach and came to London, to Mr. G.
        Bloomfield, with the boy: for she said, she never should have been happy if she had not put him herself into his hands.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">“She charged me,” he adds, “<hi rend="ital">as I valued a mother’s blessing, to watch over him, to set
          good examples for him, and never to forget that he had lost his father</hi>”. I religiously confine myself to Mr. G. Bloomfield’s own words;
        and I think I should wrong all the parties concerned, if, in mentioning this pathetic and successful admonition, I were to use any other.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Mr. G. Bloomfield then lived at Mr. Simm’s, No. 7, Pitcher’s-court, Bell-alley, Coleman-street. “It is
        customary,” he continues, “in such houses as are let to poor people in London, to have light garrets fit for mechanics to work in. In the
        garret, where we had two turn-up beds, and five of us worked, I received little Robert.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">As we were all single men, lodgers at a shilling per week each, our beds were coarse, and all things far
        from being clean and snug, like what <hi rend="ital">Robert</hi> had left at Sapiston. <hi rend="ital">Robert</hi> was our man, to fetch all
        things to hand. At noon he fetched our dinners from the cook’s shop: and any one of our fellow workmen that wanted to have any thing fetched
        in, would send him, and assist in his work and teach him, for a recompense for his trouble.</p>

      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">He frequently met with words that he was unacquainted with: of this he often complained. I one day
        happened at a book-stall to see a small dictionary, which had been very ill used. I bought it for him for 4d. By the help of this he in little
        time could read and comprehend the long and beautiful speeches of Burke, Fox, or North.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">One Sunday, after an whole day’s stroll in the country, we by accident went into a dissenting
        meeting-house in the Old Jewry, where a gentleman was lecturing. This man filled little Robert with astonishment. The house was amazingly
        crowded with the most genteel people; and though we were forced to stand still in the aisle, and were much pressed, yet Robert always
        quickened his steps to get into the town on a Sunday evening soon enough to attend this lecture.</p>

        Covent-garden theatre. These are all the opportunities he ever had to learn from public speakers. As to Books, he had to wade through two or
        three Folios: an History of England, British Traveller, and a Geography. But he always read them as a task, or to oblige us who bought them.
        And as they came in sixpenny numbers weekly, he had about as many hours to read as other boys spend in play.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I at that time read the <title>London Magazine</title>; and in that work about two sheets were set apart
        for a Review—Robert seemed always eager to read this review. Here he could see what the literary men were doing, and learn how to judge of the
        merits of the works that come out. And I observed that he always looked at the Poet’s Corner. And one day he repeated a Song which he composed
        to an old tune. I was much surprised that he should make so smooth verses; so I persuaded him to try whether the Editor of our Paper would
        give them a place in Poet’s Corner. And he succeeded, and they were printed. And as I forget his other early productions, I shall copy

      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">“I remember,” says Mr. G. Bloomfield, continuing his Narrative, “a little piece which he called The
        Sailor’s Return:<note n="106" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] This, by a reference to the same papers, I find was entitled
          ‘The Soldier’s Return.’ It has been printed in a former edition of this work. [The full poem was included in the ‘Advertisement’ to the 8th
          edn]</note> in which he tried to describe the feelings of an honest Tar, who, after a long absence, saw his dear native Village first rising
        into view. This too obtain’d a place in the Poet’s Corner. And as he was so young, it shews some genius in him, and some industry, to have
        acquired so much knowledge of the use of words in so little time. Indeed at this time myself and my fellow workmen in the garret began to get
        instructions from him.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">About this time there came a man to lodge at our lodgings that was troubled with fits. Robert was so much
        hurt to see this poor creature drawn into such frightful forms, and to hear his horrid screams, that I was forced to leave the lodging. We
        went to Blue Hart-court, Bell-alley. In our new garret we found a singular character, James Kay, a native of Dundee. He was a middle-aged man,
        of a good understanding, and yet a furious Calvinist. He had many books,—and some which he did not value: such as the Seasons, Paradise Lost,
        and some Novels. These books he lent to Robert; who spent all his leisure hours in reading The Seasons, which he was now capable of reading. I
        never heard him give so much praise to any book as to that.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I think it was in the year 1784 that the question came to be decided between the journeymen shoemakers;
        whether those who had learn’d without serving an apprenticeship could follow the trade?</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The man by whom Robert and I were employ’d, Mr. Chamberlayne, of Cheapside, took an active part against
        the lawful journeymen; and even went so far as to pay off every man that worked for him that had joined their clubs. This so exasperated the
        men, that their acting committee soon looked for unlawful men (as they called them) among Chamberlayne’s workmen.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">A part of the Narrative here naturally turned upon the spiteful and contentious bickerings of men who
        were all angry together; which contentions ultimately forced me from London. At this moment I feel much obliged to them. They treated me with
        a visit to my friends, and a charming holiday; which George thus describes:</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘Robert naturally fond of Peace, and fearful for my personal safety, begged to be suffered to retire from
        the storm.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">He came home; and Mr. Austin kindly bade him take his house for his home till he could return to me. And
        here, with his mind glowing with the fine descriptions of rural scenery which he found in Thomson’s Seasons, he again retraced the very fields
        where first he began to think. Here, free from smoke, the noise, the contention of the city, he imbibed that love of rural simplicity and
        rural innocence, which fitted him, in a great degree, to be the writer of such a thing as “The Farmer’s Boy”.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Here he lived two months:—at length, as the dispute in the trade still remained undecided, Mr. Dudbridge
        offered to take Robert apprentice, to secure him, at all events, from any consequences of the litigation.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The indentures were avowedly for the above purpose only; and, after detailing the transaction, George
        proceeds thus: </p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘When I left London he was turned of twenty and much of my happiness since has arisen from a constant
        correspondence which I have held with him.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">After I left him, he studied music, and was a good player on the violin.<note n="107" place="foot"
          resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] This statement is rather too strongly worded; ‘a good player’ means a great deal, and probably more
          than the writer meant to express. The reader may qualify it with what he pleases.</note></p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">But as my brother Nat had married a Woolwich woman, it happened that Robert took a fancy to Mary-Anne
        Church, a young woman of that town, whose father is a boat-builder in the Government yard there. He married 12th Dec. 1790.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Soon after he married, Robert told me, in a letter, that ‘he had sold his fiddle and got a wife.’ Like
        most poor men, he got a wife first, and had to get household stuff afterward. It took him some time to get out of ready-furnished lodgings. At
        length, by hard working, &amp;c he acquired a bed of his own, and hired the room up one pair of stairs at 14, Bell-alley, Coleman-street. The
        landlord kindly gave him leave to sit and work in the light garret, two pair of stairs higher.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In this garret, amid six or seven other workmen, his active mind employed itself in composing ‘The
        Farmer’s Boy.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In my correspondence I have seen several poetical effusions of his; all of them of a good moral tendency;
        but which he very likely would think do him little credit: on that account I have not preserved them.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Robert is a lady’s shoemaker, and works for Mr. Davies, Lombard-street. He is of a slender make; of about
        five feet four inches high; very dark complexion. His mother, who is a very religious member of the church of England, took all the pains she
        could in his infancy to make him pious: and, as his reason expanded, his love of God and man increased with it. I never knew his fellow for
        mildness of temper and goodness of disposition. And since I left him, universally is he praised by those who know him best, for the best of
        husbands, an indulgent father, and quiet neighbour. He is about thirty-two years old, and has three children’<note n="108" place="foot"

      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The following conclusion of George’s original Narrative I always thought peculiarly happy; and well might
        Mr. Lofft join with him cordially in his prayer, ‘that <hi rend="smcaps">God</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the Giver of thought</hi>, may, as mental
        light spreads, raise up many who will turn a listening ear, and will not despise</p>

        <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">The short and simple annals of the poor’.</l>
      </lg>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Further information was given soon after by my Brother in the following Letter to Mr. Lofft, and in the
        anecdote which closes this part of the history:</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘The late Mr. Austin’s wife was a Manby (my mother’s sister). And it may seem strange that, in “The
        Farmer’s Boy,” <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi> no where calls him Uncle, but Master. The treatment that my brother Robert experienced from Mr.
        Austin did not differ in any respect from the treatment that all the servant boys experienced who lived with him. Mr. Austin was the father of
        fourteen children by my aunt (he never had any other wife). He left a decent provision for the five children that survived him: so that it
        could not be expected he should have any thing to give to poor relations. And I don’t see a possibility of making a difference between <hi
          rend="ital">Giles</hi> and the boys that were not related to Mr. Austin: or he treated all his servants exactly as he did his sons. They all
        worked hard; all lived well. The Duke had not a better man tenant to him than the late Mr. Austin. I saw numbers of the husbandmen in tears
        when he was buried. He was beloved by all who knew him. But I imagine that Robert thought that when he was speaking of Benevolence that was
        universal, he had no occasion to mention the accidental circumstance of his being related to the good man of whom he sung.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">_______</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘I have him in my mind’s eye a little boy; not bigger than boys generally are at twelve years old. When I
        met him and his mother at the inn, he strutted before us, dressed just as he came from keeping sheep, hogs, &amp;c. his shoes filled full of
        stumps in the heels. He looking about him, slipped up—his nails were unused to a flat pavement. I remember viewing him as he scampered up: how
        small he was. Little thought, that little, fatherless boy would be one day known and esteemed by the most learned, the most respected, the
        wisest, and the best men of the kingdom.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">________</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Amongst the anecdotes interspersed in the foregoing Narrative, distinguished for ingenuousness and
        feeling, that which the reader has just seen, if worth correcting in a slight particular, may be done here; and I would not do it but that I
        find the fact, trifling as it may appear to some, has been repeatedly noticed. George states that he received his brother in London, ‘dressed
        just as he came from keeping sheep, hogs, &amp;c.’ Now the strict truth of the case is this; that I came (on the 29th of June, 1781) in my
        Sunday clothes, such as they were; for I well remember the palpitation of my heart on receiving his proposals to come to town, and how
        incessantly I thought of the change I was going to experience: remember well selling my smock frock for a shilling, and slyly washing my best
        hat in the horsepond, to give it a gloss fit to appear in the meridian of London. On entering Whitechapel, riding backwards on the coach, a
        long line of carriages in the centre of the street attracted my particular notice; and I anxiously looked for the principal object in that
        procession of which I conceived them to be a part: little dreaming that they all stood for hire! But these are surely trifling anecdotes; and
        I will endeavour to record something more important.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Taking it then for granted, that my history, so far as it has been stated, is fully and sufficiently
        known, I mean to elucidate a fact or two to which an allusion has been made in the former Preface, so as to throw an additional light on
        subjects which I am persuaded will not be deemed uninteresting by the lovers of literature.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It cannot be forgotten by any one who has thought of my history and success, that Mr. Lofft has said,
        when speaking of the MS. of this Poem, that ‘it had before been shown to some persons in London; whose indifference toward it may probably he
        explained, when it is considered that it came to their hands under no circumstances of adventitious recommendation. With some a person must be
        rich, or titled, or fashionable as a literary name, or at least fashionable in some respect, good or bad, before any thing which he can offer
        will be thought worthy of notice’.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Nothing surely can so effectually illustrate this fact as a plain account of my unsuccessful attempts in
        publicly stating which, on such an occasion as this, I see not the smallest impropriety; as it may teach men in my own station of life not to
        despair, if they feel themselves morally and intellectually worthy of notice; and at the same time teach them not to <hi rend="ital">rely</hi>
        on an untried and brittle support, by throwing away the honourable staff of mechanic independence.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The following papers, which I now transcribe from originals, and copies in my possession, accompanied the
        MS. of ‘The Farmer’s Boy’ to my brother George, at St. Edmund’s Bury, to whom they are addressed. I have endeavoured to arrange them so as to
        make the story as simple and as straight forward as possible.</p>

          [Bloomfield’s note:] The parts of the poem first composed, before any thought was entertained of going through with the Seasons, were the
          morning scene in Spring, beginning ‘This task had <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi>,’ and the description of the lambs at play. And if it be lawful
          for an author to tell his opinion, they have never lost an inch of ground in my estimation from that day to this.</note> I now send the
        Poem, as a present to my Mother. It coming through your hands, you will be at liberty to detain it as long as you please; and I have no doubt
        but some parts of it will please you. I would wish you to observe well the following remarks, and I wish you to be candid if it should ever
        draw any remarks from you.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">When I began it, I thought to myself that I could complete it in a twelvemonth, allowing myself three
        months for each quarter; but I soon found that I could not; and indeed I made it longer than I at first intended. Nine tenths of it were put
        together as I sat at work, where there are usually six of us. No one in the house has any knowledge of what I have employed my thoughts about
        when I did not talk.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I chose to do it in rhime for this reason; because I found always that when I put two or three lines
        together in blank verse, or something that sounded like it, it was ten to one if it stood right when it came to be written down. Winter and
        half of Autumn were done long before I could find leisure to write them. In the ‘Harvest Home’ you will find the essence of letters which you
        wrote formerly to London.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">When I had nearly done it, it came strongly into my mind that very silly things are sometimes printed;
        but by what means I knew not. To try to get at this knowledge, I resolved to make some efforts of that sort; and what encouraged me to go
        through with it was, that, if I got laughed at, no one that I cared for could know it, unless I myself told them. I sometimes thought of
        venturing it into the house of some person above a bookseller; but I never could find impudence enough to do it. So I carried it, accompanied
        with the following letter, to your magazine man. He kept it eight or ten days, and then sent a sober-looking, book faced man back with it,
        sending therewith the little note which follows the letter.</p>

        of the piece, are intimately known. Before I send it away, something persuades me that I might possibly find some person capable, and
        possessing condescension enough to satisfy me in a desire I feel of knowing whether the little piece, particularly the latter half, Autumn and
        Winter, contains any thing like poetical merit; that is to say, to what excellence in others it makes the nearest approaches. I am fully

        it, and was told to go into the compting-house. When I went in, Mr. ******* spoke thus, as nearly as I can recollect:—‘Your poetry, Mr.
        Bloomfield, I am afraid, won’t do for separate publication; unless you can get some person to revise it for you. As you wish to see it
        printed, I think you had better take it to some person who publishes a magazine. I think your wisest way would be to take it to Mr. ******;
        and I have no doubt but he will insert it for you,’ &amp;c.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I left him: and, as I should not like to buy my own rhimes, I did not take his advice. I could wish to
        say more on this subject, but the parcel is waiting for my budget. Pray remember this:—don’t give the book to my Mother, nor to any one else,
        till you hear from me again. </p>

      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0"><hi rend="smcaps">Dear George</hi>,</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I Finished my last rather abruptly for want of time.—If I had given my little piece to Mr. *******, even
        supposing that he would have accepted it, it would then have taken perhaps six months at least, by monthly continuations, before it would all
        have been printed. My chief pride would have been to have sent my Mother <hi rend="ital">a printed copy</hi>; but, at the above rate, one copy
        only would have cost six shillings: I therefore send it as it is. I never wrote it out but once. I have no copy of it, except in my memory.
        You will find the copies of my letters to the parties miserably blotted, they were written in haste: I meant to have transcribed them, but had
        not time.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Having never been instructed in grammar, it may abound in faults of that kind which I am not aware of.
        The management of stops I don’t pretend to. I desired you not to show it for this reason; because I think it would look awkward to give it
        even to my Mother without some kind of introductory letter.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">You will perceive that the information I principally wanted to gain, I could not gain; that is, how to go
        about printing such a thing, and what it would cost. But as I could not send my Mother <hi rend="ital">a printed copy</hi>, I don’t trouble
        myself much to know whether it was want of merit, or want of patronage, that made me fail.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">You say you find pleasure in reading it; perhaps it arises principally from this: you know all the
        situations, circumstances, and persons introduced into it. I wish that pleasure may continue to you, and such of our friends as may happen to
        get hold of it.—All well.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Your affectionate Brother,</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#right"><hi rend="smcaps">Robert Bloomfield</hi></p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Such were the efforts which I found courage enough to make; and here <hi rend="ital">my</hi> efforts
        ended. Not so with my Brother. With the foregoing information in his hands, he asked me by letter whether I had any objection to his showing
        the Poem to his neighbour Mr. Lofft, whom I had never seen, nor of whose readiness to assist the poor or the ignorant had an equal knowledge
        with my Brother, who lived on the spot. I left it to him to do as he proposed, and not to miss so fair a chance of getting a sound critical
        opinion, and that accompanied with feeling and good manners. George immediately carried the Poem to Troston, with the following paper, which I
        now copy from his own hand-writing.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0"><hi rend="ital">To</hi>
        <hi rend="smcaps">Capel Lofft</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Esq.</hi></p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#right">Bury, Nov. 1798.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘<hi rend="smcaps">Sir</hi>,</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Common fame speaks of the willingness that you show in giving your counsel and advice to the poor. This
        benevolent trait in your character has emboldened me to approach you, to petition you to give your opinion on the enclosed piece. I fancy I
        see beauties in it, and was thinking of applying to one of our printers to know, if, from the locality of it, it would pay for printing (for
        ’tis a Suffolk piece); but it struck my mind forcibly, that I should stand a better chance of meeting with that ingenuousness I wish for, by
        begging the opinion of a man of genius and taste, than by applying to a tradesman.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Since I have had the Poem in my hands I have never shown it to any one, nor spoke of it; nor does any one
        here know of this application.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">If, Sir, you will deign to give your opinion, I will never mention your name, unless by your permission.
        This, I hope, will not be deemed an impertinent intrusion; for ’tis the high rank you hold in the literary world prompted me to this, because
        on your judgment I can rely with satisfaction.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Let the result of this be what it may, your petitioner will ever revere your name.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">Your most devoted servant,</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent6"><hi rend="smcaps">George Bloomfield</hi>.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">P. S. The late Mr. Wm. Austin, of Sapiston, took the Author, when very young, and kept him, from motives
        of charity.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The consequences which arose from this application are too well known to be repeated; yet there were
        circumstances attending the progress of the Poem through the press which are not known, but might be made known with honour to all the parties
        concerned.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The first letter I received from Mr. Lofft was to me a cordial not to be described. In others which
        immediately followed I found the ensuing remarks:</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘At the same time the example, as well as the Poem, may teach the rich, and the highly born or educated,
        not unnaturally to urge harsh and overbearing lines of distinction; but to be more attentive to the gifts bestowed by the common Father on
        mankind, than to an overweening conceit of their own privileges and advantages.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Their privileges and advantages would amply gain in good will and security, what they might thus
        sacrifice from the cold and degrading claims of unfeeling ostentation.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">In another letter I read:—</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘It is truly a rural Poem, more so than any with which I am acquainted in our language; except Allan
        Ramsay’s Gentle Shepherd,<note n="110" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Allan Ramsay (1686–1758), the Scots poet who inspired both Burns and
          Bloomfield. <title>The Gentle Shepherd </title>(1725) was a pastoral drama.]</note> and <ref type="m"
          target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BurnsRobert">Burns’</ref> Poems.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The first extract the reader will perceive to be of a nature highly grateful to the feelings of the
        mechanic who had been setting his mind to work as well as his hands; but with the second I felt otherwise; and I remember the feeling with the
        utmost precision. I had been charmed with Ramsey, but knew nothing of Burns, except by trifling quotations and by name.<note n="111"
          place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] It may possibly be acceptable to some readers to know that I had been married six years,
          when, (after weathering the storm of domestic sickness described in the ‘<ref target="editions.2019.bloomfield_poems.21WildFlowersPt3.html#oaktable">Address to my Old Table</ref>’, in Vol. II.,) I began composing this
          Poem, which I find, by comparing dates, happened to be during the last illness of Robert Burns, and about three months before his death. If
          it should be suspected that I mention this with a view of strengthening an apparent approximation to so illustrious an example of intellect
          and poetic excellence, the reader will do a great injustice to me, and to the notions I entertain of his powers, and of his works.</note> I
        believed that my generous, and then only patron, had, in the warmth of his heart, overrated my performance; and I was even then prepared, for
        disappointment.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The printing was now going on, and that I knew little of its progress (which was the case) I have only to
        blame myself. I seldom called to enquire after it. I knew it to be in good hands. Yet, during the fifteen months which elapsed before its
        publication, the latter part of which time was attended by very bad health, I felt much anxiety; and, (having the Poem then perfect in my
        memory,) after a hard day’s work, with my back to the fire, and in the stillness of the night, I have often repeated aloud the whole, or
        greater part of the Poem, until my wife was fast asleep, before I could find resolution to put out the candle. The reader who disdains such
        little anecdotes had better lay down the book; for I shall proceed in my own way.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">At length, in March 1800, my brother Nathaniel (with whom I wish the world was better acquainted) called
        to say that he had seen, in a shop window, a book called The Farmer’s Boy, with a motto. I told him I supposed it must be mine; but I know
        nothing of the motto: and I the more believed it to be mine, having just received through the hands of Mr. Lofft a request to wait on the Duke
        of Grafton, in Piccadilly. I had a very slight personal remembrance of the Duke from my childhood; and I felt as most men would feel in my
        circumstances on a similar occasion.<note n="112" place="foot" resp="editors"> Presumably, Bloomfield has in mind the childhood incident in
          which he went squirrel hunting on the Duke’s land. See <ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.349a.html">Letter 349a</ref>.</note> I met with condescension
        in its noblest features, and even with congratulations; and amongst the conversation was very naturally asked, ‘How I liked the execution of
        the work? Was it not beautifully printed?’&amp;c. I replied, that I had not yet seen it. The Duke himself then brought from the library one of
        the large paper copies, and spread it on the table. <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi> never was so hard put to it in his life to keep his face in
        order as at that moment. At that moment the Preface was <hi rend="ital">as new to me as the Poem was to the world</hi>. I could not read it
        there; but on my return home I saw the high praise which my Brother had given me, and which had been so advantageously laid before the public
        by Mr. Lofft. I thanked them both for having spared me the task of telling my own story, thanked God for his providential interposition, and
        felt my heart at ease.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">And here I trust I shall not be thought guilty of any impropriety in giving, from its immediate relation
        to the foregoing interview, an extract from a book of memorandums which I keep by me;<note n="113" place="foot" resp="editors"> Not found, but
          presumably the basis for the <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/anecdotes.html">‘Anecdotes and
            Observations, Reflections, and Critical Remarks’</ref> from <title>The Remains of Robert Bloomfield</title> (1824).</note> as but a short
        time after the above date I spent a delightful month at Wakefield Lodge, in Whittlebury Forest, Northamptonshire; upon which visit I find
        recorded the following remark:</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘When I was at Wakefield Lodge I conceited that I saw the workmen and neighbours look at me as at an idle
        fellow. I had nothing to do but to read, look at them, and their country and concerns. They did not seem to know how to estimate me. I was not
        a constant companion at the Duke’s table,<note n="114" place="foot" resp="editors"> [Bloomfield’s note:] This was my choice; for it gave me
          the calm enjoyment of liberty in my own way. See ‘<ref target="editions.2019.bloomfield_poems.15RuralTalesPt10.html#whittlebury">Lines written on a Visit to Whittlebury Forest, addressed to my children</ref>.’ Vol. II.</note>
        nor was I much in his company; yet, seeing me noticed with attention by the family, that attention was caught, and dealt out to me at
        second-hand. I sometimes thought of the Spectator when at Sir Roger De Coverly’s, and of the <hi rend="ital">silent gentleman</hi> whom nobody
        knew much about. Six months only before that time I was in sickness and trouble; sometimes two, sometimes three days in a week racked with a
        head-ach that nearly drove me distracted. To lie down almost destitute of the necessaries of life, tortured with pain till I cried out, and
        that pain augmented by the sight of a wife and three children whom I could not help, was certainly a hard trial for my philosophy. The Poem
        became public in two months after, and my first relief was from the hand of the right worthy owner of Wakefield Lodge. What a glorious thing
        is a present of ——— to a man in distress! If hundreds should arise from my writings, I question if hundreds will produce the exquisite
        sweetness of that ———.’</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">From the above date I found, however unfit to meet prosperity, and a total change of company and
        connections, that such a change could not be avoided. I became known to the literary, and esteemed by the good. Sir Charles Bunbury, and many
        worthy characters in Suffolk, gave me the welcome of a friend and a countryman. At Troston, under the hospitable roof of Mr. Lofft, I was
        every way at home. My London and country wellwishers have increased, until to name them would wear the appearance of ostentation, which I much
        wish to avoid. And yet, while I boast in my possession the hand-writing of the late Mr. Fox, I hardly know whether I am justified in
        altogether refraining. Let not then any of them imagine that I have failed to cherish a grateful regard for the zeal and endeavours of them
        all. I write with an overflowing heart: and could I feel otherwise than I do, should unquestionably be unworthy of their attention.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Very trifling emendations have taken place in this Stereotype Edition. One, however, may seem worthy of
        notice. In the description of the Mad Girl I had originally called her <hi rend="ital">Poll</hi>; but on my visit to Suffolk, after an absence
        of twelve years (which gave rise to the Lines that follow this Preface), I learned that her name was <hi rend="ital">Ann</hi>. I conversed
        with her, and found her greatly recovered, and sensible of her past calamity. Instead of giving this information in a note, I have, partly
        from choice, and partly from the nature of the printing, inserted <hi rend="ital">Ann</hi> for <hi rend="ital">Poll</hi> in the text.</p>
      <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I have the gratification to <hi rend="ital">know</hi> that this Poem has given pleasure to thousands, and
        to make a contrary pretence would be something worse than affectation. Upon this conviction I rest my claim (with all due submission to the
        learned) of exhorting all persons of acknowledged taste and ability, when they receive a poor man’s production, to read it with candour, and
        to judge of it with truth: so that, if it be found entitled to a share of public attention, the unlettered and the unfriended may not lose
        their chance of communicating instruction or entertainment to the world.</p>
