            <head>Related to the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title></head>
            <p rend="noCount">This appendix assembles illustrative passages from letters directly related to 
                the composition, reception, and revision of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. 
                The selections appear chronologically and are grouped into five key phases in the <title 
                    level="m">Guide</title>’s history: <ref target="#first">1807–1811</ref> (its origination 
                and initial publication in Wilkinson’s <title level="m">Select Views</title>); 
                <ref target="#second">1820</ref> (its first appearance under Wordsworth’s 
                name in <title level="m">The River Duddon</title>); <ref target="#third">1821–1834</ref> (the 
                text’s evolution into an independent guidebook in the third and fourth editions); 
                <ref target="#fourth">1835–1841</ref> (Wordsworth’s final revisions and the reception 
                of the fifth edition); and <ref target="#fifth">1842–1850</ref> (its reissue in 
                Hudson’s <title level="m">Complete Guide</title> 
                and absorption by the early-Victorian travel book industry).</p>
            <p rend="noCount">These excerpts derive from a number of sources, including original letters held at 
                various repositories. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes, reliable and complete transcriptions 
                of those letters by the Wordsworths may be found in <title level="m">The Letters of William and Dorothy 
                    Wordsworth</title>, 2nd ed., 8 vols. Oxford UP, 1967–93. Throughout our selections, we regularize 
                punctuation, expand abbreviations, and offer slight emendations for the sake of clarity.</p>

                        observations on planting, with which he has been greatly pleased, as they coincide with his 
                        own previous ideas of what <emph>should</emph> be. He recommends to every body to plant 
                        larches on their <emph>high</emph> rocky grounds—and oak, ash, etc. etc. on their richer and 
                        low grounds.</p>

                    2 October 1808</emph></head>
                    <note place="inline" resp="editors">John Pering, vicar of Skipton and Kildwick in North 
                        Yorkshire, toured the Lakes in the summer of 1808 and enjoyed meeting William and Dorothy Wordsworth. 
                        Hoping to enhance his travel journal, he later requested a written description of the local 
                        mountains from the poet. In this friendly reply, Wordsworth offered several reasons for 
                        respectfully declining the request. A copy of Wordsworth’s letter survives in Pering’s manuscript 
                        notebook.</note>
                    <p rend="noCount">I am pleased to find that this beautiful country has made such an impression upon 
                        you as to induce you to record your feelings: but what shall I say to your request that I should 
                        communicate to you some description of the same objects?—Alas! you have but a faint notion how 
                        disagreeable writing, of all Sorts, is to me, except from the impulse of the moment.</p>
                    <p rend="noCount">I must be my own Task master or I can do nothing at all. Last autumn I made a little 
                        Tour, with my wife, and she was very anxious that I should preserve the memory of it by a written 
                        account. I tried to comply with her entreaty, but an insuperable dullness came over me, and I could 
                        make no progress.</p>
                    <p rend="noCount">This simple and true statement I am sure you will deem a sufficient apology for not 
                        venturing upon a theme so boundless as this sublime and beautiful region.</p>
                    <p rend="noCount">Besides, you can easily conceive that objects may be too familiar to a Man, to leave 
                        him the power of describing them. This is the case with me in regard to these Lakes and mountains, 
                        which are my native Country, and among which I have passed the greatest part of my life: and 
                        really I should be utterly at a loss were I about to set myself to a formal delineation of them, 
                        or of any part of them, where to begin, and where to end.</p>

                <div type="letter"><head>3. <emph>Joseph Wilkinson to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, early 
                    June 1809</emph></head>
                    <note place="inline" resp="editors">The only surviving document detailing the negotiations surrounding 
                        the <title level="m">Select Views</title> letterpress, this letter was posted by Wilkinson from his 
                        home in Norfolk to Grasmere, where Coleridge was residing with the Wordsworths. Presumably 
                        overwhelmed with his new periodical, <title level="m">The Friend</title>, Coleridge had 
                        apparently suggested Wordsworth as a potential collaborator for Wilkinson. This letter includes 
                        Wilkinson’s response to Wordsworth’s concerns over <title level="m">Select Views</title> competing 
                        with a similar series by the poet’s artist friend William Green of Ambleside (1725–1811, 
                        <title level="m">DNB</title>). On its dating, see note 26 <!--[link]--> in the introduction to 
                        this edition.</note>
                    <p rend="noCount">I am just returned from Town, where I have been making arrangements for my 
                        publication, and as I have seen some of Mr. Green’s numbers I will be obliged to you if you will 
                        tell our friend Wordsworth—that no two works, descriptive of the same country can be more 
                        different, or less likely to interfere with each other, than his and mine. But I shall write 
                        to Mr. Wordsworth in a few days more fully upon the subject when I hope either Mr.  W.—or 
                        yourself, or both, will afford me the assistance I shall explain, to enable me to make my work 
                        more perfect and acceptable to the public than it otherwise would be.</p>

                <div type="letter"><head>4. <emph>DW to Catherine Clarkson, 18 November 1809</emph></head>
                    <note place="inline" resp="editors">Catherine Clarkson, wife of the prominent abolitionist 
                        Thomas Clarkson (1760–1846, <title level="m">DNB</title>), was one of Dorothy’s closest 
                        friends. The Clarksons lived in the Lake District from 1796 to 1806, during which time 
                        they became intimates of the Wordsworths, but now they had moved back to the south of 
                        England. Dorothy here praises William’s introduction to <title level="m">Select Views</title> 
                        and reports that he is considering publishing his own guidebook apart from Wilkinson, 
                        predicting that a guidebook will prove more lucrative than her brother’s poetry. The letter 
                        reveals various details about the textual history of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, 
                        including that Sara Hutchinson sometimes acted as scribe for the project and that Wordsworth 
                        was awaiting proofs of Wilkinson’s prints before setting out on the “descriptions” part of 
                        his assignment.</note>
                    <p rend="noCount">Sara has been kept almost constantly busy in transcribing: for William, 
                        and for ‘The Friend’; therefore she has desired me to write to you. For William she has 
                        been transcribing the introduction to a collection of prints to be published by Mr. 
                        Wilkinson of Thetford (of which I believe you know the history as your husband’s name is 
                        down among those of the subscribers). I hope you will be interested with William’s part 
                        of the work (he has only finished the general introduction, being unable to do the rest 
                        till he has seen the prints). It is the only regular and I may say <emph>scientific</emph> 
                        account of the present and past state and appearance of the country that has yet appeared. 
                        I think, if he were to write a Guide to the Lakes and prefix this preface, it would sell 
                        better, and bring him more money than any of his higher labours. He has some thoughts of 
                        doing this; but do not mention it, as Mr. W[ilkinson]’s work should have its fair run. He 
                        mentioned to Mr. Wilkinson his scheme, to which I should think that Mr. W. will have no 
                        objection; as the Guide will, by calling Mr. W.’s publication to mind, after its first 
                        run, perhaps help to keep up the sale.</p></div>

                    <note place="inline" resp="editors">This is the most commonly cited letter related to <title 
                        level="m">Select Views</title>, largely because it contains Wordsworth’s private complaints 
                        about Wilkinson’s drawings. It begins with his estimate of the best features of his introduction 
                        and an explanation of his rhetorical aims before moving on to dismiss Wilkinson’s artwork. Sir 
                        George (1753–1827, <title level="m">DNB</title>) and Lady Margaret Beaumont were important 
                        patrons of the arts, and Sir George was an amateur landscape painter himself.</note>
                    <p rend="noCount">I am very happy that you have read the Introduction with so much pleasure, and 
                        must thank you for your kindness in telling me of it. I thought the part about the Cottages 
                        well-done; and also liked a sentence where I transport the Reader to the top of one of the 
                        Mountains, or rather to the Cloud chosen for his station, and give a sketch of the impressions 
                        which the Country might be supposed to make on a feeling mind, contemplating its appearance 
                        before it was inhabited. But what I wished to accomplish was to give a model of the manner in 
                        which topographical descriptions ought to be executed, in order to their being either useful or 
                        intelligible, by evolving truly and distinctly one appearance from another. In this I think I have 
                        not wholly failed.</p>
                    <ab rend="center">[ . . . ]</ab>
                    <p rend="noCount">The drawings, or Etchings, or whatever they may be called, are, I know[?], such as 
                        to you and Sir George must be intolerable. You will receive from them that sort of disgust which 
                        I do from bad Poetry, a disgust which can never be felt in its full strength, but by those who 
                        are practised in an art, as well as Amateurs of it. I took Sir George’s subscription as a 
                        kindness done to myself; and Wilkinson though not superabundant in good sense told me that he saw 
                        it in that light. I do however sincerely hope that the Author and his Wife (who certainly, 
                        notwithstanding her faults and foibles, is no ordinary Woman) may be spared any mortification from 
                        hearing them condemned severely by acknowledged judges. They will please many who in all the arts 
                        are most taken with what is most worthless. I do not mean that there is not in simple unadulterated 
                        minds a sense of the beautiful and sublime in art; but into the hands of few such do prints or 
                        picture fall.</p>

                            Convention of Cintra</title> was a political pamphlet published by Wordsworth in 1809. 
                            Concerning it, Reed wrote (in the May letter mentioned by the poet), “I was not less 
                            surprised than delighted in finding so much more of permanent and universal interest than 
                            I had any reason to look for in a work professedly of an <emph>occasional</emph> character. 
                            I cannot better convey the impression it has made on my mind than by saying that I cherish 
                            it with the same feeling as the poems, and therefore is it that I am anxious to see them 
                            conjoined. No reader, who duly appreciates the latter, can fail to perceive that the Tract 
                            is rich in the same elements of thought and feeling.”</note> and I think myself with some 
                        interest upon its being reprinted hereafter, along with my other writings. . . . It was I repeat 
                        gratifying to me that you should have spoken of that work as you do, and particularly that you

                        <emph>Body</emph> of the Tourist, as I found that the Guide Books which attended mainly to this 
                        were preferred much, by the generality of Tourists, to mine, which, though in fact containing 
                        as much of this sort of matter as could be of any real use, appeared to be wanting in this 
                        respect. The employment to which I had by a sort of promise committed myself I found upon 
                        further consideration to be very troublesome and

                        pecuniary emolument, for that was quite trifling, but for the principles of Taste which it 
                        recommended, I turned all that I had written over to Mr. Hudson the Publisher, stipulating only 
                        that all that related to <emph>mind</emph>, should in my book be printed entire and separated 
                        from other matter, and so it now stands. Every thing of mine will be reprinted, but the 
                        <emph>guide matter</emph> of mine will be interwoven with what Mr. Hudson has undertaken to write 
                        or compile, the whole however before struck off to be submitted to my approbation. Mr. Gough of

                            to Prof. Sedgwick in answer to a Letter from him, pressing him to prepare the essay as soon as 
                            he could; which I have no doubt he will do.—Any thing I have to say, had better be reserved for 
                            a brief advertisement. I am truly sorry to have disdained your proof as mentioned; but will 
                            take care the like shall not occur in future. The introduction is well planned and I wish you

                        <p rend="noCount">I snatch a moment from the hurry of this place to thank you for the first of 
                            the Series of Letters on the Geology of the Lake district which you have done me the honor 
                            of addressing to me. I received it yesterday from Mr. Danby,<note place="foot" 
                                resp="editors">F. C. Danby of Kendal. With Wordsworth’s approval, Hudson and Nicholson 
                                had first approached Sedgwick though this mutual acquaintance.</note> liked it very 
                            much, and am impatient for the rest. It will give the Kendal lake Book so decided a 
                            superiority over every other, that the Publishers have good reason to rejoice. I am happy 
                            to think that my endeavours to illustrate the beautiful Region may be thought not unworthy 
                            of accompanying your scientific researches. I address this to you at random, but hope it will 
                            be forwarded should you be no longer at Cambridge.</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">You perhaps don’t remember that the Pocket Hammerers were complained of not by 
                            me in my own person, but in the character of a splenetic Recluse; I will, however, frankly own 
                            that to a certain extent I <emph>sympathized</emph> with my imaginary personage, but I am sure 
                            I need not define for you how far, but no farther, I went along with him. Geology and 
                            <emph>Minerology</emph>  are very different things.</p>
