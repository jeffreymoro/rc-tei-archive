               <h2><span class="head">2nd Edition (2020)</span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Since this <em>Romantic Circles</em> edition of William Wordsworth’s <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> first appeared in July 2015, our ongoing research has yielded enough new discoveries
                  and insights about the text’s complex origins, publication history, and afterlives
                  as to necessitate, in our minds, a revised second edition. While several resources
                  remain largely unchanged—notably our fully annotated, illustrated text of the 1835
                  edition and the bibliographic, cartographic, and textual tools for studying the <em>Guide</em>—we have significantly reworked, extended, and, in some cases, corrected our earlier
                  account of the essay’s origins, composition, and initial publication. The most significant
                  changes to the critical apparatus come in our introduction, which incorporates several
                  important findings, and a new appendix offering the most detailed study to date of
                  the <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.serialpublication.html">serial publication of <em>Select Views</em></a>. We have also added a new section featuring high-resolution scans of Wordsworth’s
                  <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/letterpress_gallery">1810 letterpress</a> and silently corrected minor transcription and labeling errors in our earlier edition.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2">
               <h2><span class="head">1st Edition (2015)</span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">First published in 1810 and repeatedly revised by its author over the ensuing 25 years,
                  Wordsworth’s <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> has long been considered a crucial text for scholars of Romantic-era aesthetics,
                  ecology, travel writing, and tourism. Though the fifth edition of 1835 (the last revised
                  by Wordsworth) has remained available in reprints and scholarly editions, earlier
                  editions of the <em>Guide</em> continue to be scarce. This is particularly true of the original 1810 version, which
                  appeared as an anonymous prose supplement to a set of Lake District sketches by the
                  Rev. Joseph Wilkinson.
               </p>
               <p class="noCount">This new digital edition therefore aims to provide scholars, students, and general
                  readers easy and open access to key editions of the <em>Guide</em> from Wordsworth’s lifetime, including full scans of Wilkinson’s 1810 sketches and
                  Wordsworth’s 1810 and 1835 texts. Accompanying these primary works is an extensive
                  scholarly apparatus, including a historical and textual introduction to the <em>Guide</em>; detailed hypertext notes on Wordsworth’s essay; an annotated bibliography of previous
                  scholarly editions and criticism on the <em>Guide</em>; and excerpts from letters by Wordsworth and his circle addressing the work’s production,
                  reception, and revision.
               </p>
               <p class="noCount">Taking advantage of digital technologies, we have also included a parallel-text chart
                  tracking Wordsworth’s sequential revisions over five editions between 1810 and 1835;
                  dozens of maps, engravings, and photographs of the Lakes; and a geo-tracking feature
                  that allows readers to pinpoint locations discussed in the <em>Guide</em> with the click of a mouse. All told, then, this site combines the traditional features
                  of a serious scholarly edition with digital tools that offer a fresh, and hopefully
                  fuller, experience with one of Wordsworth’s most illuminating, challenging, and compelling
                  works.

            <p class="noCount">Numerous students, colleagues, Wordsworth scholars, and enthusiasts have lent their
               time, talents, and expertise to this edition. Emily Young and Rachel Wise, who were
               then remarkable BYU undergraduates, helped launch our research and transcriptions
               in 2011 and 2012. At <em>Romantic Circles</em>, Dave Rettenmaier has provided technical expertise and design savvy from the beginning;
               Tilar Mazzeo shepherded our 2015 edition from proposal to release; Michele Speitz
               spearheaded the publication of this 2019 version; and Neil Fraistat, Steven Jones,
               Orrin Wang, and Paul Youngquist have offered unwavering support at the executive level.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">At our home campus, BYU, the English Department, Office of Digital Humanities, and
               Center for the Study of Europe provided generous financial support for research and
               travel, and a university Mentoring Environment Grant allowed us to hire student collaborators
               and take them on a week-long research trip to the Lake District.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">For years of enthusiastic support and expert responses to obscure queries, special
               gratitude is in order for Jeff Cowton, MBE, head curator at the Wordsworth Trust.
               Dating to a memorable afternoon in the Jerwood Centre during the spring of 2011, Jeff’s
               generosity has not only yielded more authoritative editions but also institutional
               partnerships that have enriched hundreds of lives at BYU. Warm thanks also to the
               Wordsworth Trust’s assistant curators, Rebecca Turner and Melissa Mitchell, for cheerful,
               timely assistance with countless queries sent from Provo to Grasmere over the better
               part of a decade.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">Others who have been especially generous with their time, resources, and expertise
               include Ed Vermue, special collections and preservation librarian of the Oberlin College
               Library, who provided the high-resolution scan of <em>Smith’s New and Accurate Map of the Lakes</em> (1800); Maggie Kopp and Russ Taylor, special collections librarians at BYU who facilitated
               access to early editions of the <em>Guide</em> and many other key resources; Joel Silver of the Lilly Library at Indiana University,
               who supplied high-resolution scans of the 1810 <em>Select Views</em>; Patrick Vincent of the University of Neuchâtel and Bernhard Jenny of Oregon State
               University, who helped us along the trail of the Pfyffer terrain relief; Mark L. Reed,
               emeritus professor of English from the University of North Carolina, whose generosity,
               unrivalled knowledge, and bibliographic expertise saved us from countless potential
               errors; Elisabeth Fairman, chief curator of rare books and manuscripts at the Yale
               Center for British Art, who spent an afternoon helping us study the FitzRoy copy of
               <em>Select Views</em>; James Baker, Matthew Crowther, and, especially, John Ford, who generously offered
               their published and unpublished research on and vast knowledge of Rudolph Ackermann;
               Sarah Barlow, a BYU student who voluntarily assisted with illustrations and permissions;
               John Talbot, our departmental colleague and resident Latinist; Jean-Robert Durbin
               of the Huntington Library’s Rare Book Department; John Mustain, rare books librarian
               at Stanford University; Emma Darbyshire of the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge; and
