                <p rend="noCount">The editions below are ideal resources for scholarship but can be difficult to access
                    outside research libraries. For readers seeking an inexpensive, portable edition of
                    the <title level="m">Guide</title>, several options exist. At present, the most
                    readily available version is a 2004 reprint of Ernest de Sélincourt’s edition
                    (London: Frances Lincoln) with a preface by Stephen Gill.</p>

            <p rend="noCount">In this first attempt to assemble all of Wordsworth’s prose writings, the arrangement
                is thematic. The text of the 1835 <title level="m">Guide</title> appears in vol. 2,
                “Aesthetical and Literary” works, under the subcategory of “Descriptive” writing,
                accompanied by Wordsworth’s letters on the Kendal and Windermere Railway. This
                edition has no footnotes besides Wordsworth’s own and offers just seven “Notes and
                Illustrations” at the volume’s end. Essentially, then, it offers only a clean
                reading text, but it sets a precedent for more thorough scholarly treatments.

           Building on the work of Grosart, Knight produces a chronological edition of
                Wordsworth’s prose writings. Volume 2 begins with the <title level="m">Guide</title>,
                for which Knight prefers the earlier title, <title level="m">Description of the
                    Scenery of the Lakes</title>. Using the 1835 edition as his copy text, Knight
                annotates the work with basic information on the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s
                textual history and references to relevant passages in Wordsworth’s poetry. As such,
                Knight’s is the first in a line of scholarly editions that runs through de
                Sélincourt through Owen and Smyser to the current electronic edition.

                historical materials (maps, title page facsimiles, etc.) and photographs that add
                visual and cultural interest. Bicknell’s introduction reviews the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s textual history and helpfully situates the work within the history

            <p rend="noCount">In this authoritative biography, Gill shows that the <title level="m">Guide</title> was
                a work long in the making. Though reluctantly begun, it became a project in which
                Wordsworth was deeply invested, and Gill suggests its aesthetic value has been
                underappreciated in contemporary scholarship. Gill also suggests an autobiographical
                component of the <title level="m">Guide</title>, noting how Wordsworth uses his birth
                year (1770) as the moment at which the Lake District and its culture began quickly
                deteriorating. </p></item>

            <p rend="noCount">This bibliography and its companion (below) are invaluable for tracing Wordsworth’s
                sources. Wu lists in chronological order books read by Wordsworth from childhood
                until the time of his move to Dove Cottage. Among these are many books referenced in
                the <title level="m">Guide</title>. Wu shows that Wordsworth’s interest in travel
                literature dates back at least to his days at Hawkshead School. </p></item>

                mountainous prospect; a very interestingly picturesque description of the
                disposition and effect of the cottages in the vales; and more particularly of the

                little five shilling duodecimo, (Longman,) an Essay on the Scenery of the North of
                England. It is, as might have been anticipated, full of fine feeling and fine
                philosophy. He analizes the country, and shews all the sources of the pleasure which
                it is peculiarly fitted to yield the enlightened and thoughtful mind. But after all,
                the best book to read (we are not now speaking of Guides) before, during, and after
                a Tour of the Lakes, is <hi rendition="#smcaps">The Lyrical Ballads</hi>” (87).</p></item>

                Briggs insinuates that the poet has stolen it from the “old dalelander.”</p></item>

            <p rend="noCount">In the midst of this rambling essay on British cottages, Wilson inserts a few remarks
                on the <title level="m">Guide</title>. “Instead of a guide,” he writes, Wordsworth
                “presented the world with a treatise on the picturesque, the sublime, and the
                beautiful. It is needless to say, that his treatise overflows with fine and true
                thoughts and observations; nor does any man living better understand, or more deeply
                feel, the characteristic qualities of the scenery of Westmoreland. Yet it is
                somewhat heavy, even as a philosophical essay.” He goes on to opine that such guides
                are perhaps best written by non-natives of a region, who might offer a more
                “impartial and reasonable work” (264).</p></item>

                beautiful and poetical descriptions, wandered for a whole morning among the scenery
                which has been his inspiration, and to which he has repaid its influences and
                associations tenfold, whether in his noble poems, or the less ambitious volume
                before us. For ourselves, we owe him not a few thanks for compelling us to pause in
                the dullest of our labours, and carrying us away, though only for an hour, to the

                side glances into the very heart of those familiar things ‘that border the highway’”
                (xvi). Knight describes many features of the book and appreciatively quotes long
                passages, concluding that “there is no finer delineation of the district, except in
                his own poetry” (xvii).</p></item>

                inhabitants of the Dales, with their homesteads and manner of living.” In this
                respect, it is “quite a model, and probably the most accurate and interesting thing
                of the kind ever written.” He concludes his section on the <title level="m">Guide
                </title>by speculating on the economic impact of Wordsworth’s writing on the region:
                “there is not an inn or small farmhouse in all the Lake Country which does not reap

                Brooke begins by contrasting the relative detachment of Gray’s guide to the Lake
                District with the passion of Wordsworth’s. From there he traces how Wordsworth’s

                practical” (225). Campbell’s main concern, though, is bibliographical, as he
                corrects compilers who fail to recognize that such poems as “Long Meg and Her

                Scenery of the Lakes” (xii). This, he says, contains “Perhaps, on the whole, the

                with authority and logic. She admires his intricate knowledge of the area and his

                Compared with the ornate word-sketches in Rawnsley’s <title level="m">Months at the

                Wordsworth’s original aesthetic and moral ideas. While its main procedure is to move
                readers from the familiar to the new, it “never quite overcomes the traditions of
                the picturesque” (35). </p></item>

            <p rend="noCount">Written to accompany an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, this book
                (assembled with the assistance of Robert Woof and Peter Bicknell) explores the
                “public life” of the Lake District from the eighteenth century to the present. Pages
                77–91 treat Wordsworth specifically, with one short section, “Wordsworth as Guide,”
                arguing not only that the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> “became the
                standard work on the visual qualities of the Lake District” (80), but, more
                importantly, that it inaugurated a crucial shift “from critical pictorialism to a
                sense of responsibility for [the landscape’s] right development and careful
                conservation” (80). This shift would become decisive in English culture. In
                connection with this discussion, the authors also foreground Wordsworth’s interests
                in landscape design and gardening, urging readers not to overlook “this side of
                Wordsworth’s nature,” which so clearly drove the ethics of the <title level="m">Guide</title>.</p></item>

            <p rend="noCount">Davies argues that Wordsworth’s opinions on forestry in general and larches in

                subject about which I find myself in complete disagreement with Wordsworth. I enjoy
                the larch greatly, and can only suppose that he had seen none but immature
                specimens, and in those close plantations which are necessary for economic forestry”

                <p rend="noCount">In her chapter on “Archeologies,” Kelley argues that Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> privileges two aesthetic arguments. First, Wordsworth
                endorses the Coleridgean definition of beauty as “Multeity in Unity.” Second, and
                more radically, he suggests that the beautiful is a natural progression and
                completion of the sublime. Kelley argues that Wordsworth’s reckoning of sublimity as
                inherently deficient, primordial, and precursory to the beautiful is evident in the
                way he stratifies the topography and history of the Lake District. This
                stratification, according to Kelley, reflects Wordsworth’s attempts to map out the
                workings of his own imagination. </p></item>

            <p rend="noCount">Roberts’s essay considers the importance of John Brown, an influential

                Wordsworth. The article focuses specifically on Brown’s posthumously published poem
                “Night Scene in the Vale of Keswick,” which was first published in 1776 and
                subsequently reprinted in the 1835 edition of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. Roberts suggests that while Brown likely found his poem unsuitable
                for publication because of its suppressed romantic quality, the poem provided a
                seminal “modern” description of mountain scenery that inspired writers like Thomas
                Gray and Wordsworth. In fact, Robert asserts that both Gray and Wordsworth attempted

                Wordsworth. In its pedestrian sensibility, it anticipates Wainwright’s books for
                fell-walkers. While, like earlier writers in the picturesque tradition, Wordsworth
                privileges valley “views” and “prospects,” he offers a new sense of immersion, a
                feeling for the walker’s route, and a willingness to celebrate hard-earned views

            <p rend="noCount">All of Wordsworth’s Lake District writing, Carlson argues, reflects and inflects key
                developments in the picturesque representation of the Lakes. In particular, his work
                shows how such representation became increasingly multi-medial, incorporating maps,
                engravings, poems, diagrams, and other tools to define and materialize British
                terrain. Depicting the British landscape cartographically became linked with
                describing it in poetic meter. It is no coincidence, Carlson notes, that
                Wordsworth’s poetry records some of the first cultural responses to the Ordnance
                Survey of Britain, nor that his own <title level="m">Guide</title> came to incorporate
                many different materials “as if they were comparable visual aids to the experience
                of landscape” (88). In fact, Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> influenced
                the next generation of tour books, which worked to merge art, literature, travel,
                and science.</p></item>

                that resonate with writings of other “traveler-scientists.” His interest in the <title level="m">Guide</title> is part of Smethurst’s larger exploration of how

            <p rend="noCount">Porter’s essay describes the evolving discipline of topography and its management of
                competing genres, linked variously with the modern discourses of feeling and fact.
                Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> enters the essay in its final section,
                serving as a case study of topography’s development. Porter traces the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s transformation through its various editions,
                highlighting Wordsworth’s attempts to reconcile discourses that often competed with
                one another. Ultimately, the edition of 1835 “enhanced the text’s relationship to
                picturesque aesthetics while subsuming (but carefully maintaining) its alignment
                with the representational techniques of physical geography” (175). If
                nineteenth-century poets of place and readers of like spirit preferred the language
                of personal observation and response, Porter argues, they also found authority and
                practical value in the new topography.</p></item></list>

            <p rend="noCount">In his final chapter, “Rash Assault: Nature and the Nature of Tourism,” Ousby turns
                to the Lake District to study how “nature” has come to function as “a necessary
                refuge, a source of spiritual renewal” (101). Paradoxically, he remarks, the very
                tourists who visit places like the Lakes for spiritual sustenance often destroy what
                they cherish; Wordsworth himself famously took up these questions. Of the <title level="m">Guide</title> specifically, Ousby writes that, although it was far
                from the first guidebook of its kind, it made earlier efforts seem unliterary and
                incomplete in comparison. Moreover, the <title level="m">Guide</title> cemented
                Wordsworth’s status as a “Lake Poet,” embodying what was finally his greatest impact
                on tourism—namely, the invention of a literary landscape inseparable from the poet’s
                life and work.</p></item>

            <p rend="noCount">Buzard’s chapter on “Tourist and Traveller” helps explain how Wordsworth could both
                complain about tourists and write guidebooks for them. Travel literature dealt in
                anti-tourist rhetoric from the start, Buzard contends, because the “tourist” was the
                (supposedly) less cultured, less sophisticated person against whom a true
                “traveller” could define himself. When Wordsworth directed his guidebook to “the <title level="m">Minds</title> of Persons of taste,” he was seeking “readers who would
                live up to the calling of true travellers” (30). Such sensitive beings could visit
                the Lake District without desecrating it. In this context, Buzard describes the <title level="m">Guide</title> as an example of the “anti-guidebook” genre. Buzard
                concludes that Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> lost much of its
                idiosyncratic flavor when incorporated into Hudson’s <title level="m">Complete
                    Guide</title> of 1842. By that time, travel books based on individual authority
                were beginning to seem obsolete, as the age of the comprehensive Baedecker and
                Murray handbooks had arrived.</p></item>

                Lake District and ensures that those tourists who read his guidebook will
                vicariously experience the region through his perspective. Ultimately, Labbe
                concludes, Wordsworth wants to create an “undifferentiated Nature, undisturbed by
                detail,” in order to reinforce his self-appointed position as the leading guide to
                the region.</p></item>

                “Wordsworth’s aerial picture must have done much to fix the idea of a ‘district’ in
                people’s minds” (100). While the Lakeland was popular before Wordsworth wrote his
                    <title level="m">Guide</title>, Wordsworth helped tourists conceive of the area
                “as a distinct entity, separate from those bits of its constituent counties that did

                runs throughout Wordsworth’s oeuvre, Thomas suggests that readers consult the text
                in which Wordsworth most explicitly assumes the role of guide, the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>, for clues about the poet’s thoughts on the subject.
                Thomas elaborates especially on Wordsworth’s aim to guide the <title level="m">minds</title> of his readers. Wordsworth’s authority derives from intimate local
                knowledge, but even more so from habits of observation and reflection.</p></item>

                Crummock Water and Brothers Water—might have been influenced by the imaginary tour
                of the Lakes that Southey included in <title level="m">Letters from England</title>
                (1807). Although there is no definitive proof that Wordsworth read Southey’s volume,

                <p rend="noCount">Gill examines points of textual similarity between the poetry and prose in the
                       1820 <title level="m">River Duddon</title> volume, suggesting that, while the volume
                is a miscellany, it is also unified in the sense that it “both literally and
                metaphorically begins and ends in the Lake District” (25). Notably, Gill argues that
                “Topographical Description” extends and enhances Wordsworth’s poetical vision as
                presented in the <title level="m">River Duddon</title> poems. Gill frames his argument
                within the context of the rise of tourism and the critical reception of the Lake

            <p rend="noCount">Carlson proposes that guidebooks, by quoting illustrative snippets of blank verse,
                helped bring about the Romantic-era naturalization and nationalization of blank
                verse as a lyric form. Whereas other tour writers borrowed poetic descriptions of
                different locales—say, from Milton or Thomson—and applied them to Lake District
                features, Wordsworth included poetry that presented itself as autochthonous. Carlson
                shows how Wordsworth’s quotations in the <title level="m">Guide</title> (1) translate
                the ideas and objects described into the register of individual experience, (2)
                demonstrate “the mind’s penetration by images,” (3) serve as illustrations or
                “verse-pictures,” and (4) institute pauses for contemplation, halting the reader’s
                movement as if enforcing visual attention.</p></item>

            <p rend="noCount">For Fulford, Wordsworth’s later work “was neither an escape from history as New
                Historicist critics argued in the 1980s, nor, on any simple level, an ecological
                poetry, as eco-critics suggested in the 1990s, but a topographic writing allied with
                guidebooks and local histories, and preoccupied with the landscape as a place marked
                by the deeds of past Britons—a historicized nationalism” (7). Fulford mentions the
                <title level="m">Guide</title> in this context, contending also that the book in
                its various editions shows Wordsworth taking advantage of new trends in publishing
                and meeting the demands of late-Romantic and Victorian audiences. </p></item></list>
