               <p>William Wordsworth’s experience writing and publishing the original 1810 version of
                  the <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> was unlike any other of his sixty-year literary career. As detailed in our <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#section3">introduction</a>, much of this episode’s uniqueness stemmed from his serving as the de facto ghost
                  writer for Joseph Wilkinson’s <em>Select Views in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire</em>. Not only did this arrangement curtail his customary liberty to choose his own subject
                  matter and set his own deadlines, but it also left Wordsworth largely disenfranchised
                  in matters of when, in what format, and for what audience his work would appear. Unsurprisingly,
                  then, the famously independent writer quickly came to regret having accepted the <em>Select Views</em> commission, and his correspondence from 1810 frequently bemoans having yoked himself
                  to so “intolerable” an artist and his “drawings, or Etchings, or whatever they may
                  be called.”

               <p>While Wilkinson served as a convenient scapegoat, the poet’s aggravations can largely
                  be attributed to his unfamiliarity with, and ultimate unfitness for, the conventions
                  of publishing a series of art prints. Prior to <em>Select Views</em>, Wordsworth had been deeply, even obsessively, involved in the publication of seven
                  editions of his verse and one of his prose.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           then, he had published seven editions of verse: An Evening Walk (1793), Descriptive
                           Sketches (1793), four editions of Lyrical Ballads (1798, 1800, 1802, and 1805), and
                           Poems, in Two Volumes (1807).</span></div>
                  </div> But all of these experiences occurred in the specific fiscal context of the English
                  book trade, where editing, typesetting, advertising, and other upfront costs were
                  sufficiently low (albeit far from insignificant) that the established publisher or
                  genteel author of the early Romantic age could generally afford to underwrite a new
                  title in hopes of recouping the investment or even turning a profit upon its release.

                           the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But, as James Raven and Michael Gamer have
                           shown, literary historians have typically overestimated its prevalence. Raven’s and
                           Gamer’s respective surveys suggest only 2–4% of eighteenth-century literary titles
                           in Britain were published by subscription. See Raven, The Business of Books: Booksellers

                  </div> Publishers of prints, however—who were largely distinct from specialists in books—faced
                  much steeper upfront costs and were therefore considerably more reluctant to risk
                  a title’s completely flopping. Although series of collectible engravings had always
                  been a luxury good, prices reached historic highs (even adjusting for inflation) in
                  the early nineteenth century. By 1810, nearly two decades of war with France had exacerbated
                  ongoing paper and labor shortages; and breakthrough, cost-cutting technologies like
                  lithography and wood-based papermaking would not permeate the British market until
                  the 1820s and 1830s. Meanwhile, burgeoning European and North American demand for
                  art prints had triggered spikes in engravers’ fees, especially at the upper reaches
                  of the market. While rates varied widely by region and in accordance with a print’s
                  size and level of detail, elite London engravers could charge £15 or more for folio
                  plates in 1810. Prices might easily double when working from pencil sketches like
                  Wilkinson’s, as capturing subtle variations in shading and line weight necessitated
                  the use of labor-intensive soft-ground etching techniques.

                           of engraving remains largely underexplored. John Ford’s recent study, Rudolph Ackermann
                           and the Regency World (Sussex: Warnham Books, 2018), records Ackermann paying £5 per
                           plate (£4 for engraving and £1 for each copper plate) for the eighty images in A History
                           of the University of Oxford (1814). These engravings, however, were half as large
                           as those in Select Views (quarto vs. folio) and would not have required soft-groun…</span></div>

                           known to have sold 815 sets of The History of the Abbey Church at St. Peter’s, Westminster
                           (1812) and 703 of A History of the University of Oxford (1814) (Ford, Rudolph Ackermann,
                           143). Given that these were among the firm’s most popular and heavily marketed series
                           of the early 1810s, a print run of 100–200 copies for the considerably more obscure
                           Select Views seems roughly commensurate. Second, fewer than forty copies of the 1810
                           Select Views are known to survive in university libraries and other archives (World…</span></div>
                  </div> If the circulation was, in fact, this low, Wilkinson almost certainly would have been
                  required to subsidize his vanity project with personal funds. Even if, hypothetically,
                  the engraver, W. F. Wells, offered the bargain rate of £15 per plate for folio-sized
                  soft-ground etchings, total charges for the forty-eight engravings would have been
                  £720. In such a scenario, Wilkinson would therefore have needed to sell 115 sets at
                  the advertised price of 10s.6d. per installment (or £6.6s. for all twelve numbers)
                  just to pay the engravers’ bill. And, judging from Ackermann’s ledgers for similar
                  series, engraving expenses may well have accounted for under one-third of total production
                  costs for <em>Select Views</em>.

                           of the University of Oxford, about two-thirds of the £6.6s. collected for each copy
                           of Select Views likely went toward paper (roughly £1.10s. per copy), plate printing
                           (£1), letterpress printing (£1), and postage and booksellers’ fees (£1) (Rudolph Ackermann,
                           143). Factoring in Wordsworth’s and Ackermann’s fees and miscellaneous expenses, Wilkinson
                           may well have needed to sell 400 or more sets just to break even.</span></div>

               <p>Unfortunately, no Ackermann ledgers are known to survive for 1809–11, when, presumably,
                  most expenditures or revenues from <em>Select Views</em> would have been logged. The firm’s extant payments book that begins in January 1812,
                  however, records four disbursements to Wilkinson between the start of 1812 and February
                  1813 totaling £217.15s.

                  </div> Without supplemental data from earlier payment books, these details obviously reveal
                  little about the series’ overall circulation or profitability. They do, however, clarify
                  that, like most vanity publications, <em>Select Views</em> was almost certainly produced at the financial risk of the author rather than the
                  publisher. Had the series been underwritten by Ackermann, any disbursements to Wilkinson
                  would in all probability have occurred either at the point of contract (1809) or upon
                  receipt of the final sketches and letterpress (1810). Presuming, then, that the series
                  was published at Wilkinson’s expense, these sizeable, and likely final, remittances
                  represented not profits but partial reimbursements made upon receipt of late-arriving
                  subscriber fees in 1812 and early 1813.

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>By most indications, the Wilkinsons were relatively affluent but not so wealthy as
                  to be able to spend hundreds of pounds on a passion project without feeling the effects.
                  Presumably, then, in contracting with Ackermann rather than self-publishing, the artist
                  calculated that any added expenses would be counterbalanced by the London firm’s expertise,
                  distribution networks, and increasingly prestigious imprimatur. Even before retaining
                  Ackermann—or, for that matter, an engraver or letterpress writer—Wilkinson worked
                  to secure enough subscriptions to keep the undertaking from proving financially ruinous.
                  His first calls for subscribers appeared in November 1808, roughly six months before
                  he made arrangements with Wells, Ackermann, and Wordsworth and over a year before
                  the first number of <em>Select Views</em> appeared.

               <p>Besides publishing by subscription, another conventional safeguard Wilkinson embraced
                  was serializing the set across an entire calendar year. On the first day of each month
                  of 1810, subscribers to <em>Select Views</em> received installments typically consisting of four prints and several letterpress
                  pages. Each number arrived in wrappers listing the month’s contents, reprinting the
                  series’ prospectus, and reminding purchasers that “Ten Shillings and Sixpence each
                  Number” were “to be paid for on Delivery” (figs. 1 and 2). For those financing projects
                  like <em>Select Views</em>, this mode of distribution had obvious appeal, as it allowed them to spread production
                  costs over an entire year and start recouping their investment when subscribers began
                  making monthly payments upon receipt of the first installment.

                           to pay in monthly installments. Sticker-shock was a real possibility, as, according
                           to the Economic History Association’s comparative price calculator, the 2019 equivalent
                           of Select Views’ £6.6s price-tag is roughly £440 (or $550). For further details on

                  </div> Another clear benefit of this method was the extended window it afforded contributors
                  to complete their assigned tasks. At the outset, the plan for <em>Select Views</em> was for Wilkinson to submit his finished sketches to Wells, who would then, as he
                  completed his etchings, send proofs to Wordsworth in Grasmere. As detailed in <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#para19">paras. 19–23</a> of our general introduction, this process quickly broke down; but, at least in theory,
                  the idea was for Wordsworth to receive proofs early enough to key the “Descriptions”
                  in his letterpress to specific drawings (fig. 3 below).

                           many sloppily misspelled the names of the artist (e.g., Wilkenson, Wikinson, etc.)
                           and publisher (Akermann, Akerman, Ackerman). </span></div>

               <p>No discernible logic governs the orders in which the printed engravings were originally
                  serialized or later reorganized in the table of contents included in the series’ final
                  installment. The ordering of Wordsworth’s contributions was, by contrast, relatively
                  straightforward, as his 
                  “Introduction,”
                   
                  “Section I,”
                   and 
                  “Section II”
                   were serialized, paginated, and later bound in the exact sequence in which he wrote
                  and submitted them. Less certainty, however, has surrounded precisely when specific
                  page ranges of his letterpress first appeared in serial numbers. Part of the confusion
                  is owing to a 10 May 1810 letter in which the poet informs Lady Beaumont, “I am very
                  happy that you have read the Introduction [to <em>Select Views</em>] with so much pleasure, and must thank you for your kindness in telling me of it.”

               <p>Such a timeline, however, is contradicted by a <em>sui generis</em>, and generally overlooked, copy of <em>Select Views</em> at the Yale Center for British Art. Originally owned by Wilkinson’s Thetford neighbors
                  the “Ladies FitzRoy” of Euston Hall, this is the only known set where all twelve monthly
                  numbers were never removed from their original shipping wrappers. Consequently, this
                  set allows us for the first time to pinpoint the serialization schedule for every
                  plate and letterpress page in <em>Select Views</em>. As revealed by the unopened installments and detailed in the <a class="link_ref" href="#chronotable" title="">table that ends this appendix</a>, the first seven monthly shipments (January through July) brought four Wilkinson
                  prints and four consecutive pages of Wordsworth’s 
                  “Introduction.”

                           the “Ladies FitzRoy’s” ownership (e.g., Fig. 1). The ladies in question were presumably
                           the wife (Anne) and daughter (Georgiana) of Augustus FitzRoy (1735–1811, DNB), the
                           3rd Duke of Grafton and former Prime Minister (1768–70).</span></div>
                  </div> The first departure from this norm came in August, when subscribers received the final
                  six pages of Wordsworth’s introductory section, only three prints, and a note from
                  Wilkinson explaining that a fourth print was delayed due to “an Accident to the Plate
                  of Furness Abbey” (fig. 4). In light of these details, it becomes clear that if, in
                  fact, it was the full text of Wordsworth’s 
                  “Introduction”
                   that Lady Beaumont read “with so much pleasure” in early May, it must have been in
                  manuscript rather than published form. For, as the FitzRoy set demonstrates, only
                  twenty pages had been published by 1 May and another three months would pass before
                  all thirty-four pages of the 
                  “Introduction”
                   would be available in print.

               <p>The FitzRoy copy at Yale also shows that, while Wilkinson’s two-page dedication shipped
                  with the January number, his title and contents pages were, in keeping with custom,
                  withheld until the last installment of December. As for the hodge-podge of “descriptions”
                  Wordsworth—with considerable assistance from his sister, Dorothy—begrudgingly wrote
                  after completing his 
                  “Introduction,”
                   the two-page-long 
                  “Section I”

                  “Section II”
                   in October, and—following the conspicuous absence of letterpress pages in November—the
                  concluding six pages of 
                  “Section II”
                   in December.

               <p>More generally, this remarkable set at Yale suggests the diverse motivations, not
                  always grounded in aesthetic taste, that could impel well-heeled Britons to subscribe
                  to such a series. While we know little about Wilkinson’s relationship with the FitzRoys,
                  that no member of their household deigned to open even a single installment of <em>Select Views</em> suggests their subscription owed more to neighborly duty or noblesse oblige than to
                  heartfelt admiration for the rector’s art. Oddly, though, despite the family’s apparent
                  apathy toward Wilkinson’s drawings, they went a step beyond subscribing, arranging
                  to have all forty-eight plates hand-colored before leaving Ackermann’s shop.

                           colorists consisting of British women and émigrés from revolutionary France (Antony

               <p>In the run-up to publication, advertisements for <em>Select Views</em> warned that the series would either be unavailable or would cost considerably more
                  after the subscriber deadline. This proved a bluff, as in coming years Ackermann advertised
                  leftover sets “in boards” for the same £6.6s. paid by original subscribers.

                  </div> Even that price may have proven too high, though, as deeply discounted second-hand
                  copies began showing up in estate-sale advertisements and book catalogues by the mid-1810s.
                  In 1816, for instance, the Newcastle bookseller Emerson Charnley advertised two used
                  sets of <em>Select Views</em>, one “elegantly half-bound in Russia” leather for £3.13s.6d and another still sewn
                  in its original wrappers for £3.3s. A year later, Richard Priestley of London shaved
                  an additional 30% off the original price, offering a pre-owned set for £2.12s.6d.
                  In ensuing decades, not even increasing awareness of Wordsworth’s connection to <em>Select Views</em> could check this trend, as second-hand sets in boards went for £1.1s. in 1837 and
                  10s.6d. in 1851. This depreciation continued into the early twentieth century, when
                  bound copies were advertised for 12s. in 1903 and 18s. in 1917.

                  </div> Testifying, however, to the ongoing vagaries of the antiquarian book market, surviving
                  copies of <em>Select Views</em> have since regained their value and then some. At this writing in early 2020, online
                  dealers are asking £45 for individual Wilkinson prints from a dissembled copy of <em>Select Views</em>, £1,200 for a bound copy of his 1821 reprint, and £1,800 for an 1810 set still in
                  boards. Presumably, much of this surge in prices can be chalked up to Wordsworth’s
                  enduring importance in literary studies and the increased scarcity brought on by university
                  libraries scooping up and locking away many of the copies that come up for sale.

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Wordsworth’s first prose book, <em>The Convention of Cintra</em>, appeared in May 1809. Before then, he had published seven editions of verse: <em>An Evening Walk</em> (1793), <em>Descriptive Sketches</em> (1793), four editions of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798, 1800, 1802, and 1805), and <em>Poems, in Two Volumes</em> (1807).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Publishing by subscription, of course, remained an option for literary titles during
               the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But, as James Raven and Michael Gamer have
               shown, literary historians have typically overestimated its prevalence. Raven’s and
               Gamer’s respective surveys suggest only 2–4% of eighteenth-century literary titles
               in Britain were published by subscription. See Raven, <em>The Business of Books: Booksellers and the English Book Trade, 1450–1850</em> (New Haven: Yale UP, 2007), 316, and Gamer, <em>Romanticism, Self-Canonization, and the Business of Poetry</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2017), 76–79.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">On soft-ground etching, see Antony Griffiths, <em>Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques</em> (Berkeley: U of California P, 1996), 97–99. The economics of engraving remains largely
               underexplored. John Ford’s recent study, <em>Rudolph Ackermann and the Regency World</em> (Sussex: Warnham Books, 2018), records Ackermann paying £5 per plate (£4 for engraving
               and £1 for each copper plate) for the eighty images in <em>A History of the University of Oxford</em> (1814). These engravings, however, were half as large as those in <em>Select Views</em> (quarto vs. folio) and would not have required soft-ground etching. See also G. E.
               Bentley’s <em>William Blake in the Desolate Market</em> (McGill-Queen’s UP, 2014), which offers a plethora of details regarding engraving
               pricing in general and Blake’s fees in particular. Bentley’s chart on “Blake’s earnings
               as a commercial engraver” (Table 1.3, pp. 18–29) shows that for fifty-two engravings—all
               relatively small and none soft-ground etchings—completed between 1800 and 1809, Blake
               received on average £12.5s. per plate. In or around 1813, Blake received £42 for a
               larger, quarto-sized engraving of Thomas Phillips’s portrait of 
               “The Right Honourable Earl Spencer.”

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">This admittedly tenuous estimate is based on two data points. First, Ackermann is
               known to have sold 815 sets of <em>The History of the Abbey Church at St. Peter’s, Westminster</em> (1812) and 703 of <em>A History of the University of Oxford</em> (1814) (Ford, <em>Rudolph Ackermann</em>, 143). Given that these were among the firm’s most popular and heavily marketed series
               of the early 1810s, a print run of 100–200 copies for the considerably more obscure
               <em>Select Views</em> seems roughly commensurate. Second, fewer than forty copies of the 1810 <em>Select Views</em> are known to survive in university libraries and other archives (WorldCat lists twenty-seven
               copies, and the Wordsworth Trust owns seven more). If roughly as many sets are housed
               in personal collections, the total of surviving copies would fall well short of one
               hundred.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Extrapolating from Ford’s itemized list of Ackermann’s production costs for <em>The History of the University of Oxford</em>, about two-thirds of the £6.6s. collected for each copy of <em>Select Views</em> likely went toward paper (roughly £1.10s. per copy), plate printing (£1), letterpress
               printing (£1), and postage and booksellers’ fees (£1) (<em>Rudolph Ackermann</em>, 143). Factoring in Wordsworth’s and Ackermann’s fees and miscellaneous expenses,
               Wilkinson may well have needed to sell 400 or more sets just to break even.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Ackermann’s ledgers are archived at Coutts Bank, which rarely grants access to historical
               financial records. Our knowledge of these details is therefore owing to the meticulous
               research and generosity of John Ford. His unpublished transcriptions of Ackermann’s
               payment books show the following four entries from 1812 and 1813:
