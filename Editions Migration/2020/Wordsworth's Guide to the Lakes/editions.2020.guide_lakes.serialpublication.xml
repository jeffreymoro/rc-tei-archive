        <p>Our aim is to produce a thoroughly annotated and contextualized edition of Wordsworth's
          "Guide" that will prove useful to students, researchers, and the general public. Our
          edition will feature complete transcriptions of each iteration of the Guide and highlight
          key variants across the five editions Wordsworth oversaw during his lifetime. We will also
          include extensive background information on the Guide including annotations for obscure
          terms, references, and literary allusions as well as maps and photographs of key locations
          in England's Lake District. We hope also to include high-resolution scans of the rarely
          seen Joseph Wilkinson sketches that inspired the Guide‟s original composition.</p>

        <p>William Wordsworth’s experience writing and publishing the original 1810 version of the
            <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> was unlike any other of his sixty-year
          literary career. As detailed in our <ref
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#section3"
            >introduction</ref>, much of this episode’s uniqueness stemmed from his serving as the
          de facto ghost writer for Joseph Wilkinson’s <title level="m">Select Views in Cumberland,
            Westmoreland, and Lancashire</title>. Not only did this arrangement curtail his
          customary liberty to choose his own subject matter and set his own deadlines, but it also
          left Wordsworth largely disenfranchised in matters of when, in what format, and for what
          audience his work would appear. Unsurprisingly, then, the famously independent writer
          quickly came to regret having accepted the <title level="m">Select Views</title>
          commission, and his correspondence from 1810 frequently bemoans having yoked himself to so
          “intolerable” an artist and his “drawings, or Etchings, or whatever they may be called.”

        <p>While Wilkinson served as a convenient scapegoat, the poet’s aggravations can largely be
          attributed to his unfamiliarity with, and ultimate unfitness for, the conventions of
          publishing a series of art prints. Prior to <title level="m">Select Views</title>,
          Wordsworth had been deeply, even obsessively, involved in the publication of seven
          editions of his verse and one of his prose.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth’s
            first prose book, <title level="m">The Convention of Cintra</title>, appeared in May
            1809. Before then, he had published seven editions of verse: <title level="m">An Evening
              Walk</title> (1793), <title level="m">Descriptive Sketches</title> (1793), four
            editions of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798, 1800, 1802, and 1805), and
              <title level="m">Poems, in Two Volumes</title> (1807).</note> But all of these
          experiences occurred in the specific fiscal context of the English book trade, where
          editing, typesetting, advertising, and other upfront costs were sufficiently low (albeit
          far from insignificant) that the established publisher or genteel author of the early
          Romantic age could generally afford to underwrite a new title in hopes of recouping the
          investment or even turning a profit upon its release.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
            >Publishing by subscription, of course, remained an option for literary titles during
            the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But, as James Raven and Michael Gamer have
            shown, literary historians have typically overestimated its prevalence. Raven’s and
            Gamer’s respective surveys suggest only 2–4% of eighteenth-century literary titles in
            Britain were published by subscription. See Raven, <title level="m">The Business of
              Books: Booksellers and the English Book Trade, 1450–1850</title> (New Haven: Yale
            UP, 2007), 316, and Gamer, <title level="m">Romanticism,
              Self-Canonization, and the Business of Poetry</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2017), 76–79.</note> 
          Publishers of prints, however&#8212;who were largely
          distinct from specialists in books&#8212;faced much steeper upfront costs and were
          therefore considerably more reluctant to risk a title’s completely flopping. Although
          series of collectible engravings had always been a luxury good, prices reached historic
          highs (even adjusting for inflation) in the early nineteenth century. By 1810, nearly two
          decades of war with France had exacerbated ongoing paper and labor shortages; and
          breakthrough, cost-cutting technologies like lithography and wood-based papermaking would
          not permeate the British market until the 1820s and 1830s. Meanwhile, burgeoning European
          and North American demand for art prints had triggered spikes in engravers’ fees,
          especially at the upper reaches of the market. While rates varied widely by region and in
          accordance with a print’s size and level of detail, elite London engravers could charge
          £15 or more for folio plates in 1810. Prices might easily double when working from pencil
          sketches like Wilkinson’s, as capturing subtle variations in shading and line weight
          necessitated the use of labor-intensive soft-ground etching techniques.<note place="foot"
            resp="editors">On soft-ground etching, see Antony Griffiths, <title level="m">Prints and
              Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques</title> (Berkeley:
            U of California P, 1996), 97–99. The economics of engraving remains largely
            underexplored. John Ford’s recent study, <title level="m">Rudolph Ackermann and the
              Regency World</title> (Sussex: Warnham Books, 2018), records Ackermann paying £5 per
            plate (£4 for engraving and £1 for each copper plate) for the eighty images in <title
              level="m">A History of the University of Oxford</title> (1814). These engravings,
            however, were half as large as those in <title level="m">Select Views</title> (quarto
            vs. folio) and would not have required soft-ground etching. See also G. E. Bentley’s
              <title level="m">William Blake in the Desolate Market</title> (McGill-Queen’s UP, 2014),
            which offers a plethora of details regarding engraving pricing
            in general and Blake’s fees in particular. Bentley’s chart on “Blake’s earnings as a
            commercial engraver” (Table 1.3, pp. 18–29) shows that for fifty-two
            engravings&#8212;all relatively small and none soft-ground etchings&#8212;completed
            between 1800 and 1809, Blake received on average £12.5s. per plate. In or around 1813,
            Blake received £42 for a larger, quarto-sized engraving of Thomas Phillips’s portrait of
              <title level="a">The Right Honourable Earl Spencer.</title></note>
        </p>
        <p>No surviving documents record total sales of the 1810 <title level="m">Select
          Views</title>, but circumstantial evidence suggests a small print run of 200 or fewer copies.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This admittedly tenuous estimate is based on
            two data points. First, Ackermann is known to have sold 815 sets of <title level="m">The
              History of the Abbey Church at St. Peter’s, Westminster</title> (1812) and 703 of
              <title level="m">A History of the University of Oxford</title> (1814) (Ford, <title
              level="m">Rudolph Ackermann</title>, 143). Given that these were among the firm’s most
            popular and heavily marketed series of the early 1810s, a print run of 100–200 copies
            for the considerably more obscure <title level="m">Select Views</title> seems roughly
            commensurate. Second, fewer than forty copies of the 1810 <title level="m">Select
              Views</title> are known to survive in university libraries and other archives
            (WorldCat lists twenty-seven copies, and the Wordsworth Trust owns seven more). If
            roughly as many sets are housed in personal collections, the total of surviving copies
            would fall well short of one hundred.</note> If the circulation was, in fact, this low,
          Wilkinson almost certainly would have been required to subsidize his vanity
          project with personal funds. Even if, hypothetically, the engraver, W. F. Wells, offered
          the bargain rate of £15 per plate for folio-sized soft-ground etchings, total charges for
          the forty-eight engravings would have been £720. In such a scenario, Wilkinson would
          therefore have needed to sell 115 sets at the advertised price of 10s.6d. per installment
          (or £6.6s. for all twelve numbers) just to pay the engravers’ bill. And, judging from
          Ackermann’s ledgers for similar series, engraving expenses may well have accounted for
          under one-third of total production costs for <title level="m">Select Views</title>.<note
            place="foot" resp="editors"> Extrapolating from Ford’s itemized list of Ackermann’s
            production costs for <title level="m">The History of the University of Oxford</title>,
            about two-thirds of the £6.6s. collected for each copy of <title level="m">Select
              Views</title> likely went toward paper (roughly £1.10s. per copy), plate printing
            (£1), letterpress printing (£1), and postage and booksellers’ fees (£1) (<title
              level="m">Rudolph Ackermann</title>, 143). Factoring in Wordsworth’s and Ackermann’s
            fees and miscellaneous expenses, Wilkinson may well have needed to sell 400 or more sets
            just to break even. </note></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, no Ackermann ledgers are known to survive for 1809–11, when, presumably,
          most expenditures or revenues from <title level="m">Select Views</title> would have been
          logged. The firm’s extant payments book that begins in January 1812, however, records four
          disbursements to Wilkinson between the start of 1812 and February 1813 totaling £217.15s.<note
            place="foot" resp="editors">Ackermann’s ledgers are archived at Coutts Bank, which
            rarely grants access to historical financial records. Our knowledge of these details is
            therefore owing to the meticulous research and generosity of John Ford. His unpublished
            transcriptions of Ackermann’s payment books show the following four entries from 1812

            </table> Our thanks also go to James Baker and Matthew Crowther for sharing their
            research into Ackermann’s finances in private correspondence and through their
            respective websites, <ref
              target="https://cradledincaricature.com/2013/05/04/the-ackermann-ledgers-at-coutts/"

                Window</title></ref>. </note> Without supplemental data from earlier payment books,
          these details obviously reveal little about the series’ overall circulation or
          profitability. They do, however, clarify that, like most vanity publications, <title
            level="m">Select Views</title> was almost certainly produced at the financial risk of
          the author rather than the publisher. Had the series been underwritten by Ackermann, any
          disbursements to Wilkinson would in all probability have occurred either at the point of
          contract (1809) or upon receipt of the final sketches and letterpress (1810). Presuming,
          then, that the series was published at Wilkinson’s expense, these sizeable, and likely
          final, remittances represented not profits but partial reimbursements made upon receipt of
          late-arriving subscriber fees in 1812 and early 1813.</p>
        <p>By most indications, the Wilkinsons were relatively affluent but not so wealthy as to be
          able to spend hundreds of pounds on a passion project without feeling the effects.
          Presumably, then, in contracting with Ackermann rather than self-publishing, the artist
          calculated that any added expenses would be counterbalanced by the London firm’s
          expertise, distribution networks, and increasingly prestigious imprimatur. Even before
          retaining Ackermann&#8212;or, for that matter, an engraver or letterpress
          writer&#8212;Wilkinson worked to secure enough subscriptions to keep the undertaking from
          proving financially ruinous. His first calls for subscribers appeared in November 1808,
          roughly six months before he made arrangements with Wells, Ackermann, and Wordsworth and
          over a year before the first number of <title level="m">Select Views</title>
            appeared.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See para. 9 and fig. 3 of the <ref

        </p>
        <p>Besides publishing by subscription, another conventional safeguard Wilkinson embraced was
          serializing the set across an entire calendar year. On the first day of each month of
          1810, subscribers to <title level="m">Select Views</title> received installments typically
          consisting of four prints and several letterpress pages. Each number arrived in wrappers
          listing the month’s contents, reprinting the series’ prospectus, and reminding purchasers
          that “Ten Shillings and Sixpence each Number” were “to be paid for on Delivery” (figs. 1
          and 2). For those financing projects like <title level="m">Select Views</title>,
          this mode of distribution had obvious appeal, as it allowed them to spread production
          costs over an entire year and start recouping their investment when subscribers began
          making monthly payments upon receipt of the first installment.<note place="foot"
            resp="editors">Serial publication also allowed subscribers feeling the pinch of so
            expensive a purchase to pay in monthly installments. Sticker-shock was a real

              Poetry</title>, 75–80. </note> Another clear benefit of this method was the extended
          window it afforded contributors to complete their assigned tasks. At the outset, the plan
          for <title level="m">Select Views</title> was for Wilkinson to submit his finished
          sketches to Wells, who would then, as he completed his etchings, send proofs to Wordsworth
          in Grasmere. As detailed in <ref
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#para19"
            >paras. 19–23</ref> of our general introduction, this process quickly broke down; but,
          at least in theory, the idea was for Wordsworth to receive proofs early enough to key the
          “Descriptions” in his letterpress to specific drawings (fig. 3 below).<note place="foot"
            resp="editors">The Wordsworth Trust owns a complete set of engraver’s proofs
            (2010.18.2), which shows that at this stage the large script titles for specific images
            had not yet been etched onto the plates. Several proofs also omitted the scheduled month
            of publication, and many sloppily misspelled the names of the artist (e.g., Wilkenson,
            Wikinson, etc.) and publisher (Akermann, Akerman, Ackerman). </note>

        <p>No discernible logic governs the orders in which the printed engravings were originally
          serialized or later reorganized in the table of contents included in the series’ final
          installment. The ordering of Wordsworth’s contributions was, by contrast, relatively
          straightforward, as his <title level="a">Introduction,</title>
          <title level="a">Section I,</title> and <title level="a">Section II</title> were
          serialized, paginated, and later bound in the exact sequence in which he wrote and
          submitted them. Less certainty, however, has surrounded precisely when specific page
          ranges of his letterpress first appeared in serial numbers. Part of the confusion is owing
          to a 10 May 1810 letter in which the poet informs Lady Beaumont, “I am very happy that you
          have read the Introduction [to <title level="m">Select Views</title>] with so much
          pleasure, and must thank you for your kindness in telling me of it.”<note place="foot"

              >Appendix C</ref>). </note> This has understandably led many scholars to assume all
          thirty-four printed pages of Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Introduction</title> had been
          serialized by the beginning of May.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for instance,

        <p>Such a timeline, however, is contradicted by a <emph>sui generis</emph>, and generally
          overlooked, copy of <title level="m">Select Views</title> at the Yale Center for British
          Art. Originally owned by Wilkinson’s Thetford neighbors the “Ladies FitzRoy” of Euston
          Hall, this is the only known set where all twelve monthly numbers were never removed from
          their original shipping wrappers. Consequently, this set allows us for the first time to
          pinpoint the serialization schedule for every plate and letterpress page in <title
            level="m">Select Views</title>. As revealed by the unopened installments and detailed in
          the <ref target="#chronotable">table that ends this appendix</ref>, the first seven monthly shipments (January through
          July) brought four Wilkinson prints and four consecutive pages of Wordsworth’s <title
            level="a">Introduction.</title><note place="foot" resp="editors">Most of the wrappers in
            this copy (YCBA, Folio A 5188) bear a handwritten note of the “Ladies FitzRoy’s”
            ownership (e.g., Fig. 1). The ladies in question were presumably the wife (Anne) and
            daughter (Georgiana) of Augustus FitzRoy (1735–1811, <title level="m">DNB</title>), the 3rd Duke of Grafton and former
            Prime Minister (1768–70). </note> The first departure from this norm came in August,
          when subscribers received the final six pages of Wordsworth’s introductory section, only
          three prints, and a note from Wilkinson explaining that a fourth print was delayed due to
          “an Accident to the Plate of Furness Abbey” (fig. 4). In light of these details, it
          becomes clear that if, in fact, it was the full text of Wordsworth’s <title level="a"
            >Introduction</title> that Lady Beaumont read “with so much pleasure” in early May, it
          must have been in manuscript rather than published form. For, as the FitzRoy set
          demonstrates, only twenty pages had been published by 1 May and another three months would
          pass before all thirty-four pages of the <title level="a">Introduction</title> would be
          available in print. <figure>

        <p>The FitzRoy copy at Yale also shows that, while Wilkinson’s two-page dedication shipped
          with the January number, his title and contents pages were, in keeping with custom,
          withheld until the last installment of December. As for the hodge-podge of “descriptions”
          Wordsworth&#8212;with considerable assistance from his sister, Dorothy&#8212;begrudgingly
          wrote after completing his <title level="a">Introduction,</title> the two-page-long <title
            level="a">Section I</title> appeared in September, the first four pages of <title
            level="a">Section II</title> in October, and&#8212;following the conspicuous absence of
          letterpress pages in November&#8212;the concluding six pages of <title level="a">Section
            II</title> in December.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For details on Wordsworth’s
            dilatory composition of Sections I and II, see <ref

              >paras. 18–23</ref> of our introduction. Sending the title and contents pages with the
            final installment was a conventional way to avoid reprinting front matter if the
            contents changed during serialization (Griffiths, <title level="m">The Print Before
              Photography</title>, 359–61).</note></p>
        <p>More generally, this remarkable set at Yale suggests the diverse motivations, not always
          grounded in aesthetic taste, that could impel well-heeled Britons to subscribe to such a
          series. While we know little about Wilkinson’s relationship with the FitzRoys, that no
          member of their household deigned to open even a single installment of <title level="m"
            >Select Views</title> suggests their subscription owed more to neighborly duty or
          noblesse oblige than to heartfelt admiration for the rector’s art. Oddly, though, despite
          the family’s apparent apathy toward Wilkinson’s drawings, they went a step beyond
          subscribing, arranging to have all forty-eight plates hand-colored before leaving
          Ackermann’s shop.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Another expertly colored copy of <title
              level="m">Select Views</title> can be seen at the Wordsworth Trust. While added
            expense and some collectors’ aversion to altering originals kept this practice
            relatively rare, Ackermann is said to have retained a team of specialized colorists
            consisting of British women and émigrés from revolutionary France (Antony Griffiths,
              <title level="m">The Print Before Photography</title>, 144–154, esp. 147). </note></p>
        <p>In the run-up to publication, advertisements for <title level="m">Select Views</title> warned that the series
          would either be unavailable or would cost considerably more after the subscriber deadline.
          This proved a bluff, as in coming years Ackermann advertised leftover sets “in boards” for
          the same £6.6s. paid by original subscribers. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See, e.g., Ackermann’s stock
            lists in the end pages of <title level="m">Naples and the Campagna Felice</title> (London: Ackermann, 1815) and the
            <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> for April 1815.</note> Even that price may have proven too high, though, as
          deeply discounted second-hand copies began showing up in estate-sale advertisements and
          book catalogues by the mid-1810s. In 1816, for instance, the Newcastle bookseller Emerson
          Charnley advertised two used sets of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, one “elegantly half-bound in Russia”
          leather for £3.13s.6d and another still sewn in its original wrappers for £3.3s. A year
          later, Richard Priestley of London shaved an additional 30% off the original price,
          offering a pre-owned set for £2.12s.6d. In ensuing decades, not even increasing awareness
          of Wordsworth’s connection to <title level="m">Select Views</title> could check this trend, as second-hand sets in
          boards went for £1.1s. in 1837 and 10s.6d. in 1851. This depreciation continued into the early
          twentieth century, when bound copies were advertised for 12s. in 1903 and 18s. in 1917.<note place="foot"

              Records</title>, vol. 14 (London: Karslake, 1917), p. 38.</note> Testifying, however, to the ongoing
          vagaries of the antiquarian book market, surviving copies of <title level="m">Select Views</title> have since
          regained their value and then some. At this writing in early 2020, online dealers are
          asking £45 for individual Wilkinson prints from a dissembled copy of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, £1,200
          for a bound copy of his 1821 reprint, and £1,800 for an 1810 set still in boards.
          Presumably, much of this surge in prices can be chalked up to Wordsworth’s enduring
          importance in literary studies and the increased scarcity brought on by university
          libraries scooping up and locking away many of the copies that come up for sale.</p>
