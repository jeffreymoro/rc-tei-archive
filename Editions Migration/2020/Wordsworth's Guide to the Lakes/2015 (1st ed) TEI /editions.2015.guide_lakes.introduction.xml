                    <p> In the two centuries since its initial publication, Wordsworth’s <title
                        level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (as it has generally come to be
                        known<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As detailed later in this
                        introduction, Wordsworth’s essay on the Lakes appeared under various titles
                        before he published it as <title level="m">A Guide through the District of
                            the Lakes in the North of England</title> in 1835. In 1842, when
                        Wordsworth’s 1835 text was republished alongside Adam Sedgwick’s geological
                        studies of the region, the collection was titled <title level="m">A Complete
                            Guide to the Lakes</title>. This shorthand title became more firmly
                        fixed with the publication of Ernest De Sélincourt’s <title level="m"
                            >Wordsworth’s Guide to the Lakes</title> (London: Henry Frowde, 1906),
                        the edition that continues to be the most widely used version of the text.
                        Keeping with convention, then, the present edition generally refers to the
                        text as the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes </title>(or simply the
                            <title level="m">Guide</title>).</note>) has attracted its share of
                    enthusiasts. One of the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s earliest admirers was
                    John Wilson, the one-time Wordsworth disciple who, through his bully pulpit at
                        <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title>, became one of
                    late-Romantic-era Britain’s most influential critics. In a series of <title
                        level="j">Blackwood’s</title>essays from the 1820s, Wilson variously
                    described the <title level="m">Guide</title> as “singular and striking,” “full
                    of fine feeling and fine philosophy,” and “by far the best specimen of the prose
                    style of Wordsworth which has ever been given to the world.”<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> “Wordsworth’s River Duddon,” <title level="j">Blackwood’s
                            Edinburgh Magazine</title> 7 (May 1820): 213; “Green’s Guide to the
                        Lakes,” <title level="m">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title> 12 (July
                        1822): 87.</note> A half century later, Matthew Arnold recounted how
                    Wordsworth once told him of a clergyman who asked “if he had ever written
                    anything besides the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. Yes, he
                    answered modestly, he had written verses.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        (London: Macmillan, 1879), vi.</note> In much the same vein, Arnold’s
                    contemporary Andrew James Symington speculated that there was “not an inn or
                    small farmhouse” mentioned in the <title level="m">Guide </title>“which does not
                    reap in hard coin the results.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        Blackie and Son, 1881), 2:54.</note> And in 1906, as the <title level="m"
                        >Guide</title> approached its century mark, the twenty-four-year-old
                    Virginia Woolf dubbed it a “happily permanent friend” and its author a “calm
                    authority” who “has all the courtesy and consideration of an old inhabitant who
                    does the honours of the place to a stranger.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Virginia Woolf, “Then and Now, 1906,” <title level="j">Times Literary
                            Supplement</title>, 15 June 1906: 216.</note></p>
                <p> Despite receiving such warm praise in such high places, the <title level="m"
                        >Guide</title> has never been what one might call a bestseller. In the
                    thirty-seven years after it first appeared as a stand-alone volume in 1822, it
                    enjoyed steady, if not brisk, sales, with new British editions appearing in
                    1823, 1835, 1842, 1843, 1846, 1853, and 1859. Then, rather
                    inexplicably—especially given Wordsworth’s popularity among the Victorians—the
                    book essentially vanished, being republished only in collected works editions
                    between 1859 and the Ernest De Sélincourt edition of 1906. Thanks to several
                    reissues of De Sélincourt and various other new editions, the <title level="m"
                        >Guide</title> remained in print throughout much of the twentieth century,
                    and databases such as Google Books now allow free and instant access to most
                    nineteenth-century and a few twentieth-century editions. But, while the
                    availability of the text itself is happily no longer an issue, those seeking a
                    modern, comprehensive, annotated edition have generally been out of luck. W.J.B.
                    Owen and Jane Worthington Smyser’s outstanding 1974 scholarly edition, which
                    fills most of Volume 2 of their three-volume <title level="m">The Prose Works of
                        William Wordsworth</title>, remains the standard, but it is available exclusively
                    in an expensive print edition, usually only in major university libraries.
                    Another common problem for those researching the text is the difficulty of
                    accessing the extremely rare first edition and the accompanying sketches by the
                    Rev. Joseph Wilkinson. While the second through fifth editions of what came to
                    be known as the <title level="m">Guide</title> are now freely available via
                    Google and other databases, studying the prose and sketches from the first
                    edition has required a trip to one of the select few archives that own this
                    work.</p>
                    <p> The present edition, then, aims to give scholars, students, and general readers easy and open access to key editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> from Wordsworth’s lifetime, including full scans of Wilkinson’s 1810 sketches and Wordsworth’s texts of 1810 and 1835. Accompanying these original texts is an extensive scholarly apparatus that includes a historical and textual introduction to this edition; detailed footnotes on the texts; an annotated bibliography of previous scholarly editions and criticism on the <title level="m">Guide</title>; and excerpts from letters by Wordsworth and his circle that shed light on the work’s production, reception, and revision. Taking advantage of digital technologies, this edition also includes a parallel-text feature, which allows readers to readily visualize how Wordsworth altered particular passages across the five editions published between 1810 and 1835. Beyond this, the edition features a wealth of maps, engravings, and photographs of the Lakes and an innovative geo-tracking feature that allows readers to pinpoint exact locations discussed in the <title level="m">Guide</title> with the click of a mouse. Thus, while in many respects this aims to serve as a standard scholarly edition of the text, in others it offers a new, and hopefully fuller, experience with one of Wordsworth’s most illuminating, challenging, and compelling works.</p>

                <p>In his correspondence Wordsworth often referred to the <title level="m">Guide

                        6:81.</note> and he seemed to regard the work, especially as he grew older,
                    with fondness. In fact, the <title level="m">Guide</title> was the most
                    extensively and frequently revised of all of his prose works. First published
                    anonymously in 1810 as the letterpress to the Rev. Joseph Wilkinson’s <title
                        level="m">Select Views in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire</title>
                    (see Fig. 1), the <title level="m">Guide</title> subsequently underwent major
                    revisions in 1820, 1822, and 1823 before its final revision under Wordsworth’s
                    direction in 1835. In 1842 Wordsworth gave editorial rights to the Kendal
                    publishers Hudson and Nicholson to produce a new, greatly expanded version of
                    the work. Since Wordsworth was not the primary editor of what has come to be
                    known as “Hudson’s <title level="m">Guide</title>,” this version is not always
                    accounted for in the standard textual histories; however, its final form and
                    much of the additional material included in it reflect his eager
                        involvement.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The full title of the 1842

                <p>Wordsworth’s interests in travel and topographical description date to long
                    before the first appearance of the <title level="m">Guide</title> in 1810, but
                    1807 provides the earliest record we have of his seriously contemplating writing
                    a guidebook. During a visit to Lady Holland, the poet said he was “preparing a
                    manual to guide travelers in their tour amongst the Lakes.”<note place="foot"

                    project was short-lived, however, for in the following year he firmly declined
                    the Rev. John Pering’s request to provide a description of the Lakes,
                    explaining, in a letter dated 2 October 1808, that so far his attempts to record
                    excursions through his native country had been clouded by an “insuperable
                    dullness.” His close familiarity with the Lakes had, in his estimation, left him
                    “utterly at a loss” as to “where to begin, and where to end,” and he could not
                    see his way to any adequate treatment of a “theme so boundless as this sublime
                    and beautiful region.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                </p>
                <p>In light of this declaration, it is somewhat surprising that less than a year
                    later Wordsworth agreed to write the prose companion to Wilkinson’s sketches of
                    the Lakes. In 1809, when he approached Wordsworth about helping with his
                    sketches project, Wilkinson lived nearly three hundred miles southeast of the
                    Lake District, in Thretford, Norfolk, where he served as the rector of East and
                    West Wretham and domestic chaplain to the Marquis of Huntley. Between 1794 and
                    1804, however, he and his wife, Mary, had lived in Ormathwaite, on the outskirts
                    of Keswick, where they cared for her octogenarian uncle, the legendary chemist
                    Dr. William Brownrigg.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Brownrigg (1711-1800,
                            <emph>DNB</emph>) was one of the leading British scientists of his
                        generation, making landmark discoveries in the regulation of mine gasses,
                        the cultivation of table salt, and the identification of platinum’s physical
                        properties. During his Ormathwaite years, Joseph Wilkinson (1764-1831) held curacies at
                        Irthington (near Carlisle) and Monkwearmouth (near Sunderland) and a living
                        at West Harrington, Lincolnshire. Despite his connection to Brownrigg and
                        the Lake poets, Wilkinson (1764–1831) was a rather minor figure in his era
                        and was not included in either the original or updated <title level="m"
                            >Dictionary of National Biography</title>. When Wilkinson died in
                        October 1831, the <title level="j">Gentleman’s Magazine </title>published a
                        brief obituary (Nov. 1831, pp. 472-73), but the fullest details about his

                    Especially between 1802 and 1804, the Wilkinsons regularly socialized with their
                    Keswick neighbors the Southeys and Coleridges and in the process often crossed
                    paths with the Wordsworths. The cordial relationship that formed between the
                    Wordsworths and Wilkinson is signaled in Dorothy’s journal entry for 1 July
                    1802, which recorded the arrival of saddlebags from Keswick including letters
                    from Coleridge and Mary Hutchinson and drawings from Wilkinson.<note

                    three poets, Southey seems to have had the closest friendship with Wilkinson. In
                    a letter to William Taylor dated 7 January 1804, he noted that Wilkinson “is my
                    neighbour at present, and a very excellent one I find him.”<note place="foot"

                    moved to Norfolk, and two years later Southey went out of his way on a journey
                    south to visit them. Writing to his wife back in Keswick, he reported that
                    Wilkinson still represented “the very cream of human kindness.” Exiled as they
                    were, however, to a region that, in Southey’s estimation, was “utterly without
                    beauty,” the Wilkinsons pined for the Lakes: “Wilkinson says he has had but one
                    regret at the thought of Ormathwaite—which has lasted ever since—and Mrs W.
                    never looks at the drawing of it but the tears come in her eyes.”<note

                    of his Lakeland sketches. Sometime in the spring of 1809, he approached
                    Coleridge about writing a prose companion for this project.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> The letter in which Wilkinson originally proposed the
                        project to Coleridge has been lost. While there is no record of Wilkinson
                        initially approaching Southey to assist with <title level="m">Select
                            Views</title>, it is worth speculating that he might have done so given
                        that, first, Southey was apparently his closest friend among the Lake poets
                        and, second, Southey had published significantly more prose at this point
                        than either Wordsworth or Coleridge (e.g. <title level="m">Letters Written
                            during a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> [1797] and <title

                    time for Coleridge, as he was consumed at the moment by his new periodical,
                        <title level="m">The Friend</title>, so he forwarded Wilkinson’s inquiry to
                    Wordsworth, who was apparently intrigued but non-committal. One of Wordsworth’s
                    main concerns was that Wilkinson’s collection might compete with a similar
                    project then in the works by the poet’s friend and Lake District neighbor
                    William Green. In response to these concerns, in early June 1809 Wilkinson wrote
                    Coleridge: <quote>I am just returned from Town, where I have been making
                        arrangements for my publication, and as I have seen some of Mr Green[’]s

                        no two works, descriptive of the same country can be more different, or less
                        likely to interfere with each other, than his and mine. [B]ut I shall write
                        to Mr Wordsworth in a few days more fully upon the subject when I hope
                        either Mr W—or yourself, or both, will afford me the assistance I shall

                    difficult financial times for the Wordsworths, and hence the general assumption
                    has long been that only the most pressing need could have induced him to accept
                    an undertaking that would appear to many as hack or, more generously,
                    commissioned work.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for instance, Owen and

                    There is something to this, as by 1809 it was increasingly looking as if
                    Wordsworth would never make a living as a poet. His most recent collection,
                        <title level="m">Poems, in Two Volumes</title> (1807)—an edition he had
                    hoped would establish his reputation as one of Britain’s preeminent poets—was
                    excoriated by reviewers and largely ignored by readers (230 of the 1,000 copies
                    remained unsold in 1814).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Gill, <title
                            level="j">Life</title>, 258-59 and 266-67.</note> When Wilkinson came
                    offering paid work, Wordsworth had no steady income and four children, a wife, a
                    sister, a sister-in-law, and frequent long-term houseguests to feed. It was
                    certainly, then, no time for high principles regarding the hiring out of his
                    pen.</p>
                <p>That said, it seems overly harsh to read Wordsworth’s acceptance of Wilkinson’s
                    offer as a purely mercenary act. As noted above, at least two years earlier
                    Wordsworth had expressed interest in trying his hand at such a project; and the
                    alacrity with which he began composing after agreeing to assist Wilkinson hardly
                    suggests a begrudging attitude. With or without compensation, this opportunity
                    might very well have struck Wordsworth as a godsend, as it allowed him to write
                    on some of his favorite subjects (nature, aesthetics, the Lakes) in a genre
                    (expository prose) to which he was increasingly drawn. On this latter point, the
                    earliest versions of what would become the <title level="m">Guide to the
                        Lakes</title> were written in the midst of the most sustained period of
                    prose composition of Wordsworth’s long career. Between 1808 and 1810, he wrote
                    and saw to press the 216-page political treatise <title level="m">The Convention
                        of Cintra</title>; the letterpress for <title level="m">Select Views</title>
                    (i.e., the first edition of the <title level="m">Guide</title>); and two lengthy
                    essays (“Reply to Mathetes” and “Essay Upon Epitaphs”) for Coleridge’s <title

                        same span Wordsworth wrote two additional “Essays Upon Epitaphs.” Both were

                        unpublished until 1876.</note> Just how busied he was with prose in 1809 is
                    evidenced in the fact that <title level="m">The Convention of Cintra</title>
                    (published 27 May 1809) was released at the exact moment when he was

                    Dorothy expressed optimism that William’s turn to prose works might actually
                    bring him out of obscurity and alleviate the family’s financial distress.
                    Writing to Catherine Clarkson on 18 November 1809, she confided, “I think, if he
                    were to write [his own] Guide to the Lakes and prefix this preface [from <title

                <p>Besides money and the chance to write an essay on his native region, another
                    likely inducement for Wordsworth’s participation in <title level="m">Select
                        Views</title> was the opportunity to engage with fine art and the
                    picturesque landscape tradition. Owing to famous lines about the “tyranny” of
                    the eye and how it is “the most despotic of our senses,”<note place="foot"

                    Wordsworth has often been misrepresented as hostile toward the visual arts. In
                    reality, his views were more nuanced. His long-standing friendship and
                    correspondence with Sir George Beaumont, a painter and well-known patron of the
                    arts, highlights Wordsworth’s eager interest in prevailing artistic
                    philosophies, particularly those dominating landscape painting, as well as his
                    belief that he was qualified to evaluate fine art with a critical eye. The easy
                    familiarity with which Wordsworth discusses artistic principles and techniques
                    demonstrates that he was well versed enough; and, indeed, Wordsworth reportedly
                    felt that there were three vocations for which nature had fitted him—those of
                    poet, landscape gardener, and art critic.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                <p>And, contrary to what has emerged as the scholarly consensus, Wilkinson might
                    actually have been esteemed as a skilled artist in 1809. Most modern dismissals
                    of Wilkinson’s artistic abilities draw upon a May 1810 letter from Wordsworth to
                    his friend and patron, the art connoisseur Lady Beaumont. Penned at a moment of
                    particular pique over how the serial publication of <title level="m">Select

                        Monkhouse. Commenting on some Westall engravings and a brief description of

                    quite well, particularly compared to rank-and-file sketches from the picturesque
                    craze of the early Romantic period. The best images in Wilkinson’s <title
                        level="m">Northern Sketches</title> (1795) display skills in shading,
                    situation, and perspective and avoid many of the clichés of
                    late-eighteenth-century landscape painting (see, for instance, Fig. 2). No doubt
                    Wordsworth felt encouraged by the success of this earlier project. And, though
                    disproportion and a somewhat drab sameness weigh down many images in <title

                    “Cottage at Nebthit” (Fig. 4) artfully convey the harmony between the natural
                    and the man-made in the Lake District. </p>
                <p>While Wilkinson never found a broad audience for his drawings, they were of

                    conventional assumptions that Wilkinson’s sketches were unequivocally without
                    merit and that Wordsworth, by extension, could only have agreed to work with so
                    middling an artist for mercenary reasons.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> However undervalued Wilkinson’s artistic gifts may now be, it merits noting that he does appear to have struggled when it came to drawing the human figure. His original sketches, held by the Wordsworth Trust, include
                        small figure studies in the margins—human characters, animals, wagon wheels,
                        boats, etc.—ultimately located in the engravings. Either Wilkinson suggested
                        these details to help engraver W. F. Wells (in a style that appears quite
                        different from that of the landscapes) or, more likely, he requested another
                        artist’s help. That artist might well be William Henry Pyne (1769–1843,
                            <emph>DNB</emph>), a figure-drawing master who regularly collaborated
                        with Ackermann, the publisher of <title level="m">Select Views</title>.
                        Figures in Pyne’s 1808 <title level="m">Microcosm</title>, also published by
                        Ackermann, resemble those added to Wilkinson’s landscapes. Wilkinson knew
                        Pyne and included his name on a list of potential subscribers for <title

                <p>Another key indicator that Wilkinson’s sketches were
                    highly valued by some is how they were priced and sold. In short, <title
                        level="m">Select Views</title> was an expensive production, privately funded
                    by subscribers who were charged 10s. 6d. per month (£6.6s. for the entire
                    series), in exchange for which they were to receive four folio-sized engravings
                    at the beginning of each month of 1810.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Except
                        in August and September 1810, when three and five engravings were
                        respectively shipped, Wilkinson generally kept to this schedule of sending
                        four engravings per month.</note> Calls for subscribers began appearing in
                    national periodicals in April and May 1809—months before Wordsworth had agreed
                    to participate<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A notice in the <title

                <p>The series’ chief selling point, according to the
                    newspaper advertisements, was Wilkinson’s long residence in the area, which gave
                    his images “a decided superiority over the productions of travellers and
                    artists,” who of necessity drew from “partial and hasty observation.” The
                    engravings of Wilkinson’s pencil drawings, moreover, were by W. F. Wells,
                    engraver to Gainsborough and “other eminent Masters.” And the paper would be of
                    such a quality that it would “admit of tinting” should purchasers desire to
                    color their images. Nowhere is there mention of Wordsworth’s name (nor would
                    there be, even after the images began shipping), and that the engravings would
                    be accompanied by “appropriate Letter-press Descriptions” is treated as a minor
                    selling point.</p>
                <p>During the latter half of 1809, as Wilkinson recruited
                    subscribers and worked with his engraver and publisher, Wordsworth made steady
                    progress on his essay. In late November, Sara Hutchinson prepared a fair copy of
                    the manuscript for the publisher, and at the start of the new year Wordsworth’s
                    introduction and the first engravings began shipping. By Dorothy’s account, only
                    after the introduction was published did William begin writing the other parts
                    of the text, postponing later descriptions until he received copies of
                    Wilkinson’s prints.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Letters,</title> 2: 372.</note> It is not exactly clear
                    when Wordsworth completed Sections I and II, but the writing regularly stalled
                    due to delays on Wilkinson’s end. Nearly a year later, in November of 1810,
                    Dorothy recorded that William was still writing for <title level="m">Select
                        Views</title>, a task that had become so “irksome” to him that he employed
                    her to “compose a description or two for the finishing of his work for
                        Wilkinson.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:449.</note>
                </p>
                <p>It seems unlikely that Wordsworth ever worked closely with Wilkinson’s prints as
                    he composed; in fact, a number of incongruences between the letterpress and the
                    prints indicate breakdowns in the collaborative process. Before Wordsworth had
                    finished the final sections for <title level="m">Select Views</title>, he was
                    already making private plans to use what he had written as material for an
                    independent guidebook, and between 1809 and 1812 Wordsworth began reworking
                    ideas from <title level="m">Select Views</title> into two fresh essays, now
                    generally known as “Unpublished Tour” and “The Sublime and the Beautiful.”<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors">

                    Wordsworth abandoned these essays shortly after accepting Lord Lonsdale’s annual
                    pension of £100 per annum, a generous offer that provided Wordsworth with
                    financial means to live on until a salaried government post opened up.<note

                    an appendix to his <title level="m">River Duddon</title> volume (Fig. 7).
                    Besides being rechristened “A Topographical Description of the Country of the
                    Lakes in the North of England,” this revision combined Sections I and II from
                    the 1810 edition into a single section and included new sections on the
                    gracefulness and beauty of the lakes’ boundary lines, the initial impression of
                    the region upon those unused to mountains, and the ill-advised attempts of
                    modernizers to “improve” estates at Derwentwater and Windermere.<note

                    also appended a prefatory note justifying the essay’s publication in the <title
                        level="m">River Duddon </title>volume on the grounds of its “having been
                    written in the same spirit” as his poems and “from a belief that it [would]
                    materially illustrate” his verses. This encouraging of readers to consider the
                    essay in tandem with his poetry carries over into the “Topographical
                    Description” itself, which routinely illustrates key points with passages from
                    Wordsworth’s poetical corpus. At the same time, the second edition takes pains
                    to dissociate itself from <title level="m">Select Views</title>, expunging all
                    references to both Wilkinson and his etchings. Completing the transformation of
                    the reading experience, the <title level="m">River Duddon</title> volume
                    appeared not as a massive folio (as <title level="m">Select Views </title>had)
                    but as a more affordable and portable duodecimo.</p>
                <p>Although sales for <title level="m">The River Duddon</title> were

                        Sales essentially ceased at this point, and 30 copies were remaindered in

                    reviewers ignored the “Topographical Description,” but those who did notice it
                    were unfailingly positive. The <title level="j">British Critic</title>, for
                    instance, opined that the essay “certainly is of value as an illustration of the
                    poems now under our review, but we rate its absolute merit very high” (52).

                    performance” (203) and “as topographically useful as it is <emph>poetically
                        picturesque</emph>” (143).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For reviews of

                <p>Buoyed by these remarks and his family’s encouragement, Wordsworth began
                    preparing a stand-alone edition of the <title level="m">Guide</title> that would
                    be tailored particularly toward travelers. Published in June 1822 as <title

                    fold-out map and a new section entitled “Directions and Information for the
                    Tourist.” Other additions, such as notes on the local climate and an edited
                    account of Dorothy’s excursion up Scafell Pike, only further signaled that the
                    book’s primary intended audience was tourists. </p>

                    went to press (Fig. 10). This fourth edition offered a new section comparing the
                    Lakeland mountains to the Alps, advancing Wordsworth’s aim to “reconcile a
                    Briton to the scenery of his own country, though not at the expense of
                        truth.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    two by other poets) and a reworked version of Dorothy’s account of their

                    run turned out to be overly optimistic, as sales were considerably slower than
                    those of the third edition. To move the hundreds of copies of the fourth edition
                    he still had on hand after the initial sales wave, Wordsworth’s publisher,
                    Longman, ran new advertisements for the book in newspapers and literary
                    magazines during each summer tourism season between 1823 and 1833 (Fig.

                    two editions, the <title level="m">Guide </title>had thus far proven less than a
                    lucrative venture for Wordsworth, with his total royalties from the third and
                    fourth editions amounting to a mere £62.12.10.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        interesting here is not the dwindling sales after the first few years (which

                <p>In 1835, as stock of the fourth edition was at last exhausted, Wordsworth
                    completed what would be the final revision of his lifetime and published a

                    were mainly structural, as Wordsworth reordered the book into its now familiar
                    organization: an opening section with “Directions and Information for the
                    Tourist,” a three-part “Description of the Scenery of the Lakes,”<note

                        Inhabitants”; and “Changes, and Rules of Taste for Preventing their Bad

                    a set of picturesque sketches into a full-fledged travel guide was complete,
                    and, with the publication contract for this edition passing from the
                    London-based Longman to the Kendal-based Hudson and Nicholson, the <title

                    provincializing of the book’s marketing at this point. Whereas the third and
                    fourth editions were widely advertised and sold throughout England, the fifth
                    edition had a minuscule advertising budget (£3.14, down from £30 for the
                    previous edition), was advertised only in small-town Lake District newspapers,

                    arrival in Kendal or other gateways to the region. Whereas three years after the

                    untapped market for the <title level="m">Guide</title>. And thus, in the same 27
                    September 1838 letter to Wordsworth, he wrote, “We should be happy to consult
                    with you sometime when we are at Ambleside on the expediency of having a new
                    &amp; more correct map of the Lake District, and also of extending the

                        contributions remain untouched and separate from the publishers’ additions.
                        As he put it in a letter to Adam Sedgwick (late March 1842), the new
                        information intended for the “<emph>Body</emph> of the Tourist” must remain
                        distinct from “all that related to the <emph>mind</emph>” (<title level="m"
                            >Letters</title> 7:310). In saying this, Wordsworth echoed the opening
                        of the 1835 edition: “In preparing this Manual, it was the Author’s
                        principal wish to furnish a Guide or Companion for the <emph>Minds</emph> of
                        Persons of taste, and feeling for Landscape, who might be inclined to
                        explore the District of the Lakes with that degree of attention to which its
                        beauty may fairly lay claim” (i). </note> In the ensuing years, he played
                    the role of general editor, assisting with the book’s organization and helping
                    Hudson secure letters on the region’s geology from Adam Sedgwick and botanical
                    lists from Thomas Gough. The resulting enlarged, more scientific edition—known
                    today as “Hudson’s <title level="m">Guide</title>” (Fig. 13)—first appeared in
                    1842, the year before Wordsworth became Poet Laureate. Hudson’s <title level="m"
                        >Guide </title>was published twice more before Wordsworth’s 1850 death (in
                    1843 and 1846), with each subsequent edition incorporating new materials to meet
                    the demands of an increasingly diverse and competitive guidebook market.
                    Fittingly, thirty-plus years after Wilkinson elided Wordsworth’s name from the
                    first edition of the <title level="m">Guide</title>, the poet’s name had come to
                    function as one of its chief selling points, for by now he had become a national
                    institution and an attraction for tourists in his own right. </p>

                <p> The textual history of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> comes into
                    tighter focus in light of its <emph>contextual</emph> history, for the book
                    represents an episode not only in Wordsworth’s career but also in the longer
                    history of travel writing about the Lake Country. By the time Wordsworth reached
                    adulthood, the Lake District had become one of the most popular landscape
                    subjects for writers and artists in the British Isles and a major tourist
                    destination. Of course, it had not always been so. While people had long lived
                    and labored in the region, before the mid-eighteenth century the lakes and
                    mountains of England’s northwest attracted few leisure travelers. In fact, the
                    topography of the Lake District struck many as more forbidding than inviting.
                    Daniel Defoe, writing in the 1720s, claimed that the region was “eminent only
                    for being the wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I have passed over
                    in England.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Daniel Defoe,<title level="m"> A

                    isolated landscapes prized by latter-day travelers, this one remained
                    comparatively intact because earlier generations found it resistant to
                    cultivation and civilization; its preservation is thus one of history’s happy
                    ironies. It was not until modernity arrived with its sprawling populations,
                    industrial projects, and rapid transportation networks that Britons began to
                    value “wilderness”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> We put “wilderness” in
                        quotes because, as Wordsworth was well aware, the Lake District was hardly
                        an untouched preserve, even before eighteenth-century tourists took interest
                        in it. Humans had long inhabited and shaped the region. For Wordsworth,
                        then, preserving the landscape meant holding on to and enhancing its
                        character as produced by traditional ways of life and the mediating power of
                        taste. Throughout the <title level="m">Guide</title>, readers find
                        significant tension between “nature” and “culture.” Several scholars listed
                        in our annotated bibliography have addressed this tension and other
                        complications attending Wordsworth’s environmentalism. </note> for its
                    contrasting, spiritual resources. The change came about in Wordsworth’s lifetime
                    or just before. As an old man he could still recall the observation of the
                    shrewd woman he lodged with as a youth in Keswick: “Bless me! folk are always
                    talking about prospects: when I was young there was never sic a thing
                        neamed!”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Wordsworth’s first letter on

                    emerged at a moment of historical opportunity. </p>
                <p> Various imperatives drove the popularization of “wild”
                    terrains like the Lake District. One was national: the so-called discovery of
                    Britain reflected a desire to bring home at least some of the cultural capital
                    of the continental Grand Tour, the rite of passage that functioned as the
                    culmination of the English gentleman’s education. The growth of home tourism was
                    helped by the fact that eighteenth-century European wars sometimes made
                    cross-channel travel difficult. Turning energies inward by necessity as well as
                    inclination, British tourists and travel writers self-consciously went about
                    demarcating their own nation’s “classic ground,” often focusing on lesser known
                    but increasingly romanticized reaches of Northern England, Scotland, and Wales.
                    Wordsworth was therefore not unique when, in the <title level="m">Guide</title>,
                    he compared the Lakeland fells to the Alps and expressed a desire to “reconcile
                    a Briton to the scenery of his own country” (105);<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> Citations of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>

                    promoting a nativizing project with several decades of history. The
                    eighteenth-century promotion of British landscape had paradoxical aspects. It
                    drew on continental codes of art to celebrate domestic beauties, but it set the
                    stage for the time when tourists would hunger to range over British territory
                    newly defined as heritage landscape, helped along by expanding economic
                    opportunity, leisure, and improved transportation. It is no wonder that most
                    historians of British travel date the birth of modern tourism to roughly
                    1750—precisely the moment when Lake District literature emerged, marking the
                    first stirrings of what would become the cult of the picturesque and, later on,
                    of the expanded cultural picturesque known as literary tourism. By the Romantic
                    period, conditions were firmly in place for tourism to flourish on a large
                    scale. </p>
                <p> Wordsworth draws on this basic travel history in the
                        <title level="m">Guide</title>. Repeatedly he hits the keynote “within the
                    last sixty years,” defining a period that wraps his <title level="m"
                        >Guide</title>’s concerns into the history of tourism (see especially the
                    opening of Section Third).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In another sense,
                        this chronology assimilates regional history into the period of Wordsworth’s
                        own life, linking the <title level="m">Guide</title> and the landscape it
                        celebrates to the biographical myth that underlies the author’s poetry. In
                        the first edition of 1810, Wordsworth refers to events that have occurred
                        “within the last forty years,” making 1770, his birth year, the point of
                        departure. See Gill, <title level="j">Life</title>, 285. </note> The rise of
                    landscape connoisseurship with its associated visual art and literature stirred
                    up tourist traffic that transformed both physical and social aspects of the Lake
                    District. It also encouraged more people to take up residence. Wordsworth
                    himself chose to settle in the heart of the Lake District not only because it
                    was his childhood home and the repository of personal memories but also because
                    it had become a prominent aesthetic territory. Now, in the <title level="m"
                        >Guide</title> as well as in his poetry, he was taking stock of the changes
                    that had occurred there, sometimes writing in celebration, sometimes sounding
                    defensive and elegiac notes. He was singing the beauties of a place, but he was
                    also aiming to define and protect it. </p>
                <p> In sum, though many assume that the Lake District was
                    “discovered” by Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets, it was in fact advertised
                    in print and painting from the 1750s forwards; thus, Wordsworth’s <title
                        level="m">Guide</title> must be understood in terms of a deeper backstory.
                    The Lakes were the subject of early books by James Clarke, Thomas Gray, Thomas
                    Pennant, William Gilpin, Thomas West, and others.<note place="foot"

                        (Winchester: St. Paul’s Bibliographies, 1990). </note> By the late 1700s,
                    such books were commonly read, toted about, and recycled (cited, imitated, and
                    even plagiarized by later tour writers). Indeed, Lake tours had already become
                    the subjects of parody, as in James Plumptre’s <title level="m">The Lakers
                    </title>(1798) and William Combe and Thomas Rowlandson’s <title level="m">The
                        Tour of Dr. Syntax in Search of the Picturesque </title>(1809) (Fig. 14).
                    Wordsworth had read enough Lake District literature to know what he liked and
                    disliked about it. He engaged that tradition in the <title level="m"
                        >Guide</title>, quoting and responding to previous writers; in fact, parts
                    of his work may feel derivative to the reader who recognizes echoes of, say,
                    Gilpin’s complaints about white objects disrupting sight lines or West’s
                    characterization of the Lake region as a miniature version of the Alps. Other
                    aspects of the <title level="m">Guide</title>, too, might seem somewhat
                    conventional to readers steeped in the period’s travel literature, including
                    Wordsworth’s emphasis on ideal views and paths of approach, his attention to
                    colors and forms, and certain aspects of his meditations on the beautiful and
                    the sublime. </p>

                <p> Yet, however familiar aspects of the <title level="m"
                        >Guide </title>might seem, there is also a striking originality to much of
                    the work. Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>, for instance, refuses to
                    reduce the landscape to painters’ formulae,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A
                        typical passage on this theme occurs in the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s
                        “Miscellaneous Observations” section: “But, though our scenes are better
                        suited to painting than those of the Alps, I should be sorry to contemplate
                        either country in reference to that art, further than as its fitness or
                        unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the
                        spectator, who has learned to observe and feel, chiefly from Nature herself”
                        (102). Wordsworth expressed skepticism about the jargon of landscape
                        painting as early as his <title level="m">Descriptive Sketches</title>
                        (London: Johnson, 1793). He wrote, “Whoever, in attempting to describe [the
                        Alps’] sublime features, should confine himself to the cold rules of
                        painting would give his reader but a very imperfect idea of those emotions
                        which they have the irresistible power of communicating to the most
                        impassive imaginations” (24, fn). </note> adds fresh touches of poetry and
                    philosophy to the tour discourse, and advances novel arguments about land
                    conservation and stewardship. And, not surprisingly, in terms of the lyricism
                    and style of his prose, Wordsworth easily outshines most earlier writers on the
                    Lakes.</p>
                <p> The first influential promoters of Lake scenery were visual artists, but just
                    behind them came the writers who established foundations for literature on the
                    region. One was John Dalton of Queen’s College, Oxford, who published <title
                        level="m">A Descriptive Poem Addressed to Two Young Ladies at Their Return
                        from Viewing the Mines Near Whitehaven</title> in 1755; another was John
                    Brown of St John’s, Cambridge, whose glowing letter on the Vale of Keswick
                    (written in the early 1750s but first published in 1767) described the area’s
                    scenery in terms of “the united powers of Claude, Salvator, and Poussin” and
                    attracted many aspiring artists and scenery-hounds.<note place="foot"

                    </note> As Peter Bicknell observes, both Dalton and Brown were natives of
                    Cumberland; it was fitting that they should be the first of the “long line of
                    dons and divines who were to record the Lakes.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"

                    Recalling such pioneers, in the <title level="m">Guide </title>Wordsworth
                    singled out Brown, calling him “one of the first who led the way to a worthy
                    admiration of this country” and opining that he worked “with a powerful pencil,
                    and the feeling of a genuine Enthusiast.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                </p>
                <p>But even before Wordsworth was born, Brown’s letter had found its way into the
                    hands of Thomas Gray and convinced that poet to turn Lake tourist. Gray, best
                    known for his “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,” made his tour of the
                    Lakes in 1769. Having left a sick traveling companion behind, he kept a careful
                    journal which first came to print in William Mason’s 1775 <title level="m">The
                        Poems of Mr. Gray</title>. In 1780 this text appeared as an addendum to the
                    second edition of West’s popular <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes
                    </title>(discussed below), and by that means it became a permanent fixture in
                    the tourist literature. Wordsworth knew it well. Though Gray’s prose had a few
                    purple moments—his superheated account of the Jaws of Borrowdale inspired
                    parodies—Wordsworth praised its overall “distinctness and unaffected
                        simplicity.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Guide</title>, 61. </note> In doing so he echoed the editor
                    of West’s <title level="m">Guide</title>, William Cockin, who admitted that
                    Gray’s journal offered little of what readers might call “fine writing” but
                    insisted that those who prized trustworthy description and “elegant simplicity
                    of narrative” would find it a welcome companion to their travels.<note

                    Gray a kindred spirit, a sensitive poet of an earlier generation exploring
                    places he now knew and loved. Gray’s journal contained several passages that
                    Wordsworth would especially approve, as when Gray called Grasmere Vale,
                    Wordsworth’s future home, “a little unexpected paradise.”<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> Ibid., 212.</note> Wordsworth rightly saw Gray’s journal as
                    a major impetus for the growth of Lakeland tourism, attributing its sway in part
                    to “the pensive interest with which the human mind is ever disposed to listen to
                    the farewell words of genius.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Guide</title>, 60-61.</note> Gray died in July 1771, not
                    quite two years after his Lake tour, and about fifteen months after Wordsworth’s
                    birth.</p>
                <p> Another major figure in the background of Wordsworth’s writing and, indeed, in
                    the backstory of most Romantic-era books on landscape, is the Reverend William
                    Gilpin. His most directly relevant work, <title level="m">Observations Relative
                        Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty Made in the Year 1772 on Several Parts of
                        England, Particularly the Mountains and Lakes of Cumberland and
                        Westmoreland</title>, was published in 1786. However, it circulated broadly
                    in manuscript before its printing, so its influence predates its official
                    appearance. Gilpin’s work was more instruction manual than tour guide, a
                    treatise on the proper viewing and representation of landscape. Wordsworth,
                    though uncomfortable with some of Gilpin’s notions, found himself agreeing with
                    Gilpin on many points. In the <title level="m">Guide </title>and elsewhere, he
                    internalized much of the thought and vocabulary of this leading theorist of the
                    picturesque. </p>
                <p> Arguably the first true guidebook to the Lake District, Thomas West’s <title
                        level="m">A Guide to the Lakes</title> first appeared in 1778. West had
                    already established himself as an authority on the region with <title level="m"
                        >The Antiquities of Furness</title> (1774), and recognizing that Lake
                    tourism was accelerating, he set out to fill a need. His guidebook went through
                    numerous editions and was still in use (in its eleventh edition) when the first
                    stand-alone version of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> appeared in
                    1822. Wordsworth refers to West often in the <title level="m">Guide</title>,
                    noting that his “Guide to the Lakes has been eminently serviceable to the
                    Tourist for nearly 50 years.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        and landscape sketchers in the late eighteenth century. The device took its name
                        from Claude Lorrain, the seventeenth-century French artist whose visions of
                        Arcadia did much to shape British theories of the picturesque. To use one, the
                        viewer had to turn his or her back to the natural scene. The glass could then
                        frame and tint the landscape so that it resembled one of Claude's paintings.

                <p>The first few pages of West’s <title level="m">Guide </title>indicate its
                    character. The book’s epigraph, taken from Milton, announces a treatise on “A
                    happy rural seat of various views,” and in fact <emph>views</emph> of the
                    Northern Arcadia are the work’s main emphasis. Assuming that readers will bring
                    expectations formed by landscape art, West strongly recommends the use of a
                    “landscape mirror” (a.k.a. the Claude glass—a favorite device of Gray’s and of
                    many travelers) (Fig. 15), and suggests a series of stations for viewing the
                    region to best advantage.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas West, <title

                        1778), 15-16, etc.</note> Sensibly organized, clear, detailed, and engaging,
                    West’s catalogue of the full wonders of the Lake District quickly won admirers
                    and exerted influence. </p>
                <p>West’s <title level="m">Guide</title> took on another sort of importance due to
                    innovations completed by William Cockin, who edited the second (1780) and third
                    (1784) editions of the book after West’s death (Fig. 16). Under his
                    superintendence, the <title level="m">Guide</title> became an anthology of Lake
                    writing. Its “Addenda,” comprising some 100 pages of the 300-page work, included
                    texts on the Lakes dating as far back as the 1750s, presented in chronological
                    order. Thus, the expanded <title level="m">Guide</title> allowed a reader like
                    Wordsworth to conveniently peruse the history of Lake literature. For readers
                    generally, West’s <title level="m">Guide</title> made literary descriptions,
                    especially poems, fundamental aides to landscape appreciation. It probably also
                    helped solidify the sense that travelers ought to take up the rhapsodic pen
                    themselves. Composing a suitable panegyric became an important aspect of travel
                    experience, with verse especially becoming a cognate to amateur sketching.
                    Writers had launched a process that the Lake Poets, especially Wordsworth, would
                    complete, converting the Lake District into a poetic landscape. </p>

                <p>By framing the Lake District as a series of pictures and establishing codes by
                    which such pictures should be admired, West and his contemporaries set patterns
                    that tourism still follows in many respects, though catering now to travelers
                    with digital cameras. In fact, today’s itinerary for the Lake District still
                    includes some of West’s viewing “stations” (e.g., Claife Station on Windermere)
                    (Fig. 17). At the same time, modern Lake tourism makes literary and antiquarian
                    appeals that arguably can also be traced to West’s brand of tour writing.</p>

                <p>Though other titles might be mentioned, the examples cited above show that
                    Wordsworth did not write in a vacuum. His <title level="m">Guide</title> was
                    highly informed by other books. Nonetheless, it was distinctive in several
                    respects. It captured the creed that animated Wordsworth’s verses, promoting it
                    for a broader sort of reading audience. As witnessed in this edition’s annotated
                    bibliography, commentators on the <title level="m">Guide</title> (while not
                    always agreeing with each other) have tended to highlight many of the book’s
                    uniquely “Wordsworthian” traits. Among the most broadly appreciated of these are
                    the following.</p>
                <p>To begin with, whereas earlier guidebooks typically take the tourist’s point of
                    view, the <title level="m">Guide </title>convinces us that its author has walked
                    all of the region’s paths in all sorts of weather. He belongs to the place
                    almost as much as the trees, rocks, lichens, and waterfalls. Despite his
                    familiarity with previous publications on his subject, he writes “as one having
                    authority, and not as the scribes.” Characteristically, he blends a native’s
                    matter-of-factness with a sense of wonder and dignified reverence. </p>
                <p>Second, Wordsworth goes beyond the conventional practice of travel handbooks in
                    the range of his arguments. As Ian Ousby writes, the <title level="m"
                        >Guide</title> “makes most [earlier travel books] seem ‘two-dimensional’ by
                    its larger, more rounded approach to its subject, treating landscape not as a
                    special effect to be sought out and appreciated in isolation but connecting it
                    to the region’s geology, history, and human culture.”<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> Ian Ousby, <title level="m">The Englishman’s England</title>
                        (London: Cambridge UP, 1990), 138–39.</note> Wordsworth himself said that he
                    aimed to “give a model of the manner in which topographical descriptions ought
                    to be executed…by evolving truly and distinctly one appearance from
                        another.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> He made this remark in an 1810
                        letter to Lady Beaumont (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:404). </note>
                    In keeping with that intent, the <title level="m">Guide</title> insists that
                    travelers must experience the Lake District as it unfolds itself gradually to
                    the pedestrian. Against the tradition of viewing the Lake District as a series
                    of discrete viewing stations, Wordsworth presents it as a whole that takes its
                    charms from relationship, interconnection, and gradual transition, both physical
                    and temporal. Often Wordsworth seems to draw on Coleridge’s concept of beauty as
                    “multeity in unity.” The Lake District may offer no single feature superior to,
                    say, a high peak in the Alps, but as a compact <emph>whole</emph>, he contends,
                    the Lake District compares favorably with any terrain in the world. In a sense,
                    the region is a poem in which the parts take their meaning from the overall
                    scheme. This understanding has both poetic and ecological significance.</p>
                <p>Third, Wordsworth never quite accepts the idea that he is merely writing a
                    guidebook. He announces straightaway in the 1835 edition that the “humble and
                    tedious task” of providing directions for tourists is, for him, subordinate. The
                    core of his essay will therefore direct itself to “the <emph>Minds</emph> of
                    Persons of taste, and a feeling for Landscape,” to sensitive beings prepared to
                    watch and receive with uncommon attention.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Guide</title>, i. </note> It is telling, indeed, that the
                    word <emph>guide</emph> never appeared in the work’s title until the fifth
                    edition. <emph>Description</emph>, adopted in the titles of the second, third,
                    and fourth editions, was in ways a more accurate term, but the book never
                    restricted itself to mere description either. </p>
                <p>Fourth, the <title level="m">Guide </title>makes a pioneering case for preserving
                    the ecological, aesthetic, and social health of the Lake District, fearing even
                    as it promotes the region’s charms that newcomers may love the region to death.
                    As noted above, Wordsworth writes as a Lake District local, but he also writes
                        <emph>to</emph> locals—especially to wealthy landowners who have recently
                    arrived. The title page of the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s definitive fifth
                    edition advertises a work “for the use of Tourists and Residents”; and from the
                    third edition forward the book’s third section carries a telling subtitle:
                    “Changes, and Rules of Taste for Preventing their Bad Effects.” Whether
                    descanting on the ideal color for homes, the traditional shape of vernacular
                    chimneys, or the sensible placement of trees, Wordsworth often takes a view that
                    transcends the limits of private property. He argues that, in a special moral
                    sense, the countryside belongs to everyone, regardless of who might own legal
                    title to it. His statement that the Lake District should be regarded as “a sort
                    of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye
                    to perceive and a heart to enjoy”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Guide</title>, 88. </note> is widely regarded as the first
                    published call for the creation of national parks.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> On Wordsworth as founding figure for national parks, see, for example, Stephen Gill, <title level="m">Wordsworth and the Victorians</title> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1998), 260. See also the <ref target="http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/whatisanationalpark/history#early19">UK National Parks website</ref>.</note>
                    Wordsworth directly inspired the founders of Britain’s National Trust (not to
                    mention the National Parks in the U.S.); and the 1951 establishment of Lake
                    District National Park, the largest in England, drew heavily upon his legacy. As
                    Bicknell says in the introduction to his illustrated edition of the <title
                        level="m">Guide</title>, “whether we agree with [Wordsworth] or not, he has
                    fundamentally changed the way we all look at the natural world.”<note

                            Wordsworth’s Guide to the Lakes</title>, 7.</note>
                </p>
                <p>Finally, Wordsworth conceives of his guidebook not as a fully autonomous work but
                    as part of his larger literary and philosophical project. Tellingly, where other
                    topographical writers might refer to a painting, Wordsworth usually quotes
                    poetry—not infrequently his own—instead.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On

                    He imports verse not merely for vanity or ornamentation; rather, he grasps for
                    the most evocative language at hand, whether it come in the form of a lyric, a
                    passage from the <emph>Excursion</emph>, or even a few lines from such
                    unpublished poems as “Home at Grasmere” or <title level="m">The Prelude</title>.
                    In so doing, Wordsworth insists that poetry is an authoritative mode of
                    description and that topographical verse and prose are unavoidably intertwined.
                    Quotations become verbal pictures, illustrations, occasions for heightened
                    attention. They also model emotional reactions, encouraging readers to translate
                    the writer’s observations into the realms of personal sensation and reflection.
                    Consequently, the <title level="m">Guide</title> schools readers in Wordsworth’s
                    own processes of thought and composition. In terms of the larger history of
                    travel writing, the work also expands the trend of blending poetry with tour
                    writing, a potent combination which by Victorian times would not only make
                    reviewing poetry essential to travelers’ landscape explorations, but would also
                    produce thoroughly literary geographies, converting the Lake District into the
                    “Wordsworthshire” of literary tourists.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        “Wordsworthshire” seems to be the coinage of James Russell Lowell (see his
                        article on Wordsworth in <title level="m">Among My Books</title>, 2nd ser.,
                        1876), but it is essentially synonymous with “Wordsworth Country,”
                        “Wordsworth Land,” and other common designations of the Lake District’s
                        literary landscape. Compare “Scott-land,” “Burns Country,” and similar
                        inventions of the period’s travel and heritage industries. </note> It should
                    probably also be said that Wordsworth’s self-quotation performs anthology- and
                    canon-making functions; thus, it becomes difficult to disentangle the long-range
                    effects of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> from the reverberations
                    of his poems. In the end, Wordsworth, his poems, and the terrain he celebrated
                    became inseparable in the public imagination. The increasing popularity of
                    Wordsworth’s poetry from the 1820s through the 1840s mirrored, and probably owed
                    something to, the growing accessibility of the Lake District as tourist terrain.
                    Meanwhile, Lake tourism, helped along by marketing savvy on the poet’s and his
                    publishers’ part, helped consolidate Wordsworth’s Victorian authorial
                    persona.</p>
                <p>We can all be pleased that Wordsworth, despite early misgivings, took up, in his
                    phrase, “a theme so boundless and sublime as this beautiful region.”<note

                    with its earnest affection for its subject. There are moments in the <title

                    literature of power: accounts of the “magical” effects of reflection, light, and
                    mist; striking metaphors; excursions into the clouds and even back in time.
                    Other passages dwell on the small and often overlooked—lichens, wildflowers,
                    ferns, gravel. Such descriptions generate in prose the “poetry of nature”<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> The “poetry of nature” phrase recalls
                        Coleridge’s account of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> in chapter
                        14 of <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>: “During the first year
                        that Mr. Wordsworth and I were neighbours, our conversations turned
                        frequently on the two cardinal points of poetry, the power of exciting the
                        sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature, and
                        the power of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying colours of
                        imagination. The sudden charm, which accidents of light and shade, which
                        moonlight or sunset diffused over a known and familiar landscape, appeared
                        to represent the practicability of combining both. These are the poetry of
                        nature.” </note> for which Wordsworth remains beloved. In short, the book
                    promotes Wordsworthian imagination, “the faculty which produces impressive
                    effects out of simple elements.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Wordsworth’s

                    inviting visitors to read the landscape as they have learned to read
                    Wordsworth’s poems. </p>
                <p>Of course, the history of Wordsworth’s influence hardly ends with the editions of
                    the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> published during his lifetime.
                    Lake District tourism and associated literature continued to grow after the
                    poet’s death, encouraged by improved transportation, the advent of photography,
                    and the enthusiasm of many writers, walkers, tour promoters, artists, and
                    conservationists, notable Wordsworthians among them. While Wordsworth would be
                    pleased by this expansion of his reputation and influence, he probably would
                    feel some discomfort about the further commercialization of “Wordsworth
                    Country.” Late in his life, he famously protested the construction of the Kendal
                    and Windermere Railway, fearing that mass tourism would degrade the Lake
                    District’s “character of seclusion and retirement.”<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> See his letters to the <title level="j">Morning
                        Post</title>, published together in slightly revised and expanded form as a
                        pamphlet: <title level="j">Kendal and Windermere Railway: Two Letters

                            Son, 1844), 6.</note> In this light, it seems ironic that a man
                    so skeptical of tourism should have written a guidebook at all. That said,
                    Wordsworth loved sharing the beauties of the Lakes, and he understood that his
                    own writing had helped produce the demand for tourist literature and
                    infrastructure in the region. He could not really have things both ways. To be
                    sure, Wordsworth never wished the Lake Country to be overrun by visitors
                    unprepared to appreciate it, destroyed by the effects of its own attractions. As
                    he put it in the second of his railway letters, “there are temples of Nature,
                    temples built by the Almighty, which have…claim to be left unviolated.”<note

                    Nonetheless, he could not keep the Lakes to himself, and in candid moments he
                    may have perceived the symbolic appropriateness of having the local train and
                    his appointment as Poet Laureate arrive together in the 1840s. He would now have
                    to accept the crowds at Windermere along with his fan mail and appreciative
                    readership. <title level="m">The Guide </title>thus leaves us with a paradox,
                    and it may be said to have failed in some of its rhetorical aims. Still, signs
                    of the impact of Wordsworth’s taste-shaping efforts, his conservation ethic, and
                    his love of nature abound even now in the Lake District and beyond. </p>
