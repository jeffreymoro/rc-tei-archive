                <p rend="noCount">This appendix assembles illustrative passages from letters related
                    to Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. The appendix favors
                    letters that give sustained, explicit attention to the <title level="m">Guide</title> over those that make only passing reference to the work or its
                    themes. It especially seeks to include selections that shed light on the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s textual history, its reception, and Wordsworth’s
                    thoughts about its qualities and purposes. </p>
                <p rend="noCount">The selections below appear chronologically, grouped into date
                    ranges that reflect key phases in the <title level="m">Guide’s</title> history:
                    1807-1811 (the origination and initial publication of the <title level="m"
                        >Guide</title> in Wilkinson’s <title level="m">Select Views</title>); 1820 (its
                    first appearance under Wordsworth’s name in <title level="m">The River
                        Duddon</title>); 1821-1834 (its evolution into an independent guidebook in the
                    third and fourth editions); 1835-1841 (Wordsworth’s final revisions and sales of
                    the fifth edition); 1842-1850 (the book’s absorption into the Victorian travel
                    book industry in Wordsworth’s twilight years). Throughout the text, we silently
                    regularize punctuation. </p>

                        subjects that would become important in his topographical essays, including

                            Kildwick in North Yorkshire, toured the Lakes in the summer of 1808. He
                            requested a written description of the region from Wordsworth, who in
                            this letter offered several excuses. The poet penned this refusal
                            despite having told Lady Holland in the previous year that he was
                            preparing “a manual for travellers,”<note

                                    letter he would begin work on the letterpress for Wilkinson’s <emph>Select Views</emph>.</note>
                    <p rend="noCount">I am pleased to find that this beautiful country has made such
                        an impression upon you as to induce you to record your feelings: but what
                        shall I say to your request that I should communicate to you some
                        description of the same objects?—Alas! You have but a faint notion how
                        disagreeable writing, of all Sorts, is to me, except from the impulse of the
                        moment. I must be my own Task master or I can do nothing at all. Last autumn
                        I made a little Tour, with my wife, and she was very anxious that I should
                        preserve the memory of it by a written account. I tried to comply with her
                        entreaty, but an insuperable dullness came over me, and I could make no
                        progress.</p>
                    <p rend="noCount">This simple and true statement I am sure you will deem a
                        sufficient apology for not venturing upon a theme so boundless as this
                        sublime and beautiful region. </p>
                    <p rend="noCount">Besides, you can easily conceive that objects may be too
                        familiar to a Man, to leave him the power of describing them. This is the
                        case with me in regard to these Lakes and mountains, which are my native
                        Country, and among which I have passed the greatest part of my life: and
                        really I should be utterly at a loss were I about to set myself to a formal
                        delineation of them, or of any part of them, where to begin, and where to
                        end.</p>

                    <note place="inline" resp="editors">Coleridge had been staying with the
                            Wordsworths at Allan Bank since mid-June. Presumably overwhelmed with
                            his new periodical, <title level="m">The
                            Friend</title>, he suggested Wordsworth as a
                            collaborator for Wilkinson, but Wordsworth was reluctant to compete with
                            his artist friend William Green of Ambleside (1725-1811, <title level="m">DNB</title>). This
                            letter is Wilkinson’s response to Wordsworth’s concerns.</note>

                        arrangements for my publication, and as I have seen some of Mr. Green’s
                        numbers I will be obliged to you if you will tell our friend Wordsworth that
                        no two works, descriptive of the same country can be more different, or less
                        likely to interfere with each other, than his and mine. But I shall write to
                            Mr. Wordsworth in a few days more fully upon the
                        subject when I hope either Mr. W.—or yourself, or both, will afford me the
                        assistance I shall explain, to enable me to make my work more perfect and
                        acceptable to the public than it otherwise would be.</p>

                    <head><emph>Dorothy to Catherine Clarkson</emph>, 18 November 1809</head>
                    <note place="inline" resp="editors">Catherine Clarkson, wife of the
                            prominent abolitionist Thomas Clarkson (1760-1846, <title level="m">DNB</title>), was one
                            of Dorothy’s closest friends. The Clarksons lived in the Lake District
                            from 1796 to 1806, during which time they became intimates of the
                            Wordsworths, but now they had moved back to the south of England.
                            Dorothy praises William’s introduction to <title level="m">Select Views </title>and reports that he is considering publishing his own guidebook apart
                            from Wilkinson, predicting that a guidebook will prove more lucrative
                            than her brother’s poetry. The letter reveals various details about the
                            textual history of <title level="m">Select
                                Views</title>, including that Sara Hutchinson
                            sometimes acted as scribe for the project and that Wordsworth sometimes
                            had to wait for Wilkinson’s prints to arrive.</note>
                    <p rend="noCount">Sara has been kept almost constantly busy in transcribing: for
                        William, and for ‘The Friend’; therefore she has desired me to write to you.
                        For William she has been transcribing the introduction to a collection of
                        prints to be published by Mr. Wilkinson of Thetford (of which I believe you
                        know the history as your husband’s name is down among those of the
                        subscribers). I hope you will be interested with William’s part of the work
                        (he has only finished the general introduction, being unable to do the rest
                        till he has seen the prints). It is the only regular and I may say <emph>scientific</emph> account of the present and past state and
                        appearance of the country that has yet appeared. I think, if he were to
                        write a Guide to the Lakes and prefix this preface, it would sell better,
                        and bring him more money than any of his higher labours. He has some
                        thoughts of doing this; but do not mention it, as Mr. W[ilkinson]’s work
                        should have its fair run. He mentioned to Mr. Wilkinson his scheme, to which
                        I should think that Mr. W. will have no objection; as the Guide will, by
                        calling Mr. W.’s publication to mind, after its first run, perhaps help to
                        keep up the sale.</p>

                            an explanation of his rhetorical aims before moving on to dismiss
                            Wilkinson’s artwork. Sir George (1753-1827, <title level="m">DNB</title>) and Lady
                            Margaret Beaumont were important patrons of the arts, and Sir George was

                    <p rend="noCount">I am very happy that you have read the Introduction with so
                        much pleasure, and must thank you for your kindness in telling me of it. I
                        thought the part about the Cottages well-done; and also liked a sentence
                        where I transport the Reader to the top of one of the Mountains, or rather
                        to the Cloud chosen for his station, and give a sketch of the impressions
                        which the Country might be supposed to make on a feeling mind, contemplating
                        its appearance before it was inhabited. But what I wished to accomplish was
                        to give a model of the manner in which topographical descriptions ought to
                        be executed, in order to their being either useful or intelligible, by
                        evolving truly and distinctly one appearance from another. In this I think I
                        have not wholly failed.</p>

                    <p rend="noCount">The drawings, or Etchings, or whatever they may be called,
                        are, I know, such as to you and Sir George must be intolerable. You will
                        receive from them that sort of disgust which I do from bad Poetry, a disgust
                        which can never be felt in its full strength, but by those who are practised
                        in an art, as well as Amateurs of it. I took Sir George’s subscription as a
                        kindness done to myself; and Wilkinson, though not superabundant in good
                        sense, told me that he saw it in that light. I do however sincerely hope
                        that the Author and his Wife (who certainly, notwithstanding her faults and
                        foibles, is no ordinary Woman) may be spared any mortification from hearing
                        them condemned severely by acknowledged judges. They will please many who in
                        all the arts are most taken with what is most worthless. I do not mean that
                        there is not in simple and unadulterated minds a sense of the beautiful and
                        sublime in art; but into the hands of few such do prints or picture
                        fall.</p>

                        interests of Author and Publisher might be fairly and best promoted.—I am
                        persuaded that this little Book would have a considerable sale, if any

                        the Lake district, and in the leading Towns of the North. Of course an
                        arrangement would be expedient so that the Book might be had at Messrs.
                        Longmans and Moxon my Publishers in London, and any other Bookseller.</p>

                            his poetry and prose. Reed had written to the poet in January 1839,
                            thanking him for a copy of the 1835 <title level="m"

                            turned out to be a fairly typical North American response: “It may not

                            nature should afford so much value to a distant reader as I have drawn
                            from it. I have found it a guide to the mind in kindred scenes and that
                            it cultivates a taste for landscape which finds its indulgence in the
                            worthy admiration of regions that are accessible to us.”<note xml:id="ftn8" place="foot" n="8" resp="editors"> A

                            in finding so much more of permanent and universal interest than I had

                            perceive that the Tract is rich in the same elements of thought and

                        this were preferred much, by the generality of Tourists, to mine, which,

                        real use, appeared to be wanting in this respect. The employment to which I
                        had by a sort of promise committed myself I found upon further consideration

                        and separated from other matter, and so it now stands. Every thing of mine

                    <p rend="noCount">I am sorry to say that your letter and proof arrived together
                        with several other communications and putting yours aside I entirely forgot
                        it till this morning. I wrote to Prof. Sedgwick in answer to a Letter from
                        him, pressing him to prepare the essay as soon as he could; which I have no
                        doubt he will do.—Any thing I have to say, had better be reserved for a
                        brief advertisement. I am truly sorry to have disdained your proof as
                        mentioned; but will take care the like shall not occur in future. The
                        introduction is well planned and I wish you success in the [? onerous]

                    <p rend="noCount">I snatch a moment from the hurry of this place to thank you
                        for the first of the Series of Letters on the Geology of the Lake district
                        which you have done me the honor of addressing to me. I received it
                        yesterday from Mr. Danby,<note xml:id="ftn14" place="foot" n="14" resp="editors"> F. C.

                            first approached Sedgwick though this mutual acquaintance.</note> liked
                        it very much, and am impatient for the rest. It will give the Kendal lake
                        Book so decided a superiority over every other, that the Publishers have
                        good reason to rejoice. I am happy to think that my endeavours to illustrate
                        the beautiful Region may be thought not unworthy of accompanying your
                        scientific researches. I address this to you at random, but hope it will be
                        forwarded should you be no longer at Cambridge. </p>
                    <p rend="noCount">You perhaps don’t remember that the Pocket Hammerers were
                        complained of not by me in my own person, but in the character of a
                        splenetic Recluse; I will, however, frankly own that to a certain extent I
                            <emph>sympathized</emph> with my imaginary personage, but I am
                        sure I need not define for you how far, but no farther, I went along with
                        him. Geology and <emph>Minerology</emph> are very different
                        things.</p>
