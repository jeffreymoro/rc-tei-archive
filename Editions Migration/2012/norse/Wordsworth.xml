            <head>William Wordsworth (1770–1850)</head>
            <p>Wordsworth is considered one of the canonical poets of the Romantic Age, not
                        least for the  collection <hi rend="ital">Lyrical Ballads</hi> (first
                        published 1798), on which he collaborated with Samuel Taylor 
                        Coleridge. Wordsworth was born in Cockermouth, Cumberland, in the Lake
                        District, which had  been settled by Norsemen – although it was
                        technically outside of the Danelaw (the area in which  Danish law
                        obtained, according to the treaty between King Alfred and the Viking invader
                        Guthrum  from the late ninth century). “The Danish Boy”
                        is one of the only places, where this fact is turned  into a poetic
                        theme. Wordsworth was made Poet Laureate in 1843.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi rend="ital">[The Danish Boy] A Fragment</hi> (1800).<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">In
                                    editions of Wordsworth’s poems until 1836, this poem was
                                    known only as <hi rend="ital">A Fragment.</hi> From 1836 onwards
                                    it was  named <hi rend="ital">The Danish Boy. A
                                        Fragment.</hi>
                  </note>
               </head>
               <p>Wordsworth spent the winter 1798–99 with his sister, Dorothy, and
                            S. T. Coleridge in Goslar,  Germany. There, he wrote several works,
                            including the enigmatic “Lucy” poems and the poem of 
                            the Boy of Winander. The “Fragment” on the Danish Boy,
                            which first appeared in <hi rend="ital">Lyrical Ballads</hi>
                             (2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> ed., 1800), has a theme in common
                            with these: the death of a young person.</p>
               <p>The scene of the poem appears to be set in the landscapes of
                            Wordsworth’s native north-west  England. Like “The
                            Thorn” from <hi rend="ital">Lyrical Ballads</hi>, this is also a
                            poem about a haunted place, which  seems like it is based on local
                            folklore. However, in 1843, when Wordsworth dictated to his friend 
                            Isabella Fenwick a set of notes to his poems (intended as a reference
                            guide for his family and heirs),  he made clear that the
                            “Fragment” was “entirely a fancy”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">

                            Wordsworth added a note that gave a background for this

                            in which he had taken refuge. The House fell under a curse, and the
                            Spirit of the  Youth, it was believed, haunted the Valley where the
                            crime had been committed.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="3">

               <p>The poem is remarkable in presenting English violence against the Danes,
                            when Viking rovers  were otherwise known as the “Cruel
                            Dane”, as Wordsworth has it in “The Danish
                            Conquest”, a poem  from his late poetic cycle of <hi rend="ital">Ecclesiastical Sketches</hi>. Danish violence may be
                            condemned, but the  late poem focuses on the Danes’ ability
                            to integrate into English society with their conversion to 
                            Christianity. The early “Fragment” emphasizes the poetic
                            abilities of northern warriors, who (like  Regnar Lodbrog or Harold
                            Hardrade) were reputedly accomplished skalds.</p>

                            Seashore</hi> (1820)</head>
            <p>Wordsworth honoured the Danish King Canute (reigned in England
                        1016–1035) as a monarch who  set the Christian Lord higher than
                        earthly kingship. In Wordsworth’s poem “Canute” from
                        the 
                        <hi rend="ital">Ecclesiastical Sonnets</hi> series, the Danish ruler sails
                        past the monastery of Ely and is captivated by  the devout and
                        beautiful song of the monks emanating from there. Wordsworth based the first
                        part  of “A Fact, and an Imagination”, from the same
                        series, on John Milton’s <hi rend="ital">History of Britain</hi>
                        (1670),  where the story of Canute’s demonstration of
                        God’s infinite power is told.</p>
            <p>The relevant passage is</p>
            <quote>Canute was famous through <hi rend="ital">Europe</hi>, and much
                        honour’d of <hi rend="ital">Conrade</hi> the emperor, then at <hi rend="ital">Rome</hi>,  with rich Gifts and many Grants of what he
                        there demanded for the freeing of passages from Toll  and Custom. I
                        must not omit one remarkable action done by him, as <hi rend="ital">Huntingdon</hi> reports it, with  great scene of Circumstance, and
                        emphatical Expression, to shew the small Power of Kings in  respect of
                        God; which, unless to Court Parasites, needed no such laborious
                        Demonstration. He  caus’d his Royal Seat to be set on the shore,
                        while the tide was coming in; and with all the state  that Royalty
                        could put into his countenance, said thus to the Sea; “Thou Sea
                        belongest to me, and  the Land whereon I sit is mine; nor hath any one
                        unpunish’d resisted my commands: I charge  thee come no further
                        upon my Land, neither presume to wet the Feet of thy Sovereign Lord.”
                        But  the Sea, as before, came rowling on, and without Reverence both
                        wet and dash’d him. Whereat  the King quickly rising,
                        wish’d all about him to behold and consider the weak and frivolous
                         Power of a King, and that none indeed deserv’d the Name of a
                        King, but he whose eternal Laws  both Heaven, Earth, and Sea obey. A
                        Truth so evident of it self, as I said before, that unless to  shame
                        his Court-flatterers, who would not else be convinc’d, <hi rend="ital">Canute</hi> needed not to have gone  wet-shod home: The
                        best is, from that time forth he never would wear a Crown, esteeming 
                        earthly Royalty contemptible and vain.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="4">

            <p>Milton refers to the medieval historian Henry of Huntingdon (c.

            <p>Wordsworth adds a self-invented story concerning King Alfred (reigned
                        871–899) to the  legendary account of Canute. This second part,
                        a product of the poet’s own “imagination”, also uses
                         the powers of nature as a metaphor.</p>
