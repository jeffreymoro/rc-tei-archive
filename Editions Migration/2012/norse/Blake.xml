            <head>William Blake (1757–1827)</head>
            <p>William Blake was a poet, painter and printmaker. He is known as the most
                        singularly unique artist  of his age. Although virtually unknown during
                        his lifetime, his productions in both word and picture  have inspired many, including William Butler Yeats, the Beat poets, and the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch.</p>
            <p>In his poetry, Blake is interested in all mythological systems, which he
                        generally finds  inadequate or false. He mentions Odin, Thor and
                        Frigga, but also a deeper impact of the <hi rend="ital">Eddas</hi> on 
                        his own self-invented mythological system has been observed.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">Theodore T.
                                Stenberg, “Blake’s Indebtedness to the <hi rend="ital">Eddas</hi>”, <hi rend="ital">Modern Language Review</hi>
                                18.2 (1923): 204–206.</note> In one of his
                        marginal notes to a  book in his library, he lists the <hi rend="ital">Edda</hi> as one among a number of works that are inspired, as the
                         biblical testaments were.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">Annotations to Bishop Waton’s <hi rend="ital">Apology for the Bible</hi> (1798), in <hi rend="ital">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, ed.

                                543.</note> There seems to be direct borrowing from Thomas
                        Gray’s English  appropriation of Norse mythology: like
                        Gray’s Loki, who will “burst his tenfold chain” at 
                        <hi rend="ital">Ragnarök</hi>, Blake’s rebellious son Orc
                        breaks free from his “tenfold chains” in the beginning of 
                        <hi rend="ital">America</hi> (1793), as a sign of the old order ending and a
                        new beginning.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="3">Blake, <hi rend="ital">America</hi>, pl. 1, l. 12, in

                                5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Blake began as a writer of poetry supporting radical politics. This can be
                        seen in his enthusiastic  response to the upheaval in France, the
                        unpublished <hi rend="ital">The French Revolution</hi> (1791), in <hi rend="ital">Songs of  Innocence and Experience</hi>
                        (1789–1793), and the prophetic verses of <hi rend="ital">America</hi>

            <p>“Gwin. King of Norway” is from The <hi rend="ital">Poetical
                            Sketches</hi> (1783), Blake’s earliest verses (written 
                        between c. 1769 and 1778). This publication of Blake’s juvenilia was
                        financed by the sculptor John  Flaxman and his friends, the Rev. A. S.
                        Mathew and his wife Harriet, who hosted a London literary  and artistic
                        circle to which the young Blake had been invited. The poems are generally
                        imitative:  there are imitations of eighteenth-century popular nature
                        poetry, “King Edward the Third” is a  Shakespearean
                        drama, while “Imitation of Spenser” is self-explanatory.
                        “Gwin, King of Norway”  and “Fair Elenor”
                        reconstruct the form of ancient ballads. At the time <hi rend="ital">Poetical Sketches</hi> was  published, the ballad form was
                        increasingly associated with radicalism and the people’s rebellion.
                         This was made evident in the radical antiquary Joseph Ritson’s
                        three-volume <hi rend="ital">A Select Collection of  English Songs</hi>
                        (1783).</p>
            <p>Inspiration from Thomas Percy’s <hi rend="ital">Reliques of Ancient
                            English Poetry</hi> (1765) and Macpherson’s  Ossian poetry
                        (1760–1763) is diffused throughout. The most conspicuous references
                        in his poem of  Gwin’s fall are to Thomas Chatterton’s
                        forged translation “Godred Crovan” (1769). Godred (d. 
                        1095) was a Norse-Gael ruler of Dublin, the Isle of Man and the Hebrides.
                        Chatterton’s poem  details a significant battle in the campaign
                        to invade the Isle of Man. Blake takes the Norse  connection and
                        creates an early political hymn. However, Blake’s Gordred has little
                        in common  with Chatterton’s king Godred, who is also described
                        as “rising” himself to battle; but this is not a  popular
                        uprising. However, the link between liberty and the Old North was
                        sufficiently made in  Paul Henri-Mallet’s chapter “Of the
                        Form of Government which formerly prevailed in the North”.</p>
            <p>Blake’s Gordred figure is a “giant”, symbolizing the
                        will of the people against the tyrant king.  He rises to overturn Gwin,
                        pointing forward to the giant Albion who rises to assert his ancient 
                        liberties against oppression, religious and political, in Blake’s
                        later poetry. The diction of the poem  also anticipates many of the
                        later images he connects with political upheaval, depicted as a 
                        cataclysmic change, such as the blazing comets, rolling clouds, thunder and
                        trumpets.</p>
