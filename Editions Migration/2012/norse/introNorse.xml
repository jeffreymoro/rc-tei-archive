                                1760–1830</title> collects twenty-one British writers 
                            from c. 1760–1830, a period which is today associated with the
                            rise of Romantic sensibilities. A  number of literary works in
                            Britain were inspired by Old Norse manuscripts, collections of Danish
                             folklore or similar such texts from Scandinavia. The  periodical press printed a
                            number of original Norse-inspired verses and generally reviewed the
                             works that dealt with the subject.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">For a full list of

                  <p>Recent anthologies, reader’s companions and critical discussions
                            have engaged with  Romanticism’s fascination with the
                            mysterious or foreign “other” in the attempt to define
                            British  national and ethnic identities. In these works, the East
                            (Orientalism) has been a significant  preoccupation. The
                            Scandinavian-inspired texts included in this electronic edition shift
                            the  geographical focus to the North. Pre-Romantic and Romantic
                            appropriations of Old Norse religion  and practices may have
                            constituted yet another form of sensationalist writing –
                            especially in the  way it became associated with Gothic terror
                            – but it was equally an attempt to recover a national  past.
                            Part of the reason for the appearance of Norse
                            “medievalism” in British texts was the belief  that
                            Icelandic texts represented the pre-Christian traditions of the
                            Anglo-Saxons, traditions which  had not been recorded in writing in
                            Britain due to the early introduction of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>The majority of the examples selected for this edition are by well-known
                            writers (Thomas Gray,  William Blake, William Wordsworth, Robert
                            Southey, Walter Scott, Ann Radcliffe etc.), but the  available
                            editions of these authors’ works generally lack the contextual
                            framework, commentaries,  and annotations which are needed to give
                            meaning to their use of Scandinavian material. Writers who are lesser known figures today have also been included. Their writings (in
                            most cases not  available in modern editions) are interesting in
                            their own right for the success they enjoyed at the  time; but they
                            also help to reconnect the poems of the major Romantic figures with
                            their original  literary context.</p>
                  <p>The texts are selected in order to exemplify the wide spectrum of
                            interest in medieval northern forms: from skaldic song to
                            sagas, addressing subjects such as pagan heroism, mythology,  and
                            folklore. The texts can be divided into two groups. One is the attempt
                            at translating  Scandinavian manuscript poems (through Latin).
                            These compositions are best described as  resourceful
                            “imitations” or free “adaptations”, rather
                            than attempts at philologically accurate  translation. The second
                            group – the majority of examples – consists of original
                            compositions. For  both types, the editorial head-notes will
                            explain how the textual universe of the Norse Middle Ages  came to
                            serve contemporary ends: ideologically, nationally, and in terms of
                            defining an alternative  to hackneyed Neoclassical aesthetics.</p>
                  <p>This introduction will describe the emergence and development of literary
                            interest in  Scandinavian matters: the early discovery of Old
                            Norse/Scandinavian texts, the use of these in the  construction of
                            an Anglo-Saxon past, and the themes on which Scandinavian-inspired
                            literature was  focused.</p>

                  <p>The interest in Old Norse poetry began in the seventeenth century in
                            Scandinavia as part of a  nationalist-antiquarian movement. Many of
                            the critical works produced at this time achieved  European-wide
                            circulation and were used as reference books by authors of the Romantic
                            era. An  important early work was the Danish antiquary <ref target="../images/OleWorm.jpg">Ole
                            Worm’s <title>[Runer] seu Danica literatura 
                                antiquissima</title></ref> (1636, rev. 1651). The title means
                            “Runes [transcribed in runic script], or the Old  Danish
                            Literature”. Worm was primarily concerned with runic inscriptions
                            on stones and other  objects, but, in an appendix, he printed two
                            poems: the Death Song of Ragnar Lodbrog (Ragnarr 
                            Loðbrók) and the composition known as
                                <title>Höfuðlausn</title>
                            (“Head-Ransom”) by Egill Skallagrímsson. 
                            These were both skaldic poems, i.e. part of a Scandinavian poetic court
                            tradition. The Icelandic  antiquary and poet Magnús
                            Ólafsson assisted Worm in translating these poems into Latin.
                            But, in  the printed version, a transcription into runic script was
                            also added. The reason for this was that  Worm erroneously assumed
                            that all Old Norse literature had originally been recorded in runes,
                             before Scandinavian countries were converted to Christianity and
                            Roman letters.</p>
                  <p>In fact, runes were not part of manuscript culture, but intended and used
                            only for inscription on  hard surfaces, such as wood and metal.
                            Nonetheless, Worm’s mistaken theory was generally  accepted,
                            and Norse literature and culture came to be known as
                            “Runic”, an adjective often used in  English from the
                            seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, especially in relation to
                            poetic  composition. The important statesman and writer Sir William
                            Temple wrote in his essay “Of  Poetry” (1690):
                            “Runes were properly the Name of the ancient Gothic letters or
                            characters … But,  because all the writings they had among
                            them of many ages were in verse, it came to be the  common name of
                            all sorts of poetry among the Goths”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="3">

                  <p>The use of the term <hi rend="ital">Goth</hi>, and its adjective <hi rend="ital">Gothic</hi>, also had wide application, referring more
                             broadly to medieval Germanic/Teutonic culture. Part of the reason
                            for the adoption of this term was  the popularity of the
                            sixth-century Ostrogothic historian Jordanes, who had spoken about <hi rend="ital">Scandza</hi>
                             (Scandinavia) as “a hive of tribes or certainly a womb of
                            nations [<hi rend="ital">vagina nationum</hi>]” from which 
                            many European peoples had come.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="4">

                            when he  explained that the Anglo-Saxons were “one branch of

                                Hive”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="5">

                             came to mean “medieval Germanic”. Since anglophone

                            almost exclusively from what was revealed in Scandinavian sources
                            (primarily Icelandic texts), the  medieval warrior culture they
                            described is most accurately labelled <hi rend="ital">Gothic/Scandinavian</hi>. This  combined term will be used in
                            this introduction to indicate when an idea of the Anglo-Saxon or 
                            Germanic past relies on the images provided in Old Norse texts.</p>
                  <p>A significant source of knowledge about the religious concepts of the old
                            Gothic North was  revealed in the two <title>Eddas</title>. A key
                            figure in bringing these manuscripts to a wider readership was the 
                            Danish scholar Peder Hansen Resen (Lat. Resenius, 1625–1688). In
                            1665, he produced the first  Latin edition of Snorri
                            Sturluson’s <title>Prose Edda</title> (1220s), entitled
                                <title>Edda Islandorum</title>. In the same year,  Resen also
                            published examples from the <title>Poetic Edda</title>, a
                            thirteenth-century collection of much older  mythological and
                            heroic lays. In <title>Ethica odini pars Eddœ Sœmundi
                                vocata Haavamaal</title>, he printed  the long Odin-poem
                                <title>Hávamál</title> (“Sayings of the High
                            One”); and in <title>Philosophia antiquissima 
                                norvego-danica dicta Volupsa</title>, we find the apocalyptic <hi rend="ital">Völuspá</hi> (Prophecy of the Seeress).
                            The  latter especially, was seen to provide a parallel to the
                            biblical destruction at the end of the  world, was repeatedly
                            translated and referred to by English writers.</p>
                  <p>It had long been known that the English language had adopted some names
                            of the weekdays  from the Norse pantheon: Tuesday (Tiu or Tyr),
                            Wednesday (Woden), Thursday (Thor), and Friday  (Frigg or

                            the  Cambridge linguist Robert Sheringham. In <ref target="../images/Sheringham.jpg"><title>De Anglorum
                                gentis origine disceptatio</title> (Treatise on the  Origins of

                            establish links to pre-Christian mythology and religion, as this
                            was believed to have been practised by the pagan Anglo- 
                            Saxons.</p>
                  <p>Sheringham’s history of the English people was concerned with the
                            remarkable courage and  inherent love of liberty in the Gothic
                            race. As exemplification, he quotes stanzas 25 and 29 from
                            Worm’s Latin translation of Ragnar’s Death Song.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="7">Robert

                                    322, 358.</note> In the poem, Ragnar recalls his warrior
                             feats from a pit of poisonous snakes, into which he has been
                            thrown by his enemy, King Ella of  Northumbria. Ragnar faces his
                            own finality with the famous remark “I die laughing” (in
                            Worms’s  edition: <hi rend="ital">ridens moriar</hi>), which
                            concludes the poem. The reason for the triumphant pose can be 
                            gleaned from the preceding stanzas, in which Ragnar makes clear that he
                            is secured a place in  Odin’s Valhalla
                                (<title>Valhöll</title>, “hall of the slain”),
                            a privilege reserved only for those who prove their  bravery on the
                            battlefield. In the <title>Gylfaginning</title> (The Tricking of Gylfi)
                            section of the <title>Prose Edda</title>,  Snorri Sturluson created
                            a vigorous image of Valhalla, where dead warriors fight all day in 
                            preparation for the final battle against evil, and are rewarded by drink
                            and mead provided afresh  each night. Despite the many
                            appropriations of this theme as it appears in the Death Song, it was
                             never noted that Ragnar’s poem is in fact an aberration in
                            this respect: it is one of only a few cases  in the whole body of
                            Norse literature where a non-battle death makes the hero eligible for
                            Valhalla.</p>
                  <p>Stanzas 25 and 29, in which Ragnar explains the religious motives for his
                            courageous defiance of  death, were quoted time and again by
                            subsequent British writers. Only six years after Sheringham’s
                             publication, the antiquary Aylett Sammes translated these stanzas
                            into English in his in <title>Britannia  antiqua illustrata: Or,

                            Bartholin. In this thesis, the author promoted the theory that the

                             (1755, rev. ed. 1763, 1773). This work deals with the ancient
                            history and religion of the North.  Mallet relied to a large extent
                            on literary texts, from which he drew information about the manners
                             of the Old Scandinavians. The second work was <title>Monumens de

                            reception was more modest.  Reviews in the <title>Monthly

                            the material, he became interested in the  aesthetic appeal of
                            Norse poetry. In the second edition, Mallet added passages to his text
                            addressing  the merits of Norse poetics and its connection with the
                                sublime.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="17">
                                     For Mallet’s changing approach to

                            that could  inspire an emergent Romantic sensibility. Mallet is
                            referred to in the notes accompanying several of  the poems in this
                            anthology.</p>
                  <p>Another reason for the positive reception of <title>Northern
                                Antiquities</title> in Britain was that Mallet’s 
                            description of the Scandinavian pre-Christian culture could be seen as
                            valid for the study of early  English history. Percy with his
                            publisher Thomas Carnan, a former associate with the famous 
                            bookseller John Newbery, announced on the title page of the English
                            translation that the volumes  contained not only information about
                            “the ancient Danes”, but also about “our own Saxon
                             ancestors”. This was despite the fact that Mallet only
                            mentions the Anglo-Saxons in passing.</p>
                  <p>This was not the only alteration introduced in the English version.
                            Mallet had not adequately  distinguished between Celtic and
                            Germanic peoples, using the designation <hi rend="ital">Celtique</hi>
                            indiscriminately  about all northern peoples. Thus, when speaking
                            about the Germanic ancestors, Mallet refers to the  Druids (an
                            exclusively Celtic priesthood). This ethnic and cultural confusion was
                            often perpetuated  in authoritative sources, such as Philipp
                            Clüver’s <title>Germaniae Antiquae</title> (Leiden, 1616),
                            Johann  Georg Keysler’s <title>Antiquitates selectae

                            Pelloutier, for example, held that the German  language derived

                            English  edition of Mallet’s work, he painstakingly labours
                            out the differences between the “two races of  men”
                            as “ <hi rend="ital">ab origine</hi> distinct”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="19"> Mallet,

                            confusion in the form of notes and  annotations, and supplanting

                            the Anglo-Saxons were part of a wider North Sea culture had slowly
                            emerged in the course of the  seventeenth-century. At the beginning
                            of the eighteenth century, the Oxford philologist George  Hickes
                            (1642–1715) tied Norse poetry to English tradition in his
                            monumental <title>Linguarum veterum  septentrionalium thesaurus

                            volumes  between 1703 and 1705. Hickes’s investigation into
                            “northern” cultures presented itself as a rather 
                            haphazard amalgamation of Anglo-Saxon and medieval Germanic cultures, as
                            this could possibly  be recovered through numismatics, linguistics
                            and poetics.</p>

                                    not  exclusively, on Hickes’s grammar in the first
                                    volume of the <title>Thesaurus</title>. Hence, she deals with
                                    the “<title>Saxon Poems</title>”, as  these
                                    are “made up of words purely <hi rend="ital">Saxon</hi>,

                            and Anglo-Saxon heroic traditions in the discussion of the  poem
                            known as “The Waking of Angantyr” (lines originally

                            Heiðreks). This poem presents a dialogue between the
                            shield-maiden Hervor and her dead  father Angantyr over possession
                            of the magical sword Tyrfing. Hickes prints the poem alongside  the
                            Anglo-Saxon fragment <title>The Battle of Finnsburh</title>, where a
                            sword with similar lightening  properties is mentioned.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="24"> Hickes,

                                    After this was destroyed,  the transcript of the poem
                                    survived only through Hickes’s work.</note> Hickes
                            was the first to translate a Norse poem into English in its

                  <p>Hickes’s claim that Old Norse and Anglo-Saxon language and
                            traditions were closely related  was taken up by later
                            eighteen-century promoters of Nordic poetry, not least Thomas Percy. In
                             connection with his new translation of the Hervor/Angantyr
                            dialogue in <title>Five Pieces of Runic Poetry  Translated from the
                                Islandic Language</title> (1763), Percy refers to Hickes’s
                            studies. In the preface to  this short volume, Percy follows
                            Hickes’s lead in emphasizing the linguistic closeness of the
                            Saxon  language to Norse, using the filial metaphor: “sister
                                dialect”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="25">

                            Icelandic  manuscripts were relevant for Anglo-Saxons. This was due
                            to the fact that Iceland was converted to  Christianity so late
                            (the Alting made it law in 999 or 1000); thus, they had preserved their
                            “original  manners and customs longer than any other of the
                            Gothic tribes”, securing the survival of their  literary
                            representations “down nearer to our own time”, i.e. long

                  <p>In one of the notes to the translation of Mallet’s <title>Northern
                                Antiquities</title>, Percy argues even more  sharply that
                            Anglo-Saxon literary practices can be gleaned from skaldic odes:
                  <quote>As to the Anglo-Saxon, and Icelandic poetry: these will be allowed to be
                            in all respects  congenial, because of the great affinity between
                            the two languages, and between the nations who  spoke them. They
                            were both Gothic Tribes, and used two not very different dialects of the
                            same  Gothic language. Accordingly we find a very strong
                            resemblance in their versification,  phraseology and poetic
                            allusions ….<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="27">

                  In a letter from February 1764, Percy proposed that “Icelandic was
                            a kind of court language, as  French is now”, understood in
                            royal circles throughout Scandinavia, England, and the Atlantic

                                    Percy’s argument takes its cue from
                                    Torfæus’s preface to his <title>Orcades</title>
                                    (1697).</note> In fact, Percy had originally imagined a
                            sense of continuity between his most famous  collection,
                                <title>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</title> (first ed. 1765),
                            and his anthology of Norse verses.  The minor poet William
                            Shenstone, acting as Percy’s literary mentor, suggested that the
                            Old Norse  poems could be included in <title>Reliques of Ancient

                            evidence, primarily of a dubious anecdotal nature, that Scandinavian
                            skalds had  travelled with the Germanic invaders of Britain in the
                            fifth century, and there created an unbroken  line of singers,
                            developing into the later well-documented medieval profession of
                            theminstrel.</p>
                  <p>Like Percy, the poet Thomas Gray also seems to have studied early English
                            and Old Norse  poetry in tandem. In the advertisement to
                            Gray’s two famous Norse odes, he explains that the  examples
                            were originally translated to illustrate how Scandinavian verses were an
                            early influence  on English poetry, through the incursion of
                            Scandinavian invasions into the British Isles. The poetic  history,
                            on which he collaborated with the poet William Mason, was later aborted;
                            but both Gray  and Mason later published the Norse pieces that they
                            had translated for the project. Their three  poems are found in
                            this electronic edition.</p>

                            poetry” altogether and begin his account only after the Norman
                            Conquest. The  reason for this, he explains in the preface, is that
                            “Saxon poems are for the most part religious 
                            rhapsodies” and therefore not marked by the images of the people
                            in their native state.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="33">

                                <title>Beowulf</title>, the major Old English  heroic epic, had
                            not been discovered, and it would not be translated into modern English
                            until 1837.</p>
                  <p>For this reason, Warton looked to Old Norse poetry for a sense of what
                            pre-Christian Anglo-  Saxon poetry would have looked like. In the

                            the continuity between Norse and Saxon literary pasts. He spends several
                            pages on  giving an account of how Norse poetry was introduced into

                  <p>The theory that Anglo-Saxon manners could be recuperated from the
                            evidence of their  Scandinavian brethren was generally accepted.
                            James Macpherson, in his <title>An Introduction to the  History of
                                Great Britain and Ireland</title> (1771; rev. 1772, 1773), has
                            recourse to the <title>Prose Edda</title> and  Ragnar’s
                            Death Song and other example of Viking-related literature to draw the
                            lineaments of  Anglo-Saxon attitudes. When
                            François-René de Chateaubriand wrote about the history of
                            English  Literature in 1836, he noted: “it would be almost
                            impossible to take a separate view of literature  during the epoch
                            of the Anglo-Saxons and that of the Danes; I shall therefore treat of

                  </p>
                  <p>When it came to literary texts about England’s past as part of a
                            Viking empire, a number of  poems were written. In the electronic
                            edition, examples are William Wordsworth’s lyrical ballad 
                            “The Danish Boy”, as well as his later poem on King
                            Canute. Richard Hole and Walter Scott use  Viking England as their
                            historical setting. But often, literary texts borrowing ideas of heroism
                            and  pagan religion from Scandinavian sources presented these as
                            characteristics of the pagan Anglo-  Saxons, without mentioning the
                            Viking invasions.</p>
                  <p>In translating Norse poetry into English, the influence of James
                            Macpherson’s “translations”  from the
                            fourth-century Celtic bard Ossian cannot be underestimated. The first
                            instalment of this  purportedly ancient oral tradition was
                            published as <title>Fragments of Ancient Poetry, Collected in the 
                                Highlands of Scotland</title> in 1760. Thomas Gray had seen two
                            specimens of Macpherson’s  compositions before of their
                            appearance in print. In a letter, he wrote that he was in “ <hi rend="ital">extasie</hi> with  their infinite beauty”,
                            although unsettled about their authenticity.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="38">

                                Poetry</title>, Thomas Percy is candid about his motives for 
                            publishing when he refers to Macpherson’s
                            “translations”: “It would be as vain to deny, as it
                            is  perhaps impolitic to mention, that this attempt is owing to the
                            success of the ERSE [i.e. Scots-  Gaelic] fragments”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="40">
                        <title>Five Pieces</title>, [v].</note> Already in a letter
                            dated 21 July 1761, to the Welsh antiquary Evan Evans,  Percy
                            argued that his motive for putting together the collection was to
                            restore balance in the book  market, which he believed was
                            overzealous for Scottish poetry. Percy complains that the Scots are
                             “everywhere recommending the antiquities of their country
                            to public notice, vindicating it’s [sic]  history, setting
                            off it’s poetry”. In this letter, Percy refers to the
                            Ossian <title>Fragments</title> as part of the  Scotophilia
                            dominating the literary book market, while he mentions the plans for
                            publishing both  Old Norse poetry and <title>Reliques</title> as a
                            means to vindicate English history.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="41">

                            Evans’s researches into Welsh antiquity, acted on Percy as a
                            catalyst: a  Gothic/Anglo-Saxon tradition that could rival the
                            Celtic antiquities would be located and offered to  the public.</p>
                  <p>However, for a number of other translators and poets, the Norse tradition
                            was not taken up  primarily for competitive or nationalist reasons,
                            but because it provided scope for expanding a  heroic, vernacular
                            imagination independent of Macpherson’s politically
                            problematically and  historically questionable Ossian. Nonetheless,
                            a number of literary writers backed both horses:  Thomas James
                            Mathias included in his <title>Runic Odes: Imitated from the Norse
                                Tongue in the Manner  of Mr. Gray</title> (first ed. 1781), a
                            poem inspired by “Images selected from the Works attributed to
                             Ossian”; Frank Sayers’s <title>Dramatic Sketches of
                                the Ancient Northern Mythology</title> (1790) contained 
                            inspiration from both Norse and Celtic traditions; and <title>Poems
                                Chiefly by Gentlemen of Devonshire  and Cornwall</title>
                            (1792), edited by Richard Polwhele, printed translations and imitations
                            of both Norse  and Ossianic poetry. Richard Hole, who contributed a
                            Norse poem (from <title>Njal’s Saga</title>, through 
                            Bartholin) to this last collection, had previously published a
                                <title>Poetical Translation of Fingal</title> (1772).  Finally,
                            Thomas Love Peacock uses Macpherson’s Ossianic terminology when
                            composing the  Norse-inspired <title>Fiolfar</title> (1806).</p>
                  <p>But it was not only in England that there was an interest in the Norse
                            past. Historically, the  Okney Isles and the Hebrides had also been
                            affected by Viking imperialism. Indeed, a syncretic  culture of
                            Norse-Gaels (or <hi rend="ital">Gall Gaidel</hi>), a people dominating
                            the Irish Seas and western Scotland  for a substantial part of the
                            Middle Ages, had developed in these regions. In Ragnar Lodbrog’s
                             Death Song (which begins this anthology), we find a list of
                            military battles and conquests, including  several British
                            locations, such as Orkneys, Hebrides, Scotland and Northumbria. In fact,
                            some  critics have argued that the original may have been written
                            in, or at least taken a route past, the  Orkneys.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="42"> These theories are

                            Shetland only  became Scottish territory in 1472, as a result of
                            the marriage between James III of Scotland and  Margaret, daughter
                            of the Danish king Christian I. The islands preserved the <hi rend="ital">Norn</hi> language, a  descendent of Norse, which

                            Caithness, in the northern Scottish Highlands. Gray found the poem in

                            made several translations of Norse texts relevant  to the
                            northernmost British Isles: <title>Anecdotes of Olave the Black King of

                            stand as the first saga texts translated into English.  Later, in
                            1786, Johnstone published a compilation of Old Norse sagas,
                                <title>Antiquitates Celto-  Scandicae</title>, with texts in
                            Icelandic and Latin. In the notes, he often turns his attention to

                  <p>In the eighteenth century, national and literary history was reconceived
                            under the sign of the bard,  with Ossian as the most conspicuous
                            example. The bardic voice would speak to and for his age. In 
                            English poems on Norse themes, focus is often on the skalds and their
                            ability to move men to heroic  action (rather than the deeds
                            themselves). The skald’s task was to commemorate great battles in
                             immortal verse and thereby encourage new fervour. This became
                            symbolic of the poetic voice  possessing a mystical power capable
                            of commanding social action. It is possible to read these  examples
                            as an expression of anxiety about the poet’s social role in the
                            modern world. The poet’s  role, as it is well known, was a
                            central Romantic concern, leading to the aggrandizement of the poet
                             as a guide and teacher of mankind. In the present anthology,
                            Thomas Penrose’s <title>The Carousal of  Odin</title> deals
                            centrally with the skaldic voice, while Edward Jerningham, in <title>The
                                Rise and Progress of  the Scandinavian Poetry</title>, has the
                            “hallow’d bards” impart “truth” and
                            “touch with joy the human  heart,/ In man’s too
                            transient perishable frame”. Both Thomas Percy in <title>An Essay
                                on the Ancient  Minstrels in England</title> and Thomas Warton
                            in <title>Of the Origin of Romantic Fiction in Europe</title> call 
                            attention to the skald as a pivotal and revered figure in societies of
                            old.</p>
                  <p>Beyond the national and historical interest in Gothic/Scandinavian
                            poetry, British poets also had  literary reasons for being
                            attracted to it. In 1731, the Oxford fellow John Husbands wrote in the
                             preface to <title>A Miscellany of Poems by Several Hands</title>
                            (1731) that worthwhile literatures could be  found among the
                            “barbarous” nations. He includes the Scandinavians
                            alongside Laplanders,  American Indians, and ancient Welsh odes.
                            Later in the century, this was to develop into a full-  blown
                            philo-primitivism for non-classical poetry. Husbands gives particular
                            attention to Egill’s  “Head-Ransom” poem, from
                            which he quotes two passages, challenging his readers that this 
                            specimen, measures up to anything by Pindar.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="45"> John Husbands,

                  <p>In the second half of the eighteenth century, writers began to actively
                            seek for alternatives to  Neoclassical forms. This was not
                            initially a call for a replacement of classical sophistication and 
                            decorum, but, more modestly, an attempt to explore a simpler and, in
                            some sense, truer poetry. At  the end of his introduction to
                                <title>Five Pieces of Runic Poetry</title>, Percy explains that the
                            objects of his  interest may not be “works of taste or
                            classic elegance”, but the Norse poetry serves: “to unlock
                            the  treasures of native genius they present us with frequent
                            sallies of bold imagination and constantly  afford matter for
                            philosophical reflection by showing the workings of the human mind in
                            its almost  original state of nature”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="46">
                        <title>Five Pieces</title>, [xiii–xiv].</note> This
                            statement anticipates the poetics of later Romantic writers. The 
                            unfamiliarity of Norse mythology made it new and exciting compared to
                            the trite references to  Greek and Latin pantheons. However, the
                            scant knowledge of Norse mythology among the British  reading
                            public, evidently made it necessary to supply a number of explanatory
                            notes. For several  examples in the present anthology, the
                            author’s original annotations have been preserved, since they
                             are often an integral part of communicating the newly-embraced
                            Norse tradition to an English  audience.</p>
                  <p>In the final analysis, the very novelty of Norse references attracted
                            writers who tired of old  forms, but the foreignness of this
                            mythology was probably also the reason why Norse-inspired  poetry
                            never established itself as a major Romantic mode. The Ossianic poems
                            (which required no  knowledge of complex mythological narratives)
                            remained the best-selling books of vernacular  poetry in Britain
                            and abroad.</p>
                  <p>If the Ossian poetry was charged with positive social and political
                            ideals of previous grandeur for  the Highlands, the
                            Gothic/Scandinavian past was also routinely associated with a number of
                            similar  characteristics. The Scottish philosopher and poet James
                            Beattie (1735–1803) provided a concise  overview in the form
                            of “four peculiarities” for which Britain’s
                            “northern conquerors” were to be  praised:
                            “[1] They were bold and hardy: [2] they despised death, or
                            rather, they thought it  honourable and advantageous to fall in
                            battle: [3] they were indulgent and respectful to their  women: and
                            [4] they were animated with a spirit of liberty and
                                independence”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="47">

                                     528.</note> These  “peculiarities”
                            were given literary expression in Norse-inspired fiction of the
                            period.</p>
                  <p>Beattie’s first point about heroism served as prism thorough which
                            other facets of  Gothic/Scandinavian culture would come into view
                            and begin to make sense. The most positive  manifestation of this
                            was the idea of the Germanic North as a beacon of liberty. After all,
                            the  Scandinavians had never been conquered by the Romans or anyone
                            else. Mallet, in the preface to  his history of Denmark, speaks of
                            Northerners as having released Europe from the “yoke of
                            Rome”,  a repressive regime which had banished “all
                            elevation of sentiment, all things that were noble and 
                                manly”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="48">

                            nations of southern Europe, which had succumbed to various degrees of

                            “unconquerable soul”, speaks of how they were ignited with
                            “the fires of social zeal”:  from this zeal, British

                  <p>The Norse skalds were often seen as guarantors of libertarian values, as
                            in Edward Jerningham’s  reference to how they “rouse
                            the tyrant from his flatt’ring dream” in his <title>The
                                Rise and Progress of  the Scandinavian Poetry.</title> In the
                            latter half of the eighteenth century, when Britain was going 
                            through a turbulent period of political unrest, this laid open the
                            libertarian legacy of the North to  interpretations that reflected
                            more radical, if not anti-royalist, sentiment. Examples of this can be
                             seen in the present edition through the poems of William Blake and
                            Robert Southey.</p>
                  <p>From the reading of Norse literature grew a notion that the old Northmen
                            had an unusual respect  for women (mentioned by Beattie). In turn,
                            this fostered a theory that Scandinavia was the place of  origin
                            for the development of medieval chivalry. Mallet drew on
                            Montesquieu’s pseudo-scientific  theory, linking virtues of
                            the Gothic ancestors to climatic conditions, to argue that the harsh
                             northern climate cools the “warm passion of love”,
                            which is found in excess among southern  nations. Not overcome by
                            unrestrained sexual desire, the northerners treated their women as
                            equals.  Mallet developed this idea to make capital of the
                            Scandinavians’ reputation for belligerency by  reading it
                            into a romantic context of chivalrous courtship of women. He claims that

                            a proper exertion of virtue and courage”. Thus, we  see here

                  <p>Most forcefully, the claim was taken up by Thomas Percy in the essay
                                <title>On Ancient Metrical  Romances &amp;c</title>,
                            prefixed to the third volume of <title>Reliques of Ancient English
                                Poetry</title>. In this essay, he  carefully worked out an
                            argument for a northern origin of the medieval chivalrous romance. 
                            According to Percy, skalds had accompanied Germanic warlords in their
                            conquest of Britain and  established a thriving romance tradition
                            there. The production of romantic fiction was later  bolstered by
                            Danish Viking invasions and settlements. Hence, what was introduced
                            post-1066 in the  form of Anglo-Norman romances was not an entirely
                            new import, but a sophistication of the already  familiar (Normans
                            were of Danish extraction). By integrating the medieval romance with
                            that of  prior skaldic compositions, Anglo-Saxon England could be
                            relocated towards the centre of  European literary progress, rather
                            than at the receiving end of foreign influences from the 
                                Mediterranean.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="56">

                  <p>A poem allegedly illustrating the ideas of the northerners’
                            penchant for romantic composition  was included in Percy’s

                            “The Complaint of Harold”,  originally a skaldic
                            composition embedded in <title>Knytlinga saga</title>. It is a monologue
                            purportedly spoken  in the first person by the eleventh-century
                            Norwegian King Harald III. For many readers, Percy’s  title
                            was likely evoke the English lyric mode of “complaints”,
                            popular in the Petrachan-inspired  Renaissance –“A
                            Complaint by Night of the Lover Not Beloved” by Henry Howard,
                            Earl of Surrey,  is an often mentioned example. However, unlike the
                            Earl of Surrey, we have no admission of a  “pang, that
                            inwardly doth sting” in Harald’s poem. Even if one ignores
                            the English title Percy gave  the poem, it is hard to reconcile
                            this skaldic piece with Percy’s description of it as
                            “modern”: that is  to say, its “subject
                            … turns upon the softer passions”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="59">
                        <title>Five Pieces</title>, 74.</note> In fact, the poem is
                            focused on Harald’s  masculine achievement and never gives
                            way to emotional reflection on the inner torments of love. 
                            Nonetheless, Thomas Warton described Harald’s ode as
                            “professedly a song of chivalry” with the 
                            “romantic air of a set of stanzas, composed by a Provencial

                            included in this anthology contain allusions to Ragnar Lodbrog’s
                            anticipation of a  glorious afterlife in Valhalla. But almost just
                            as frequently, the fear of not reaching Valhalla is  found in
                            English compositions. References abound to the cold underworld of Norse
                            mythology,  where those who did not achieve a heroic death were
                            fated to go. Niflheim (“Abode of Mist”) was a  world
                            ruled over by Hel, a cruel mistress who makes an appearance in several
                            poems. Among the  writers who took advantage of Niflheim as a means
                            of creating literary effects of terror were Robert  Southey in
                            “The Death of Odin”, Thomas Love Peacock in
                            “Fiolfar”, while Ann Radcliffe uses Hel  as a central
                            antagonist in the long poem <title>Salisbury Plain. Stonehenge</title>.
                            The fact that Radcliffe, the  doyenne of terror fiction, involved
                            herself in a tale with references to Norse mythology goes to  show
                            how the superstitions of the old Northmen were ransacked for its
                            chilling effects. As it is  apparent, in several of the texts,
                            ideas from Norse mythology came to serve as subspecies of terror 
                            writing. We lack a coherent survey of what we may coin <title>Gothic

                            may only invite further study.</p>
                  <p>The association between the Gothic/Scandinavian past and the literary
                            vogue for horror owed a  great deal to Thomas Gray’s Norse
                            Odes. “The Fatal Sisters” deals with Norse goddesses
                            spinning  the fate of men on a loom with human entrails and skulls,
                            while “The Descent of Odin” is an  account of the
                            awakening of a seeress from her grave through the use of magic
                            incantations.  Witness to Gray’s influence is Charles
                            Maturin, who cites the latter ode in the beginning of his  Gothic
                            novel <title>Melmoth the Wanderer</title> (1820).<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="62"> Charles Maturin,

                            Gray to task  for having distorted the reception of Norse culture
                            in Britain, essentially obscuring its noble heroic  imperatives.
                            According to Carlyle, Gray had prejudiced generations of readers to view
                            the religion  of Odin as merely “gloomy palace of black
                            ashlar marble, shrouded in awe and horror”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="63"> Thomas Carlyle,

                                     York: John Wiley, 1866), 31. Like Gray, Carlyle argued
                                    that the “Norse mythos” could be traced in English
                                    vernacular  literature (32).</note>

                  <p>Richard Hole is just one of several writers who learned from
                            Gray’s Norse poems. The passage  extracted from in his

                            edition shows how Norse  mythology could be called upon to evoke an
                            atmosphere of dread and horror. Another writer who  exhibited a
                            similar technique was Joseph Cottle (whose brother, Amos, translated
                            parts of the <title>Poetic  Edda</title> in 1797). The first book
                            of <title>Arthur</title> (1800), an epic poem (not included here), deals
                            with the  Danish invasion of Britain in the ninth century: in a

                            encounters night-hags and suffers horrible illusions engineered by a
                            Norse  sorceress. This first book has little relation to the rest
                            of the poem, an incongruity for which Cottle  apologizes in the
                            preface. But, as he explains, the departure arose “from the
                            peculiar scope to the  imagination which the wildness of the Gothic
                            superstitions afforded”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="64">

                  <p>The late eighteenth century book buyers, from their reading of the Ossian

                            endeavours a warrior could undertake. So it was for  the
                            Gothic/Scandinavian warrior, as Walter Scott explicitly points out, when
                            commenting on Old  Norse heroes: “they … held nothing
                            more worthy of their valour than to encounter supernatural 
                                beings”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="66">

                                <hi rend="ital">haugbui</hi>, an animated corpse). Since the first
                            English  translation of this poem in George Hickes’s
                            scholarly <title>Thesaurus</title> (1703–5), this poem was 
                            frequently translated in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
                            When Anna Seward, the  poetess “Swan of Lichfield”,
                            wrote a free adaptation based on it, she indulged not only in its tomb
                             horrors but also gave it a feminine angle by magnifying the
                            daughter’s heroic defiance of her father.  The result is
                            included in the present edition.</p>
                  <p>The most notorious of Gothic writers, Matthew “Monk” Lewis,
                            also took up the poem, first  incorporated into <title>The
                                Monk</title> (1796). This was written within the context of
                            parodying superstitious  beliefs and enthusiast religion.
                            “The Sword of Angantyr” was later featured as one of
                            several  Scandinavian poems in his <title>Tales of Wonder</title>
                            (1800). Included here from this collection is another  adaptation
                            of an original tale. The story of the cunning Water-King, who abduct a
                            young maiden  was taken from a collection of Danish folklore tales.
                            These tales of supernatural imps and spirits  were opportune for
                            literary exploitation in a book market that had shown itself hungry for
                            horror.</p>
                  <p>In the process of adapting original folktales in <title>Tales of
                                Wonder</title>, Lewis celebrated his own  tawdriness as a
                            manager in a circus of horrors by including a literal translation for
                            comparison. He  also introduced elements of satire to the
                            collection through the use of editorial notes and not least by 
                            providing his own parody of the ancient ballad form. Douglass H. Thomson
                            has recently discussed  Lewis’s strategy in this respect as
                            a means of defusing allegations that he was an enthusiast of the

                  <p>Walter Scott, who contributed genuine Scandinavian ballad material to the
                            collection, expressed  misgivings about Lewis’s parodic
                            antics: “<title>Tales of Wonder</title> were filled, in a sense,
                            with attempts at  comedy which might be generally accounted
                                abortive”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="68">

                                        Works</title> (Philadelphia: George S.  Appleton,
                                    1851), 567.</note> Scott was interested in examining how
                             superstitions had exerted an influence on communities in history.
                            With an emphasis on the  historical dimension, Scott tended to
                            debunk his own interest in horror writing through the uses of 
                            scholarly annotation, such as is evident from the extensive historical
                            notes on Norse superstition  which he provided for his semi-gothic
                            novel <title>The Pirate</title> (1822), in which Norna, a seeress of
                             Scandinavian descent, practices magic, visits tombs, and sings of
                            Old Norse heroic virtues. As one  critic has argued, Scott gives
                            the reader irregularity whilst remaining regular himself.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="69"> Peter

                            Nonetheless,  when Scott wrote his Norse-inspired ballad
                                <title>Harold the Dauntless</title> (1817), he chose to place it
                            within  a framework that diffuses any claim to seriousness and ends
                            with a stanza apologizing for having  “scorn’d to add
                            a note” from scholarly authorities on Norse poetry.</p>
                  <p>We may sum up this introduction by observing that the translations,
                            adaptations, and imitations  of Scandinavian literature during the
                            period from 1760 to 1830 were guided by pre-Romantic and  Romantic
                            concerns – aesthetically, ideologically, and not least
                            nationally. Knowledge of the  tradition was slight and the choice
                            of themes even more limited in scope. This is why it has made 
                            sense to compile a representative selection of texts.</p>
