            <head>Robert Southey (1774–1843)</head>
            <p>Robert Southey is considered to be one of the major Romantic poets. He held
                        office as Poet  Laureate from 1813 to his death. Southey had a
                        life-long interest in Norse poetry. On several  occasions, he seems to
                        have planned a long poem on a Norse theme.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">In 1796 Southey was preparing a
                                “Norwegian tale of [Harald] Harfagre”, in 1799 he had
                                plans “to build up a Runic  song”, and references
                                to Norse mythology in relation to his plans for future literary
                                endeavours crop up in his later  correspondence; see Herbert G.
                                Wright, “Southey’s Relations with Finland and
                                Scandinavia”, <hi rend="ital">The Modern Language 
                                    Review</hi>, 27.2 (1932): 149–67.</note> Southey is
                        known for his  epics, among which <hi rend="ital">Joan of Arc</hi>
                        (1796), <hi rend="ital">Thalaba</hi> (1801) and <hi rend="ital">Madoc</hi>
               (1805) are the best known. <hi rend="ital">Thalaba</hi> is an
                        “Oriental” fantasy, in the preface to which Southey tells us
                        that he was  inspired to poetic experiment by the use of irregular
                        verse and mythological subject matter in <ref target="Sayers.html">Frank Sayers’s <hi rend="ital">Dramatic Sketches of the Ancient Northern Mythology</hi></ref>
                        (1790).<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">
                                Robert Southey, <hi rend="ital">Thalaba, the Destroyer</hi> (London:
                                T. N. Longman and O. Rees, 1801), vii–ix.</note> In the
                        Romantic period,  both Norse and Arab literature were investigated for
                        their richness of fantastic imagery in the  attempt to create a space
                        for the construction of a literary tradition independent of classical
                        letters.</p>
            <p>The two poems “Race of Odin” and “Death of Odin”
                        are based on the theory that Odin was a  historical chieftain who had
                        been deified. Through a false etymology, Odin’s Æsir (the word
                        used  in Norse mythology about the family of the gods) were interpreted
                        as “Asia-men”, who had  travelled from beyond
                        Europe’s borders to a new settlement in Scandinavia. This
                        historicizing and  euhemerist theory was known through the works of
                        Snorri Sturluson, the Icelandic historian, poet  and politician. It is
                        found in the prologue to the <hi rend="ital">Prose Edda</hi> and with
                        variations in <hi rend="ital">Ynglinga saga</hi>
                         (which makes up the first part of <hi rend="ital">Heimskringla</hi>)
                        (both from the 1220s). Snorri speaks of Odin’s  flight from
                        military aggression in his homeland (either Troy or the Black Sea),
                        presumably alluding  to the Roman imperial advances under Pompey. If we
                        square this with verifiable history, Odin’s  migration can be
                        placed in the first century BC. We know from historical texts that
                        Mithridates VI,  Rome’s most formidable antagonist in the East,
                        had to yield to Pompey.</p>
            <p>The idea of Odin’ Æsir as a retinue of migrating Asians was
                        intensely discussed (and believed as  historical fact) in the
                        eighteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="3">

                        migrating from the East was also the foundation of George Richards <hi rend="ital">Odin. A Drama</hi>
                         (1804), taking the form of Greek tragedy, and William

            <p>Southey’s poems fall within his radical period and have
                        anti-establishment connotations. He  turned to conservatism in later
                        years, as did fellow poet-radicals Wordsworth and Coleridge.  Southey
                        probably sees Odin’s desire to revenge himself on imperial Rome as
                        applicable to the fight  against the state terrorism of the 1790s. To
                        be sure, a similar theme is taken up in the dedicatory  epistle (see
                        below), which Southey contributed to Amos Cottle’s translation of the
                            <hi rend="ital">Poetic Edda</hi>. In a  passage (not included
                        below) from the poem, Southey names revolutionary heroes forced to flee
                         their homelands due to political persecution: the French Marquis de
                        Lafayette (1757–1834), the  English Joseph Priestly
                        (1733–1804) and the Polish-Lithuanian Andrzej Tadeusz
                        Kościuszko  (1748–1817), who are all celebrated as
                        “Persecuted men! … sufferers in the cause/ Of Truth and

               <hi rend="ital">“To A. S. Cottle from Robert Southey”</hi>
                        (1797)</head>
            <p>Robert Southey’s dedicatory poem to Amos Cottle was prefixed to the
                        latter’s English translation of  the <hi rend="ital">Poetic
                            Edda</hi>, which was entitled <hi rend="ital">Icelandic Poetry, or The
                            Edda of Saemund</hi> (1797). Amos’s  brother, Joseph, later
                        gave an explanation of how this work was produced.</p>
            <quote>A young friend of my brother’s wanted more information respecting the
                        Scandinavian  Mythology than he could obtain from English books, and
                        during one of Amos’s long Cambridge  vacations, he kindly
                        undertook to translate literally for his friend the whole of the Edda of
                         Sæmond, with the notes. Soon after he had commenced the work,
                        Mr Southey (between whom  and my brother there existed reciprocal
                        respect), seeing his engagement advised him rather to  make <hi rend="ital">verse</hi> the vehicle of his translation in the free manner
                        of Gray’s “Descent of Odin,” one of  the poems.
                        This advice was adopted and was the origin of my brother’s
                        translation of the “Edda  of Sæmond”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="23"> Joseph

            <p>The poem takes metaphors from the Norse tradition to serve a radical agenda.
                        Southey sees Gothic  bloodiness as part of a primitive but sincere
                        creed, while he condemns the hypocrisy of Christian  priests, who in
                        the past have pretended to benevolence; their prayers constitute “a
                        bloodier hate than  ever rose/ At Odin’s altar”. It is
                        impossible not to read this as connected with Southey’s deeply felt
                         antipathies against the Roman Church, since he levels precisely such
                        criticisms of hypocrisy against  Papal wars in his anti-Catholic
                        diatribe <hi rend="ital">Letters Written during a Short Residence in Spain

                        given below, Southey praises Norse fortitude and  bravery, as well as
                        the moving force of the poetry. He also praises the Scandinavian landscape,

                        (1796), to which he refers in a later footnote.</p>
