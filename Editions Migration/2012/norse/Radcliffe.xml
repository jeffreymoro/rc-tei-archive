            <head>Ann Radcliffe (1764–1823)</head>
            <p>Ann Radcliffe was one of the most popular writers of her day and almost
                        universally admired in the  1790s and beyond. She took up the Gothic
                        novel, which Horace Walpole had launched in  1764 with his <hi rend="ital">The Castle of Otranto</hi>, but changed it into something
                        altogether more rational and  moral. She used a technique by which
                        terror and curiosity were aroused in her readers through  events
                        seemingly supernatural. Later, however, these are painstakingly explained as
                        the effects of  natural causes. Science (or what today is sometimes at
                        best considered pseudo-science) is the basis  of her Gothic.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="ital">Salisbury Plains. Stonehenge</hi> (published posthumously)
                        diverges from Radcliffe’s usual formula  by not being explained
                        away. Rather it is a sort of aetiological explanation for the mystery of
                         Stonehenge, based entirely on a mythical framework. Radcliffe
                        introduces the reader to Norse  mythology, which she had evidently come
                        to see as a serviceable source for terror writing.</p>
            <p>We learn that Odin wants to subdue a terrible dragon-like wizard named
                        Warwolf, who draws  support from Hela, the ruler of the underworld. To
                        this end, he enlists the help of a Hermit, who  possesses the spell of
                        minstrelsy. The Hermit finally defeats the evil wizard by un-teething him,
                         burying his fangs in the ground. Due to their magic power the fangs
                        grow to enormous size and  thereby create the circles of Stonehenge
                        monoliths. The mystery of Stonehenge had fascinated  many writers and
                        the stone circles were often referred to as <hi rend="ital">Chorea
                            Gigantum</hi> (“Giant’s Dance”) in  early
                        publications.</p>
            <p>The ancient site was connected with Druidism through the fanciful antiquarian
                        works of John  Aubrey (1626–1697) and William Stukeley
                        (1687–1765). Radcliffe, like many other eighteenth-  century
                        writers confused Celtic druidism with Germanic/Norse tradition. So did
                        Paul-Henri Mallet  and Johann Georg Keysler, to whose antiquarian works

                        poem. However, in the English edition to Mallet’s writing, the editor
                        Thomas  Percy had carefully pointed out the mistake.</p>
            <p>The poem, containing much descriptive material of the landscape around
                        Salisbury Plain, shows  Radcliffe skilfully using carefully constructed
                        descriptions of the surroundings to enhance the  Gothic effect. In a
                        number of ways, she conforms to Edmund Burke’s theory of the sublime
                        in <hi rend="ital">A  Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Idea
                            of the Sublime and Beautiful</hi> (1757), which  became the
                        theoretical basis for evoking mixed pleasure and fear, a strategy central to
                        the Gothic  novelists in their attempts to manipulate the psychological
                        responses of their readers.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">

                                    sport, because he was blind. Loke came to  him and asked
                                    him, why he did not throw something at Balder as well as the
                                    rest? “Because I am  blind,” replied the
                                    other, “and have nothing to throw with.”
                                    “Come then,” says Loke, “do like the 
                                    rest show honour to Balder by tossing this little trifle at him;
                                    and I will direct your hand towards  the place where he
                                    stands.” Then Hoder took the miseltoe [<hi rend="ital">sic</hi>], and Loke guiding his hand, he  darted it at
                                    Balder; who, pierced through and through, fell down devoid of
                                    life; and surely never  was seen either among Gods or men,
                                    a crime more shocking and atrocious than this. Balder 
                                    being dead the Gods were all silent and spiritless; not daring
                                    to avenge his death, out of respect  to the sacred place in
                                    which it happened.”</q>In a note upon the subject of the miseltoe M. Mallet says,
                                    “This plant, particularly such of it  as grew upon

                                    also among all the Celtic nations of Europe. The people  of

               <l>No breath from the Wizard’s

               <l>Yet could not the Druid those
                            fangs once view,</l>
               <l>And know the task he was bidden to
                            do,</l>
               <l>Without feeling his very
                            heart-blood chill.</l>
               <l>He hung his lamp on a sharp rock
                            near,</l>
               <l>He bent again o’er vast
                            Warwolf’s bier,</l>
               <l>And he touched one fang, with

               <l>But, why does he start, and why
                            does he stand</l>
               <l>As though he saw Hela’s
                            shadowy hand?</l>
               <l>He has heard the shriek of his
                            harp afar!</l>
               <l>He has felt the glance of his evil
                            star!</l>
               <l>And he hastens to fold his charmed
                            band</l>
               <l>Round the cold damp brows of his

               <l>But not all the strength of his
                            magic might</l>
               <l>Can lift the head from its stony
                            bed,</l>
               <l>Or the strong bandage pass
                            below,</l>
               <l>To press the Wizard’s
                            forehead tight;</l>
               <l>So he laid it loosely on the

                            faithful lamp,</l>
               <l>And sprinkled the flame on the

               <l>Straight the head uprose, and the

                            band;</l>
               <l>He tied the knot with a shaking
                            hand,</l>

                            outlast</l>
               <l>The struggle of every mighty
                            pang.</l>
               <l>And then he seized one hideous
                            fang,</l>
               <l>And threw it on the ground!</l>
               <l>No blood escaped the wound.</l>
               <l>Hark, to the harp’s now
                            rising sound!</l>
               <l>He knew the fiends were fighting

               <l>Senseless and dim, at first, it

               <l>His harp’s tones answered
                            to his fearful mood;</l>
               <l>Then he thought of the deeds of

                            walked its round,</l>
               <l>Whether a fairy or fiend,</l>
               <l>Whether a foe or a friend.</l>
               <l>It could see the procession move
                            along</l>
               <l>With glittering harps, in robes of
                            white;</l>
               <l>It could hear the responsive
                            far-borne song</l>
               <l>Faintly swell o’er the
                            wide-stretched plain,</l>
               <l>Then sink, till all was still
                            again,</l>
               <l>And sleeping in the clear
                            moonlight.</l>
               <l>So this beautiful spire did watch
                            and wake,</l>
               <l>And guarded the land for
                            Innocence’ sake.</l>

               <l>Let but the feeblest ray,</l>
               <l>Or gleam, of moonshine chance to
                            fall</l>
               <l>Over this steeple so slenderly
                            tall,</l>
               <l>Or but glimmer upon the trembling
                            vane;</l>
               <l>Though the ’nighted
                            traveller on the plain,</l>

                            shine,</l>
               <l>Peering over upland downs

               <l>Yet all too well the warning
                            sign</l>

                            Wizard’s line!</l>
               <l>Soon as they spy its watching
                            eye,</l>
               <l>Whether by moonlight, or by
                            morn,</l>
               <l>Sullen they sigh, and shrink and
                            fly,</l>
               <l>Where sun, or moonbeam, never
                            warn.</l>
               <l>So this beautiful spire does watch
                            and wake,</l>
