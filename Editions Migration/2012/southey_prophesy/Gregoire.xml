                        >Henri Gregoire (1750-1831), Bishop of Blois in the secessionist French
                        Catholic Church during the French Revolution, in which he played a leading
                        role in the National Convention. Gregoire resisted both Robespierre’s
                        attempts to abolish the church, and, with less success, Napoleon’s efforts
                        to reconcile it with Papal rule. He resigned his see when that
                        reconciliation occurred.</note> It bears ample proofs of his frankness and
                    benevolence, as well as of his inconsistency and enormous prejudices, political
                    and religious, of his weak judgment and warm heart. M. Gregoire was not in
                    favour with Buonaparte, though he published some remarks upon the state of the
                    Roman Catholics in Ireland, (the Slavery of the Whites he called it,) which were
                    hardly exceeded in falsehood and effrontery by any diatribe from the Imperial,
                    or Radical, or Whig press.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editor">Gregoire’s
                        remarks upon the Irish appeared in his 1808 <title>De la litterature des
                            negres</title>, originally translated by D. B. Warden in 1810 as
                            <title>An Enquiry Concerning the Intellectual and Moral Faculties and
                            Literature of Negroes</title>.</note> The present volumes were seized by
                    the police (like Madame de Stael’s ‘Germany’) and suppressed; in both cases the
                    suppression seems to have proceeded more from personal ill-will than the
                    apprehension of any possible injury to the imperial government from such books.
                    They were returned to the author after the restoration of the Bourbons.</p>
                <p rend="indent1"> A Protestant called Langius, M. Gregoire tells us, published a
                    geographical sketch of the Empire of Orthodoxy, which, according to him, is
                    bounded on the east by Fanaticism, and on the west by Pseudo-Orthodoxy. The
                    empire is composed of three confederated kingdoms, called Illumination,
                    Justification and Renovation, and the author enters into a detailed statistic
                    account of each. The river of Orthodoxy, which runs through the three kingdoms,
                    rises from different sources in Sinai, Thabor, and the Mount of Olives, and
                    discharges itself into the Pacific Sea, opposite to the Island of the Blessed.
                    This reminds us of a map of the Land of Tender, so called in the translation of
                    Clelia, (‘an excellent new romance’ one hundred and fifty years ago,) written by
                    the exquisite pen of Monsieur de Scudery, with the Lake of Indifference, the Sea
                    of Enmity, and the three cities of Tender upon Inclination, Tender upon Esteem,
                    and Tender upon Gratitude.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editor">Madeleine de

                    designer. But there are parts both of literary and ecclesiastical history which
                    might be greatly elucidated by genealogical trees,<note n="4" place="foot"

                        monastic history. The hint was perhaps taken from a passage in the works of
                        St. Antoninus of Florence: —<hi rend="ital">Quemadmodum arbor una est in

                        nevertheless have their sap and strength from root and trunk), so a monk’s

                    readers by introducing them, in the present instance, if M. Gregoire had formed
                    one, however incorrectly, it would have suggested to him some kind of method, in
                    which his book is now utterly defective. The different sects are arranged
                    neither with any relation to each other, nor chronologically, nor
                    geographically, nor even in alphabetical order, (the easiest and laziest of all
                    modes of arrangement,) but with as little method or connection as the paragraphs
                    in a newspaper.</p>

                    the ground might smile at some of the positions which would have been found
                    there. He informs us, for instance, that the belief of the existing English

                        association with the Sunday School for children that she ran there. The
                        meeting, which featured praying and testifying, was accused by the local
                        curate of being a hotbed of Methodist sectarianism. Letters to the press and
                        a pamphlet war ensued over the next four years and More was pushed into
                        closing the school.</note> With equal accuracy he designates one of the

                    M. Gregoire has fallen into these errors by writing upon subjects with which he
                    is very imperfectly acquainted; there are others into which he has been misled
                    by his imperfect knowledge of English. For example, he accuses Robert Robinson,
                    the Baptist-historian, of saying that the whole life of Bossuet<note n="10"

                    clearly arisen from misapprehending them. In another instance he appears to have
                    followed some faithless translation: speaking of Wesley’s Primitive Physic, he
                    quotes the following prescription as <hi rend="ital">bizarre—Pour guérir une
                        colique venteuse, prenez une femme saine, et tâtez-la tous les jours: remède

                        Wesley wrote, of consumption, ‘In the last stage, suck a healthy woman
                        daily. This cured my father’. Wesley, <title>Primitive Physic</title>

                    ascribed to the printer, if it were not evident that M. Gregoire could not have
                    had the original work before him; because the remedy of human milk is advised by
                    Wesley for consumption, and not for colic. It seems to have been prescribed as
                    commonly in former times as asses-milk is now. Baxter tells us that he used it
                    four months, and was somewhat repaired by it;<note n="13" place="foot"

                    superficial and inaccurate. The author has chiefly followed Lackington, and
                    seems not to have known that Lackington, after he was reconciled to the
                    Methodists, published a retractation of the work which is here relied on.<note

                    by Wesley at the age of eighty-one, to a lady of twenty-three, is also given,
                    without any doubt being implied of its authenticity. The letter is in itself so
                    grossly incredible, that M. Gregoire ought to have seen its falsehood; and, in
                    point of fact, it is known to be a forgery, by the avowal of the person who
                    forged it.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editor">In 1775 John Wesley’s wife,
                        long angry with her husband, read aloud to some of his friends and enemies
                        private letters addressed to him by a young woman. She also sent texts of
                        the letters to the <title>Morning Post</title>, intending to demonstrate
                        that he abused his position as spiritual leader, entering romantic and
                        sexual liaisons with female followers. Most people were satisfied that the
                        more incendiary passages had been interpolated by Wesley’s wife and were of
                        her own making. Southey was shown one of the letters in 1821, after he had
                        published his <title>Life of Wesley</title> (1820), but, suspecting it to be
                        a forgery, did not insert it in a second edition of the
                    biography.</note></p>
                <p rend="indent1"> The sectarians of whom M. Gregoire speaks with most indulgence
                    are the Quakers. This partiality towards them arises from the honourable manner
                    in which they contributed to the abolition of the Slave Trade; the aid which he
                    has contributed to the same cause being the redeeming part of his public life.
                    This sympathy induces him to sum up the character of the society by saying, that
                    if the title of Primitive Christians, which they claim, cannot be allowed them
                    on the score of their belief, they have some right to it on account of their
                    morals; and that among all Christian sects, theirs appears to be one of those
                    which, being characterized by the greatest integrity in the conduct of the
                    members, are at the same time a model and a reproach to others. The account
                    which he has given of them is vague and desultory, scarcely touching upon their
                    history, and not attempting to trace or account for the gradual but great change
                    which they have undergone. When he describes the works at Coalbrookdale as their
                    creation, he imputes to the spirit of Quakerism what has been produced by the
                    spirit of trade; and when he characterizes that district as a tract <hi

                        sejour,</hi> he shows how little he is acquainted with the state of morals
                    and domestic comforts in manufacturing or mining countries.<note n="17"
                        place="foot" resp="editor">The works at Coalbrookdale on the river Severn
                        were the iron foundries and forges in which new smelting methods were
                        developed, enriching the Quaker ironmaster family headed by four successive
                        Abraham Darbys (Abraham IV (1804-78) was head of the family in Southey’s
                        time) and making the area a cradle for industrial production. The French
                        translates as: ‘where good morals, work and affluence have taken up
                        residence’. In fact, the Darbys provided for their workers’ well-being
                        rather better than most of the mill-owners of the time.</note></p>

                    Quakers there are, both male and female, who deal in such pomps and vanities
                    without scruple and without reprehension. Nay there are some who have traded in
                    guns and gunpowder, so difficult is it for any sect to separate itself from the
                    general concerns of that society wherewith it is surrounded. The spirit of the
                    age has acted upon them with better effect in exciting a desire for intellectual
                    improvement, and the Quakers of the present time have not only their chemists
                    and naturalists, who hold a high rank among their contemporaries, but their
                    poets also. If some of these betray no marks of their profession, the poems of

                    Quakerism, and are equally honourable to the society and to the individual. Some
                    of his pieces are written directly upon the principles of the community to which
                    he belongs, such as the stanzas on Silent Worship, the Quaker’s Burial

                    entitled Napoleon, in which he takes occasion, from the character of that
                    merciless destroyer, to inculcate the opinions of the Quakers concerning the
                    unlawfulness of war. But all his compositions breathe the same pure and
                    religious spirit. One little piece we shall quote to justify the terms of

                <p>The information which M. Gregoire has brought together concerning the English
                    sects, is brief, inaccurate, and altogether unsatisfactory. What he says of the
                    minor sectarians in Scotland is chiefly taken from Sir John Sinclair’s
                    Statistical Account.<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editor">Sir John Sinclair,
                            <title>Statistical Account of Scotland</title>, 21 vols (Edinburgh,
                        1791-99).</note> They have been as evanescent as they were numerous.
                    ‘Particular countries’, say the joint-historians of the Dissenters, ‘have their
                    endemical diseases. The plague has from time immemorial ravaged Egypt; the
                    yellow fever is the scourge of the West Indies; and goitres afflict and
                    disfigure the inhabitants of the Alps. A malady of the soul similar to the last
                    seems to be the curse of Scotland. An excessive zeal for little things, like an
                    enormous wen, has with but, perhaps, one exception, disfigured every sect that
                    has arisen in that country; and, drawing away the vital energy which should have
                    communicated strength, weakened its spiritual powers. To ascertain the cause
                    would be important, as it might operate as a preventive in future; but it is
                    certainly a striking peculiarity in the Scotch character; and if it could be
                    purged by hellebore, the whole produce of Anticyra could not be purchased at a
                    price too high’.<note n="23" place="foot" resp="editor">David Bogue and James

                    at least as applicable to the first Puritans, whom these writers eulogize so
                    highly, as to the Scotch. The truth is, that the minor sects in Scotland have
                    mostly originated in craziness, and left as few traces behind them as the
                    Muggletonians in England; and that since Scotland, by the joint operation of
                    church discipline and parochial education, was reclaimed from a state hardly
                    less barbarous than that of Ireland at present, sectarianism has not prospered
                    there. Neither Quakers, nor Moravians, nor Methodists have met with any success
                    in Scotland. The church has been too efficient to leave room for interlopers,
                    and the soil suffers no weeds but its own. The few schisms of modern growth have
                    related to points of church government, and originated in that sort of temper
                    which is provoked by an election or a lawsuit. Fanaticism in that country has
                    spent itself, and the deadlier venom of infidelity is now at work.</p>

                    in England from books of travels, and the common sketches, or dictionaries, of
                    religious opinions, which are in every person’s hand. He tells us indeed of an
                    Irishman who, under the inexplicable name of Shady Hand, preached at Boston, and
                    held all his meetings at night, without candles, because, he said, he was the
                    light, and all other light was useless where he was present. Such a preacher,
                    whether knave or madman, or both, was soon silenced, by the proper interference
                    of the magistrates. He has not noticed the dancing Quakers, who reject

                        York in 1774 by prophet ‘Mother’ Ann Lee (1736-84). Worship took the form of
                        long, sometime all-night, meetings at which the spirit would move

                    August, 1804, to the great alarm of the people. As I doubted the reports, I set
                    out to see for myself. In February, 1805, I preached in Knoxville to hundreds
                    more than could get into the Court-House, the Governor being present; about 150
                    appeared to have the jerking exercise. I thence rode eighteen miles to hold a
                    night-meeting, and had about twenty Quakers among my hearers; but their usual
                    stillness was interrupted, for about a dozen of them had the <hi rend="ital"
                        >jerks</hi>, as powerful as I had seen, even to making them grunt. I have
                    seen all denominations of religion exercised with <hi rend="ital">the
                    jerks</hi>; gentleman and lady, black and white, young and old, without
                    exception. I passed a meeting-house, where I observed the undergrowth had been
                    cut away for a camp-meeting, and from fifty to an hundred saplins were left,
                    breast-high, on purpose for the people who were jerked to hold by. I observed
                    where they had held on, they had kicked up the earth, as a horse stamping does.
                    A Presbyterian minister told me, that while he was preaching the day before,
                    some had the <hi rend="ital">jerks, and</hi> a young man from North Carolina
                    attempted to mimic them, and was soon seized with them; being ashamed, he
                    attempted to ‘mount his horse and be off; but his foot jerked so that he could
                    not put it into the stirrup; and when he was helped on, he could not sit

                    form it happens first to break out. Among the early Quakers it brought on that
                    tremulous agitation from which their popular designation was given them. Among
                    the early Methodists it manifested itself in convulsions. The Welch enthusiasts

                        >Falling</hi> was one of the circumstances which usually characterized the
                    Camp Meetings. These remarkable assemblies, which some madmen, in opposition to
                    the regular body of Methodists, are endeavouring to introduce here arose in
                    America as much from convenience, or indeed necessity, as from inclination. When
                    persons from all parts, far and near, were invited to a preaching and a
                    Sacrament in some central part of a wild and thinly-peopled country, they
                    collected in numbers too large to be accommodated by any such neighbourhood as
                    the woods could afford. It is said that hospitality was not wanting, but that,
                    on the contrary, all that brotherly kindness could do was done, public and
                    private houses being opened, and free invitations given to all who chose to
                    enter. This, however, could not suffice when from ten to twenty thousand persons
                    were collected, and moreover the people, we are told, ‘were unwilling to suffer
                    any interruption in their devotions; they formed an attachment to the place
                    where they were continually seeing so many careless sinners receiving their
                    first impressions, and so many deists constrained to call on the formerly
                    despised name of Jesus. They conceived a sentiment like what Jacob felt in
                    Bethel—Surely the Lord is in this place! This is none other but the house of
                    God, and this is the gate of Heaven’.<note n="29" place="foot" resp="editor"

                <p>The waggons are wanting in this picture, some hundreds of which are sometimes
                    brought together at a Camp Meeting, whole families coming from a distance of 80
                    or 100 miles, sleeping in them, and bringing their provisions. Tents, waggons,
                    carts, carriages of all kinds, and horses, are drawn up in a circle or square,
                    or arranged more irregularly and with more picturesque effect, according to the
                    nature of the ground, and the humour of the parties. Pulpits are erected, and
                    the preaching goes on day and night for three or four days, more than an hundred
                    preachers being sometimes collected. ‘To give you a more just conception of this
                    work’, says one of the actors in such scenes, ‘suppose the Camp illuminated with
                    candles on the trees, waggons, and at the tents; persons falling down and
                    carried out of the crowd by those next them, and taken to some convenient place
                    where prayer is made for them, and some psalm or hymn, suitable to the occasion,
                    sung. If they speak, what they say is attended to, being very solemn and
                    affecting; many are struck under such exhortations. But if they do not recover
                    soon, praying and singing are continued alternately, and sometimes a minister
                    exhorts over them; for generally a large group of people collect and stand
                    around, paying attention to prayer, and joining in singing. Now suppose twenty
                    of these groups; a minister engaged in preaching to a large congregation in the
                    middle, some mourning, some rejoicing, and great solemnity in every countenance,
                    and you will form some imperfect idea of this extraordinary work. Opposers call
                    this confusion! But in any of these parties employment for the mind may be
                    found. The work being engaging, persons subsist with less sleep and food than at
                    other times’.<note n="31" place="foot" resp="editor">‘Extract of a Letter from

                <p rend="indent1">The symptoms are thus described. Persons of all ages, (children of
                    eight years old!) of all colours, conditions and denominations, by scores and
                    hundreds (at some meetings more than a thousand cases have occurred) fall to the
                    ground. Some feel the crisis approaching, ‘their hearts swell, their nerves
                    relax, and in an instant they become motionless and speechless, but generally
                    retain their senses. It comes upon others like an electric shock, felt in the
                    great arteries of the arms or thighs; the body relaxes and falls motionless; the
                    hands and feet become cold; and yet the pulse is as formerly, though sometimes
                    rather slower. Some grow weak, so as not to be able to stand, but do not lose
                    their speech altogether. They continue in that state from one hour to
                    twenty-four. When they regain their speech, which comes to them gradually, they
                    express themselves commonly in the following manner—that they are great sinners,
                    the vilest of the vile; and pray earnestly for mercy through Christ. Some think
                    that there is mercy for all but them; that salvation through Christ is a
                    wonderful salvation, but will not be applied to them. They often continue in
                    this state several days. Many have not yet recovered, so that it is not certain
                    that they will. Others recover in an hour, and speak of possessing salvation
                    from sin. They have great gifts in prayer and exhortation, which they often
                    perform in an incredible manner. Indeed it is a miracle that a wicked and
                    thoughtless sinner, who never could address himself to an audience before,
                    should rise out of one of these fits, and continue for the space of two hours
                    recommending Christ as a Saviour, free, willing, and all sufficient’.<note

                <p rend="indent1">Another writer, who saw more than three hundred persons under the
                    influence of this disease, describes it in some respects differently. ‘Persons
                    who fall’, he says, ‘are generally such as had manifested symptoms of the
                    deepest impressions for some time before. It is common to see them shed tears
                    plentifully for about an hour. Immediately before they become totally powerless
                    they are seized with a general tremor; and sometimes, though not often, they
                    utter one or two piercing shrieks in the moment of falling. Persons in this
                    situation are affected in different degrees: sometimes, when unable to stand or
                    sit, they have the use of their hands, and can converse with perfect composure.
                    In other cases they are unable to speak, the pulse becomes weak, and they draw a
                    difficult breath, about once in a minute. In some instances their extremities
                    become cold, and pulsation, breathing, and all the signs of life forsake them
                    for nearly an hour. Persons who have been in this situation have uniformly
                    declared that they felt no bodily pain; that they had the entire use of their
                    reason and reflection; and when recovered they could relate every thing which
                    had been said and done near them. From this it appears that their falling is
                    neither common fainting, nor a nervous affection. Indeed this strange phenomenon
                    appears to have taken every possible turn to baffle the conjectures of those who
                    are not willing to consider it as a supernatural work. Persons have sometimes
                    fallen on their way to public worship, and sometimes after they had arrived at
                    home; and in some cases when they were pursuing their common business on their
                    farms, or when retired for secret devotion. It was above observed that persons
                    generally are seriously affected for some time previous to their falling: in
                    many cases, however, it is otherwise. Numbers of thoughtless sinners have fallen
                    as suddenly as if struck with lightning. Many professed infidels, and other
                    vicious characters, have been arrested in this way; and sometimes at the moment
                    when they were uttering blasphemies against this work’.<note n="33" place="foot"

                <p rend="indent1"> The question is worth considering, why no effects of this kind
                    were produced during the great crisis of the Reformation, not even in the Low
                    Countries, where such multitudes were assembled in the open field that many
                    preachers were employed at the same time in addressing them, as at these Camp
                    Meetings. The cause will probably appear to be, that, though the minds of the
                    congregation were in a more inflamed state, the object of the preacher was
                    different; it was rather to affect them as a party than as individuals. He
                    addressed himself not so much to their feelings as to their reason; not so much
                    concerning their own sins as concerning the superstitions of their country. He
                    made them perfectly contented with themselves as an enlightened and reformed
                    people, the saints and the champions of the Lord, impatient to act in his cause,
                    and ready to suffer for it, if they were called upon to bear testimony in prison
                    or at the stake: and he worked up their indignation to the highest pitch against
                    the gross and palpable abuses of a fraudulent and inhuman church. The passions
                    which he excited had therefore an outward direction, and broke out in those acts
                    of enormity and riot which in many places made the Romanists appear to have the
                    better cause: so seriously may the best be injured by imprudent and intemperate
                    supporters.</p>
                <p rend="indent1"> A more interesting part of M. Gregoire’s work relates to certain
                    sects upon the continent, whose adventures and even names have escaped the
                    notice of our English heresiographers. He tells a singular tale of some Pietists
                    from Denmark and the neighbouring countries, who, in the year 1734, resolved to
                    fly from the contagious wickedness of the world, and for that purpose, embarking
                    upon the Baltic, sailed towards the North in quest of some island, where, as in
                    a Goshen of their own, they might be safe. They cruised in search of Paradise in
                    a wrong latitude; and being bad sailors and soon sick of the dangers of the sea,
                    were glad to land upon a small island near Stockholm, where they were permitted
                    to settle, and where their descendants still subsist under the name of
                    Skevi-kare, an appellation given them from a domain which they purchased.<note

                    course in former times, seeking the free enjoyment of its own opinions abroad,
                    when that liberty was denied at home. But these adventures were almost always

                        libertarian Protestant movement inspired by the work of the pastor of the
                        village of St Philipsland, Pontiaan van Hattem (1645-1706). It held that
                        Christ’s atonement had freed humans from the necessity to win salvation by
                        obedience to natural law. The movement was banned by the States of Holland

                        original. Like the Hattemites, the Hebrews rejected obedience to religious
                        law. Banned in the 1690s, the movement did not survive Verschoor’s

                    where, he says, they proved the truth of the saying, that if the Devil were to
                    open a school in that country, he would find disciples. They are accused of
                    having taught that all sins are imaginary; and that if there be a real sin, it
                    consists in believing that any thing is sinful. How easily are the grossest
                    calumnies founded upon mistakes or misrepresentations, and how readily are they
                    credited by uncharitable minds! The very people who are thus calumniated held as
                    a maxim, that God punishes men <hi rend="ital">not for</hi> their sins, but <hi
                        rend="ital">by</hi> them. They seem, in fact, to have been pious Fatalists,
                    who advanced dangerous subtleties, but lived innocently, and deduced from
                    erroneous premises the useful conclusion, that in all things it is our duty to
                    submit with willing resignation to the divine pleasure, and that our chief aim
                    should be to preserve the soul in tranquillity. They were called Hebrews also,
                    because the Verschoristes held that the study of that language was necessary for
                    all Christians. It is curious that most of the persons who held this notion, and
                    applied themselves in consequence to the study of Hebrew, were women.</p>

                    extinct. They seem to have resembled that sect of ‘Freethinking Christians’
                    which has separated from the church for the mere sake of separation, holding all
                    its doctrines, but rejecting all discipline. No other profession was required
                    from the members than a belief that Christ is the Messiah, and that the
                    Scriptures are inspired. They allowed of no priests; any member (women alone
                    excepted) might preach and expound in their meetings, which were held in what
                    they called Colleges of Piety. At one time they had formed eighteen of these in
                    different towns. Some of them, from the large license which was given, ran into
                    enthusiasm, and delivered their own dreams as revelations: but the sect had no
                    principle of cohesion, and its members gradually dropt off, some, who wisely
                    felt ‘the weight of too much liberty’, joining better regulated communities, and
                    others borne away like chaff upon the stream of infidelity. The Society, or
                    Genoot-schap Christo-Sacrum, which was founded at Delft by an old burgomaster of
                    that town, in the first year of the present century, resembled these Collegians
                    in the terms of admission; its object, however, was very different, being the
                    ambitious one of uniting Christians of all opinions in one catholic society.
                    From four members, with which it began, it increased to three thousand in the
                    single town of Delft, where they had a handsome church, and published certain

                    describes as the most singular and whimsical place he ever beheld. When he
                    visited Holland, during the peace of Amiens, they formed a society of their own,
                    consisting of about a thousand persons, who had the whole village to themselves.
                    The streets are not broad enough to admit any carriage, and are paved with pale
                    bricks, which are kept as clean as the floor of a drawing-room. The houses,
                    about three hundred in number, are entirely insulated, each standing in the
                    centre of a little garden, laid out in the Dutch fashion. Each has two doors,
                    and the front one is never opened but for the marriage or the funeral of its
                    owner. When a stranger is seen in the village, the window-shutters are
                    immediately closed, and the inmates retire to the back rooms, so that not a
                    human face is seen there, nor a sound heard; ‘in broad day-light’, says Mr.
                    Forbes, ‘all was still and solitary as night’. Of course they intermarry among
                    each other; and if a stranger wins the affections of one of the damsels, he can
                    only obtain her fortune by consenting to settle in the place and conforming to
                    its regulations. Many of them are wealthy, and all charitable. The traveller has
                    not given any information concerning the rise of this singular society, nor of
                    their tenets, excepting that they suppose this kind of retirement to be
                    conformable to primitive Christianity. They carry the punctilios of cleanliness
                    even beyond their countrymen; no person is allowed to spit in the streets. One
                    of their pastors, perceiving that after having held the cure a long time he
                    could not obtain the good-will of his parishioners, and not being conscious of
                    any error or deficiency in himself, ventured at length to inquire the reason of
                    their apparent dislike to him. After some hesitation, the old gentleman to whom
                    he addressed himself, replied, Mynheer, you are a learned man; you speak Greek
                    and Latin; but you go into the reading-desk with your shoes on, and your
                    predecessor always used slippers for that purpose, which you will find in a
                    corner of the vestry.<note n="40" place="foot" resp="editor">The community at

                <p rend="indent1"> A branch of the Mennonites exists in Alsace, descended from those
                    who were banished from Switzerland and from Strasbourg, in the sixteenth
                    century, when these inoffensive sectarians paid dearly for the crimes of the
                    Anabaptists at Munster, though no person testified against them more zealously
                    than Menno himself. M. Gregoire estimates them at about a thousand souls, and
                    with an equitable spirit, the more to be admired in so bigoted a Romanist,
                    renders justice to their peaceable, industrious, and virtuous deportment. They
                    reside mostly in the department of Les Vosges, at Salm, formerly the chief place
                    of a petty principality so called. A hamlet of that name is exclusively
                    inhabited by them. They are almost all employed in agriculture, and particularly
                    excel in the management of cattle and in making cheese. Their dress is as
                    peculiar as that of the quakers, and more picturesque,—they use neither buckles
                    nor buttons, and let the beard grow. Maidens wear the hair loose, and the
                    punishment for incontinence is to have it shorn, and publicly to ask pardon for
                    the scandal which has thus been brought upon the church. Married women gather up
                    the hair and bind it round the head. Like the Quakers, they scruple at taking an
                    oath, and hold it unlawful to bear arms. The National Convention, in 1793,
                    threatened to force them into the military service; they proposed as a
                    compromise to furnish a certain number of carts; their proposal was referred to
                    a committee, and to the credit of that atrocious assembly, in its worst days, it
                    was accepted. Afterwards, when the conscription was enforced, M. Gregoire says,
                    some of their conscripts chose to serve rather than find substitutes. The choice
                    probably lay not between service and substitution, but between obedience to this
                    grievous law and the punishment denounced against those who refused to obey it;
                    they were too poor to provide substitutes during the enormous consumption of men
                    under Buonaparte’s tyranny.</p>
                <p rend="indent1"> They have no churches, or meeting-houses, because of their small
                    numbers and their poverty; and it is rarely that they have a settled place of
                    meeting. The minister usually collects his flock (if we rightly understand M.
                    Gregoire) in the open air, when they pray kneeling, and sing psalms, and the
                    preacher expounds the Bible, and more especially the Apocalypse, the favourite
                    book of all persecuted and obscure sects. They pray thrice in the day, and
                    abstain from meat at Easter, Whitsuntide, and on St. Bartholomew’s day. With
                    regard to baptism they hold a middle course, and baptize youth at the age of
                    eleven or twelve, by sprinkling, the person thus admitted into the church,
                    laying his hand upon his breast and answering for himself, which they conceive
                    essential to the sacrament. They seldom marry out of their own community; they
                    avoid law-suits, take care of their own poor, and if one of their brethren meet
                    with misfortunes which are not occasioned by any misconduct of his own, they set
                    him up again in the world. During the course of the Revolution they neither
                    suffered nor profited by it. And it is a proof of their integrity and honourable
                    feelings, that they never availed themselves of the laws to pay in assignats
                    debts contracted upon the old standard of money, nor ever purchased any of the
                    property of the emigrants. We have antiquarian travellers, picturesque
                    travellers, political travellers, poetical travellers, sentimental travellers,
                    bibliographical travellers, and travellers for the Bible Society; a traveller
                    who should make it his object to search out the varieties of society would do
                    well to visit the Mennonites, or Anabaptists, as they are improperly called, of

                <p rend="indent1"> This little community derives its origin from the first age of
                    the Reformation. No sect has arisen among the French Protestants since the
                    commencement of the last century, with which M. Gregoire begins his work. He has
                    indeed included the Camisards, of whom he gives a most unsatisfactory account,
                    and a most prejudiced one, accusing William III. and the refugee ministers at
                    Geneva of producing and fomenting for political purposes that madness, into
                    which the Protestants of the Cevennes were driven by one of the most remorseless
                    and wicked persecutions that history has recorded.<note n="42" place="foot"
                        resp="editor">In 1702, responding to the billeting of soldiers in their
                        houses in an effort to force them to convert to Catholicism or flee, some of
                        the French Protestants of villages in the Cevennes region took to arms,
                        fighting both the army and their persecuting Catholic neighbours. Led by
                        ‘prophets’, they continued fighting over the next eight years, a final peace
                        occurring only after the death of King Louis XIV in 1715.</note> These he
                    has included because of their descendants the French prophets, whose vagaries
                    excited much notice in London about an hundred years ago.<note n="43"

                        Fage, Elie Marion and Jean Cavalier fled to London in 1706, attracting
                        English millenarians and becoming known as the ‘French Prophets’. According
                        to the Methodist Jonathan Edwards, their meetings featured violent
                        agitations, speaking in tongues, writhings on the ground and
                        self-mutilation.</note> Louis. XIV. did not leave Protestants enough in
                    France to produce sects; but yet it will presently be shown how little the
                    dominant religion was able to secure and maintain that uniformity which by such
                    nefarious means it endeavoured to establish. Germany, however, affords M.
                    Gregoire a plentiful crop of tares during the period which his history
                    illustrates; and it is not without triumph that a writer, who regards Luther as
                    a minister of evil, comments upon the spawn of heresies with which that country
                    is overrun. Some of these partake of that extravagance which manifests itself in
                    so many ways among the Germans. The Gichtelians, or Angelic-brethren, professed
                    to live like the Angels, who are neither married nor given in marriage; they
                    abstained from all labour, and imagined that by devoting themselves wholly to
                    contemplation, and thus, as it were, offering themselves a sacrifice for others,
                    they renewed the priesthood of Melchisedeck, and entitled themselves to the
                    appellation which they had chosen.<note n="44" place="foot" resp="editor">The

                        establishment. Gichtel was a disciple of the mystic Jakob Böhme
                        (1575-1624).</note> Such a sect was not likely to maintain itself long.

                    called himself the Father of Sion, and his wife the Mother, pretended that the
                    Almighty dwelt in him, and had commissioned him to found a new church. Such is
                    the credulity of mankind, that no quack can be too ignorant to obtain followers,
                    no political charlatan too base or too infamous, no religious enthusiast too
                    insane. Eller is said to have been more knave than madman. He attracted a number
                    of dupes to Ronsdorf, a town then newly built in the duchy of Berg; they erected
                    their houses in a position where each looked to the dwelling of their prophet
                    and teacher, as the <hi rend="ital">kebla</hi> of their devotions; and he
                    maintained an absolute dominion over them as long as he lived, by making himself
                    master of all their secrets, for which purpose he employed some as spies upon
                    others, and promoted convivial meetings, less, M. Gregoire thinks, from any love
                    of debauchery, than because he kept his own head cool while the wine opened the
                    hearts of his credulous believers. The sect died with him. </p>
                <p rend="indent1"> Two brothers, by name Rohler, natives of the village of Brugglen,
                    in the canton of Berne, set themselves up, in the year 1746, as the Two
                    Witnesses mentioned in the Revelations, and designated a girl of their
                    acquaintance as the woman who was to be clothed with the sun, and have the moon
                    under her feet. Christ, they affirmed, was to come and judge the world in the
                    year 1748, after which the kingdom of Heaven would commence in their village. If
                    we call to mind what numbers, upon the faith of a similar prediction, hurried
                    out of London a few years afterwards, we shall be the less disposed to wonder
                    that these madmen produced a great effect among the Bernese peasants; men and
                    women forsook their usual occupations, for what availed to spin, or to till the
                    fields, if the day of judgment was so near at hand? One of the brothers was mad
                    enough to declare he would ascend bodily into Heaven, in the sight of the
                    people: it is said so many clung to him for the purpose of partaking in his
                    ascension, that they furnished him with a fair pretext for adjourning this proof
                    of his divine mission. This sort of madness led, as it has often done, to the
                    indulgence of the most open sensuality. The Bernese government thought it
                    necessary to interfere; and put an end to the delusion by putting the two
                    brothers to death, five years after doomsday ought to have occurred, upon their
                        computation.<note n="46">Christian and Jerome Rohler, belonging to the Swiss

                <p rend="indent1"> A German gamekeeper, Hans Rosenfeld by name, played a more daring
                    and atrocious part in Prussia and some of the adjoining states. He declared
                    himself the Messiah; affirmed that Christianity was a mere deception, and all
                    its priests impostors; that the King of Prussia was the devil, and that he
                    himself was to collect the four-and-twenty elders, wrest the sword from this
                    infernal sovereign, and, at the head of that council of twenty-four, govern the
                    world. The seven seals also were to be opened, and as there were no angels to
                    open them, this impudent impostor required his dupes to furnish him with seven
                    beautiful girls, who were to act in their stead, and who, till the time should
                    come, served him as mistresses, and supported him by the work of their hands. To
                    the disgrace of the government under which he lived, this fellow continued this
                    life during twenty years, with no other interruption than that of a short
                    imprisonment now and then; and, such is the credulity of mankind, he found
                    believers. At length he was brought to justice in a manner not less remarkable
                    than the imposture itself. A man who was completely infatuated by his promises,
                    and had actually given up three of his daughters to the villain’s pleasure,
                    became at last, not undeceived concerning him, but out of patience that he was

                    Rosenfeld should take possession of the government of the world; and in this
                    humour he went to the King of Prussia, whom he believed to be the devil, in the
                    hope of provoking him so to act against the false Messiah as might force him to
                    fulfill his predictions. Frederic on this occasion behaved well; he ordered
                    proceedings to be instituted against Rosenfeld, and the impostor was sentenced
                    to be whipt, and imprisoned for life in the fortress of Spandau; the fellow
                    appealed to a higher tribunal, and the sentence was mitigated; not satisfied
                    with this, a further appeal was made to the king, apparently in the hope that he
                    might be inclined to favour the criminal for the blasphemy of his offence; but
                    Frederic properly confirmed the original judgment in its full rigour.</p>
                <p rend="indent1"> This was in the year 1782. In the same year a curious sect was
                    discovered in Bohemia, where it had perhaps long existed in obscurity. They
                    called themselves Abrahamites, professing to be of Abraham’s religion, and
                    rejecting all later revelations, except that they admitted the Decalogue and the
                    Pater Noster. Many thousand peasants were found to be infected with this species
                    of Deism; they were perfectly satisfied with themselves; held that human
                    learning was unnecessary; and in their pretensions to inspiration, their
                    language resembled the most exceptionable assertions of the primitive Quakers.
                    As soon as they were discovered, the clergy began to proceed against them, and
                    they on their part petitioned the Emperor Joseph to protect them. He promised
                    them liberty of conscience, but on further consideration informed them that such
                    as did not chuse to profess one of the religions tolerated in the empire by a
                    certain day in the ensuing spring, must be exiled from Bohemia: and accordingly
                    some were marched under a military escort into Transylvania, others into the
                    Beunat of Temeswar. They are said to be a branch of the Adamites, who still
                    exist in the circles of Bidschow, Chrudem, and Iglau.<note n="47" place="foot"

                    last century, than for us. At the beginning of the present, a crazy pastor in
                    Swabia took up Bengel’s notion, and proclaiming that the kingdom of the Messiah
                    was at hand, invited all true believers to prepare for a journey to Jerusalem,

                    Wurtemburg into Poland, which took place at that time, were in great measure
                    occasioned by this man’s publications and preaching, the persons who emigrated
                    thinking it would be desirable to get so far on their way. But this madness,

                    affect to go galloping to Heaven, like the Jumpers in Wales. They themselves
                    give their leader, and the preachers who have espoused his opinions, the
                    appellation of Saints—a word of dangerous import to those who know how it has
                    always been misapplied in the language of fanaticism. According to their absurd
                    and perilous belief, it would follow that they themselves might claim the same
                    spiritual nobility; for they have struck out all confession of sin from their
                    form of worship, maintaining that sin is abolished, and salvation assured, by
                    baptism; and that what the flesh may afterwards commit communicates no taint to
                    the spirit. When ignorant and infatuated persons professing such opinions
                    assembled tumultuously in the fields, and held midnight meetings, it was time
                    for any government which understood its interest and its duties to interfere;

                    pocket, which he produced and put on, one after another, as fast as they were
                    taken off. They reject baptism and public instruction, and bury their dead
                    without any ceremony, merely digging a hole and covering up the corpse, as if it
                    were a dead animal. Like the Radicals, they profess themselves hostile to all
                    civil and religious establishments, and boast of being superior to those
                    prejudices by which priests and magistrates have hitherto deceived the world.
                    They call themselves patriots in Christ; and, in perversion, if not in derision
                    of the Gospel, say that the liberty and equality which they desire are what
                    Christ has obtained for them. They had also instituted among themselves an
                    order, having a star for its insignia, and they styled themselves Knights of
                    Napoleon— the second and true Messiah! The statement from which M. Gregoire has
                    presented this account was written in 1809, when Buonaparte was in the height of
                    his power; but even then this blasphemous adulation of the tyrant did not
                    prevent the government from taking measures to repress a sect, the growth of

                    as reformers, the purposes of a revolutionary faction. Having laboured more than
                    any other individual in the Long Parliament to loosen the fabric of our church

                    matter of religion, as never was in any age, in any nation, until this
                    parliament met together’. ‘If I would deal with a Papist’, said he, ‘to reduce
                    him, he answers—(I have been answered so already)—to what religion would you
                    persuade me? What is the religion you profess? Your thirty-nine articles, they
                    are contested against. Your public solemn Liturgy, that is detested; and which
                    is more than both these, the three essential, proper, and only marks of a true
                    church, they are protested against. What religion would you persuade me to?
                    Where may I find, and know, and see the religion you profess?—I beseech you,

                    wondered at my wonder, and said, I hope your worship is too wise to believe that

                    founders of that church under Edward VI. and Elizabeth made it. ‘The existing
                    Protestants’, he says, ‘scarcely resemble in any thing those of the sixteenth
                    century; for identity of name does not imply conformity of doctrine. If Luther
                    and Calvin were to return upon earth, they would be greatly surprized at finding
                    themselves not of the religion of those who have taken their denominations from
                    them’.—Not so much surprized as St. Peter would be at the claims and actions of
                    his successors! The ex-bishop’s chapter upon the recent state of Protestantism

                <p rend="indent1"> We have before us the Life of the Glorious Bishop St. Patrick,
                    Apostle and Primate of Ireland, together with the Lives of the Holy Virgin St.
                    Bridgit, and of the Glorious Abbot St. Columbe, Patrons of Ireland, printed in
                    1625 at St. Omers, with the license and approbation of the Censors of Louvaine,
                    of the Bishop of St. Omers, and of the Commissary and Definitor General of the
                    Seraphic Order. The author, Fr. B. B. one of the Irish Franciscan friars at
                    Louvaine, says of St. Patrick, that this Life ‘will abundantly teach how
                    stupendious he was in perpetrating of miracles’. He will, he says, ‘furnish the
                    scrip of your memories with bright stones taken up out of the torrent of our
                    glorious Apostle’s life, wherewith, if you charge the sling of your tongues, the
                    weakest among you shall be able to encounter and cast down any temerarious and
                    Goliah-hearted Protestant that should undertake to renew the lost field, or to
                    recover the gained breach’. ‘Since they obtrude their new-found Gospel on you,
                    under the specious vizard of venerable antiquity, lo here we offer them St.
                    Patrick’s Life, who lived in the purer times of Christianity: let them examine
                    it, let them search it, and point us out what they shall find in it to
                    countenance their cause, or to advance their religion.—Nothing will occur here
                    but quires of sacred virgins, and troops of holy monks. They will admire at the
                    frequent mention of holy veils and ecclesiastical tonsure. Holy water, vessels
                    of holy oils, hallowed fire, the sign of the Cross, &amp;c. sound very harshly
                    in Protestants ears. Our wiving gospellers hold no commerce or society with a
                    continent and chaste monk. The refined naturalists of Geneva will never
                    acknowledge our glorious prelate’s walking in the majesty of a Roman <hi

                    religious, consumed with fasts and weakened with hair-cloth, as a disciple.
                    Paleness arising of long standing in cold water, (a thing never practised by our
                    tender solifidians,) short and broken sleeps taken all alone on a hard flint,
                    seem strange and absurd in the theology of our libidinous ministers, who lie
                    immersed in beds of down, not alone, but embracing their sweethearts with
                    greater devotion than ever any Geneva bible’. And presently he asks ‘What
                    greater imposture can they impose on you than to father their Protestant
                    paradoxes on the primitive Christians?’<note n="57" place="foot" resp="editor"

                    St. Patrick, which he has written for their confusion, or edification, relates
                    in this Life, not indeed that the Saint heated an oven with ice, but that he
                    made a rousing fire with it. He relates also that fire dropt from his fingers
                    and dried up the waters of an inundation; that he transported a leper to Ireland
                    upon an altar stone, which served for the passage better than the best life-boat
                    could have done; that he himself effected his landing there in the face of an
                    army of devils drawn up to oppose him; that at sundry times he made the earth
                    swallow sundry magicians; that he raised many persons from the dead whose bodies
                    had long been resolved to dust; that he moved a mountain to accommodate a noble
                    of Munster whose view from his dwelling was obstructed by it, and brought the
                    mountain back as easily as he had displaced it, when the said noble refused to
                    let him build a church, which he had promised if the miracle was performed; that
                    he made a he-goat bleat in the belly of the man who had stolen and eaten it, and
                    entailed a goat’s beard upon the issue of the thief for ever—(it is to be hoped
                    that he limited it to the male line;) that when it rained, his sanctity served
                    as great coat and umbrella to keep him perfectly dry; that when he walked in the
                    night it was by the light of his own fingers; and that having cleared Ireland of
                    magicians and devils, by whom it was so infested that the whole island was
                    called the Devil’s own, he marched the venomous creatures of all kinds, by which
                    it was overrun, to a promontory, and made them cast themselves into the sea—upon
                    which Joceline exclaims, as well he might, ‘<hi rend="ital">O miraculum

                    M. Gregoire may be indignant at the repetition of such legends; but when he
                    insults a Protestant clergyman for alluding to them, it is proper he should be
                    reminded that they were invented in his church, and promulgated with its
                    sanction. It is fit also that he should be reminded of what Bolland has said
                    with regard to these very tales, and other such as these, in the preface to his

                <quote>When St. Antonio preached at Rimini, where there dwelt a great number of
                    heretics, he disputed against their errors, and desired to bring them back to
                    the light of truth. But they being as it were made stones by their obstinacy,
                    not only would not yield to his holy eloquence, but even altogether refused to
                    hear him. St. Antonio therefore, God inspiring him, went out one day to the
                    mouth of the river, close by the sea, and standing upon the shore near to the
                    sea and to the river also, began, in the manner of a discourse, to call upon the
                    fishes on the part of the Lord, saying, Hear ye the word of the Lord, O ye
                    fishes of the sea and of the river, seeing that the heretical infidels refuse to
                    hear it! Behold immediately there gathered together before St. Antonio so great
                    a multitude of fishes, great and small, as never had been seen in those parts;
                    and they all held their heads a little out of the water. There you might have
                    seen the great fish beside the little ones, and the little ones pass quietly
                    under the fins of the great ones, and even rest there. There you might have seen
                    divers species, each hastening to join those of its own kind, so that they were
                    arranged before the face of the Saint, like a painted field, marvellously
                    adorned with variety of colours and of forms. There you might have seen bands of
                    fishes, huge and great, take their place at the preaching, like the divisions of
                    an army in array. There you might have seen the fishes of a middle size chuse
                    their middle station, and, as if instructed by their Maker, rest in their places
                    without truculence. There you might have seen a copious multitude of little
                    fishes approaching like pilgrims for an Indulgence, and drawing nearer to the
                    Holy Father as their teacher. So that at this preaching, which was ordered by
                    Heaven, in the first place the small fishes arranged themselves to hear St.
                    Antonio, in the second those of a middle size, and the great ones in the third,
                    where the water was deeper. They being thus arranged, St. Antonio solemnly began
                    to preach, saying, ‘O Fish, my brethren, ye are greatly bounden, according to
                    your capacity, to give thanks to the Creator who hath given you so noble an
                    element for your habitation, so that ye have the sweet water, and the salt, as
                    it suiteth you. Moreover he hath appointed for you manifold refuges that ye may
                    avoid the annoyance of the storms. He hath made for you a clear and limpid
                    element that ye might see whither ye go, and perceive also your food. At the
                    creation of the world ye received from God as a benediction, the command that ye
                    should multiply. At the deluge, when all other creatures who were not in the Ark
                    perished, ye were preserved without hurt. To you it was appointed to swallow up
                    the prophet Jonah at the command of the Lord, and after the third day to replace
                    him on shore. You brought the tax money to our Lord and Saviour when he, as a
                    poor man, had not else wherewith to have paid it. You, before the Resurrection,
                    and after it, were the food of the eternal King. For all which things ye are
                    greatly bound to praise and bless the Lord, from whom ye have received so many
                    singular blessings above all other creatures’. At these words, some fishes
                    uttered a sound, others opened their mouths, and all inclined their heads,
                    praising together the Most High in such a manner as they could. Antonio,
                    rejoicing in the Holy Spirit at this reverence of the fishes, and crying with a
                    most loud voice, said, ‘Blessed be the eternal God, because the fishes of the
                    water honour God more than heretical men, and irrational creatures hear better
                    than men who are unfaithful in their belief’. By how much the more Antonio
                    preached, so much the more did the multitude of fishes increase, none retiring
                    from the place which they had taken. To which prodigy the people of the city
                    hastened, the aforesaid heretics coming also, and seeing so unwonted and truly
                    admirable a miracle, they were touched at heart, and all sat down at the feet of
                    St. Antonio that he might preach to them. Then St. Antonio, opening his mouth,
                    preached so marvellously upon the Catholic faith that he converted all the
                    heretics who were there, and sent the faithful home strengthened in their faith,
                    joyfully and with his benediction. The fishes also having obtained leave from
                    St. Antonio, went their way to various parts of the sea as if rejoicing.</quote>

                    pastor, and learnt from him his peculiar sentiments, transported them into
                    France. The pedigree of this superstition is not so improbable as it appears to
                    M. Gregoire: the fanatics of that age approached as nearly to the Jesuits in
                    some other respects as they did in the theory and practice of deposing kings and
                    putting them to death. Our manufacturers of jet blacking do not vie more
                    emulously with each other, than the religious orders of the Romish church have
                    done in introducing modes of devotion, with their outward and visible signs—the

                    Colombiere seems to have thought; and he found an inspired nun in a fit state to
                    further his purposes. The venerable mother, Marguerite Marie Alacoque,<note

                    Paray-le-Moncal, in the diocese of Autun, affirmed that our Saviour had appeared
                    when she was engaged in prayer before the Holy Sacrament, and, showing her his
                    heart, had said that as that heart had exhausted itself in giving men certain
                    proofs of his love, it was his pleasure that a certain day should be dedicated
                    to its worship; and she was charged to address herself to his servant, F. de la
                    Colombiere, and order him to do all in his power for establishing this devotion.
                    The venerable mother, in discharging the commission, moreover assured him that

                        (Paris, 1729).</note> The legend thus brought forward was worthy the worst
                    ages of monkish wickedness. It was said, that in one of her amorous colloquies
                    with her beloved Christ, he asked her, while her head was reclining upon his
                    bosom, to give him her heart; and upon her consenting, he took it from her side,
                    inserted it in his own, and then replaced it. He then constituted her heiress of
                    his heart, and authorized her to dispose of it as she pleased; upon which she
                    cut the name of Jesus with a penknife in large and deep letters upon her breast.
                    As from that hour she suffered a continual pain in her side where the heart had
                    been extracted and replaced, Christ told her that she should be bled whenever
                    the pain became too strong; accordingly she was bled on the first Friday of
                    every month as long as she lived, being one hundred and ninety-two times. The
                    legend proceeds in the old vein of blasphemous fable to a promise of marriage
                    with the Redeemer, the affiancing and the actual espousals. Compare such tales
                    as these with the disgraceful story of <ref target="people.html#SouthcottJoanna"
                        >Joanna Southcott</ref>, and the difference will immediately be seen between
                    imposture and madness.</p>
                <p rend="indent1"> The imposture was too late. When the Bishop of Soissons, in 1729,
                    published the life of Marie Alacoque, he found it expedient to withdraw from
                    sale a book which excited great indignation, and Pope Ganganelli suppressed an
                    Italian translation as soon as it appeared. The fashion, however, which it was
                    intended to introduce prevailed, the devotion was approved at Rome by the
                    Congregation of Rites, and the Festival of the Heart of Jesus was authorized by
                    a brief of Pope Clement XIII. Church bells were dedicated to it and named after
                    it, towns placed under its patronage. Amulets were written on heart-shaped paper
                    and inclosed in hearts of gold, silver, or baser metal, to be worn upon the
                    breast; allegorical prints were engraved upon the same subject, in the taste of
                    Hugo’s or Quarles’ Emblems, and the most splendid church in Lisbon was erected
                    by the late Queen of Portugal, in honour of this new object of devotion, where
                    the altar-piece by Pompeio Bettoni represents the heart in the heavens,
                    radiating with glory.<note n="82">In the 1780s Queen Maria I (1734-1816)
                        commissioned seven altarpieces from Pompeo Batoni (1708-87) for Lisbon’s new
                        basilica of the Sacred Heart.</note> The court of Rome in vain represented
                    the new worship as purely spiritual; the language of the devotees became as
                    carnal as its tangible symbol, and they talked of its fine fibres and its blood
                    derived from that of David, of its palpitation and dilatation. In the prolific
                    order of such abuses it was conceived that the heart of the Virgin Mary was
                    entitled to a like worship, as being after God’s own heart, and one with the
                    heart of Christ; and a Friar Minim, preaching at Morteau, in Franche-Comt, to
                    recommend this devotion, said that the foolish virgins could not enter into
                    Paradise, because, when they knocked at the gate, they cried Lord, Lord! whereas
                    if they had cried, Lady! Lady! the marriage hall would immediately have been
                    opened to them.</p>
                <p rend="indent1"> Thus in the christian, as in the heathen world, superstitions
                    have arisen from the abuse of words, and typical representations have past into
                    objects of idolatrous worship. The Roman church has grown more cautious in
                    encouraging such practices than it was in darker times; it has also sometimes
                    exposed frauds which it would formerly have encouraged, and suffered fanatics to
                    follow their own wild impulses, which three centuries ago would have been
                    controlled and directed by the policy of the church. In those days something
                    would have been shaped out of the Society of Victims, who were so far connected
                    with the <hi rend="ital">Cordicoles</hi>, that each member was to wear a silver
                    medallion representing the hearts of Christ and the Virgin. The use of the word
                    Victim had been introduced by the foundress of the <hi rend="ital">Religieuses
                        adoratrices perpétuelles du très Saint Sacrement de l’Autel</hi>, an order
                    of nuns which spread rapidly in France during the latter part of the 17th
                    century. The sisters were to consider themselves as victims self-devoted in
                    atonement for the offences offered to our Lord in the mystery of the Eucharist.
                    Each in turn acted as the <hi rend="ital">Victime réparatrice</hi> of the day;
                    in the discharge of this office she secluded herself from the hour of matins;
                    when the sisterhood went from the quire to the refectory she came out the last,
                    with a rope round her neck and a torch in her hand; when they had taken their
                    places at the table she reminded them of their obligation as victims immolated
                    in the place of their Saviour, and then returned to the quire, fasting, and
                    remained there till after vespers, like a lamb set apart from the flock, for
                    sacrifice. M. Gregoire approves of this; he says, <hi rend="ital">l’acception du

                        woman, but retreated into a priory for the last fourteen years of her life.

                        published.</note> who at the age of eighteen attracted considerable notice
                    at Paris by her personal accomplishments and her talents. She wrote some novels,
                    of which she repented when her life had been, as she believed, preserved by a
                    miracle. From that time her writings were upon devotional subjects, and were
                    published anonymously by her admirers. M. Gregoire says, they all display a
                    certain kind of talent; the language is pure and sometimes felicitous, —but they
                    are still romances of another kind, in which the writer delivers as realities
                    the chimeras of her delirious imagination. Yet, he adds, they had seduced a
                    great number of persons. Mlle. Brohon required that a college of Victims should
                    be established, consisting of six men and as many women. Our Saviour, she said,
                    had vouchsafed to act as her confessor, and chosen her to institute this new
                    order; and he had said to her, seek me no longer upon the cross; I have yielded
                    that place to thee: I shall be crucified no longer, my Victims shall be
                    crucified for me. We pass over other things of the same kind too offensive to be
                    brought forward. The honour of commencing this mission was given to the female
                    sex for three reasons, first, as a proof of our Lord’s love to his blessed
                    mother; secondly, to recompense the fidelity shown him by women during the
                    course of his mortal life and passion; and, thirdly, to humble the male sex, and
                    to make them jealous of the zeal of the weaker vessels. The number of Victims
                    was fixed at twelve, to resemble the Apostles; the men were to be all priests,
                    the women not subordinate to them but to the bishop only; and their successors
                    were to be chosen from a body of auxiliaries, that there might be no deficiency
                    at any time. Mademoiselle Brohon called upon Louis XV. in the name of the Lord,
                    to devote Madame Victoire as one of the Victims. Elevated as her rank was, it
                    would still be an elevation for her to become one of an order for whom the same
                    privileges were promised as the angels enjoyed, and whom the angels themselves
                    might envy. For their names were to be written with the precious blood which
                    issued from the Redeemer’s side, and Christ and the Virgin had as parents
                    adopted them, would live with them openly and familiarly, refuse them nothing,
                    and admit them into all their secrets. Without them an essential point in the
                    Messiah’s religion would still be wanting. They were to be his coadjutors in the
                    great work of redemption, and, taking upon themselves the sins of the world,
                    were to become, as it were, the centre, and reservoir, and channel from which
                    grace was to flow upon mankind. The time for their institution was arrived, for
                    God was about to exercise judgment upon the nations, to decimate the earth, and
                    chuse for himself a new people. France, as having been the first of the
                    Christian kingdoms, and distinguished for the purity of its faith and for its
                    devotion to the Holy Virgin, might be the cradle of this chosen people, if its
                    perversity did not deprive it of so great a blessing. And if France refused the
                    Victims, its provinces would be lost, and a foreign prince would be commissioned
                    to lay waste and subdue it. The prophetess thought she could perceive that the
                    Spaniards would be the instruments of this chastisement. Heavy calamities would
                    fall upon Paris, the clergy, secular as well as regular, would be abased, and
                    the sanctuaries abolished, to punish the offences of those who ought to have
                    been the ornament and glory of the church. When all was fulfilled, the Victims
                    would constitute the sole body of the church during the reign of the Redeemer,
                    and Enoch and Elias would be their presidents.</p>

                    came on, believed that she saw in them the fulfilment of her predictions. She
                    too thought that the Lord would chuse out victims acceptable to himself, that
                    the existing ecclesiastical system would be done away, and two great societies,
                    male and female, be substituted for it; and, like some of the primitive Quakers,
                    she went to Rome for the purpose of assuring the Pope that his downfall was at
                    hand. There are many places wherein such a crazy pretender would have been
                    treated worse. She was confined in the castle of St. Angelo, and was so little
                    dissatisfied with her treatment, that when the Directory demanded her
                    liberation, she chose to remain there. At length, however, she returned to
                    Paris. And M. Gregoire says, it is certain, that at this time both Mademoiselles

                        resp="editor">A movement within the Catholic Church between the sixteenth
                        and eighteenth centuries, named after the Dutch theologian Cornelius Otto
                        Jansen (1585-1638). Jansenism flourished in the Parisian convent of
                        Port-Royal, among writers including Blaise Pascal and Jean Racine. Accused
                        by its Jesuit opponents of being Calvinistic, Jansenism stressed original
                        sin, the necessity of divine grace, and predestination. It was condemned as
                        a heresy by Pope Innocent X in 1655.</note> wherewith a century ago all
                    Europe rang from side to side. In the persecution which that question brought upon
                    Port-Royal, it was affirmed that miracles were wrought in favour of the
                    persecuted party; the most remarkable of these was the cure of a <hi rend="ital"

                    kissed by the patient in full faith. If this were the fact, nothing could be
                    more plainly miraculous; and that it was so, was so strongly attested, that the
                    Archbishop of Paris, though an enemy to Port-Royal, admitted it; it was believed
                    by the court, who would gladly have detected fraud or falsehood in a community
                    which it had determined to destroy; the proceedings against the monastery were

                    in words, wherever the interests of his sect or party were concerned. On the

                    sincerity of his opinions is proved by the austere life which he led after his
                    conversion, and this very circumstance produced in him that great and effectual
                    change. Ever after he wore the device of a crown of thorns for his seal; it was

                    was a humble-minded, worthy man, bigoted to Jansenism. Having appealed against
                    the bull Unigenitus,<note n="94" place="foot" resp="editor">By which the Pope
                        condemned the Jansenist doctrines as heresy.</note> he thought it his duty
                    not to receive priests’ orders, renounced his patrimony, and retired into the
                    Fauxbourg St. Marceau, the most beggarly part of Paris, where he supported
                    himself by making stockings, and shared his earnings with the poor. The
                    austerities which he practised in this obscure and charitable course of life,
                    are believed to have accelerated his death. The younger brother, to whom he had
                    resigned his inheritance, erected a monument to his memory in the churchyard of
                    St. Medard. The grave of the pious and penitent deacon, as he was then called,
                    was visited as much in gratitude as in devotion, by the infirm, and sick, and
                    poor, to whom he had administered alms and spiritual consolation; and some there
                    were who affirmed that their bodily ailments had been relieved while they were
                    engaged in praying there. This might easily have been feigned or fancied, and
                    there were strong motives both for credulity and fraud; for he who could allege
                    that he was the object of miraculous favour, appealed, with sure effect, to the
                    charity of those who believed him. At length it was asserted, that a girl, who
                    was both blind and lame, had been cured at his grave. This was so commonly
                    believed, that the archbishop of Paris deemed it expedient to institute a
                    judicial examination, the result of which was to show that the girl had never
                    been either lame or blind. But wilful credulity is never to be undeceived. A
                    certain Abbé Becheraud, who had one leg shorter than the other, declared that,
                    after he had prostrated himself on the thaumaturgic grave, he found a sensible
                    though not a visible elongation of the defective limb; at length it was reported
                    that the leg had been elongated an inch; this was disproved by measurement:
                    still, however, he proclaimed that he felt the miraculous aid which he sought,
                    though nobody could see it, and the multitude believed him; and he became, in
                    consequence, so great an object of veneration among the vulgar, that the
                    government thought proper to cut the delusion short by confining him in St.
                    Lazare.</p>
                <p rend="indent1">This did not suffice: other patients rapidly presented themselves
                    to deceive others, and be deceived themselves. One woman, with a short leg, went
                    to have it stretched by dancing upon the grave: at the end of some months a
                    calculation was made that at the same rate of elongation the cure would be
                    perfected when she should have capered there for fifty-four years. A Spaniard,
                    who had received a blow in the eye, applied the apothecary’s prescription with a
                    rag of the deacon Paris’s shirt, and the cure was attributed to the relic. The
                    churchyard now became a scene of the strangest extravagance. Magistrates in
                    their robes, men and women of rank, priests, monks, and doctors of the Sorbonne,
                    were to be seen there, mingled with the vulgarest rabble, as admiring and
                    believing spectators, while knaves and dupes were exhibiting themselves upon the
                    grave, dancing, jumping, jerking, whirling, or writhing in the contortions of
                    real or pretended convulsionary movements. Folly and fanaticism are always
                    contagious enough; but there was more than the natural contagion of these moral
                    endemics here: the deacon had been a confessor in the cause of Jansenism, and
                    the Jansenists were as ready as the Jesuits to obtain credit by promoting any
                    delusion in their own favour. Government at last shut the churchyard, and this
                    gave occasion to the well-known pasquinade which was written upon the
                    gates:—</p>

                <p>In an earlier stage of the frenzy, such an interference might have proved
                    effectual. It had been delayed too long. The earth from the churchyard, the
                    water from the well of which the deacon used to drink, were now said to operate
                    miraculous cures. And while the prisons were crowded with those who, in defiance
                    of the police, presented themselves at the churchyard, extravagances infinitely
                    worse than those which had been suppressed, were committed in private houses.
                    Like the French revolution, that which had begun in enthusiasm, accident, and
                    intrigue, had now passed into the hands of wretches, in whom it would be
                    difficult to say whether villainy or madness predominated. It no longer sufficed
                    for the patients to invoke the blessed deacon, and expect relief by means of
                    convulsions, which the fervour of their devotion produced. The <hi rend="ital"
                        >convulsionnaires</hi>, as they were called, stood in need of human succour
                    for receiving his miraculous aid. These succours were administered by men—the
                    persons who required them being generally women; and they consisted in blows
                    with a stick, a stone, a hammer, a poker, or a sword. One woman would lie down
                    to be threshed like a bundle of wheat; another stood upon her head; a third
                    forming a half circle, by bending her body back, remained in that frightful
                    position, while a stone, fifty pounds weight, fastened by a rope to a pulley in
                    the ceiling, was repeatedly let fall upon the abdomen; a fourth had a plank
                    placed across her while she lay on her back, and bore the weight of as many men
                    as could stand upon the plank.</p>
                <p rend="indent1">These disgusting practices were reduced to a system; there were
                    the great and the little succours; among the former, the exercise of the spit
                    was classed. It is affirmed that one woman was fastened stark naked to a spit,
                    with a pullet tied behind her, and a brother, as the male assistants were
                    called, turned the spit before a fierce fire, till the bird was fairly roasted.
                    The salamanders, who have displayed their art in England, show that this might
                    be possible for any one flagitious enough to become the subject of such an
                    exhibition; and what is most marvellous here, is the utter profligacy of the
                    abandoned performer. But even the indubitable accounts which have appeared of
                    what the Indian Yoguees inflict upon themselves would hardly obtain belief for
                    the fact, that women presented themselves to undergo actual crucifixion in these
                    accursed displays of fanaticism and impiety, obscenities and horrors, if it were
                    not established beyond all possibility of doubt. Baron Grimm has preserved an
                    account of two of these shocking exhibitions,<note n="96" place="foot"

                    Felicite, who were both between thirty and forty years of age, were moved in
                    spirit to present the lively image of our Saviour’s passion; and they were
                    actually nailed through the hands and feet to two wooden crosses, and so
                    continued for upwards of three hours. It was evident that they suffered the
                    severest agony, especially when the nails were driven in, and when they were
                    taken out; this occasioned muscular shrinkings and writhings, which it was
                    impossible to suppress; but with Indian fortitude they withheld every indication
                    of suffering over which the mind had power. And to keep up the delusion of their
                    admirers, and aid the deceit of their spiritual directors, who were affirming
                    that they felt the most exquisite delight, they affected sometimes to slumber as
                    if in a beatific trance; and sometimes addressed the spectators in the fondling
                    and babyish language of the nursery. When they were taken down, the wounds,
                    which bled freely, were washed and bandaged, after which they sate down quietly
                    to eat in the midst of the assembly. There was no fraud in all this, nor were
                    the women themselves guilty of any other deception than that of encouraging the
                    belief that they had endured unutterable pleasure while they were suspended.
                    They were pitiable fanatics, acting under the direction of consummate knaves.
                    And if any delusion could be suspected in this case, the circumstances at the
                    second exhibition were such as to put its reality beyond all doubt. In this
                    also, two women, Sisters Françoise and Marie, were crucified. M. de Condamine
                    examined the nails when they were driven in, and when they were taken out; they
                    were rough square nails, more than three inches long, and entered about a half
                    inch into the wood of the cross. Marie could not conceal the agony she felt when
                    they were driven in, and in less than an hour, cried out that she must be taken
                    down, for she could bear it no longer: being accordingly unfastened, she was
                    carried away senseless, to the great confusion of her associates. Sister
                    Françoise was of a stronger fibre, and remained on the cross upwards of three
                    hours, during which time its position was frequently altered. This woman had
                    announced that she had received a divine command to have the gown burnt off her
                    back that day, and had been assured of receiving much comfort from the
                    operation. The directors, unless they were as mad as herself, must have supposed
                    that she was properly prepared for such an ordeal; and accordingly she was set
                    on fire; but on her part all had been pure insanity, unalloyed with fraud, and
                    this was a trial against which no illusion of mind could strengthen her; she
                    shrieked for help—water was poured upon her, and she was carried away half
                    scorched, half drowned, thoroughly ashamed, and sufficiently punished.</p>
                <p rend="indent1"> A few individuals, who had not wholly abandoned themselves to
                    fanaticism, or the not less deleterious influence of party-spirit, might be
                    awakened in time by such decided proofs of delusion as these. But neither
                    absurdities, nor horrors, nor the hateful obscenities which soon mingled
                    themselves with these flagitious exhibitions, could undeceive the thorough-paced
                    believers. ‘That in an aera of learning and penetration’, says Mr. Butler, ‘in a
                    large capital, abounding with men of learning and discernment, under the eye of
                    an enlightened and active society, ardently anxious to detect it, and in the
                    face of a most despotic and vigilant police, bent on the destruction of the
                    party for whose benefit the scene was exhibited, such an imposition could so
                    long have been practised, is one of the most remarkable phenomena in the history
                    of the human mind. It shows that when the imagination of the multitude is
                    inflamed, their general testimony is entitled to no credit; and that in such
                    circumstances, the testimony even of respectable individuals should be received
                    with distrust’.<note n="98" place="foot" resp="editor">From Charles Butler, ‘The

                    which he touches, and whose benignant feelings always command our respect, even
                    when we differ from him most widely in opinion. But the truth appears to be that
                    all was not imposition, and that the strong agency of enthusiasm had called
                    forth powers both of mind and body, the existence of which had not, at that
                    time, been suspected by psychologists, and of which, now their existence is
                    known, the nature and extent are alike mysterious. Mr. Butler himself probably

                    a direct miracle as this. But there were many so unlike the established course
                    of nature, that they were deemed miraculous by those who did not believe in the

                    equal probity, and not less distinguished in their day, were confident
                    believers. Some of the French bishops believed; others held that these things
                    were miracles indeed, but of the devil’s working; and this explication M.
                    Gregoire appears to adopt, relying upon the authority of his favourite father,
                    St. Augustine, that miracles may be wrought out of the unity of the church,
                    though he who works them is not the nearer to salvation. A middle course was
                    taken by those who thought the convulsions might properly be expected, but
                    disapproved of the succours, and the rest of the mummery, which had been
                    superinduced. They termed it, in that case, a mixed work, in which there was <hi

                    scandalous practices into disrepute, that they should be burlesqued in
                    puppet-shows. The ministers treated a serious evil more seriously, though,
                    perhaps, not more wisely. They banished some of the most conspicuous believers,
                    and imprisoned others. But no severity sufficed: the belief still prevailed, the
                    practices were continued; the disputes concerning them were vehemently carried
                    on till the commencement of the Revolution, and the Revolution, which overturned
                    every thing, did not destroy the sect of the <hi rend="ital"

                <p rend="indent1">Like the Victims, they derived a certain degree of credit from the
                    events of the Revolution, which they were believed to have foretold. One of the
                    crazy sisterhood had predicted a time when the sceptre would be broken, and the
                    crown be made the sport of a raging multitude. She had said that Louis XVI.
                    would be dethroned, and that perhaps his life would be attempted: she had
                    pronounced an anathema against kings and their subjects, pastors and their
                    flocks, and, taking a torch, she feigned to set fire to the four quarters of
                    Paris, betokening what must happen. Negroes and savages, she prophesied, were
                    about to enter France, and destroy every thing, and she foretold new schools for
                    error, a new catechism, new doctrines, and the persecution of those who should
                    oppose the teachers of falsehood. It is no wonder that these ravings of madness
                    were appealed to as genuine prophecy, when, during the reign of madness, so much
                    was actually perpetrated of what had been thus loosely denounced. But whether
                    the ravings themselves were the mere products of a distempered brain, or, like,
                    the prophecies of Merlin in old times, devised for preparing and bringing about
                    the events at which they pointed, is a question which may reasonably be asked.
                    It is an artifice which has been used in all ages and in all countries. Our own
                    history abounds with examples of it, and there is full proof that it was widely
                    practised at the commencement of those measures in France, which drew on the
                    Revolution. A society was established for the purpose of diffusing revolutionary
                    predictions and revolutionary principles throughout Europe, by means of
                    religious enthusiasm. Its headquarters were at Avignon, and it had its agents
                    every where. This is a curious subject which has never been thoroughly
                    investigated; and perhaps it is no longer possible to trace it to its source,
                    and ascertain who were the prime movers of the scheme, and whence the means of
                    supporting it were derived.<note n="104" place="foot" resp="editor">The history
                        of the Avignon Society remains disputed by scholars: most now agree that it
                        was established in 1786 by Don Antoine Joseph Pernety (1716-96) a former
                        Benedictine monk influenced both by Freemasonry and by Swedenborg, whose
                        writings he translated into French while working as the librarian to
                        Frederick the Great in Berlin. Pernety was aided by Count Thaddeus Leszczy
                        Grabianka (1740-1807), another Swedenborgian, whom he met in Berlin.
                        Following a visit to English Swedenborgians, Grabianka joined Pernety in
                        founding the Société des Illuminés d’Avignon, a group whose spiritual
                        practices took elements from freemasonry, alchemy, mesmerism, Catholic
                        mysticism and Swedenborgianism and which predicted a second coming and
                        imminent millennium. The Society was dispersed in 1793-94 during the
                        upheavals of the Revolution, when Pernety, Grabianka and others were
                        arrested, although a few members still remained as late as 1804. See Clarke

                    but seems to have been unacquainted with its proceedings, supposes that it was
                    chiefly composed of Swedenborgians, and disciples of St. Martin.<note n="105"

                        as the commencement of the last Judgement, St Martin lived a retired life,
                        interesting himself in spiritualism and animal magnetism.</note> The
                    Swedenborgians are innocent of any such machinations; they are an inoffensive

                    English journal, ‘a very eminent philosopher’. He was originally bred to the
                    law, but afterwards entered the army: falling, however, into opinions not
                    consistent with the military profession, he resigned his commission, travelled
                    in Italy and England; and, then fixing his abode in Paris, had the good fortune
                    to go through the revolution without being sullied by its crimes. M. Gregoire
                    says it is absurd to think that he ever wished to overthrow the government, but
                    that, according to those who knew him, he was an inoffensive, amiable man, who
                    set an example, <hi rend="ital">en bon Théosophe</hi>, of submission to the

                    might form a small volume worthy of being favourably received. This Theosophe
                    was too poor, too religious, and too insane to have any share in establishing

                    coalesces with the wildest revolutionary opinions. One of the most curious

                    and librarian to the King of Prussia, and who was one of the founders of so
                    strange an institution, should not have written his own life, so curiously

                        Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, in Berlin. In 1763-64 Pernety had been

                    The clandestine nature of their meetings, M. Gregoire says, favoured such an

                    the time when the delusion concerning Richard Brothers was prevailing. Both
                    these men were in humble life, the one a carpenter, the other a copper-plate
                    printer; both were poor and needy; and both were induced, in the year 1789, to
                    leave their wives and families, and set out for Avignon, being moved by the
                    Spirit to join a society there, who were favoured with divine communications.
                    Bryan had heard of this society from a certain Major Tieman,<note n="115"
                        place="foot" resp="editor">Tiemann von Berend, a Saxon who claimed to be a
                        major in the Russian army, and a freemason known to Grabianka, who acted as

                    in London two years before; and he had a friend at Paris who was also connected
                    with this mysterious association. They set off from London with only four
                    guineas; which barely carried them to Paris; there their friend supplied them
                    with seven <hi rend="ital">louis</hi>, and told them that the society were
                    expecting two brethren to unite with them. Upon reaching Avignon they found the
                    Russian Major there, and the society expecting them. ‘Nothing’, says Bryan’,
                    could exceed the brotherly kindness shown by these men, who told us we were
                    welcome to the house provided by the Lord for those of his children whom he
                    might be pleased to send to the re-union from all parts of the earth. They said
                    whatever was there, was ours as much as theirs; they had not any thing they
                    called their own; the Lord had done away the distinction of mine and thine in
                    their minds’. The Russian was their interpreter and instructor for a few days,
                    till their friend arrived from Paris. They remained there seven months ‘employed
                    in reading and making extracts from the journals of the Society, by which they
                    were informed of the many changes taking place, and to take place, in the
                    nations of the earth, to prepare the way of the Lord’s second coming, and the
                    restoration of his people, the whole house of Israel, according to the
                    prophecies in the Scriptures’. And when they departed, they were so liberally
                    supplied with money for their expenses, that they landed in England with ten
                    louis each.</p>
                <p rend="indent1">The grossest artifices were practised upon these simple men during
                    their stay. Wright says, ‘very often when we have been sitting together, the
                    furniture in the room has been shook, as though it was all coming to pieces; and
                    upon inquiring what was the cause, we were told that it announced the presence
                    of angels; and when these were not heard, the brethren were always afraid that
                    something was amiss, and so inquired at the Word of the Lord:’<note n="116"

                    intercourse with the Word, and at any time to obtain divine answers to the
                    questions which they proposed. The Englishmen were one day shown the Archangel
                    Raphael—in the appearance of a poor traveller. What the Society aimed at may be
                    gathered from what Wright published as having been faithfully copied from their

                A question was proposed, Whether the dislike which one of the Englishmen felt to
                    join with any community in their forms of worship, was from Heaven or not? The
                    answer was—‘Come, come, saith the Eternal Word, O all you whom I call, come to
                    me into the retreat, and you shall there find the calm and the rest, which my
                    love reserves for the elect who hearken unto me. Tell him, well-beloved son, <hi
                        rend="ital">yea</hi>. The voice which drew thee from the tumults and
                    contentions which divide thy own country, on the borders where thou dwellest,
                    will in silence dispose thy spirit for the truth: and wisdom will enter into thy
                    heart, and its virtue penetrate thy soul to spread it to the eyes of the
                    universe, when the Word, surrounded with glory, before long shall come,
                    dissipating error, to tread under foot vice and falsehood. Hearken, understand.
                    It was I who inspired thee when thou madest thy question; it is I who answered
                    thee; and it is by me that thou mayst know what thou wast, and what thou
                    oughtest to be’.</p>
                <p>Implicit belief was inculcated upon them in these answers from the oracle, and
                    they were encouraged to labour as missionaries in the cause, by vague promises
                    of happiness and elevation. ‘If the ardour which animates thee’, said the
                    pretended Word, ‘gives at last to thy heart over thy spirit the victory and the
                    empire; if thou renouncest the desire to discover before the time, the secret of
                    the mysteries which simple reason is not able to conceive, nothing can, my son,
                    convey an obstacle to that happiness which awaits thee. Believe, believe, my
                    son, every thing that I reveal to our Elect in the name of the Eternal; and the
                    Eternal will make thee of his glory the forerunning instrument in the places,
                    where his clemency wants to pardon those of thy nation whom the enemy seduces by
                    his prestiges’.</p>
                <p rend="indent1">The Quakers disowned Bryan for having taken this journey to
                    Avignon, though in so doing, he says, he was in the strictest sense obeying
                    their principles, for he was ‘very particularly led by the spirit’. To men thus
                    prepared, the French Revolution, which was then beginning, seemed to be the
                    commencement of the prodigious changes which they were taught to expect and to
                    announce. But <ref target="people.html#BrothersRichard">Richard Brothers</ref>
                    happening ere long to excite attention, they supposed that he was the chosen
                    instrument in whom the prophecies were to be fulfilled; and Brothers was of
                    course confirmed in his madness by their stories from Avignon. By his orders,
                    which were delivered in the name of the Lord, Wright published such parts of
                    what he had transcribed at Avignon as Brothers pointed out, the Prince of the
                    Hebrews thinking it proper that others should be suppressed. There is no reason
                    to question the facts of the narrative; and the prophecies, by their French
                    idiom, authenticate themselves. The whole agrees perfectly with what M. Gregoire
                    reports of a collection of papers on the subject, published by P. Pani, a
                    Commissioner of the inquisition at Rome.<note n="117" place="foot" resp="editor"

                    destined by Heaven to reform the world, by establishing a new people of God. The
                    members were distinguished not by their names, but by figures; this appears in
                    Wright’s extracts. The members were consecrated after a regular form; this also
                    appears by the English accounts, and they pretended to be favoured with dreams,
                    inspirations, and the ministry of angels. He who presided over their cabalistic
                    operations was called their Patriarch, or Pontiff; and there was a king destined
                    to govern the new chosen people. From Wright’s extracts it appears that this
                    king, whom they called Charles, was then a child or boy, and that his reign was
                    to commence in Poland. A certain Ottavio Cappelli,<note n="118" place="foot"

                        at the Avignon Society for two years from 1787 but was arrested in 1790
                        after his return to Rome, whereupon the papal authorities used his letters
                        to the Society as evidence of heresy. Freed in 1795, he was arrested again
                        in 1798 and executed. See Garrett, <title>Respectable Folly</title>, pp.

                    unfrocked himself, a gardener, was laid hold of by the Inquisition as the author
                    of the ritual for the reception of members, and as pretending to communicate
                    with the Archangel Raphael. The process was made, and he was condemned to abjure
                    his errors, and to be confined seven years in a fortress. Proceedings were
                    instituted also against the Society itself. According to Barruel, the nuncio of
                    Avignon ordered Pernetty and his adepts to quit that territory within a month;
                    but they had associates at Rome powerful enough to obtain a repeal of the order,
                    or bold and artful enough to forge one. The arrest of Cappelli, however, and the
                    proceedings against him, alarmed them, and they were only freed from their
                    apprehensions by the progress of the revolution. Pernetty died before that time,
                    in 1787; the Society then consisted of about an hundred members, and Barruel
                    accuses them of having formed in conjunction with the Illuminés of Sweden and of
                    Lyons, ‘<hi rend="ital">le plus secret, le plus monstrueux des collèges et le

                    his facts, and by assuming an hypothesis has given his book the appearance of a
                    romance, thereby rendering the real information which it contains suspicious.
                    The designs of the Society were mischievous enough: but the men who engage in
                    such schemes are not those who meddle with direct treason. They are too cunning
                    for that, if not too scrupulous; ready, at safe distance, to set others on, but
                    not to act with them, or implicate themselves. The only effect of the Avignon
                    Society during the revolution may possibly be traced in a dispatch of Charlier
                    and Pochole, the commissioners of the National Convention at Lyons. They
                    reported that a sect had arisen in that department, who professed a
                    determination of establishing the Republic of Christ; and that crowds of
                    persons, under circumstances the most alarming, were abandoning their homes, and
                    assembling to march to Jerusalem. But they had easily been put down.</p>
                <p rend="indent1">M. Gregoire, with little propriety, calls this mysterious society
                    the Fanatics of Avignon. In Pernetty’s life, he says, it consisted of about an
                    hundred members, but in 1804 was reduced to six or seven. He speaks of a woman
                    as still belonging to it, and corresponding with a retired soldier at Avignon,
                    who has published a translation of the 68th Psalm from the Hebrew, and asserts
                    in his Commentary, that the Ark of Alliance, the Manna, and Aaron’s Rod, are
                    existing in safe concealment in the Holy Land, and will be brought to light when
                    the Jews shall enter into the bosom of the church. These persons are mere
                    enthusiasts. But the history of the Society deserves more investigation than he
                    has bestowed upon it.</p>
                <p rend="indent1">One of the most curious articles in the Ex-Bishop’s book is that
                    upon the present state of Protestantism. It is interesting to know the opinions
                    of the most decided <hi rend="ital">Liberals</hi> in the Catholic Church upon
                    that subject. Like Bossuet, he has taken all the advantage that the spirit of
                    dissent afforded him; and boldly affirms, that as a consequence of the
                    Protestants’ own principles, more <hi rend="ital">Illuminés</hi>, and more
                    Visionaries, ought to be found, and in reality are found among them than among
                    the Catholics. This he says in a work which contains an account of the <hi
                        rend="ital">Convulsionaires</hi>! But the truth is, that the <hi rend="ital"
                        >Illuminés</hi> belong at least as much to knavery as to enthusiasm; and
                    that the Visionaries, were it possible to ascertain their relative numbers,
                    would be found in proportion to that of the Catholic and Protestant population.
                    Theirs are cases of nosology: in Protestant states there is no preventive police
                    to prevent the disease, when it manifests itself, from becoming endemic: the
                    Catholic church sometimes cuts it short, and sometimes takes it under its care,
                    disarms it of its dangerous symptoms, and then inoculates for it. <ref

                        have eaten nothing at all, but this claim was exposed as false by a team of

                        Catholicism in 1707.</note>—a scandalous decision, founded upon the falsest
                    reasoning. For what can be more grossly fallacious than to infer, that, because
                    they who live conscientiously and piously in an erring church, will, by God’s
                    mercy, be saved, therefore it is allowable, for the sake of any great temporal
                    advantage, to enter into that erring church and renounce a purer one? He boasts
                    also of the numerous proselytes to Catholicism in Germany, enumerating with
                    pride the distinguished names of Winkelmann, Schlegel, and, greater than either,
                    Count Frederick Stolberg.<note n="122" place="foot" resp="editor">Johann Joachim

                        Friedrich Leopold, Count zu Stolberg (1750-1819). All three men converted to
                        Catholicism.</note> The secretary of the diocese of Strasburg, he says, has
                    within four years expedited about three hundred powers for reconciling
                    Protestants to the Catholic church. In the year 1767 the Bishops, pursuant to a
                    motion in the House of Lords by Lord Radnor, required their clergy to take an
                    account of the number of Catholics in their respective parishes; the increase at
                    that time was said to have been very great; and it has been stated, that within
                    the last thirty years they have increased seven-fold. This may be matter for
                    grave political consideration. But if the nature of such conversions were
                    inquired into, part would be found to consist of persons who, having been tost
                    about by every wind of doctrine, shifted from sect to sect, and rested at last
                    where they found not the most reason, but the most imposing assumption of
                    authority. A larger portion would be women who had suffered themselves to be
                    caught in the cobweb of controversy by some priest, an adept in such arts; and
                    the great majority would be ignorant persons in low life, neglected by their own
                    church, and glad to fasten themselves as beadsmen upon some wealthy catholics.
                    It is true, as M. Gregoire boasts, that the <hi rend="ital">set-off</hi> against
                    these numbers is very trifling; but it is not true that the few proselytes which
                    have been made by the English church have consisted chiefly of emigrant priests,
                    and that the affair, as Erasmus says, terminates usually, like a comedy, in a
                        wedding.<note n="123" place="foot" resp="editor">Erasmus’s caustic remark,
                        after Luther’s marriage, on the reformation which rent the Catholic

                    church of England is not like a sect, solicitous for converts, nor does it boast
                    of them; but it has at this day, to our knowledge, proselytes from the Church of
                    Rome, to whom no unworthy motives can possibly be attributed, and of whose
                    talents and virtues any community might be proud.</p>
                <p rend="indent1">If the Ex-Bishop is to be believed, when he predicts what is to
                    come, ‘Protestantism will never again become what it has been, and cannot remain
                    what it is; an irresistible movement is bearing it towards its end, its
                    constitution itself is the corrosive germ of its existence. It will have the
                    fate of all those sects’, he says, ‘which the Catholic church, during eighteen
                    centuries, has seen successively rise, attack, and fall away before her; while,
                    elevating her majestic head above all errors, heresies, and schisms, directed by
                    her divine founder, she holds on to the consummation of ages’. According to him,
                    its triumph must be not only sure, but easy,— so easy, indeed, as to be
                    inglorious. The Protestant clergy have long taken to preach upon ethics for want
                    of piety, for want of theological abilities, and from idleness. To declaim
                    against vice requires no great depth either of mind or erudition; but to
                    instruct their hearers in the great truths of Christianity, and to make them
                    love, and admire, and adore that which produces the true sanctification of the
                    heart, of this they are not capable’. Is M. Gregoire ignorant even of the names
                    of our great divines, that he should repeat this impudent declamation of one as
                    ignorant as himself of the subject upon which he is declaiming?</p>
                <p rend="indent1">Holding the Protestants thus cheaply, M. Gregoire touches upon the
                    question of a Reunion of the Churches. Collectively considered he classes the
                    Protestants in two great divisions, the one consisting of those who, like the
                    Unitarians in England, and the philosophizing Christians of Germany, believe as
                    much of revealed religion as suits with their system, and no more; the other,
                    those who hold fast to revelation, but are split into an hundred subdivisions.
                    The former, he says, cannot become parties to any reunion with the Romish
                    Church, yet, with a strange inconsistency, he enumerates Professors Eichorn and
                        Paulus<note n="124" place="foot" resp="editor">Johann Gottfried Eichhorn
                        (1753-1827), the German theologian and Biblical critic; Heinrich Eberhard
                        Gottlob Paulus (1761-1851), the German theologian.</note> among the
                    Protestant <hi rend="ital">Savans</hi> who might enter upon the project with
                    more success than their predecessors; and he points out a number of Catholics,
                    among whom the only English name is the truly respectable one of
                        Berrington,<note n="125">Shute Barrington (1734-1826), Bishop of Llandaff in
                        Wales, as well as Bishop of Salisbury and Bishop of Durham, and an advocate
                        of maximum toleration of Catholics.</note> as persons who may direct their
                    labours to the same end. It would be easy, he says, for the different
                    governments of Europe to second these views. The Catholic Church admits of no
                    compromise upon any point of doctrine, but upon matters of discipline it may
                    make some sacrifices.</p>
                <p rend="indent1">In this respect M. Gregoire certainly deserves the praise of
                    candour, that he neither disguises nor qualifies any of his own opinions, for
                    the sake of making them appear less obnoxious than they are to Christians of
                    other persuasions. ‘Civil and religious toleration’, he says, ‘must not be
                    confounded. Religious toleration would imply that error and truth are
                    indifferent: but truth cannot be indifferent; there is but one truth, and
                    religious toleration would therefore be an outrage to God, who is truth itself.
                    Civil toleration is that which grants to every one the liberty of publicly
                    performing his worship,—a right inalienable in every political society, and
                    which ought to be called liberty of worship—not toleration’. ‘Out of the church
                    there is no salvation, as there was none out of the ark of Noah, which was its
                    type’. But if this postulate be granted, toleration becomes, by the plainest and
                    straightest reasoning, what the old Presbyterians called it, soul-murder, and
                    the consequences drawn from it by Bishop Gardener and Bishop Bonner<note n="126"

                    they are authorized and approved by the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman
                    Church. Their conclusions fall to the ground, because the principle is false.
                    But M. Gregoire holds the principle in its widest extent. The Paschal Lamb, he
                    says, is not to be eaten out of the bosom of the church. Out of the Ark of Noah
                    all persons perished, even infants, and those who had never heard of it. Upon
                    this subject M. Gregoire produces whatever is most positive in the language of
                    St. Augustine, for the purpose of avowing his full assent to it! All men, he
                    says, are children of wrath, therefore all worthy of vengeance, all worthy of
                    punishment, all worthy of hell. It is an article of faith that the sin of Adam
                    being transmitted to his descendants renders them all guilty. To wish therefore,
                    in favour of infidels, and of those who have not been baptized, to open a new
                    road whereby they may escape damnation, is to contradict Christ himself; for at
                    the Last Judgement some will be on his right hand to enter into eternal
                    happiness, and others on his left to partake the punishment of the devils.
                    Whoever is not on the right, will indubitably be on the left. He will not even
                    tolerate the opinion that unbaptized infants undergo a kind of damnation in
                    which they are exempt from actual torments. ‘A kind of damnation!’ he exclaims,
                    ‘what language! God does not inflict upon them positive pain! Then they are not
                    children of wrath, as the Scripture calls them. St. Augustine affirms that he
                    who is not in the kingdom of Heaven is in eternal fire’. By a curious infelicity
                    M. Gregoire contrives to unite in his own opinions whatever is most odious in
                    Calvinism with whatever is most offensive in the Romish superstition. And
                    sincerely is it to be regretted that Christianity should thus be represented by
                    one of its sincere advocates in a country which is overrun with infidelity.
                    Wherever the doctrine of the damnation of infants is taught, wherever a church
                    proclaims, without reserve or limitation, that salvation is to be obtained only
                    within its own fold, wherever transubstantiation is the prominent object of
                    faith, infidelity must and will predominate.</p>
                <p rend="indent1">Upon the subject of infidelity we shall shortly recur to M.
                    Gregoire. For the present we would part from him in good will, and with respect
                    for his openness and benevolence, though in the most decided hostility to his
                    errors, both political and religious. The following passage would disarm us of
                    any hostile feeling. ‘Some important facts’, says the author, ‘perhaps even some
                    erroneous citations may have escaped me. Learned men of different communions,
                    among whom I have many friends, will in their indulgence forgive me this, and by
                    their information correct it. If any expressions which may shock them should
                    have crept in, I should be deeply grieved. Attached by principle and by feeling
                    to the Catholic Religion, it is in her bosom and in her instructions that I find
                    the obligation of loving all men, of doing good to them, whatever may be their
                    country, their colour, their religion. My religion makes it a duty, my heart
                    makes it a pleasure. And though widely differing from Sturges<note n="127"

                    agree with him that the want of charity is equivalent to a great heresy’.</p>
