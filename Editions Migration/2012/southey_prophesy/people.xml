                            1792, Brothers had a series of visions and began to prophesy that God
                            was about to bring about the destruction of London and the downfall of
                            monarchs. By 1793 he was announcing himself as the prophet called to
                            lead the lost tribes of Israel back to Palestine, an event which would
                            be precipitated by God’s judgement wreaked upon London and by George III
                            ceding his throne to Brothers himself. Over the next two years, his
                            mission was recognised by William Bryan and John Wright, whose sojourn
                            at Avignon had led them to expect the imminent arrival of a millennial
                            leader. Brothers published <title>A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophecies
                                and Times</title> in 1794; Bryan, Wright and other admirers with
                            whom Southey was acquainted also published pamphlets declaring their
                            belief in his prophecy. The success of this work, and the advocacy of
                            Brothers’ mission by the MP Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, drew Brothers to
                            the attention of a government that was already afraid, in face of unrest
                            caused by food prices and scarcity, of a revolutionary uprising.
                            Brothers was arrested on 4 March 1795, examined before a committee of
                            the Privy Council, and confined to a madhouse, where he wrote <title>A
                                Description of Jerusalem</title> (published by a supporter in 1801).
                            He remained there until 1806, when he was released, and subsequently
                            lived with supporters. By 1802, however, most of his supporters had
                            fallen away, many becoming followers of Joanna Southcott, whose
                            prophetic claims he rejected in his <title>Dissertation on the Fall of
                                Eve</title> (1802). Southey planned to visit him in March 1806,
                            having known his supporters William Bryan, Samuel Whitchurch and James
                            Crease in the 1790s.</gloss>

                                >letter of October 1794</ref> Southey wrote that he was to be
                            introduced to a prophet. The prophet was most likely Bryan, by this time
                            a follower of Richard Brothers, and the location of the meeting either
                            Bristol or Bath. Southey knew two other followers of Brothers in Bath,
                            Samuel Whitchurch and James Crease; Bryan was at this time a prophetic
                            healer in Bristol. Later, Southey recalled ‘Bryan I knew personally,
                            &amp; heard from his own lips his history, &amp; his explanation of the
                            system of Brothers’. In <title>Letters from England</title> Southey
                            gives in detail Bryan’s story. A copperplate printer and engraver, and a
                            Quaker, Bryan, after experiencing a vision, went in 1789 with John
                            Wright to join the Society of Illuminés at Avignon where, in that
                            post-Swedenborgian, semi-Masonic group, he received spiritual
                            communications informing him of the coming of a prophet and the imminent
                            millennium. Returning later in the year, Bryan lived in London. In 1793
                            he was at first suspicious of Brothers’ claims to be a prophet but by
                            1795 had accepted their legitimacy and become one of his advocates, as
                            he revealed in his <title>A Testimony of the Spirit of Truth concerning
                                Richard Brothers ... in an address to the people of Israel, &amp;c.,

                            begun to uncover more details of Bryan’s prophetic career. In his
                            article ‘William Bryan, Another Anti-Swedenborg Visionary Engraver of
                            1789’, <title>Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly</title>, 34 (2000), 14-22,
                            David Worrall has shown that in the mid 1780s, Bryan acted with two or
                            three other vendors to sell Robert Hindmarsh’s printings of Swedenborg’s
                                <title>A Summary View of the Heavenly Doctrines of the New Jerusalem
                                Church</title> (1785), <title>The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
                                concerning the Sacred Scripture</title> (1786), <title>The Doctrine
                                of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord</title> (1786) and
                                <title>The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem</title> (1786).
                            Like William Blake, Bryan interested himself in Swedenborgianism, only
                            to become dissatisfied with the conventionality of its church practice:
                            his trip to Avignon was encouraged by other onetime Swedenborgians. On
                            his return he lived at 51 Upper Mary-le-bone Street, to the north of
                            Oxford St—a ‘minor center of contemporary progressive religious and
                            political activity’ (Worrall, 14). Thomas Clio Rickman, friend and
                            publisher of Thomas Paine, lived at no. 7; by late 1790 the
                            Swedenborgian Carl Bernhard Wadstrom lived at no. 45. Worrall also shows
                            that at this time Bryan came to the attention of the authorities who
                            were monitoring potentially seditious radicals. A letter of Bryan’s,
                            written on 13 December 1789, was intercepted and kept in the records of
                            the Privy Council (PRO, Kew PC 1/18/19). Bryan writes there of the
                            errors of Swedenborg, as ‘revealed to our society by an immediate
                            communication with Heaven’. He also records ‘the following words’
                            communicated to him by ‘the Angell Gabriell’: ‘Nations the Eternal calls
                            the times, &amp; the time that walks in the shadow over days of
                            darkness, without light, &amp; without strength is coming to change the
                            face of the world &amp; to begin his new reign, the time is near wherein
                            the promises will be accomplished, the Human Blood will flow in large
                            streams, that the enemies of God may subsist no longer &amp; that the
                            true religion may be known all over the world, prepare yourselves, do
                            not cease to pray and do not fear any thing from the calamities which
                            are to happen for you will not experience them provided you continue
                            united &amp; faithful’ (quoted Worrall 21). In 1795, Brothers was to
                            employ very similar prophetic rhetoric: it may be that his understanding
                            of his mission was shaped by Bryan, and by the expectations Bryan had
                            formed at Avignon. Southey’s acquaintance the Welsh poet and scholar
                            Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg) (1747-1826) offers another contemporary
                            portrait of Bryan, as does Williams’ biographer Elijah Waring (c.
                            1788-1857), who knew Bryan in later years. Waring’s report of Williams’
                            conversation, and account of his own acquaintance, is worth giving in

                            when he was living near Bristol, in the winter of 1794-5. After
                            Espriella’s letters were published, he found me out in London, (I think
                            it was in 1808,) and I instantly recognised him, though he was then in
                            the complete garb of a Quaker, and apparently of one with whom the world
                            went smoothly.</quote>

                            the conspirators had at command. They had agents in London to find out
                            such men as Bryan and Wright, and send them on their pilgrimage: and it
                            appears also that they had agents to receive them at certain points upon
                            the way, and to supply them with money. If the whole scheme could be
                            traced, it would form a very singular chapter in the history of those

                        <quote>[Waring:] William Bryan became an adherent of Richard Brothers, and
                            consequently was deceived by the same cunning mechanism that imposed
                            upon the pseudo prophet: but he certainly had nothing of the conspirator
                            in his nature ; being one of the mildest and most gentle of men, and
                            unfeignedly religious, though imaginative and eccentric. I knew him
                            well, and ever found him full of intelligence, benevolence, and piety.
                            When he related to me, in 1812, his adventures in the Avignon affair, he
                            did it with great simplicity and candour, acknowledging himself dubious
                            as to the real origin of what he had supposed to be a divine intimation,
                            though many public events throughout Europe had fallen out in accordance
                            with the prophetic utterances he had there heard. I was then a young
                            man, and Bryan advanced in years, but still retaining a fine set of
                            features, and a general expression of head, which had often been
                            compared to the best paintings of our Saviour; whilst his speech was
                            peculiarly melifluous. The account of the Avignon prophets given by
                            Southey, in Espriella’s Letters, accords substantially with the personal
                            details communicated to me. William Bryan afterwards emigrated to
                            America, where he had several sons respectably settled, and where he
                            died at a great age, only a few years ago, honoured and lamented by all
                            who knew him. I saw a letter of his, written shortly before his death,
                            which indicated the most sublime Christian hopes and anticipations,
                            blended with a clear intellect. It is remarkable that all the
                            unconscious agents in what appears to have been a deeply concerted
                            political plot, for subverting the governments of Europe, should have
                            been selected from the same class of harmless, devout, and unsuspicious
                            men; such being not only least liable to be suspected, but best adapted
                            to recommend the opinions which were intended.</quote>

                            engaged in a (pseudonymous) debate about the Welsh language in the pages
                            of the <title>Monthly Magazine</title>. Southey consulted Pughe about
                            bardic poetry and Welsh history when composing his Welsh-American poem
                            <title>Madoc</title> (1805). Southey also received from Pughe Welsh
                            Arthurian stories from the Mabinogion, some of which Pugh translated in

                            the female, suggesting that she herself fulfilled the predictions in

                            Revelation 12, that the Woman clothed in the Sun will precipitate a
                            millennium. Southey’s sceptical distrust of Southcott and her movement
                            came to a head in 1814, when she announced that she, a virgin of
                            sixty-four, was pregnant with Shiloh, the returning saviour. She died,
                            without issue, on 27 December, although William Sharp believed that her
                            body might only be in a trance and be resuscitated and the Shiloh
                            discovered. She left behind her a ‘great box’, made by Sharp, containing
                            sealed prophecies and to be opened by the bishops of the Church of
                            England. <ref target="http://www.panacea-society.org/more%20on%20box.htm">The Panacea Society</ref> announces on its website that the box is

                            disappointed with the New Jerusalem Church there, finding it too
                            conventional. At Avignon, Wright was told to expect the millennial
                            deliverer prophesied to appear in England by the seventeenth-century
                            Presbyterian Christopher Love. Returning from Avignon, Wright later
                            identified Brothers as this promised deliverer, hailing him as such in
