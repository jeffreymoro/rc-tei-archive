    <p rend="noCount"><ref target="places.html#Uley">Uley</ref> is situated in rather a singular
     valley, about seven miles from the <ref target="places.html#Severn">Severn</ref>. It appears to
     be surrounded by abrupt and woody hills, except on the north, where a bold promontory, with an
     old camp on its brow, calld the 'Berry,'<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">'Bury'] 'Berry'*

     whose sides, yielding plenty of stone for building, are extremly steep. Yet they are not hills,
     but merely the terminations of the upland country of Gloucestershire termed the 'Cotswold
     Levels' and here they break suddenly into the vale of the <ref target="places.html#Severn"
      >Severn</ref>:<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Severn] A marginal note in the MS reads '<ref

     seen), which, in its further progress, becomes of such importance to the clothiers. The Curate
     of <ref target="places.html#Uley">Uley</ref> preaches here once a fortnight, and he lately ran
     the hazard of his life by the falling of the sounding-board, which struck him a violent blow on
     the head.— The country immediately round this valley on the high ground, is every where
     intersected by stone walls; for stone, a brick thickness, more or less, is the invariable
     consequence of digging ten inches into the ground; they are merely piled, without morter,
     easily made, and as easily mended. A strange desolate appearance! In the valley there is no
     such thing. The verdure is of the most vivid green, and the uneven boundary of woods on the
     allmost perpendicular sides of the high grounds, form the finest amphitheatre I have ever seen.
     But hold! I am going down the Wye! </p>

     among some fishermen who were disturbing the water with long poles to dislodge the salmon. To
     accomplish this they occasionally used an infant kind of boat, which they carry with them in
     their large one. It holds but one person; is, as far as I can guess not more than 4 foot in
     length, goes with the broadest end foremost, is worked by a paddle, has no keel or rudder, and
     is formd of wickers only, and cover'd by an oil-skin outside to repel the water. The man
     paddles himself on shore, jumps out, and takes his boat at his back with great ease. It had a
     strange and even laughable appearance; It was impossible to keep the mind at home; it would

     so large a growth as are flourishing between the outer and inner ramparts of these towers, and
     on the top of the wall of course. This gangway, once the place of the defenders of the fortress
     and its centinels, is now an absolute wild: a mixture of Brambles, Hazel, Ash, Beech, and fruit
     trees, from twenty to thirty feet high at least. The whole area of the Chappel which I was much
     taken with, (though the man in attendance called it the banqueting-room) is coverd with
     thriving underwood. The look out from its large windows must have been allmost dreadful, as

     cannot possibly enter into particulars in a flying journal like this. We spent two hours

     precipitate lanes that lead up to the high ground, the best way would be to hire a carriage on
     purpose, that would carry half our party. We learn'd that a man in the neighbourhood was in the

     fruit, and every thing that could render the expidition agreeable and joyous. In this style,
     the whole cavalcade left the Angel Inn at <ref target="places.html#Abergavenny">Abergany</ref>,
     and excited a great deal of mirth. The roads up the mountain are such as nothing could have
     passed but a cart. Brambles, honeysuckles, and hazelnuts, rap'd us on the head as we jolted up
     the courses of the winter's torrents, for every lane is a water-course. <ref

      '<ref target="places.html#Skirrid">Skirid Vawr</ref>' was on our right, but the day was hazy,
     and the prospect not so extensive as it sometimes is. We reach'd the top of the woody part of
     this high ground, and then had a fairer view of the peak, or summit of the Sugar Loaf '<ref

     and fragments allmost to the summit, where the poor animal trembled and neigh'd for his

     servants relieved each other in the necessary duty of holding the horses, and enjoy'd the scene
     by turns. —— We all sat on the soft green, or rather brown heath or Ling; and from a spring
     just below the rocky summit had some excellent water. From this sublime eminence the eye ranges
     over others still higher, and the &lt;blue mists hanging over the horizon, gave to the&gt; long
     line of intersecting mountains the appearance of a sea of hills. We had left beauty behind,
     here was nothing but sublimity! and I think that mirth would be the last feeling likely to be
     excited in such a situation. The air was remarkably fresh and invigorating; some few drops of
     rain fell, which were most likely not known in the country below. We left the summit with
     regret. At a considerable way from the more rocky part of the hill, in our descent, a cloth was
     spread on the moss beside a rivulet, the horses tied to a thorn, and the cold <del

     not a whit better than the other. We at length reachd the turnpike road to <ref

     that having been long promised and expected, could hardly have been despensed with, and which

     Gloucester, where we dined at three at the King's Head. The Cathedrial is beauty itself.
     Westminster is black and venerable, Canterbury is gigantic, and mix'd in its beauties, but
     this, and particularly the Tower, is a noble and lovely object. We look at it as we would at a
     beautiful woman, without cessation, and without tiring. Gloucester Cathedrial is the burial
     place of Robert of Normandy, and of Edward ye Second, murder'd at <ref

     beauties tame, because they were compared with what we had seen. I have imbibed the highest
