                    my arrival in England, I was interrogated by almost every person who knew I came
                    from Gibraltar, respecting the situation of that important fortress.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> My health and spirits are so much impaired by my sufferings at
                    that place, that I several times put the succeeding narrative into the hands of
                    those, whose curiosity could not be satisfied with asking a few questions. They
                    liked it;—they borrowed it for their friends, and desired me to publish it. I
                    yielded to their persuasions, and, “with all its imperfections on its head,” I
                    give it to the Public.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"

                        imperfections on my head.”</note> If it is an error to publish it, it is an

                    a female pen. I knew the ill-natured and ill-judging part of the world would
                    freely condemn, though they had never seen it. <emph>The Siege of Gibraltar by a

                    degree entertaining to my Readers.</p>

                <p rend="noCount"> These reasons will satisfy every one, whose approbation is worth
                    my notice.—Those who soar beyond the reach of human feelings, I need not attempt
                    to please.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> When I had been in London a few days, I solicited the Commander
                    in Chief for a commission for my son. Some Noblemen in Lord Amherst’s elevated

                    though his Lordship’s Answer contained a denial to my request, it was conceived
                    in the most polite and respectful terms: assuring me, if my son was of a proper
                    age, he would immediately recommend him to his Majesty for a commission.</p>

                <p rend="noCount"> I purpose to relate, during my voyage, what happened to us from
                    the time the Spaniards began to fire upon us till this day, which is exactly six
                    weeks and three days; but you by no means comprehend what I mean by suffering
                    from cold, hunger and thirst, unless I give you some account of the <hi

                    the garrison was well supplied with provisions? I have not patience to find the
                    news-papers, which the fleet brought over, stuffed with such palpable falshoods!
                    We have not had a vessel from Barbary these fourteen or fifteen months, nor from
                    Algiers for a longer time. Four or five small brigs, at different times, got in
                    from Minorca; but how inadequate were their small cargoes to supply so many
                    thousands of people! Besides, what they brought, sold at such an enormous price,
                    that few subaltern officers could become purchasers. What ensign or lieutenant
                    could afford to give three pounds twelve shillings for a turkey, two guineas for
                    a pig, half a guinea for a duck, and nine shillings for a very small hen? Eggs
                    were sold for two years past at a
                    <emph xml:space="preserve">real </emph>a-piece, which is almost sixpence English
                    money; cabbages, eight pence a-piece, (the outside leaves of which the pigs in
                    England would scarcely eat) were carefully tied up, and six of them sold for
                    three-pence; old dried pease, one shilling and four-pence a pound; flour, a
                    shilling a pound; Irish butter, half a crown a pound; very bad brown sugar, half
                    a crown a pound; candles, that would not burn three quarters of an hour, <pb

                    /> six-pence a piece; biscuits, full of maggots, a shilling a pound; the worst
                    tea that ever was used, sixteen shillings a pound; soap, one shilling and
                    two-pence a pound; salt, that was more than half dirt and rubbish, eight-pence a
                    pound; goat’s milk, half of which was water, was eight-pence a pint. I have many
                    times paid a shilling for a few herbs to put into my pease soup.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Though Gibraltar is surrounded by the sea, we were no better
                    supplied with fish than with the other articles of life. The fishermen were
                    Genoese, and they chose to catch very few, that they might have a pretence for
                    enhancing the price:—a quantity that would dine but two persons, cost four
                    shillings. Many people kept pigs in the garrison, but the pork, which was fed on
                    all the filth the place produced, never sold under two shillings a pound. I have
                    known a guinea refused for a calf’s pluck. An ox, which could work no longer,
                    was killed, and twenty-seven shillings were asked for its head!</p>
                <p rend="noCount">The garrison expected to find an agreeable alteration when Admiral
                    Rodney’s fleet arrived in January, 1780, but it proved nothing more than a

                        participated in many significant military encounters throughout the
                        eighteenth century, including the Seven Years’ War and the Great Siege of
                        Gibraltar, among other conflicts during the American War of Independence.

                    of battle ships to be stationed at Gibraltar, and by that means the Spaniards
                    remained masters of the bay. General Eliott, like a wise and prudent Governor,
                    was extremely desirous to make the stock of provisions last as long as possible,
                    not knowing what might befall a fleet of ships sent from England for our relief,
                    or when such a fleet could be spared, being then engaged in a Dutch war.<note

                <p rend="noCount"> You may form some judgment how scarce we began to be of the

                    time perhaps was not far distant when they would be extremely glad of that for
                    nourishment which they then used as an ornament.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Of all men living, General Eliott is the most likely to keep
                    possession of Gibraltar. Though he is formed for great actions, he attends, with
                    unwearied assiduity, to the minutiae of what relates to his important trust! He
                    is, I think, take him all in al, a most excellent character. He would much
                    sooner forgive rudeness than flattery, which is at once a proof of the goodness
                    of his heart, and the solidity of his understanding. Was there any probability
                    of my opinion of him falling into his hands, I would suppress it; for as he
                    could not possibly discover the sincerity of my thoughts, he might mistake
                    candor for panegyric.—He bought a large quantity of oil, raisins, rice, &amp;c.
                    and gave them to us instead of so much meat; but subalterns with their families,
                    who depended solely on their pay, sensibly felt the difference: rice, without
                    either milk, butter, sugar, or eggs (which were delicacies we could not afford
                    to purchase) and boiled in <foreign>aqua pura</foreign> only, was, a tasteless
                    viand. Oil indeed was very useful; it served us to burn instead of candles, and
                    I was no longer obliged to go to bed by five o’clock for want of light. Raisins
                    pleased and satisfied my children when I had no bread to give them. Now I must
                    mention two important articles we began to be distressed for, namely, bread and
                    fire. About October last, the Governor found it necessary to take a quarter of a
                    pound a day of the former from each man; but the soldiers, to their immortal
                    honour, murmured not! Each man’s allowance of meat was reduced to a pound <pb

                    /> and a half a week, and such meat!—the dogs in England would have turned from
                    it with disgust!—But it was not <emph xml:space="preserve">all </emph>in that
                    <emph xml:space="preserve">putrid </emph>condition, for some of the pork was
                    very good.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> I was in continual dread of the scurvy; and my beloved Charlotte,
                    who I have suckled for fifteen months past, will, I am much afraid, feel the
                    effects of my unwholsome diet as long as she lives. Yet, what could I do? My
                    husband’s pay, though a lieutenant, would not purchase milk for my children! The
                    “silken sons of ease” in England know not what the army have endured in
                    Gibraltar! Yet, some will say, that till the Spaniards fired, their duty was not
                    hazardous; to these I answer, Is not death from the mouth of a cannon more
                    acceptable than in the shape of famine?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> By this time the stock of flour the bakers had in hand was nearly
                    consumed; a small quantity was baked, and sold at seven o’clock in a morning at
                    one particular place; a guard was obliged to be kept at the door, to keep the
                    people from teaching each other to pieces! A handkerchief was thrown in at the
                    window with the money in it, and no person was suffered to purchase two loaves;
                    these weighed about a pound, and cost five-pence. Happy were they who could get
                    one, for the inhabitants who had no flour left, and officers who had children,
                    were in a deplorable situation indeed! I cannot now recollect the distress of a
                    poor woman, without feeling a pang at my heart which gives me a sensible
                    uneasiness. She sat weeping at my door with two children, the one about seven
                    years old, the other in an infant which she suckled:—after the former had
                    repeatedly asked her for bread, she laid down her youngest child, and gave her
                    breast to her other son, saying, <emph>Suck me to death at once!</emph>—Gracious

                    stranger to the soft pleadings of humanity!——However, I desired her to come into
                    my apartment, and gave her part of my own breakfast, though I knew not what to
                    do for bread for the next meal!</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Firing was now become a scarce and important article. The coals
                    which government sent by the fleet in the winter of 1780 were nearly exhausted.
                    General Eliott, ever watchful for the preservation of the garrison, secured the
                    hulks of the Spanish fire-ships, which were driven almost under our batteries,
                    and gave every office one hundred and a half of wood, which was to last each
                    family a fortnight. The strictest care and economy could not make it even last
                    for the dressing of our scanty meals. Our cloaths we washed in cold water, and
                    put on without ironing; but when the rainy season came on, I suffered more from
                    the cold than I ever did in the severest winter in England: for what is the
                    inconvenience of a cold day by the chearing warmth of a good fire-side?——You can
                    form no idea of the periodical rains in Gibraltar!</p>

                    leave the partner of my heart behind!——yet I could neither assist nor save him,
                    if I staid. My son <emph>Jack</emph>, observing me grieve, just now ran to me,
                    and said, “Don’t cry, Mamma; the good roast beef we shall get in England <pb

                <p rend="noCount"> On the twelfth of April last, at one o’clock in the morning, an
                    English cutter came in with news of the fleet being within a few leagues of us.
                    Extravagant was our joy, you may be sure; and while friends and neighbours were
                    congratulating each other on the prospect of eating beef and mutton once more,
                    the Spaniards, about eleven o’clock, began the most furious bombardment ever
                    heard of.—Terror and consternation deprived me for a minute of sense and motion.
                    Our house was one of the nearest to the Spanish lines. I seized my children, and
                    ran with them towards Montague’s bastion, which I knew was bomb proof. An
                    officer of the fifty-eighth regiment met <pb n="9" rend="new"

                    you going? Do not you know that you are going nearer to the enemy’s fire? Stoop
                    with your children under this covered way.” Six and twenty-pounders without
                    number went over my head. I presented my little ones towards heaven, and in an
                    agony of prayer, beseeched the <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Almighty</hi> to
                    preserve us. I then had the courage to advance towards Montague’s bastion, and
                    having walked down a few steps, my strength failed me, and I fell down the rest.
                    Fortunately I received no hurt, and ran or rather flew into the soldiers
                    barracks. This was no time for the indulgence of pride, distinction, or even
                    delicacy. The soldiers who were off duty, in their blunt, honest way,
                    endeavoured to chear my spirits, saying, “Never fear, Madam; if the d——d Dons
                    fire to eternity, they will never take the old rock, nor the good souls that are
                    upon it; and if General Eliott would let us sally out at Landport Gate, my life
                    to a farthing we would lay the Spanish camp in ashes.” I admired their courage,
                    but could not eat any dinner with them agreeable to their invitation.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> We were then firing upon the enemy from almost every battery that
                    bore upon them. My head was almost distracted with the noise of so many cannon
                    being fired from the top of the building where I had taken shelter. I had the
                    happiness, however, of feeling my husband enter the place; luckily for me, he
                    was not on duty that or the day following: he procured a curtain, and hung it
                    round one of the soldiers beds for me. I laid down in my cloaths, but sleep was
                    out of the question; the bursting of shells, and the terrifying sound of cannon
                    balls, were sufficient to keep me awake; add to this, the disagreeableness of
                    lying amongst near an hundred private soldiers: <pb n="10" rend="new"
                        facs="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/editions/upton/images/siege_017Thumb.jpg"
                    /> yet I was thankful to find admittance even here, for none know what they will
                    submit to in order to save their lives, till they are tried with the near
                    prospect of approaching death.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> The next day our servant said, he would venture into our house,
                    and endeavour to bring me a few cloaths: he did so, but found it almost in
                    ruins: a shell burst in the kitchen, and a ball entered the roof and passed
                    through my bed into the parlour, while he was there.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> On the third day, Mr. ******* was Lieutenant of the picquet—many
                    buildings were set on fire by the enemy’s shells; and it was his duty to see the
                    fires put out, and to protect some of the better sort of the inhabitants who
                    were endeavouring to remove their effects to the south, and who had applied to
                    the Governor for a guard for that purpose. I could not recollect the dangers he
                    was exposed to, without being almost certain I should never see him again.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> While I was torturing myself with these reflections, an order
                    came for all the soldiers in Montague’s bastion to remove to the King’s. I and
                    my little ones were to march likewise. I was, if possible, more terrified than
                    before, for I had a much longer way to go, and the Spaniards were firing from
                    all their batteries. To the latest period of my life shall I remember with
                    anguish that dreadful walk! Sometimes I stopt, and thought I might as well
                    resign myself to die, and with my quivering lips begged of heaven to admit me
                    into its divine abode!— But when I looked on my children, I started up and
                    dragged them forwards, not knowing what I did. Our servant, and <pb n="11"

                    />two soldiers who were with me, said all they could to comfort and encourage
                    me.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> At length we arrived safe at the King’s bastion. Mr. ****** was
                    marching the picquet from thence: he waved his hand, but being on duty, could
                    not stop to speak to me. The room I was put into smelt very disagreeably; I
                    enquired the cause, and was told, a man was killed in it, not an hour before, by
                    a ball which entered in at a hole over the door.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Notwithstanding the vigilance of the officers and
                    non-commissioned officers, many of the men were shamefully intoxicated. The
                    town-major, and a party of soldiers were busily employed in staving all the
                    casks of liquor they could find in the town. And here I cannot help reflecting
                    on many of the wine and liquor merchants, who hoarded up their stocks to enhance
                    their value, till at last they were drank by any person, or staved by order of
                    the Governor, and suffered to run into the sea! But cunning often over-reaches
                    itself.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> This place was so crouded with soldiers, it was impossible to
                    procure either a bed or platform: my servant put me a matrass into a kind of
                    arch or hole by the door, and in here I and my children crept. I was ill for
                    want of sleep, yet could not compose myself to rest. Though either shot nor
                    shell could pierce the roof, yet the enemy kept on so furious a cannonading,
                    that I thought we must lose numbers of our men. It was computed that the
                    Spaniards fired, upon an average, at the rate of two hundred shot and shells an
                    hour.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">

                    /> The Spanish church, and many other buildings, were at this time in flames.
                    The first object I beheld in the morning was, a man lying dead by the door. He
                    died, I was told, from intoxication.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Some hours after this, I saw Dr. C——m and Lieutenant B——h fall;
                    they were wounded by the splinters of a shell: the former had his foot shot off,
                    the latter had a dangerous contusion on his head. He was the son of my old
                    friend: a better heart never inhabited a human breast. They brought his sword to
                    me, and as he was carrying to the hospital, our servant, with his usual
                    bluntness, came and told me I might take a last view of him, for it was supposed
                    he could not survive the dressing of his wound. In this, however, he was happily
                    mistaken.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Mr. ******* was on guard the next day, and as soon as he came
                    off, he informed me an order was given out for all ranks of women to remove to
                    the south. I was again in terrors, but was obliged to obey. My husband carried
                    my little Charlotte, while my son Jack ran by my side. We got safe to the navy
                    hospital, but when there, found it so crouded with wounded soldiers, we could
                    not procure a place to lie down in, except an open gallery. I wept in
                    silence!—Mr. ******* at last recollected a lady of our regiment, who had been
                    here some time before the siege on account of her health. She readily admitted
                    me, and gave me a dish of tea, which was a great refreshment. I laid a mat on
                    the floor, and that night slept three hours, which seemed to put new life into
                    me.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> My situation here was painful beyond comparison, from hearing the
                    groans of the wounded, and from the shrieks of others, whose limbs <pb n="13"

                    with a little fresh air in the gallery, I was often shocked with seeing the
                    mangled bodies of my slaughtered countrymen brought into the hospital! I
                    intreated my husband to convey me from this scene of woe! but this request I
                    found was needless, for the hospital was so crouded, I could not have obtained
                    leave to stay, had I been ever so desirous.</p>

                    regiment was so kind as to send a markee for us. Captain D———t, who was always a
                    generous friend to my little family, desired me to have it fixed in his
                    garden.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> My husband was that night on the guard, and I had no company but
                    my children. Never shall I forget the shocking scene day-light presented to me.
                    The Spanish gun-boats were firing upon us with all the rage of well-directed
                        artillery.—<emph> Gun-boats</emph>, methinks you say! What are those?—I will
                    tell you. They are boats constructed on purpose for carrying mortars and cannon,
                    from which they throw thirteen-inch shells, and twenty six pounders! From these
                    dreadful visitors no human foresight can find a shelter. ‘Tis all chance, and
                    they are such small objects, and so uncertain to hit, that it is only a waste of
                    ammunition in our batteries to attempt to bear upon them.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> A woman, whose tent was a little below mine, was cut in two as
                    she was drawing on her stockings! Our servant ran in, and endeavoured to
                    encourage me. He made me a kind of breast-work of beds, trunks, mattrasses,
                    bolsters, and whatever else he could find, and sat me behind them. I clasped my
                    darlings, and prayed most fervently, that the ball that should pierce their
                    tender bosoms might transfix my own too! But how needless was this prayer—I

                    that was safer, I knew not: for these internal spit-fires can attack any quarter
                    of the garrison they please.</p>

                    burned, but the army did not esteem this a misfortune; we rather rejoiced at it,
                    for some of them were so bad, there was no bearing to be within the smell of

                    another cause. About eleven o’clock it began to thunder and lighten exceedingly;
                    the flashes seemed to last several minutes, and the thunder was so uncommonly
                    loud, that the like had never been heard since the great storm which happened
                    thirty years ago. The rain deluged through our tent, but I did not mind being
                    wet. The glare of the lightening was so great, that my eyes were sensibly
                    affected; and though accustomed to the thunder rattling amongst the rocks at
                    Gibraltar, yet this by far exceeded all I ever heard. Mr. U**** asked me if I
                    should think myself safer in Captain D———t’s summer-house? He went first to see
                    if it was open, but between the flashes it was so dark, he could not keep the
                    road; at last he got there, and found our servant, who he sent to carry the
                    children. I went to the door of the tent, but the whole hemisphere seemed on
                    fire; and, as if we did not suffer enough from the Spaniards, Heaven’s artillery
                    seemed in array against us! They were firing all the time, but we could scarcely
                    hear their cannon, the thunder was so loud!—Towards morning the storm

                    struck the rock against which I leaned, and covered us with dirt and stones! In

                    children run from the camp, without a rag to cover them, whenever the gun-boats
                    approached. I was so harassed for want of rest, that I thought fatigue would
                    kill me, if the Spaniards did not.</p>

                    dreadful night, which made me determine to leave Gibraltar; but language will
                    convey but a faint idea of the horrid scene!</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> About one o’clock in the morning, our old disturbers the
                    gun-boats began to fire upon us. I wrapped a blanket about myself and children,
                    and ran to the side of a rock; but they directed their fire in a different
                    manner from what they had ever done before. They had the temerity to advance so
                    near, that the people in our ships could hear them say,
                    <foreign xml:space="preserve">Guarda, Angloise! </foreign>which is, <emph>Take
                        care, English!</emph></p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Mrs. Tourale, a handsome and agreeable lady, was blown almost to
                    atoms! Nothing was found of her but one arm. Her brother, who sat by her, and
                    his clerk, both shared the same fate. The daughter of that unfortunate woman I
                    mentioned a few pages ago, <pb n="18" rend="new"

                    girl in the ruins.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Many other people were sent to their eternal homes, but I do not
                    know their names.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> After what I had seen and suffered, I was of opinion it was not
                        <emph>courage</emph>, but <emph xml:space="preserve">madness </emph>to stay.
                    As a parent, I considered I had no right to expose the lives of my children; and
                    conjugal affection gave place to maternal tenderness: accordingly, I applied for
                    and obtained leave to embark in one of the first ships bound for England.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Affairs remained in the same situation to the hour of my
                    embarkation, which was the 27th of May last. I cannot close this account,
                    without informing you my husband presented a plan of operations to General
                    Eliott for the destruction of the enemy’s gun-boats, which was approved of, and
                    is, I suppose, before this time, put in execution.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> The ship is now at anchor. We are performing quarantine, and as I
                    have swelled my account of the siege beyond the compass of a letter, I shall
                    send it as a parcel as soon as I get on shore.</p>

                    Minorca brought the account of his promotion, but his commission was expected by
                    the fleet. The Colonel is a plain worthy character.</p>

                <p rend="noCount"><hi rendition="#smallcaps">Gibraltar</hi> is in length near a
                    league from north to south, and in breadth irregular, from half to three
                    quarters of a mile. The summit of the rock is one thousand four hundred feet
                    perpendicular above the sea.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> In the year 1704 this important fortress was torn, most probably
                    for ever, from the Spanish domain by the English forces commanded by Sir George
                    Rooke.</p>

                    /> In a council of war, held July 17, on board the English fleet, about seven
                    leagues east of Tetuan, the attack was resolved upon. Four days after, the fleet
                    got into the bay of Gibraltar, and one thousand eight hundred English and Dutch
                    marines, under the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt, were landed.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> On the 23d, soon after day-break, the ships being placed, the
                    Admiral threw out the signal for cannonading, which was continued with great
                    fury for five or six hours, fifteen thousand shot being fired in that time
                    against the town, so that the besieged were soon driven from their guns,
                    especially at the South Mole Head. As the gaining that fortification would
                    ensure the reduction of the town, the Admiral sent Capt. Whitaker with all the
                    boats immediately to endeavour to possess it; but whilst he was pushing for it
                    with great alacrity, the Captains Hicks and Jumper, who lay next the Mole,
                    landed some men from their pinnaces and boats before he came up. On this, the
                    Spaniards blew up the fortifications about the Mole, and killed two Lieutenants
                    and about forty men, and wounded sixty more. Yet our men kept possession of the
                    great platform, and Whitaker landing with the seamen who had been ordered on
                    this service, they advanced and took a redoubt or small bastion, half way
                    between the Mole and the Town, and many of the enemy’s cannon; upon which, the
                    Spanish Governor desired to capitulate, and surrender on honourable terms, which
                    they did on the 24th of July, 1704.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">

                    /> The Prince of Hesse, with the marines belonging to the fleet, were left in
                    garrison, and furnished from the fleet with every necessary for subsistence and
                    defence, and a regular plan laid down for supplying them in future from
                    Lisbon.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Under the dominion of Great Britain, the fortifications have been
                    so improved and perfected, that, joined to the natural strength of the place,
                    they render it impregnable.—To the Moors, Gibraltar was the key of Spain; and
                    the English deservedly reckon it the key of the Mediterranean.</p>
