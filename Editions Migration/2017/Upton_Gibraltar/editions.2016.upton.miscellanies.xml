                    /> PREFACE. —<lb/></head>
                <p rend="noCount">It was not my intention to introduce the Miscellanies to the world
                    by a Preface; but some Critics finding fault with my Poem intitled The Siege of
                    Gibraltar, induces me to say a few words in my own defence.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">One gentleman said it was not English; another avowed the
                    versification was bad, as one line in it was a syllable too long. I take the
                    liberty to present these able judges with a couplet from one of the greatest
                    Poets England ever produced, where the first line contains ten syllables, and
                    the second thirteen. Dryden, in his translation of Juvenal’s Codrus, says—
                        <quote>“Where mice and rats devour poetic bread, And on heroic verse
                        luxuriously were fed.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"
                            >These lines are taken from the Third Satire of Juvenal; Dryden himself
                            appends a footnote to the name, writing, “Codrus, or it may be Cordus: a
                            bad poet who wrote the life and actions of Theseus.”</note></quote></p>
                <p rend="noCount">I shall subjoin two more lines from Mr. Pope, in which he takes
                    the same liberty. <quote>“So spirits ending their terrestrial race, “Ascend and
                        recognize their native place.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"
                            xml:id="ftn4" n="4">These lines are taken from Pope’s <title level="m"
                                >Dunciad</title>, ll. 267-268.</note></quote></p>
                <p rend="noCount"><pb n="viii" rend="new"
                        facs="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/editions/upton/images/misc_008Thumb.jpg"
                    /> Errors like these, (if they can be called such) are forgiven in great Poets
                    and learned men, but not in a <emph>woman</emph>, who pretends to no learning at
                    all. Their observations put me in mind of what Dean Swift says of Critics, whose
                    utmost ingenuity lies in scanning the verses of others on their finger ends,
                    without ever being able to make a tolerable rhyme themselves during the course
                    of their lives.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">If my accusers expect me to write better than Dryden or Pope, they
                    assign me a strange talk indeed! But I have done with these, and with much more
                    pleasure address myself to the candid part of mankind. Far be such vanity from
                    me to suppose that my Miscellany contains no faults; but my avocations as a
                    Governess, will, I hope, plead my excuse! I have but little time to write, or
                    <emph xml:space="preserve">correct </emph>what I write, and shall ingenuously
                    confess, that I send the following sheets into the world, with a view to

                    <l>From whence you’ll infer that it is very little.</l>

                            Athens who, after her brother-in-law Tereus raped her and cut out her
                            tongue, wove a tapestry telling her sister, Procne, what had happened to
                            her. In revenge, Procne killed her son and served it to Tereus. Escaping
                            from Tereus, Procne and Philomela were transformed into birds.
                            Traditionally, Philomela is transformed into a nightingale, whose song

                    to display my wealth, was not to enjoy it; and to emerge from obscurity, into
                    the glare of pomp, and the bustle of parade, would be subjecting myself to such
                    enquiries, as would with difficulty be surmounted. At last, I determined, (as
                    fancy knows no bounds) to leave my native land: I thought myself transported to

                    of good sense, and different sexes: and to prove that the pleasures arising from
                    these connections, are not the most reasonable that can be had; I need but
                    mention how often they call in tavern excesses, and midnight revellings, as
                    auxiliaries to their happiness. If these sentiments are not unreasonable; it
                    must follow then, that a female mind, rightly formed, is capable of giving and
                    receiving the most permanent and social delight. When a man of taste and
                    generosity is joined, by an indissoluble band, to a woman of this cast, he can
                    return to her conversation, from evenings spent in the most convivial manner,
                    and consider her sense, sprightliness, and discretion, as pleasures higher than

                    than the Education of Children. I have long been of opinion, that it would
                    vastly encrease the wisdom and happiness of this state, if the Legislature was
                    to prohibit those from forming the minds of Youth, who by nature, or want of
                    education, are unfit for that important office. This, by some, will be thought a
                    strange assertion; but let him or her, who is of this opinion, stop a moment,
                    and ask themselves, what employment can be of more importance, than that which
                    is to form the minds and manners of the people of the next age?</p>

                    education now invariably necessary; in my opinion it is of no consequence,

                    for the undertaking.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Reading, when justly performed, is one of those graces which
                    every one is charmed with, and few attain to. The committing the rudiments of
                    this branch to persons who are unacquainted with the powers of the human voice,
                    even in speaking, is one of those errors, which parents should carefully avoid.
                    For as there is a better and a worse method of inculcating every thing, so I
                    would recommend this to be much attended to.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Children should be accustomed to declame as soon as they can
                    speak. Let them learn by rote some interesting stories or short fables, adapted
                    to their capacities; but never suffer them to repeat a line, but in the tones
                    you judge to be proper and elegant.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Some people, who have not attended to the capacities of children,
                    may think this impracticable: on the contrary; nothing is more easy. Almost
                    every person has had an opportunity of observing, that a child of five or six
                    years old, with a musical ear, will learn a tune with great exactness, without
                    the smallest knowledge of the principles of music. Why should the former be
                    thought more difficult than this? The proper cadence at a note of admiration,
                    and a period, with the raising of the voice at a note of interrogation, are <pb
                        n="43" rend="new"
                        facs="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/editions/upton/images/misc_051Thumb.jpg"
                    /> all used in the most common conversation, even amongst children. It is but
                    telling them the names of these tones as soon as they begin to read, and they
                    will readily know when to use them.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> I have always found the most difficulty in teaching the proper
                    variation at a colon and semicolon. The former is so nearly allied to the fall
                    at a period, and the latter to raising the voice at a note of interrogation,
                    that it has been only by frequently repeating these sounds, I could make myself
                    understood. They may be compared to the half tones in music, which many voices
                    are unable to make, and many ears incapable of distinguishing. When in this case
                    I have labored long without effect, I have generally had recourse to some of my
                    boarders, and desired them to instruct the new pupils. This has generally
                    answered my end; for every child thinks it very possible for her to learn what

                    their offspring are placed with those who make it a rule to do it, they would

                    my care, from five years old to twenty, I cannot recollect that I have had ten,
                    who knew the use of stops or pauses, in reading, when they came to me, and the
                    older they were, the more difficult I found it to mellow their voices to proper
                    cadences.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> I have always endeavoured to remove, as much as possible, at
                    proper seasons, that unnecessary and painful diffidence, which pupils are too
                    apt to feel in the presence of an instructor. Children do not know how to
                    separate the ideas of a teacher and a tyrant. This is owing to the
                    inconsiderateness of those parents, who draw comparisons between what their
                    children enjoy while in their own houses, and the mortification they must suffer
                    when placed at a boarding school. Every meal, perhaps, for a few preceding
                    weeks, they are reminded what plenty they are indulged with to what they will
                    find at school. Alas! how silly and impolitic is this! to fill their tender
                    minds with terror, and draw on that backwardness to enter upon a course of
                    education, which is the grand barrier to all improvement!</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Would parents pursue a different conduct, and teach their
                    daughters, to consider a governess as a kind of substituted mother, whose
                    tenderness will be extended to them in all that relates to their real <pb n="45"

                    of their children! She would not appear to them like a brow-beating pedagogue;
                    but as a person interested in, and delighted with every thing that concerns
                    their improvement and real welfare. Not that I would venture to affirm, that
                    every mind is to be wrought into obedience by love alone; some children are too
                    indolent and thoughtless to obey from motives of affection: neither can it be
                    supposed that they can see, in all respects, what is for their real advantage.
                    This, and many other reasons, make it necessary that an instructor should be
                    both feared and loved, which is very possible to be done.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> The ridicule my sex has long borne for their incorrect writing,
                    makes me very desirous to cultivate a knowledge of English grammar. In general,
                    girls are required to learn such a variety of things, in a little time, and to
                    send home such a quantity of fine needle work, as leaves but few opportunities
                    for the improvement of their mental abilities. I never found the most copious
                    grammars the most useful; for when young minds are once tired with the
                    tediousness of any thing they are pursuing, nothing is so fatal a bar to their
                    proficiency. <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Fenning</hi>’s and <hi
                        rendition="#smallcaps">Dilworth</hi>’s short grammars may be repeated many

                    These well understood and retained, with frequently giving talks of false

                    thought superficial; but experience has long convinced me of its utility.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> The taking this fatiguing part of my scholar’s education upon
                    myself, was not any emolument to me: a reading master, (as he is generally
                    called) attends a boarding school so short a time, as leaves me very much in
                    doubt, whether young ladies are much the better for his portion of instruction.
                    What, in the name of common sense, can one hour or two in a day do for thirty,
                    forty, or fifty scholars?</p>

                <head type="subHead">WRITING.</head>
                <p rend="noCount"> THIS is esteemed so common and easy a part of education, that
                    many people would think it almost impossible to advance any thing new upon the
                    subject; but as I have taught Writing myself, and have attended the errors and
                    improvements of my pupils with a motherly anxiety, I shall venture to mention my
                    opinion in this matter.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> I think it a fatal mistake to suffer children to write too long
                    at a time. Writing, when properly pursued, is as much a work of imitation as
                    drawing; and as no person can copy or imitate in a true and masterly manner when
                    the fancy is weary, it follows, con-<pb n="47" rend="new"
                        facs="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/editions/upton/images/misc_055Thumb.jpg"
                    />sequently, that to write a little at a time, and frequently, is by far the
                    best method. One hour every day I have always found answer better than any other
                    proportion of time for this employment; nor would I permit more than ten lines
                    to be wrote in that hour. When a young lady is never allowed to be tired of
                    writing, she always returns to it with a glee and a pleasure which is invariably
                    attended with improvement. I have kept those ladies whom I have taught to write
                    at least a month in capitals; it is astonishing what a difference this makes in
                    the freedom of the writing.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> This method opens the fingers, and gives the hand that proper
                    scope which is certain to form a free and masterly hand. When a young beginner
                    is permitted to write joining hand, it should be very large for six months; this
                    manner of instructing will most assuredly enable the learner to avoid a crampt
                    and confined hand, which is so much complained of in female writing.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> Letter writing is another branch of education, in which young
                    people can never be taken too much pains with. I was always happy when my
                    boarders friends required frequent letters, for nothing but constant practice
                    can make a person perfect in orthography. Neither do I think a mere filial
                    correspondence enough for a young lady while at school; I have never failed to
                    desire a further exertion of my pupils talents in this way, by giving them a <pb

                    /> a subject once a week, and insisting on a letter being addressed to myself,
                    from a theme which I thought adapted to their years and capacities.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"> From this practice, much entertainment has accrued to myself: it
                    was a continual source of delight to me, to encourage the timid, and praise the
                    ingenious. By these means I am certain I have called forth many latent sparks of
                    genius, which would have lain dormant and unknown, even to the possessor.</p>

                <p rend="noCount"> WITH respect to young ladies learning French, it has ever been my
                    opinion, that they should be allowed three or four years for the attainment of
                    it. I do not mean to insinuate that they should have no other employment during
                    that time; but amongst other avocations, their French should be carefully
                    attended to for some years. How many young ladies do we meet with who pretend to
                    speak French, and yet do not know what a verb is in that or their native
                    language! Would it not be more eligible to be a proficient in one language, than
                    a blunderer in two? I think I shall have every one of good common sense on my
                    side, when I aver, that a woman who writes her mother tongue with elegance and
                    correctness, is a more agreeable and estimable character, than she who knows <pb

                    world, more than a knowledge of Astronomy. When we consider what an amazing body
                    that immense globe of fire the sun is, how many worlds he enlightens, what an
                    astonishing force it requires to protrude each planet in its orbit, how probable
                    it is that each fixed star is a sun, warming and chearing other world
                    imperceptible to us, we are lost in the contemplation of that Divine Being who
                    is the grand Artificer of these works, and the eternal Father of the

                    understanding of the Solar system, the situation of our earth and her
                    neighbouring planets, without searching too deeply into the scientific parts, or

                        n="32">Upton misquotes John Milton’s <title level="m">Comus</title> (1634).
                        Comus extols the power of music, recalling scenes from his childhood with
                        his mother, Circe, the sirens, and the naiads “Culling their Potent hearbs,
                        and balefull drugs, / Who as they sung, would take the prison’d soul, And
                        lap it in Elysium…” (ll. 255-57).</note> For those who have fortune and
                    leisure, there cannot be a more rational and innocent amusement. Though I have
                    taught the guitar many years, yet I think the harpsichord is an instrument which
                    every lady should prefer to it, whose friends are willing to be at the expence
                    of a music master three or four years. But a young lady may have a musical year,
                    and an agreeable voice, who has not so much time to spare for this purpose; in
                    this case, I think the guitar not only proper but desirable, as it is very
                    possible, with a good ear and due attention, to learn to play well in three or
                    four months. I have not said thus much in favour of the guitar, from a
                    supposition that any emolument will ever arise to myself, as I teach it gratis

                    impertinent for the latter to ask the former this plain and useful question:
                    Would you have your daughter, Madam, an accomplished fine lady; or do you wish
                    her to be an excellent housewife, and a useful member of society? It will take
                    a great deal more time and money to form the first than the second character. If
                    every parent would be candid enough to own their views in life for their
                    children, time and expence would not be thrown away, which is sometimes the
