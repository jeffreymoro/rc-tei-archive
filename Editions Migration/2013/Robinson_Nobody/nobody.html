                           world of the beau-monde, in which social intercourse is dominated by fashionable appearances.
                           Like Lady Languid who plays the card game Faro, Belinda plays the card game ombre,

               decides to compete with another man in order to win over the object of his affection:
               <span class="quote">‘I never saw her look so handsome; her Eyes, methought, never were before so piercing,

                  to be my own, as I imagin’d, for a young Fool, whom she’s in love with, to come and

                  find no cause to laugh at me” (IV.I. p. 95, 97).’</span> <em>The School for Wives</em> also features Arnolph’s <em>The Maxims of Marriage</em>, a conduct book that contains the following precept: “<em>Every Woman that would preserve her Honour, ought to refrain from Gaming as a terrible
                  thing; for Play is very bewitching, and often drives a Woman to venture all she has</em>” (75). Brewer suggests, alternatively, that “budding beauties” alludes to Simon Berington’s
               fictional travel narrative <em>The Memoirs of Sig<span class="sup">r</span> Gaudentio di Lucca</em> (London: T. Cooper, 1737), which contains an account of Gaudentio’s love for a young

               Beauties appear’d in her”; see Brewer (8: 276n). In both instances, the men speak
               of young women—an eighteen-year-old (Molière) and a ten-year-old (Berington); clearly,
               as Brewer points out, the widow Lady Languid’s beauty is not in a similarly “budding”

               of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, and, in the Catholic religion, the nativity
               of St. John. In much of Britain, it was customary to light bonfires and celebrate
               with drink and food, including sweetmeats and fruit. Maidens, in particular, often
               engaged in superstitious practices either to gain a glimpse of their future sweetheart
               or to determine the faithfulness of their current love interest. William Hone in his
               <em>Every-day Book</em> (1827) for 24 June notes that in “One of the ‘Cheap Repository Tracts,’ entitled,
               ‘Tawney Rachel, or the Fortune-Teller,’ said to have been written by Miss Hannah More,
               relates, among other superstitious practices of Sally Evans, that ‘she would never
               go to bed <em>on Midsummer eve</em>, without sticking up in her room the well-known plant called <em>Midsummer Men</em>, as the bending of the leaves to the right, or to the left, would never fail to tell
               her whether her lover was true or false’”; see William Hone, <em>The Every-day Book; or, Everlasting Calendar of Popular Amusements</em>, 2 vols. (London: Published for William Hone, 1827), I: 850. Nelly states that she
               played the jaw harp in a transept or a side chapel of the church in order to make
               the sexton believe that his deceased sweetheart was haunting him on Midsummer Eve
               because he had not been true or, in other words, because he had been unfaithful or

               the cogitations thereof” (King James Version 17:5). Brewer cites the following explanation:
               “According to ancient teaching, the soul of man or his ‘inward holy body’ was compounded
               of the seven properties which were under the influence of seven planets. Fire, animated;
               earth gave the sense of feeling; water, speech; air, taste; mist gave sight; flowers,

               in general, from daughters to cooks, nurses, laundresses, seamstresses, and prostitutes,
               participated in camp life. Due to the casual intermixture of men and women, camps
               became equated with “sexual license. . . . Sex, it seems was everywhere. ‘Half the
               girls in the country will get husbands by Coxheath-camp,’ declared the <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, while . . . prostitutes in general were admitted behind the lines”; see Russell,
               <em>The Theatres of War: Performance, Politics, and Society, 1793-1815</em> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), 39. In her poem, 
               “The Camp”
               (1800), Mary Robinson captures the atmosphere of a military camp in what Daniel Robinson
               calls a “satirical montage of sights and sounds of an assembly of soldiers and an
               attendant entourage where the fashionable and the military, the opulent and the vulgar,
               and, most of all, the sexual . . . become jarringly confused” (Daniel Robinson, <em>The Poetry of Mary Robinson: Form and Fame</em> [New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011], 30):

               Roman Republic whose army destroyed Carthage in 146 BCE. He was the grandson (by adoption)
               of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and was a wealthy patron of the arts and sciences,
               renowned for founding the Scipionic Circle, a Roman intellectual group, consisting
               of philosophers, historians, poets, and other scholars. He is also remembered as a
               stern censor, a position he held in 142 BCE, during which time he served as supervisor
               of public morality and attempted to curb dissipation and corruption. He is the principal
               speaker in Cicero’s <em>De re publica</em> (c.54-61 BCE), the sixth book of which—entitled <em>Somnium Scipionis</em> (<em>The Dream of Scipio</em>)—depicts him as a man of intellect and virtue. It is a text that, among other things,
               influenced Dante Alighieri’s the <em>Divine Comedy</em> (1308-1321) and inspired Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s <em>Il sogno di Scipione </em>(K. 126) (1772). The Tomb of the Scipios in Rome was rediscovered in 1780, and images
               of the tomb were published in Rome in 1785 by Francesco Piranesi in <em>Monumenti degli Scipioni</em>, a work begun by his father Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Salmagundi, in this context,
