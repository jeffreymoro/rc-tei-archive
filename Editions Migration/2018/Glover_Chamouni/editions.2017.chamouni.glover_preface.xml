      </ab>
      <p> IN this age of revolutions, when RELIGION, that never-failing source of comfort to the good, and the sinner’s hope in repentance, is
        impiously represented as a chimera; when, under the shield of toleration, principles subversive of all social order, of all morality, are
        openly promulgated, and the <emph>Atheist</emph>, with unblushing front, stalks like a tyger from his covert, <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n185.html">“seeking whom he may devour,”</ref> and daringly blasphemes aloud, any attempt, however feeble, to stem
        the torrent of irreligion, or at least to weaken its baneful consequences, is praise worthy, and entitled to an attentive and impartial
        consideration.</p>
      <p> That irreligion arises as much from corruption of manners, as from the reasonings of false philosophy, cannot be denied; and it is a
        melancholy fact, that in this country the conduct of many, whose duty it is to warn the unthinking, and point out the road to virtue, forms
        striking contrast with the morality they profess, and <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n186.html">the mild Doctrines of Christianity</ref>.</p>
      <p>
        <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n187.html">In countries, as in Switzerland</ref>, where professors of religion are compelled to undergo
        the ordeal of strict examination, ’ere they rank as Ministers of the Gospel and Expounders of the Word of GOD, the inhabitants are
        comparatively blameless, and vice, in its most hideous form, is seldom seen. {iv}</p>
      <p> But where INTEREST, <emph>without merit</emph>, suffices to qualify for the noblest of all professions, the glorious task of
        strengthening the good in virtue, and instilling morality into the rising generation, the manners of the people are necessarily endangered,
        and their respect for religion is diminished or increased by the conduct of the clergy; and how painful the task of <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n188.html">reverting to events</ref>,
        which, to the eternal disgrace of the clerical character and to the morals of this country, have lately succeeded each other with almost
        breathless rapidity.</p>
        <p> The adage is here realized, that <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n189.html">“good deeds are written on water, but evil deeds on brass;”</ref> accordingly, the circumstances alluded to, have been seized with avidity, and
        triumphantly blazoned forth by those, whose talents are perverted to the worst of purposes, – the overthrow of religion, and consequent
        destruction of all morality.</p>
      <p> And who are they, who, with demoniac joy, glut on the disgraceful opportunities afforded to ridicule all sacred institutions, and openly
        blaspheme JEHOVAH’S name?</p>
      <p>
        <emph>The Atheists!!</emph>, they, whose impious doctrines tend to disprove the existence of A GOD: <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n190.html">“Chance</ref> (they say,)
        <emph>created all; the world to come is</emph> <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n191.html">visionary</ref><emph>,</emph> <emph>and immortality an empty sound</emph>.” Indeed! is <emph>chance</emph> the author, then, of light and life? did <emph>chance</emph> create the beauteous works of nature? the
        star-bespangled firmament? <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n192.html">“the universal frame thus wondrous fair?”</ref> Is it by <emph>chance</emph>
        <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n193.html">we live, and move, and have our being</ref>? If this be true, how horrible the thought that <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n194.html">“the great globe,” instead of being under the guidance of an all-powerful, all-wise, all-merciful Providence,
        may, in one instant, “with all which it inhabits,”</ref> be overwhelmed, <emph>by chance</emph>, in indiscriminate
        ruin! The idea inevitably tends to render us indifferent to our fate, and justify the insanity of those who, wanting fortitude to brave
        misfortunes, and loathing life, seek refuge in the worst of crimes, self-immolation: for, according to the Atheist’s {v} Creed, <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n195.html">“with life our sufferings end, nor is there bliss for virtue, nor punishment for vice, beyond the grave,”</ref> precepts, which
        have often instigated the profligate to robbery and murder, and let them expiate their misdeeds on the criminal altar of their indignant
        country.</p>
      <p> Come then, <emph>ye Atheists</emph>, shout your victory; proclaim your horrible exploits; but first, approach the dungeon’s cells;
        listen to the clank of chains; gaze on your victim’s haggard looks; then crown yourselves with wreaths, bathed in the blood of those, who by
        their fatal exit owe to <emph>Atheism</emph> the premature, but certain, proof that GOD EXISTS, and is alone OMNIPOTENT.</p>
      <p> But ends the evil here? Ah no! as the fell tyger, reeking with carnage, still thirsts for blood, so Atheism, unsatiated with its guilty
        triumph, now meditates a bolder flight, and marks the virtuous for its prey. Unable by artful sophistry to lure them down the flowery paths of
        vice, it attempts to avenge its defeat, by seizing <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n196.html">the hour of approaching dissolution</ref> to infuse its poison, and cloud their last, their
        sweetest hope, the hope of IMMORTALITY. With satanic cruelty, it endeavours to insinuate into the bosom of the dying, the agonising thought,
        that, instead of <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n197.html">“waking to the glorious morn, the second birth of man,”</ref> and being reunited
        in the realms of bliss, <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n198.html">“where one unbounded spring encircles all,”</ref> – to the faithful friend – the fond parent – the beloved child – the tender wife – the affectionate husband, the
        soul will perish with its mortal tenement, sink into darkness, and cease to exist for EVER. O providence! guard us from that thought! — — — </p>
      <p> Thus, the principles of <emph>Atheism</emph> aggravate our miseries <emph>here</emph>, and preclude all hope of an
        HEREAFTER.</p>
        <p> But, do these unhappy beings, these <emph>Atheists</emph>, verily believe the doctrines, they profess? Impossible!! <ref target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n199.html">the anatomy of the human frame</ref> {vi} alone
        suffices to overturn their creed, and stamp indelibly on their hearts the assured conviction of the existence of a GOD.</p>
      <p> What demon, then, impels these men to prostitute their talents to the most nefarious purpose, the subversion of religion? affectation of
        singularity! thirst for celebrity! and above all, the vain, the presumptuous hope, that posterity will enrol their names with those exalted
        characters, those benefactors of mankind, whose morals and whose writings entitle them to immortality.</p>
      <p> These, these are the springs, which actuate <emph>the Atheists</emph>: but whilst gratifying their ruling passion in <emph>this world</emph>, they tremble for their fate in THAT TO COME; prostrate in the dust, they deprecate in secret the just
        vengeance of that GOD, whom they openly blaspheme; of that awful BEING, whose voice created, whose wisdom guides, from whose all-seeing eye no
        secrets are hid, and before whose dread tribunal these impious men well know they must inevitably appear to answer for their works.</p>
