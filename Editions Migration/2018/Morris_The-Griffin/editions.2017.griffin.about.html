                  <p class="noCount">This edition showcases the poetry of Thomas D’Arcy Morris (1792-1835), a significant
                     figure in the Bombay literary scene of the early nineteenth century. It identifies
                     and attributes Morris’s works, originally published anonymously or pseudonymously
                     in contemporary newspapers and periodicals. The central text is the long review /
                     poem <em>The Griffin</em>, accompanied by some related earlier works by Morris, and some contextual correspondence.
                     The edition also includes a list of later anonymous and pseudonymous works by Morris
                     from the <em>Oriental Sporting Magazine </em>(1828-1833).</p>

                  <p class="noCount">The text of <em>The Griffin</em>, the early works and the contemporary correspondence has been transcribed from microfilm
                     copies held by the British Library of the <em>Bombay Gazette</em> (SM44) and the <em>Bombay Courier</em> (SM70). The microfilm images are of variable quality, but generally decipherable.
                     End-of-line commas and full stops within verse passages are occasionally indistinguishable,
                     and in these cases I have assigned the character that appears to be called for by
                     the sense of the lines: in no case does making a choice involve a substantive issue
                     of meaning.</p>

                  State Archives in Mumbai for their help and expertise in the course of my research,
                  to Lynda Pratt for her advice at an early stage of this project, and to Nicola Royan
                  and Margaret-Anne Hutton for guidance on sources and translations. Trinity Cheltenham,
                  the current congregation of Holy Trinity Church, Portland Street, Cheltenham, were
                  extremely helpful in facilitating my search for Catharine Hickes’s memorial. Thanks
