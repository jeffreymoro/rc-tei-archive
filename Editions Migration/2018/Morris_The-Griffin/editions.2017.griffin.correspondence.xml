          <p rend="noCount">Perhaps you will have the goodness to assist me in giving information to a friend of mine at an outpost regarding the
            actual publication in England of a work lately printed in your Gazette under the title of the “Griffin”. Many doubts have arisen in the
            minds of my brother officers at this station as to such a book having ever issued from the English Press. Some imagine it to be the
            production of a Resident in this country and that <emph>you</emph> are reviewing it! Others (and to this opinion I also incline) that it
            is from the Pen of a young officer now at home; it is certainly a creditable performance be it whose it may and bears evident marks of
            much satirical genius. I admire your Critique upon it (if it is yours) and regret exceedingly that the interest of the Poem should have
            been weakened by being given at different periods. I hope you will not deem this an intrusion upon any wish for secresy you may possibly
            have, but I am really anxious as well as many others to purchase this extraordinary book if for sale, to see how he treats our friends at
            the presidency and what he says of <emph>our</emph> army during the last War. Pray then <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Mr. Editor</hi>,
            publish this letter as it may lead some of your Correspondents to assist in flashing conviction upon us; and your attending to this
            request in your next will really much oblige many of your readers as well as your obedient servant. </p>

          <opener><salute>To the Editor of the Bombay Courier,</salute>
            <salute>Sir,</salute></opener>
          <p rend="noCount">In the Bombay Gazettes of the 30<hi rendition="#superscript">th</hi> Aug. and 20<hi rendition="#superscript">th</hi>
            instant I have read the review of a work called “The Griffin.” The 2<hi rendition="#superscript">nd</hi> canto I have unfortunately not
            been able to procure a sight of – but I am told it is a shameless libel upon the ladies of this settlement in particular and of India in
            general – Be the author who he may, I trust this is not the case, that he has not been so deficient in principle, so void of all generous
            feelings as to attempt to throw obloquy upon a whole society. </p>
          <p rend="noCount">I read the commencement of the review with some interest, as the critic there tells us it is the production of an Indian
            Subaltern’s muse; and anxious to see a spark of genius in a brother Exile and to derive amusement from something superior to the ephemeral
            Sonnets we are generally indulged with, I perused the Griffin with much attention, and I will add with encreasing interest, whether (I
            speak of as much only as I have read) the review or the Poem or both be the growth of England or India is immaterial, the former is ably
            written &amp; I applaud the sentiments of the critic highly.</p>
          <p rend="noCount">I do not feel capable of appreciating the merits of the Book, having missed seeing what is said to be the best part of it,
            viz, the 2<hi rendition="#superscript">nd</hi> Canto, but thus much I will say (&amp; it is on this account chiefly I have now troubled
            you) that situated as I am with ladies under my protection and many female friends in this place whom I esteem and regard, I most
            anxiously wish to know if the author of the Poem is actually in England or India, that should we find “The Chield amang us taking
              notes”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> ‘A chield’s amang you, taking notes, / And, faith, he’ll prent it’ (Robert Burns, ‘On
              the late Captain Grose’s Peregrinations through Scotland’, 1<hi rendition="#superscript">st</hi> pub. 1789,
              <emph xml:space="preserve">Selected Poems and </emph>Songs, ed. Robert P. Irvine (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2013), p. 201).</note> we may be
            more on our guard.</p>
          <p rend="noCount">I do not by this, wish to make your paper the vehicle of public or private animosities, but it strikes me, and it is the
            opinion of many of your readers, that a letter of this kind published by you, may set enquiries on foot and help to rid many of our wags,
            of the suspicions under which they at present labour.</p>
          <p rend="noCount">I mean nothing disrespectful to the Author of the Griffin – far from it – I applaud his genius – but I dislike his subject
            – and both my praise and censure are in the same ratio as I should feel inclined to bestow upon a well-drawn caricature, if I saw myself
            or any of my friends “shining in grim burlesque” among the ridiculous figures of the laughable group.</p>
          <p rend="noCount">I trust you will find a vacuum in your next paper for this letter, as I am convinced (and I have many reasons for the
            conviction) that it will draw forth an answer calculated to dispel the distrust with which I and some of my acquaintances now receive the
            visits of many young friends whom we deem capable of exercising their satirical talents with such effect – Oblige me therefore in this
            request, and allow me to subscribe myself your’s obediently. </p>

          <opener><salute><hi rendition="#smallcaps">Dear Mr. Editor</hi>,</salute></opener>
          <p rend="noCount">Would it be an infringement of Editorial prerogatives if <emph>you</emph> were to give your readers a full and connected
            copy of the extraordinary work called “the Griffin.” We unfortunately have lost more than half of it and as it is our full determination
            to do all in our power to refute the charges he has so unprovokedly brought against all females in this country, I trust you will excuse
            this intrusion. A blush of Maiden modesty suffuses my cheeks while forming this Epistle, the first I ever wrote to one of the male sex,
            nor would I have had occasion to trespass upon the columns of your hebdomadal publication had not a female friend (a Matron, Sir) advised
            the proceeding. My <emph xml:space="preserve">chief </emph>motive in addressing <emph>you</emph> is to request that <emph>you</emph> will
            come forward in your public capacity and vindicate the reputations of Indian females from the foul aspersions cast upon them by the Author
            of the “Griffin.” Will you make him, Sir, uncloak himself? will you force him to give up his abominable name? Will you champion him to the
            utterance? Let not, Mr. Editor, this “Anguis in herbâ”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Snake in the grass.</note> poison the
            minds of those who are willing to look upon our Sex as the Angels of this world and their light to the next. Let not this hidden
            calumniator breathe his serpent venom on the fairest flowers of creation. Yet, Sir, if you are unwilling to undertake our cause, if you
            shrink from the task, at least grant us all the aid you can. We ask it from you as an Editor! We claim it from you as a man! Think not I
            write this from any personal feeling of pique or revenge. No Sir! I scorn it. I take up the cause, as the cause of all spinsters. I am
            myself in no danger of turning “Port Admiral” for I shall soon quit the country, I neither snatch at nor would I jump at any of the
            magnates of the Land, neither do I strain my Syren's voice or shew off my Vestris’ step to entrap a lover. I have a hand to dispose of
            ’tis true, and perhaps as soon as Malabar Point<note place="foot" resp="editors"> At the western edge of Bombay Harbour; if the

            the Point will agree with me. I can say no more now than that I am</p>

            </salute></opener>
          <p rend="noCount">The farrago of lampoon and invective which the malice of our enemies has heaped up against our sex, tho’ it may be a proof
            of their industry and power of <emph>fiction</emph>, reflects but little to their honor; Even the distorted hand of
              <emph>Carricature</emph> has been pressed into the service: – in vain our virtue triumphs over scurrility and scandal. Truth is bad
            enough sometimes, but as for scandal, who can describe it. – There is an abortive impotence, a want of soul, a turpitude in scurrility,
            which nothing can redeem, and whose necessary tendency to dissolution nothing can prevent. </p>
          <p rend="noCount">I will fairly advocate the cause of my sex. We have been scandalized for
            <emph xml:space="preserve">coming out to India in quest of husbands; </emph>for the last half century that seems to have been the
              <emph>watch word</emph>: – Nay, sir, <emph xml:space="preserve">we have been exposed to public Auction </emph>(in print)
            <emph xml:space="preserve">like so many horses from the Gulf! – </emph></p>
          <p rend="noCount">Putting <emph>the object</emph> out of the question for a moment, pray if none of us had spirit to brave the raging main,
            and venture out to this fair land of promise, how long would this Eastern paradise retain its charms? – Men are poor helpless creatures: –
            without us the Company’s territories would very soon lose all their interest, dignity, &amp; attraction – all would become savage and
            degenerate. </p>
          <p rend="noCount"><emph>In quest of husbands</emph>. The charge is most ridiculous: upon my credit I do not mean to mince the matter;
            honesty needs no disguise; let me ingeniously explain things as they are, at least so far as I am concerned. That I came out to India is
            certain; but that I came out <emph xml:space="preserve">for the express purpose </emph>of getting a husband is false. – that I might be
            fortunate enough to get a husband to my liking was matter of <emph>hope</emph>, not <emph>of calculation.</emph> And pray Mr. Editor, with
            all your Editorial sapiency and penetration, can you see any great harm in this candid confession? Now, Sir, I will go further, merely to
            satisfy you that it was not a <emph>desperate</emph> case with me, and that I might have married well enough at home if I had thought
            proper; but I was in no hurry I resolved to look about me a little; <emph>to see the world</emph>; and not to give my hand unadvisedly to
            the first idle fellow who chose, to dream that he was in love with me. </p>
          <p rend="noCount">At fifteen Mama thought me sufficiently accomplished, and took me from school. A few weeks after my return home, a
              <emph>wine merchant</emph> who visited us occasionally, was the first who acknowledged the power of my charms, and had spirit to aspire
            to the honor of my hand. He applied in due form, Mama was favorable; he had what the world, terms an improving concern; but <emph>I said
              no</emph>, I don’t like the trade. Mr. Vintage fumed and sighed; but I thought he would perhaps ultimately have sighed a great deal
            more, had I been silly enough to grant him my hand without my heart; so sir the courtship dropt.</p>
          <p rend="noCount">The next who swore <emph>by all the furies</emph>, Mars Bellona and Wenus<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
              Furies are spirits of vengeance in Greek and Roman mythology, unconnected to Mars and Bellona, Roman god and goddess of war, or Venus,
              goddess of love. The transposition of v and w as a stereotypical marker of demotic London speech was already well established when
              Dickens highlighted it with Mr Weller’s oft-repeated catchphrase ‘Wery good, Samivel’ in <emph>The Pickwick Papers</emph> (1837).</note>
            as he called them, that the fire of my eyes had carried all before it, that he was dying for me, and would not live without me, was a
            spruce <emph>half pay Ensign</emph> of a marching Regiment. But young as I was I prudently calculated that three shillings a day would not
            go far towards house keeping; and as I had no idea of living on <emph>love and potatoes</emph>, and as this flaming lover of mine had
            nothing beyond that, and his jemmy<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Spruce, neat (OED). </note> person to bestow, of which poor
            soul he appeared not a little enamoured, I made it a point implicity to obey Mama in a matter of so much importance, and as she declared
            herself decidedly hostile to the Ensign. A retreat was sounded, and he reluctantly raised the seige!</p>
          <p rend="noCount"><emph>A parson</emph>, with a decent living, was my third <emph>aspirant</emph>. His proposals were pious; he talked of
            the mosaic Law; and expatiated so devoutly, on the blessings of a house full of young children shooting up like vines around the table,
            that I really became alarmed at the hideous prospect, and assured the holyman, solemnly,
            <emph xml:space="preserve">I never would bury myself alive in his old parsonage house; </emph>for what with his host of children and blue
            devils, I should be tormented to death. And therefore I gravely declined the honor of his religious promise of eternal fidelity. The
            Priest did not tarry after this explanation; but he certainly bore his disappointment with somewhat more, resignation than was pleasing to
            my vanity. </p>
          <p rend="noCount">After this a bumkin of a <emph>Country Squire</emph>, who chanced to see me at an assembly, thought proper to fall in love
            with me. He honored me with two or three <emph>amatory</emph> epistles, in which, after setting forth that “<emph>the coulter of affection
              had ploughed up his hart</emph>,” he made a mighty display of his genealogy, the number of his acres, his dogs, hogs and horses, besides
            the old family coach: – But as he was <emph>only</emph> sixty years of age, and appeared healthy and strong as Hercules, tho’ he now and
            then affected to sigh like a turtle, I resolved to decline the favor of his hand and all his worldly goods. Had he been only <emph>thirty
              years younger</emph>, or <emph>thirty years older</emph>, I really don’t know what I might have done; tho’ as it was, I could see no
              <emph>ground</emph> for the abundant <emph>harvest</emph> of connubial happiness which he seemed to anticipate. </p>
          <p rend="noCount">I will not enumerate any more: but I must not forget to mention that my flame of an Ensign, who swore by the Furies
            <emph xml:space="preserve">that he could not </emph>live<emph xml:space="preserve"> without me</emph>, had the impudence to sign articles
            of alliance with my aunt, a buxom widow of fifty, after a short <emph>parley</emph>, of one week, (observe if you please Mr. Editor, the
            gracelessness, of men) one short week after my refusal.</p>
          <p rend="noCount">There was yet another reason which I forgot to tell you, tho’ certainly it gave me much umbrage at the time, and indeed
            with a few other considerations of a domestic nature, determined me <emph>to try my luck in India</emph>. When my Squire found I was proof
            against all <emph>ploughshares</emph> and <emph xml:space="preserve">harrows </emph>of <emph>love</emph>, and would not have him with all
            his genealogical tree and the rest of his gear, he had the assurance to appear angry: that I could have borne; but then he said insolently
            enough “<emph>Well well</emph>
            <hi rendition="#smallcaps">child</hi>! <emph>go farther and fare worse</emph>!” There he fibbed: – ’tis true I have gone further, but
            thank my stars I have not fared worse; for I am still <emph>Slapatema Hopeful</emph>: and to convince you Mr. Editor, and shew <emph>that
              empty Griffin</emph> whoever, he is, that he knows nothing of our sex, tho’ he has presumed to
            <emph xml:space="preserve">blacken us pretty handsomely; </emph>I assure you, Sir, far from jumping at this, straining at that, or
            stretching or ogling after the other, I have very coolly refused half a score <emph>very personable</emph> suitors, for reasons best known
            to myself; the which I may perhaps detail in another Letter.</p>
          <p rend="noCount">All I mean to say at present is that I have made up my mind never to become a <emph>cara sposa</emph>, until I find a man
            who has something to recommend him besides <emph>his purse</emph> or <emph>his place,</emph> or <emph>his age</emph>, or <emph>his
              youth</emph>, or <emph>his dandyism</emph>, or his <emph>affectation</emph> of a passion without a
            <emph xml:space="preserve">heart </emph>to appreciate<emph xml:space="preserve"> my value! </emph>I must and will have a man who to sense
            adds fortune, to fortune merit, to merit good humour, and to all these full confidence in my loyalty and virtue! And this resolution I
            will sacredly observe, (tho’ all my friends declare it is rather <emph>visionary</emph>) until I come to years of DESPERATION: that is,
            Mr. Gazette, till I approximate that frightful climacteric at which a young lady, dragged on by the relentless hand of Time, merges, into
            what is hideously called <emph>an old maid!</emph> – If that dread period should ever arrive, which Heaven forefend, then indeed I may
            condescend to cut short my punctilios and rather than be doomed to such an evil, agree to become <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Mrs.

              <l>So Griff, you, and I, Miss, if we form’d rank &amp; file,</l>

              <l>If it were their purport to offend and pain,</l>
              <l>The day is won – they’ve not written in vain;</l>
              <l>Many a gentle breast and beating heart</l>
              <l>That felt the ven’mous sting – in memory smart – </l>
              <l>The laughing eye might feign – and cheerful smile</l>
              <l>To mute appearance might the wound beguile;</l>
              <l>But in the mem’ry hidden deep is laid,</l>
              <l>To vex the soft despairing – sighing maid – </l>
              <l>As oft the wasp – a humming sneaking thing,</l>
              <l>In nobler bodies leaves its lengthen’d sting.</l>
              <l>So we poor, spinsters, in this barb’rous age</l>
              <l>Feell most the lash – the puny critics rage.</l>
              <l>To what just cause we owe this dev’lish grudge,</l>
              <l>Is hard t’infer, and harder still to judge.</l>
              <l>In search of husbands (hear the hue and cry)</l>
              <l>You leave your homes – your friends and country fly.</l>
              <l>The fact be so – for once suppose confest,</l>
              <l>How worse, are we than spinsters in the West?</l>
              <l>Where gallant knights in endless warfare strive,</l>
              <l>And Belles coquet to take their Beaus alive,</l>
              <l>Where Cupid still is priz’d – and beauty reigns,</l>
              <l>And captive hearts are bound – and lick their chains.</l>
              <l>On ev’ry side t’is education’s care</l>
              <l>To warn the frail – and bid the blind beware.</l>
              <l>Each sex, for each continual ambush lay,</l>
              <l>In secret couch – then pounce upon the prey;</l>
              <l>To this career, each breast from birth’s inclined;</l>
              <l>If it be error – nature then is blind.</l>
              <l>Maids to fulfil their end were born to wed – </l>
              <l>In love’s chains Men, to be submissive led.</l>
              <l>But let the whining fops at home look back,</l>
              <l>Revise their satyrs and retrace their track –</l>
              <l>To foreign climes they’ve roam’d, tis no less true,</l>
              <l>Their journey had like ours a motive too;</l>
              <l>But ours was noble – they came here for gold;</l>
              <l>We, for, a husband – they by choice were sold;</l>
              <l>We follow’d in a sister’s, mother’s train;</l>
              <l>They left their parents homely roof for gain;</l>
              <l>At that God’s shrine they throw their precious health</l>
              <l>And barter, comfort, happiness for wealth;</l>
              <l>’Tis their’s to wither cropt e’er reach’d their prime</l>
              <l>In constitution old – before the time.</l>
              <l>T’is our’s, to hope – when men are old and grey</l>
              <l>We maids of forty two are young and gay – </l>
              <l>Then hush!! – ye griffins – prosers change your style,</l>

          <p rend="noCount">In yawning over the supplement of the last Courier (and by the bye that part of the Bombay Papers always make me yawn.) I
            had got to the middle of an old story about the Duke of Cumberland and Mrs. Horton,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The Duke of
              Cumberland, brother to George III, married Anne Horton, a commoner, in 1771. </note> when lo! at the bottom of the Page these words in
            Italics met my Eye. </p>
          <p rend="noCount"><emph>“To be continued after the poetry”</emph>. – Well to this Courier, baptized Poetry I turned and saw, what! not the
            usual productions of maudlin <emph>sonnetteers</emph>, but another Anathema on the devoted heads of the Griffin and others, by ANNA HOWE.
            She attacks the anonymous author of that above mentioned poem with all the invective and scurrility she can make use of, accusing, but
            hear the Gentle Anna let the Lady speak for herself, she calls the author “one who wars with Woman” “annoys the sex” “defames” “mocks
            merit and shames virtue” “abuses defenceless modesty” “assails private life” “corrupts enjoyment” his mind a chaos, himself a brute “very
            Lady-like language indeed” and now for her poetry she says that “in Bombay” captive (perhaps for Captains) hearts are bound and lick their
            chains – what delicacy what playful elegance – what poetical imagery – just fancy half a dozen hearts (bleeding ones of course)
            <emph xml:space="preserve">licking chains </emph>– Scene a Butchers shambles!! But to proceed, and listen Ladies to your champion!! Each
            sex for each continual ambush lay!! What married and single! Proh! Pudor!<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Oh! Propriety!
            </note> what is the meaning of this Miss Howe. Again – Maids to fulfil their <emph>End</emph> were born to wed!! Good! Good! my princess
            of Poetesses, but which end? fy! gentle Anna, fy! Miss Howe; then again at the unfortunate author “And where <emph>no</emph> Vices lurk,
            there <emph xml:space="preserve">only </emph>rails.” Well then, he must be a good natured satirist, but <emph>Eheu jam satis</emph>!<note
              place="foot" resp="editors"> Enough!</note> for would you believe it Mr. Editor, after all this abuse, after condemning his
            subject ridiculing his talents and affecting to despise his “puny stings.” She, the, Gentle Anna, acknowledges that the Griffin has gained
            his point, that the Day is won, he has not written in vain!! Well may he then exclaim in the words of the facetious Pindar “<emph>Euge
              Poeta magna</emph><note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hurrah for the great poet – the feminine ‘magna’ suggests that the subject
              is Anna Howe. Peter Pindar was the pseudonym of John Wolcot (1738-1819), satirist and poet. </note>
            <emph>– well done Peter</emph>.” Now let me advise all your would-be wits – and can't-be Poets, who are thus continually intruding their
            trash upon the public thro the medium of the newspapers, to leave the author of the Griffin in the slumber to which he appears quietly to
            have betaken himself and to remember the old warning!! Never disturb a sleeping Dog. Either He or the Reviewer has allowed the Great and
            therefore Good folks of our island to escape almost scot-free from personalities yet with a remark (and I dislike that remark) hanging
            over them like the sword of Damocles suspended by a thread which the rude breath of abuse and invective may chance to snap, and if the
            weapon should fall twill make most tragical mirth “amongst them; for if I remember right in one part of the Review it is said that the
            inhabitants of Bombay” are almost individually characterized and with a freedom of touch and breadth of colour closely bordering on
            Caricature, what a poetical phantasmagoria may these Anna Howes occasion.</p>
