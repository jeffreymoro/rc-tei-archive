                    which was commenced by the glimpse you were so good as to give me of him soon
                    after your marriage. London is particularly full at present. I do not often
                    venture into its crowded streets, the bustle of which is now particularly
                    disagreeable to me, but I was drawn there the other day by a strong inducement,

                    by the eagerness people express to get a sight of her when she comes, that

                        at home" (<title level="m">ODNB</title>). The Argyll Rooms in London (below)
                        were, however, a public venue.</note> She has very wisely made her tickets a

                    with the public succeeds very well. It is true in this case you have the

                        to History makes it very likely that she meant the letters on History she
                        had sent to LR in or soon after 1800. LR has returned them; slightly altered
                        texts were printed by LA in <title level="m">A Legacy for Young
                            Ladies</title> (1826). ALB's next sentences allude to her <title
                            level="a">Dialogue in the Shades,</title> written probably earlier in
                        the year after reading about the Retreat from Moscow, a commentary on the
                        abundance and magnitude of current events which make irrelevant the ancient
                        mythology still taught in schools. It can be inferred that ALB intended to
                        revise the letters on History for publication, and that the revised texts
                        were the ones printed by LA.</note> What an immense study History is now
                    become! How much employment has the last twenty years given to the Historic
                    Muse. Surely she must strike off from her roll some of her old heroes to make
                    room for the new names which croud upon her. We can at least spare Theseus &amp;
                    Hercules &amp; half a hundred more of whom we know so little &amp; who fill the
