                  I wished very much to have an account from yourself of your health, but rather with
                  the idea that a letter was owing on your side. As it was not, I shall take care not
                  again to delay paying my debts till I am dubious whether I owe them or no, for believe
                  my dear M<sup>rs</sup> Withering I value very highly the kind expressions of your affection, &amp; would not,
                  on any account, neglect a correspondence which is truly dear to me. Your letter would

                  walk along Church Row, where now there is not a single person I know, or a single
                  door at which I could knock. I drank tea at M<sup>rs</sup> Slater’s where we talked of you &amp; where I met two very good friends of yours, M<sup>r</sup> &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Ware.

                  the Play could never have sustained itself but for the sweetness of the verse, some
                  charming lines which every body repeats, &amp; the allusions, which at the time were well
                  understood, to the loves of Louis 14<sup>th</sup> &amp; Mary Mancini— You may be ready to think perhaps from the two incidents which have
                  taken up my letter that we are in very good spirits at Newington. Indeed far from
                  it. The mercantile distress, which is every where around us, has claimed our sympathy
                  &amp; of late it has approached our nearer connections, &amp; draws forth stronger feelings;
