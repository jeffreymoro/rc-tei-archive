                    coincidences in the early part of Mr. Bloomfield’s life with my own, I was
                    naturally enough anxious to become acquainted with the Author. For this purpose
                    I obtain’d his address, and found him... the modest, the unambitious person you
                    describe; wondering at the praise and admiration with which his Poem has been
                    receiv’d; whose utmost ambition was to have presented a fair copy to his aged
                        <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">Mother</ref>, as a pledge of
                    filial affection, and a picture of his juvenile avocations. So unexpected was
                    the fame of his production, that the whole of his good fortune appears to him as
                    a dream. — ‘I had no more idea,’ says he, ‘to be sent for by the <ref target="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Duke of Grafton</ref>, and be so
                    kindly and generously treated, than of the hour I shall die.’</p><p rend="indent1"> I gave him... my card of address, an invitation to my house, and
                    a sincere profession of friendship; if, among his numerous admirers, and noble
                    and royal patrons, the latter was worthy of acceptance.</p><p rend="indent1"> Last Sunday afternoon I was highly pleas’d with his company, and
                    gratified and entertain’d with his conversation. — Sir, he is all... nay, more
                    than you have describ’d.</p><p rend="indent1"> Among other subjects of conversation respecting the <title level="m">Farmer's Boy</title>, I wish'd to be inform’d of his manner of
                    composition. I enquir’d, as he compos’d it in a garret, amid the bustle and
                    noise of six or seven fellow workmen, whether he us’d a slate; or wrote it on
                    paper with a pencil, or pen and ink. But what was my surprize when told that he
                    had us’d neither. — My business, during the greatest part of my life having led
                    me into the line of litterary pursuits, and made me acquainted with litterary
                    men, I am, consequently, pretty well inform’d of the methods us’d by authors for
                    the retention of their productions. We are told, if my recollection is just,
                    that Milton took his Daughters as his amanuenses; that <ref target="people.html#SavageRichard">Savage</ref>, when his poverty precluded
                    him the conveniency of pen, ink, and paper, us’d to study in the streets, and go
                    into shops to record the productions of his fertile genius; that Pope, when on
                    visits at Lord Bolingbroke’s, us’d to ring up the servants at any hour in the
                    night for pen and ink, to write any thought that struck his lively and wakeful
                    imagination; that <ref target="people.html#BlacklockThomas">Dr. Blacklock</ref>,
                    though blind, had the happy faculty of writing down, in a very legible hand, the
                    chaste and elegant productions of his Muse.</p><p rend="indent1"> With these and many other methods of composition we are
                    acquainted; but that of a great part of the <title level="m">Farmer’s
                        Boy</title> stands, in my opinion, first on the List of Litterary
                    Phaenomena. — Sir, Mr. Bloomfield, either from the contracted state of his
                    pecuniary resources to purchase Paper, or from other reasons, compos’d the
                    latter part of his <title level="m">Autumn</title> and the whole of his <title level="m">Winter</title> in his head, without committing one line to paper.
                    — This cannot fail to surprize the Litterary World: who are well acquainted with
                    the treacherousness of memory, and how soon the most happy ideas, for want of
                    sufficient quickness in noting down, are lost in the rapidity of thought.</p><p rend="indent1"> But this is not all. — He went still a step farther. — He not
                    only compos’d and committed that part of the work to his retentive memory, but
                    he corrected it all in his head. And, as he said, when it was thus prepar’d,...
                        <hi rend="ital">I had nothing to do but to write it down</hi>.</p><p rend="indent1"> By this new and wonderful mode of composition he studied and
                    completed his Farmer’s Boy in a garret; among six or seven workmen, without
                    their ever suspecting any thing of the matter.</p><p rend="indent1"> Sir, this to me was both new and wonderful: and induc’d me rather
                    to communicate the information to you through the medium of the Press than by
                    writing; that it may meet the eye of many, who will be equally struck and
                    pleas’d with the novelty of the idea as myself.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
