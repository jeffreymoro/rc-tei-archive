                    before I left Canterbury. I had that morning breakfasted with Surgeon Chandler
                    who sometimes attended on poor <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">Charles</ref>—I was concernd to hear that you had been indisposed, and
                    rejoice in your recovery. I had many thoughts about poor Cousin Mason, and feel
                    relieved from them by what has taken place, though I doubt you will run short of
                    the possibles before I get home, so I inclose a 2 Pound Note for I have taken
                    for the free three Harps, and do not spend much—I will now tell you more of my
                    late proceedings. I recieved <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldHannah">Hannah’s</ref> on Saturday, and that same evening went by a return’d Chase
                    to Ramsgate, about 16 miles, I had dined that day in company with <ref target="people.html#FrendWilliam">Mr Friend</ref> whom I had often met at
                    the <ref target="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Dukes</ref> and elsewhere,
                    and he having two Sisters at Ramsgate, I found a home—and on Sunday lookd with
                    much pleasure at that great work termd the Pier, which is certainly an exceeding
                    fine object to a stranger, A strong Gale blew at noon, and the tides and wind
                    set straight into the harbours mouth, and produced waves such as we never saw at
                    Worthing, the stone causeway calld the Pier is about as high as Mr Williams’s
                    houses and perhaps 80 foot broad, but the waves at high water pelted us in by
                    several times as we walkd round. On monday morning I set out to walk 12 miles to
                    Deal, had refreshment at Sandwich, and proceeded on, but could get no bed at
                    Deal for love nor money, I had been pelted by a violent rain, and had been
                    riding in an oyster-Cart, had no great coat nor Umbrella, Alas! Poor fool! in
                    this dilema, though wet allmost to the skin I had the luck to get another Chaise
                    to Dover, and shutting myself up warm, and having warm Coffee inside me, and a
                    glass of Brandy, arived at Mrs Pierce’s at Dover (to whom I had letters) and a
                    good night’s rest cured all my troubles. Yesterday I amused myself as well as
                    such a miserable wet day would allow, and this day I have spent delightfully in
                    a twelve miles walk (there and back) to Folkstone, over Shakespeare’s-Cliffs the
                    air was clear, and the Chalk hills of France very plainly to be seen, I have
                    much to say on this walk when I return the Cliffs most of the way are about as
                    high as the Monument, and Shakespear’s Cliff much higher.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Monument is a 202 foot tall Doric fluted
                        column, located at the junction of Monument Street and Fish Street Hill,
                        London, near the north end of London Bridge. It was designed by Sir
                        Christopher Wren and erected to commemorate the Great Fire of London. Its
                        height represents the distance between the monument and the starting point
                        of the fire.</note> The Sea was a perfect Calm and throng’d with fishing
                    vessels. I have just had tea.—</p><p rend="indent1"> And now (say’s you) when do you intend coming home? I answer that
                    tomorrow I dine near Dover, and one of the company engages to convey me on to Mr
                    Bridge’s, at Denton which is in my way home; and there, I doubt I must tarry a
                    day and a night, and then in my way home through Canterbury must take leave of
                    the Kingsfords, and then on to Chatham; so that I fear I cannot possibly be in
                    London before the middle of next week. I hope ernestly that the Children hold
                    well, and that you are stout, My love to <ref target="people.html#ChurchJoseph">your Father</ref>,—I am quarterd on my friends both at this place and at
                    Ramsgate, and shall at both the next places where I have to stop, my expences

                    Pastrycook, who had wore a Cockade, as a freeman of Dover.</p><p rend="indent1"> It is too late for the post tonight so you will not have this
