                    &amp; <ref target="people.html#ReesOwen">Rees</ref>, to whom you sometime
                    since addrest a letter containing your Lordships approbation of my ‘Wild
                    Flowers’, and an intended address to the readers of that little collection,
                    allmost immediately communicated to me the papers, and left it to me to
                    determine upon the possibility of adopting your intended plan of doing honour to
                    me and my Book.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">For details of Buchan’s
                        proposal see Letters 178 and 181.</note> I thus conceived that themselves,
                    to whom the communication was made, were bound to reply; but I fear myself so
                    implicated that to neglect stating to your Lordship my motives and my feelings
                    individually would be an unbecoming omition on my part, and such as would after
                    give me pain.</p><p rend="indent1"> I therefore beg your Lordship’s attenton for a moment. It will be
                    observed that the Dedication to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">my Boy</ref> (who is eight years old this day) contains more meaning than
                    is there exprest. I have with great truth spoken there of a ‘peculiar delicacy’,
                    and I since feel it more than I did at that time. To adopt your plan, great and
                    honourable as it is, would involve consequences that I cannot explain. One of
                    the most difficult tasks that arises from my extraordinary situation, for such
                    perhaps with great truth I may call it, is so to act as not to wound the
                    feelings of my good and voluntary friends, nor to violate my own. The Letter I
                    long ago addrest to your Lordship is such perhaps as I ought not to be ashamed
                    of, and such that no person would believe me did I pretend to it. But though I
                    feel the intended honour, I feel too, other sensations that many perhaps could
                    suppress: I feel that it would be a violation of my notions of delicacy to print
                    it now. My object has been to abide by the most simple methods of acquiring
                    reputation, the standing alone, as far as my abilities go, and as far as it can
                    be done in justice to my friends. Thus it has happened that of the many letters
                    which I have had from his Grace the <ref target="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Duke of Grafton</ref>, <ref target="people.html#BunburyCharles">Sir C Bunbury</ref> &amp;c, one from
                    the Duke of York, and one from that most great, and most lamented man, <ref target="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Mr Fox</ref>, that none of them have
                    been made use of, though, as well as those from your Lordship of a nature highly
                    to be prized, they would have made a proud and conspicuous figure attach’d to
                    any one of my publications. I know not which most to admire, your Lordships
                    candour in stating your opinion of my poems, or your long remembrance of one so
                    distant, and so much longer silent than your kind letters formerly would fairly
                    warrant.</p><p rend="indent1"> A second edition of five thousand copies of ‘Wild Flowers’, is
                    just now publishing, and if the reasons for omitting your honoured testimony
                    which I have here given, do not speak for themselves, I despair of convincing
                    your Lordship that I have not slighted the great and worthy offer you made as
                    much to my honour, but much more to your own.</p><p rend="indent1"> I trust both your discernment and your benevolence.</p><p rend="indent1"> Be pleased to give my particular thanks to the party, most
                    probably a Lady, who copied my Letter in a handwriting that has been universally
                    admired, and which I certainly never saw equal’d.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">My poor Boy</ref> still goes with
                    a Crutch, God grant that it may be hereafter a ‘Broken Crutch’.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">An allusion to Bloomfield’s own poem ‘The Broken
                        Crutch. A Tale’ from <title>Wild Flowers</title> (pp. 51–74).</note> He is
                    healthy, and my own spark of life, supported by exercise, wears tolerably
                    well.</p><p rend="indent1"> Four thousand copies as a ninth edition of the Farmer’s Boy, are
                    now going through the press, and the same number of the ‘Rural Tales’ are
                    immediately to follow.</p><p rend="indent1"> I cannot conclude without informing your Lordship, whom I know to
                    be possessd of a love for nature’s music, and a fund of fancys, that I have
                    lately taken up a new and most agreeable trade, that of constructing Eolian
                    Harps. I am become rather dextrous in the use of the plane and the glue-pot, and
                    find a demand that I am hardly able to satisfy. Can any thing in Nature, or even
                    in imagination, exceed the tone of that simple instrument? Your unrivalld <ref target="people.html#ThomsonJames">Thompson</ref> knew it well. Witness his
                    Castle of Indolence, the finest lines that can possible be written on the
                    subject.</p><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> Ah me, what hand can touch the strings so fine?</l><l rend="indent3"> Who up the lofty diapason roll</l><l rend="indent3"> Such sweet, such sad, such solemn airs divine</l><l rend="indent3"> Then let them down again into the soul?</l></lg><p rend="indent9"> &amp;c.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Lines 361–363
