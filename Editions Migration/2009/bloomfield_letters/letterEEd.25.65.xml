                    not a satisfactory apology. I am writing ‘an Ode to Perplexity’ and never was
                    anything better timed. I have been disappointed and vexed as to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac’s</ref> songs. I want very
                    sadly to tell you all that has passed from <ref target="places.html#Troston">Troston</ref>; it would take a vollm. I send to your particular care and
                    perusal five letters on a very interesting subject; don’t shew them, but send
                    them to me again without spreading the news at <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury</ref>, as you see the despute is
                    still undetermined. I am not afraid but I shall get through it. Look at the
                    enclosed for <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr. Lofft</ref>; observe the
                    engravings. Rosy Hannah by moonlight is beauty’s own self, and to be cut on wood
                    is realy surprising.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bloomfield is
                        referring to proofs of the engravings intended for his <hi rend="ital">Rural

                    Philips at Barton; shall breakfast to-morrow with <ref target="people.html#RogersSamuel">Mr Rogers</ref>. they print 5 thousand of

                    is out!!! If I have a whole levee of visitors then, I shall not have to say, ‘It
                    will be so many weeks or so many months,’ but simply ‘’Tis done, here it is,’ I
                    have at last seen all the pieces in the vollm printed <hi rend="ital">as I
                        pleased</hi>; I shall send you a list of what I have rejected and what

                    her now; I have not forgot her love nor her conversation; tell her she will
                    never know till she is a Farmer’s Boy what tasks I have to perform, and how I am
                    oblidged to wriggle amongst a quarrelling set of candidates for fame and
                    candidates for money — two pretty things enough if we can get them peacibly. </p><p rend="right"><date when="1801-11-01">Sunday Morning.</date></p><p rend="indent1"> The notes in dispute I regard as very high praise from <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref>.
