                    his brothers and sisters the value of the House at <ref target="places.html#Honington">Honington</ref> if he outliv’d <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">his Mother</ref>.</p><p rend="indent1"> And when <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref>
                    and I were writing on this subject in Jany 1804, I made a memorandum in a book I
                    have by me, sending a copy of the same to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref> at that time.</p><p rend="indent1"> It stands thus</p><p rend="center">‘Memorandum. <date when="1804-01-25">Jan<hi rend="sup">y</hi> 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1804</date>.’</p><p>‘In a letter to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref> this day
                    have promised that if ever <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my
                        Mothers</ref> Cottage becomes my property, to give to each of the surviving
                    brothers &amp; sisters a sixth part of the then value, before it shall ever
                    be call’d mine. But not to have anything to do with it while <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my Mother</ref> lives.’</p><p>A few days after the interment of <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my
                        Mother</ref> on the last day of last year <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref> wrote to me at <ref target="places.html#Honington">Honington</ref> to say that ‘now was the time
                    to settle about the House,’ and using these forcible words, ‘If you demur I will
                    immediately advertize it to be sold by auction.’ That letter is not in being,
                    but I read it to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac</ref>
                    and <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldElizabethsisterlaw">his wife</ref>. I
                    mention this that it may be as evidence to yourselves &amp; children; that
                    the transfer of the House took place by the immediate wish and desire of my
                    Brother <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref>.—And as I sign’d
                    the Writings but yesterday, I take the first moment to tell you what I mean and
                    what I always meant to do.</p><p rend="indent1"> The place was not valued by a Surveyor; but by the guess of <ref target="people.html#GloverJohn">my Father-in-law</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac</ref>, it was worth one
                    hundred guineas.</p><p rend="indent1"> On examination of the writings it was found that <ref target="people.html#GloverJohn">John Glover</ref>, the second Husband,
                    possesses thirty pounds, being a right on the Estate by virtue of an old
                    mortgage redeem’d by our Grandfather Manby, and given to <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my Mother</ref>.—Therefore deducting
                    that sum from the value, <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George’s</ref> property is about seventy five pounds; which would certainly
                    have been divided amongst us if he had been able.—</p><p rend="indent1"> In consequence of my engagement to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref>, which I imparted to <ref target="people.html#FellowesRobert">Mr Fellows</ref> when in Suffolk, as
                    well as in consequence of the great blessings that providence has shower’d upon
                    me, I hereby engage to pay you, this time twelvemonth, that which our elder
                    Brother, through misfortunes, is not able to pay, your sixth of the above
                    sum.</p><p rend="indent1"> You will do me the justice to observe that the Forty-two pounds I
                    paid for repairs during <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my
                        Mothers</ref> life, is not brought forwards against <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref> nor you* if so, the
                    dividable sum would be thirty three pounds.—</p><p rend="indent1"> This gift, for it cannot be a debt, except of honour and of love,
                    I hope you will take as a pledge of lasting good will, and as my acquittal to
                    your children.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> Yours truly </salute><signed rend="right">Robert Bloomfield</signed></closer><postscript><table cols="4" rows="7" width="740" border="0"><row><cell width="160"/><cell width="280"/><cell width="140">       £   S    D</cell><cell width="160"/></row><row><cell width="160"/><cell width="280">Value of Cottage ———</cell><cell width="140">   105. 0. 0</cell><cell width="160"/></row><row><cell width="160"/><cell width="280">Mortgage due to <ref target="people.html#GloverJohn">Father</ref>—</cell><cell width="140">     30. 0. 0</cell><cell width="160"/></row><row><cell width="160"/><cell width="280"><ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George’s</ref> property———</cell><cell width="140">     75. 0. 0</cell><cell width="160"/></row><row><cell width="160"/><cell width="280"/><cell width="140">————</cell><cell width="160"/></row><row><cell width="160"/><cell width="280"/><cell width="140">£105. 0. 0</cell><cell width="160"/></row><row><cell width="160"/><cell width="280"/><cell width="140">————</cell><cell width="160"/></row></table><p>*All expences of the Funeral, a small debt, and the Doctors Bill, (amount
