                  contextual evidence: the letter enclosed verses published, at Faux’s instigation, in 1820 as Thetford Chalybeate Spa. A Poem by a Parishioner of St. Peters (1820). In 1827 Faux recalled urging
                  George to attend the laying of the foundation stone of the new pump room in Thetford, an ceremony which took place on 13 September
                  1819. See Letter 412. In 1827 Faux considered forwarding poems and letters by George that were in his possession for publication in
                  William Hone’s Every Day Book: this letter may have been one of these. See Letter 412 for Faux and the Every
                     Day Book publication. See Letter 360a for George acknowledging Faux’s assistance. See Letter 80a for the 1802 letter
                  from Nathaniel to George that this letter enclosed. </p><p>For permission to publish the text of MSS in their possession, the editors wish to thank the Beinecke Rare
