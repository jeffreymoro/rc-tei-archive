                    with your lordship’s conversation, should have anything left to express by
                    writing: But the sudden transition from shade to sunshine, from obscurity to
                    publicity, which have fallen to my lot, has sometimes proved almost painful, and
                    often perplexing to a great degree. Condescension from superiors ought at least
                    to inspire confidence sufficient to meet their approbation in all its shapes and
                    modifications; and, when it does not, I am apt to suspect, that it deserves no
                    such plausible name as modesty. It is a dastardly child, the offspring of
                    ignorance and fear. I feel and know, that in my composition there is not an atom
                    of what is called wit. My replies are the slow suggestions of contemplation, and
                    my ‘good things’ mostly come half an hour too late. I find this to be true in
                    conversation with my equals, where restraint can have no force. There is
                    however, another enemy (though in some cases my dearest friend) whose power is
                    resistless, and whose visits are perpetually made known by a rising of the
                    stomack, and a redundance of water in the eyes. Subjects of interest to the
                    feelings are frequent in parties, such as I have lately had the honour to join;
                    when, independent of the subject being often above my reach, I find this
                    weakness, (if it be a weakness) stand in my way, and absolutely obstruct any
                    remark or reply whatever. Your lordship informed me particularly of the death of
                    a lady<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bloomfield refers to the death of
                        Miss Elizabeth Linley who died of tuberculosis in 1794 after singing in
                        Handel’s <title>Messiah</title> ‘I know that my Redeemer liveth’.</note> the
                    circumstance attending which were of an uncommonly interesting nature. I know
                    not whether to wish such scenes to fall in my way, or whether to rejoice
                    selfishly, that I have no such torture, for excess of pleasure certainly becomes
                    pain. I have never frequented so desirable &amp; honourable a school as that
                    in which your Lordship presides; I mean your friendly conversations with the
                    learned and good, the very cream of a nation’s talents &amp; when I reflect
                    on what I am, I can but wonder at that one qualification, which alone is thought
                    sufficient to entitle me to be amongst you. But the clashing of animated
                    spirits, the flint and steel of conversation, tho’ they communicate no fire,
                    give me a generous light, &amp; while I suppress my own thoughts, I often
                    hear them better advanced by another. The illustrious soul that has left amongst
                    us the name of <ref target="people.html#BurnsRobert">Burns</ref>, has often been
                    lower’d down to a comparison with me; but the comparison exists rather in
                    circumstances than in essentials, that man stood up with the stamp of superior
                    intellect, on his brow a visible greatness; and great and patriotic subjects
                    would only have called into action the powers of his mind, which lay inactive
                    while he played calmly &amp; exquisitely the pastoral pipe. The letters to
                    which I have alluded in my preface to the Rural Tales, were friendly warnings,
                    pointed with immediate reference to the fate of that extraordinary man.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">On p. vi of the preface to <title>Rural
                            Tales</title>, Bloomfield states, ‘I have received many honourable
                        testimonies of esteem from strangers; letters without a name, but fill’d
                        with the most cordial advice, and almost a parental anxiety, for my safety
                        under so great a share of public applause’.</note><hi rend="ital">Remember</hi><ref target="people.html#BurnsRobert"><hi rend="ital"> Burns</hi></ref> has been the watch word of my friends. <hi rend="ital">I do remember</hi><ref target="people.html#BurnsRobert"><hi rend="ital"> Burns</hi></ref>, but I am not <ref target="people.html#BurnsRobert">Burns</ref>, neither
                    have I his fire to fan or quench, nor his passion to controll. Where, then, is
                    my merit, if I make a peaceful voyage on a smooth sea, and with no mutiny on
                    board? To a lady (I had it from herself) who remonstrated with him on his
                    dangers from drink, and the pursuits of some of his associates, he replied,
                    Madam, they would not thank me for my company if I did not drink with them; I
                    must give them a slice of my constitution.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The anecdote is quoted unsourced by Wickett and Duval, p. 31,
                        and is also included in the second volume of <title>Remains</title>, p. 78:
                        ‘Miss Johnson, with whom I dined at the White Hart Inn, Fetter Lane, was
                        personally acquainted with Burns; who, breakfasting with her, drank a large
                        tumbler of beer previous to taking either eatables or tea, saying that he
                        had been up till three in the morning, and had drank too much wine. On Miss
                        J’s remonstrating with him as to the injury to which he exposed his health,
                        he replied, ‘Madam, they would not thank me for my company, if I did not
                        drink with them, <hi rend="ital">I must give them a slice of my
                            constitution</hi>’, I wish Burns had given them thinner slices of his
                        constitution, that it might have lasted longer; I then might possibly have
                        had the pleasure of seeing him. He died but two months after I began
                        composing The Farmer’s Boy though at that time, and long after, his death
                        and history were unknown to me’.</note> How much to be regretted that he did
                    not give them thinner slices of his constitution, that it might have lasted
                    longer. I write this my Lord under the burning of an headacke, to which I am
                    subject, and which has prevented my waiting on your Lordship this morning. If in
                    my fireside reflections, I thus draw a picture of myself, I hope I do not
                    trespass on <ref target="people.html#GardinerWilliam">Mr. Gardner’s</ref> art,
                    &amp; more particularly I hope I shall not trespass on your Lordship’s
                    patience. I feel so great a triumph in having your decided approbation that I
                    cannot forbear hazarding an avowal of it in writing. I have said ‘Nature’s
                    sublimer scenes ne’er charmed mine eyes’<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Bloomfield quotes line 11 of ‘Spring’ from <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>:
                        ‘Nature’s sublimer scenes ne’er charmed mine eyes’.</note> and what effect
                    the Cambrian or Caledonian mountains might bring, or a sight of the sea would
                    have, I can only guess. These to me are distant visionary raptures like the
                    saint’s prospect of heaven. My Emma’s Kid<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Emma’s Kid’ was published in the first volume of <title>Remains</title>
                        with the following note: ‘Originally accompanying a pair of kid-leather
                        shoes, which the Earl of Buchan had requested me to maker with my own hands
                        for his lady, then at Dryburgh abbey’ (pp. 42–46).</note> is in therefore
                    the dream of imagination, the eye had no share in collecting one idea to
                    identify the picture. </p><p rend="indent1"> If a man is set upon a house top, he must be a fool not to tread
                    with caution, &amp; feel a becoming solicitude for his safety; more
                    particularly so, if amongst the spectators some might be found who would like to
                    see him fall. This is my situation in some degree. The patronage of wealth and
                    conspicuous talents may well be envied, &amp; perhaps may as long as envy
                    exists in little minds, and true Nobility in great ones, tho’ I know that I am
                    incomprehensible to myself &amp; thus call my courage &amp; confidence
                    to a reckoning for failures, I know that a small dose of poison, alias spirits,
                    has a momentary influence in strengthening both. But my Lord, as I have a strong
                    predilection for living as long as I can, &amp; for living with your
                    Lordship’s favor upon my head, I beseech you at all times, &amp; on all
                    occasions to guard your decisions with your accustom’d good sense &amp;
                    candour, &amp; never to believe that Bloomfield is turned fool, untill you
                    see it yourself. Indeed I much question the wisdom of counteracting &amp;
                    opposing my watery-headed propensity at all. The indulgence of it is more
                    precious than the wealth of all distilleries in the world; &amp; I have
                    always written best when I indulged it most. But I perceive, I am tattling like
