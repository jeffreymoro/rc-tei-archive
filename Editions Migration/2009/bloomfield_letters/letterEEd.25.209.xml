                    fill it. Before I enter into the particulars that have occured since your
                    departure I must remind you that at parting I hinted that I must now closely
                    attend to my own affairs which had run behind and you on your part proposed to
                    have the produce of the subscription ‘in a lump’, whenever I could get it
                    together, and meant probably to forward therewith your mechanism as to the
                    Dibbles for peas &amp;c. On both of those subjects it happens that I can
                    give you information but I will first inform you that I have unfortunately for
                    me been suffering in mind, and consequently in body, in an unusual manner. It
                    will not bear explanation, and if it would, as I hope it is now over, there
                    would be no pleasure, nor wisdom in saying any thing about it. Nearly in that
                    state of mind and frame I accepted reluctantly an invitation to Hertfordshire
                    where I rested myself about four days, and then return’d to my accumulating
                    plagues which arise from my Harp trade all run behind and from the unseasonable
                    and <hi rend="ital">impudend</hi> visits of the vain, and the interested, and
                    the curious, taking up my time, inviting me to Dinner &amp;c &amp;c, Add
                    to these that I have had agency business for Isaac Bloomfield<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">This Isaac was a relation in America—possibly
                        Elizabeth Hingston’s son, and therefore Bloomfield’s nephew.</note>
                    respecting his mother, Money drawn upon a Man whom I have not yet found; a
                    journey to the London Docks to learn where he lives, &amp;c. to go to the
                    Borough to enquire after Mrs Mason’s Money (I mean Sister George)<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Perhaps George Bloomfield’s
                        sister-in-law?</note> for she wrote to me, (mind <hi rend="ital">she
                        wrote</hi>) to say that she should be forced to take a journey to Tunbridge
                    if sombody did not send her money, I have sent money to <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury</ref> without authority! and last
                    week came as unknown and as unexpectedly as was young George’s visit the Boy Tom
                    Mason, to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">Nat’s</ref>, on his way to
                    Pembury! ‘where he is to stop as long as they will be troubled with him’, This
                    is what the boy says himself.—With all these little troubles round me and an
                    unhealthy frame, with dreams that might appall the Devil, I have been as we say
                    ‘finally helpd up’. I am by no means out of it all, but I can now conquer it,
                    and if it should happen that I cannot; perhaps I may accept an invitation to
                    Gloucestershire and South Wales next month.—</p><table cols="4" rows="19" width="740" border="0"><row><cell width="380"/><cell width="100"/><cell width="100">£</cell><cell width="160">s</cell></row><row><cell width="380"><ref target="people.html#LongmanThomasN">Longman’s</ref>

                    that contains under the head ‘Holcomb Sheep Shearing’ some interesting
                    intelligence not indeed of a nature to induce you to go on in speculation—I

                    as much sound sense as he has condescention. I have a letter from Mr Mills of

                    answers to which I am sure he would not remember; and concluded by proposing to
                    give me a suit of close, observing that he had a great stock, and we were both
                    of a size!!! How does a Gnat effect you when he sings in your ear on a Summer’s

                    friends. Boney has beaten all his opponents, and my predictions are all more
                    than fulfill’d, I dread the hour of his renew’d threats, for I doubt that our
                    governors will be paralized, or lash’d into a fume that will be if possible,
                    worse, and more unfit to meet the truly wonderful concentration of power and of
                    talents that they have to cope with. Hey for volunteering! Levies ‘en Masse’
                    Triple Taxes &amp;c.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have sometimes thought for half an hour at a time that I must
                    ride to you and to <ref target="places.html#Sapiston">Sapiston</ref> before I
                    can settle the affairs connected with <ref target="people.html#GloverJohn">John
                        Glover</ref>, (I mention’d it) and Mr Gaston &amp;c, for I confess that
                    I have had so murky and such various things through my brain, that the old, and
                    that which I have not been in the habit of attending to, has faded allmost into
                    oblivion. Should I take it in my head I should avoid <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury</ref>, and probably <ref target="places.html#Troston">Troston</ref>, and make no stay. I should take
                    advantage of the road and see Mr Burk of Barton Mills with whom an interview is
                    allmost necissary &amp;c. But this is only talking. Farewell at present.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> Yours affectionately </salute><signed rend="right">R Bloomfield</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
