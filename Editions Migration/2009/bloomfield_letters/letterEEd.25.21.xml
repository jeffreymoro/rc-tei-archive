                    at last published. I copy part of a letter from the <ref target="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Duke of Grafton</ref>, which I
                    received by this post: — </p><p rend="indent1"> ‘I have to thank you for the acquaintance of a real untaught
                    genius, starting from our neighbourhood; which, together with the account you
                    give of his moral character, makes me very desirous of being of service to him.
                    I can not but lament that I had no intimation given me from any person of him or
                    his disposition, at a time when he might have been assisted to great effect in
                    his education, and that easily. </p><p rend="indent1"> I should be glad to converse with him, if he would do it frankly,
                    on his future views of life; and, if he was advised by you to call on me here, I
                    would first thank him for his work, and then hear what were his plans or wishes
                    for his future occupations. He would find me at home every day about noon; if on
                    Friday, not till after one o’clock. </p><p rend="indent1"> I should be curious to hear where you first had knowlege of this
                    young man, or of any of his writings. The character he has given was well
                    deserved by <ref target="people.html#AustinWilliamUncle">William Austin</ref>,
                    whose son is now in his father’s farm.’</p><p rend="indent1"> I could not resist copying this. You will not give a copy of it;
                    but you will show it to those friends to whom you may wish to communicate it. </p><p rend="indent1"> I will write to your brother by to-morrow’s post. </p><closer><salute rend="indent1">I remain, dear sir, yours very sincerely,</salute><signed rend="right"><ref cRef="people.html#LofftCapel">Capel
