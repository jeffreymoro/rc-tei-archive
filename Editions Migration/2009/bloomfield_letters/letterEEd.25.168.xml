It is from Apothecaries Hall, but I did not get the spermacity because I suppose that is easily had at Worthing.</p><p rend="indent1">	I dined yesterday at <ref target="places.html#Hampstead">Hampstead</ref> and had many kind enquiries after your health, &amp; that of the Children. <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldElizabeth1789">Bet</ref> is come from her place rather out of health, and spent the afternoon here to keep company with <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter">Mary</ref> she is very well. <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot">Charlotte</ref> is bad with a cold, and with that cough which she has had so long. It don’t get worse. Sister <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteAunt">Charlotte</ref> is begining to grumble, and has begd the favour of our mattress for a while, it is going to night. A Mr Harris, with whom and <ref target="people.html#EvansJohn">Mr Evans</ref> I visited <ref target="people.html#DibdinCharles">Dibden’s</ref>, is now down at Worthing, at the rent of sixteen guineas for six weeks. I should not wonder if Mrs Park should go before the summer is out. Perhaps if you cook’d for yourselves it might sometimes be more agreeable but you will endeavour to look over little things. I am happy to hear that you go out, and enjoy your walks: have either of you bathed yet?—</p><p rend="indent1">	I have another letter from Cousin Isaac at New York, who has sent his poor old Mother <hi rend="ital">Seventeen Guineas</hi>!! There’s a Boy for you, after being lost to his friends for so many years! Poor <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">Charles</ref>, may be to you quite as good, if he lives.—<ref target="people.html#YoungThomas">Dr Young</ref> call’d yesterday and seems anxious to hear of <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">Charles</ref>, I shall tell him tomorrow how you proceed, and then write, if necessary. Your prises as to provisions are much like ours therefore as you must have provision if at home, the real weekly expence which may be term’d extra is your lodging and coals which at 16s pr week for three months is but about ten pounds, and your carriage down and home about £8, now if they raise your rent we may still do the whole for thirty pounds; courage girl, courage. I am not sorry that the knee is discharging if it satisfies you. love to the younkers. <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldHannah">hannah</ref> writes a very good and sensible letter, but she puts no stops to her sentences. </p><p rend="indent1">	We shall have about a Dozen Roses on all the trees, the moss rose died, and the sweet briar recover’d. the Broad Beans are in Blossom. the large Lupines which we thought would be yellow are a pale pink, and are a foot and a half high. I have planted 30 seedling stocks, and set scarlet Beans half round the grass plat, to form an arbour on one side up against the dead cherry tree. Both thistles are growing fast. And now, as a bit of a secret I will hint, that Mr Jefery has written to <ref target="people.html#EvansJohn">Mr Evans</ref> to say, that in about 3 weeks he is coming to town with a Chaise to bring a relation, and to say how happy he should be if Mr B would accept of a ride down with him to Worthing! it is very likely therefore that I shall accept the offer, both cheap and agreeable. but do not build upon it, nor disappoint the children. <ref target="people.html#ChurchJoseph">Your father</ref> is well.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1">	Love to you truly</salute><signed rend="right">Rob Bloomfield</signed></closer><postscript><p>Where will you stow me if I come?
