                    anxiety and hurry to write them elegantly: but still; I write whenever I think
                    my doing so may be more useful or satisfactory to others than my silence.</p><p rend="indent1"> I received your letter this afternoon, with those from the <ref target="people.html#BuchanLord">Earl of Buchan</ref><note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">For Buchan’s letter see Letters 178 and 181.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> You ask my advice: and therefore I frankly give it.</p><p rend="indent1"> I venerate the <ref>Earl of Buchan</ref>, and think him &amp;
                    the Chancellor<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Buchan’s brother, Thomas
                        Erskine (1750–1823), was the great advocate who defended Horne Tooke at the
                        1794 treason trials and who went on to become, in 1806, Lord
                        Chancellor.</note> worthy to be brothers to each other. A friend of poetry
                    and of the fine arts, a friend of liberty &amp; of public virtue, he merits
                    high esteem. I have seen letters of his in Wyvill’s Political
                        Correspondence<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Buchan’s measured yet
                        sympathetic letters to the reformer Christopher Wyvill, who organised County

                        Wyvill, <title>Political Papers, Chiefly Respecting the Attempt of the
                            County of York, and Other Considerable Districts, ... to Effect a

                        1794–1802), I, 322–27.</note> which confirm and heighten that esteem in my
                    mind, as in Mr. Wyvill’s.</p><p rend="indent1"> That he should be without pride is out of the nature of human
                    mind &amp; circumstances; but of that pride he has made a truly benevolent
                    generous &amp; virtuous life.</p><p rend="indent1"> Were there no other reasons than his character &amp;
                    affectionate zeal for persons of genius who have worthily employed it I would
                    not disappoint his wish of publishing his letter of yours to him in the next
                    edition of the ‘Wild Flowers.’ To do thus will be honourable to both. Your not
                    forbidding it would be subject to no imputation of vanity; your forbidding it I
                    think would not be free from something liable to be considered as pride or
                    unkindness or injustice.</p><p rend="indent1"> His enthusiastic admiration of <ref target="people.html#BarryJames">Barry</ref> speaks with me powerfully. What
                    he has said of that astonishingly great man is indeed characteristic.</p><p rend="indent1"> This &amp; his attachment to the memory of <ref target="people.html#ThomsonJames">Thomson</ref> of <ref target="people.html#BurnsRobert">Burns</ref> of the patriot <ref target="people.html#FletcherAndrew">Fletcher</ref> &amp; the sublime
                    Newton are motives of esteem &amp; confidence which I deeply feel.</p><p rend="indent1"> I do not see that his saying we forwarded the sale is an
                    assertion that he occasioned the sale. A person may increase and accelerate the
                    success of that which he does not deny would have succeeded without him.</p><p rend="indent1"> Above all let no omissions or retrenchments which you have made
                    of what I had said, whether made on your own views of the subject or the
                    suggestions of others, influence you on this occasion. Be that right or wrong
                    this relative to <ref target="people.html#BuchanLord">Earl Buchan</ref>, stands
                    on its own ground.</p><p rend="indent1"> I trust I have as high &amp; as free a spirit as any man;
                    yet, were <ref target="people.html#BuchanLord">Earl Buchan</ref> to wish to
                    prefix to anything of mine a testimony such as he is desirous of prefixing to
                    your poems, he must write very differently from anything I have seen of his
                    before I should refuse it.</p><p rend="indent1"> The decision of course rests with you. But I do not think him a
                    man whose talents and virtues &amp; tender of goodwill are of that rate
                    which can be slighted without injury to oneself &amp; one’s own feelings</p><p rend="indent1"> The hand in which your letter is copied is generally admired
                    here. It strikes me as being beautiful and elegant almost beyond example. I
                    think there can be no doubt of its being a female hand &amp; as little of
                    its being a lovely hand and under the guidance of a highly cultivated &amp;
                    amiable mind.</p><p rend="indent1"> The letter was worthy to be so transcribed. It places its author
                    high among the few men who have excelled in letter writing.</p><p rend="indent1"> I grieve most truly for the death of the Duchess of Devon
