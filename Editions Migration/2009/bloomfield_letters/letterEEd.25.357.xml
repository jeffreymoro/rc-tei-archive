                    house from which you date is but little more of a prison than your own garret.
                    You are too old ever to clear away your difficulties by your fingers ends, and I
                    am too old in the world to fret at this blow, where there is no disgrace. You
                    are lucky to have got into such good quarters. Your parade is longer than my
                    garden which is my only walk in general for I shun the hills and fields often by
                    choice, but oftener from suffering with cold, weakness, and illness of several
                    kinds—My sight wont let me read, so that in <hi rend="ital">fact</hi> I am a
                    prisoner too.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have written to <ref target="people.html#ParkThomas">Mr
                        Park</ref> on the subject of the Doctors Bill, and apprized him that <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot">Charlotte</ref> will call upon
                    him next week, <hi rend="ital">not before</hi>, for he may be out. He lives in

                    house from the Church on the south or London side of the way. I find writing
                    extremely difficult and must be short. The designs are done at last, and the
                    printers will soon go to work. Love to all, and I am yours, </p><closer><signed rend="right">Rob Bloomfield</signed></closer><postscript><p>The old house at <ref target="places.html#Honington">Honington</ref> is
                        going, or gone to the hammer, it has cost me a great deal too much to make
                        it and to keep it what it is, I can get no rent; and to stand repairs
                        without will never do. On a dividend of <ref target="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin">Will Austins</ref> stock I get
                        (if I can) £9 5s 6d for 7 years rent! If I don’t grow rich now the devil is

                        came a letter from <ref target="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin">Austin</ref> inclosing the above sum (all but 16s for a stamp) He says
                        ‘your House was sold yesterday at the Fox, it was knocked down to Mr
                        Longwood for one Hundred guineas but I rather think it is for Mr Sparham’.—I
                        own that I expected a higher price, but in times like these we know not what
                        to expect.—</p><p rend="indent1"> Richard in the play says, ‘Off with his head’, and in an
