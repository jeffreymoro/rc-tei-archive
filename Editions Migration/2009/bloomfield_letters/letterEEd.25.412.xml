                        in Thetford, 13 September 1819.</p><p>For permission to publish the text of MSS in their possession, the editors wish to thank the Beinecke Rare

                        preceded by an appeal to the public to relieve George from poverty (he had been forced to apply to the overseers of the poor
                        rates for his parish for relief). Hone also published a letter from Faux, a 'respectable resident at Thetford' (formerly Mayor
                        of Thetford, and a bank manager and alderman by 1845) to an unnamed correspondent explaining the efforts Faux had made to
                        bring George to the notice of local gentlemen by inviting him to attend the opening of the spa at Thetford (about which George
                        had anonymously published the poem <title><ref target="../HTML/thetford.html">Thetford Chalybeate Spa</ref></title>): 'Two
                        letters, written to a friend by a gentleman of Thetford, Mr. Faux, and some manuscripts accompanying them in George
                        Bloomfield's hand-writing, are now before me. They contain a few particulars respecting George Bloomfield and his present
                        situation, which are here made known, with the hope of interesting the public in the behalf of a greatly distressed and very
                        worthy man. The following extract from one of Mr. Faux's letters introduces George Bloomfield's circumstances, and conveys an
                        idea of his character: it will be seen that he, too, is a versifier.<quote rend="right"> Thetford, <date when="1827-10-15">Oct. 15, 1827</date></quote><quote>I have found the letter you allude to, regarding his <hi n="ital">application to
                                the overseers</hi> of St. Peter's. I was rather inclined to send you a bundle of his letters and poetry, but I hardly
                            think it fair without first consulting poor old George, and obtaining his permission. The letter enclosed, in answer to my
                            invitation to him to be present on the day the duke of Grafton laid the first stone of the Pump-room, will show you what a

                            highly beneficial to him; but his extreme modesty has been a drawback upon him through life, leaving him generally with a
                            coat 'scarcely visible.' I believe he has been always poor, and yet a more temperate man never lived.</quote></note> I
                    feel truly grateful for the kindness: but when I can, without offence, avoid being seen, I have, through life, consulted my
                    sheepish feelings. I have been accused of 'making myself scarce,' and been always considered an 'unsocial' fellow: it is a task to
                    me to go into a situation where I am likely to attract attention, and the observation of men. </p><p rend="indent1"> In childhood I read of an invisible coat—I have sometimes worn a coat scarcely visible; but I want a coat that
