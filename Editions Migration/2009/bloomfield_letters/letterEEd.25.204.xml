                    know that the custom of throwing an old shoe after a person setting off on a
                    journey ‘for luck’ is common enough in many parts of the country. Her Cottage
                    stood high on a Bank beside a green lane, and on her descent from the door, her
                    daughter, a great [illegible word] inadvertently threw after her her fathers <hi rend="ital">High-Low</hi> or half-Boot, very ponderous, and filld with nails
                    in the heel. The salutation took place on the back of her head, and she was
                    obidge’d to turn back to have the wound dressd!!! Now as you have not yet found
                    out all my prepensities you cannot perhaps immagine how such ridiculous things
                    as these provoke me to laughter when I hapen to be in the humour, viz. when I am
                    just as silly as I am somtimes sad.</p><p rend="indent1"> Our best regards to all friends</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> Yours Dear Madam</salute><signed rend="right">R B</signed><address><addrLine><rs>Address: </rs><name><ref target="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mrs Baker</ref></name>, / <name><ref target="people.html#SharpWilliam">Wm Sharp</ref> Esq</name> / <placeName><ref target="places.html#Fulham">Fullham</ref></placeName></addrLine></address></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
