                    what I should call a letter, but a mere acknowledgement for yours of yesterday
                    which had been expected with very great anxiety because we knew you to be
                    awkwardly situated, and that it would require your whole stock of fortitude and
                    experience to go through with it. I understand you have read that work of
                    astonishing variety ‘Gill Blas.’ Now you may be either Gill, or Fabricious, or
                    Scipio—but you will surely not have so many changes, or be <hi rend="ital">tempted</hi> to change your situation so often.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Adventures of Gil Blas of Santillane</title>, one
                        of the era’s most popular romances, was written between 1715 and 1735, in
                        French, by Alain-René Lesage and translated into English by Tobias Smollett
                        in 1749.</note> As to the present <ref target="places.html#Putney">Putney</ref> concern it is evidenced that the subscribers and governers
                    want to screw out of a new Master ten or twenty pounds which when divided would
                    save each of them perhaps £2 per year or less / But now as to what we have to do
                    with this beggarly spirit, is the point in hand.—You cannot go back to the
                    Central it seems! On this I should say or surmise, that Johnson has already <hi rend="ital">there</hi> some whom his <hi rend="ital">interest</hi> prompts
                    him to send before you; so much for that.—</p><p rend="indent1"> I don’t think you are right in sticking for £70, for this reason,
                    = because with <hi rend="ital">you</hi> it is £70 or nothing. Or at least you
                    see you will have another plan to seek, though in this I by no means despair. I
                    would by no means refuse £60 or even £55 (for a single man as you are,) and you
                    see they are at their wits end to get one for more! But you are to understand
                    this my advice on the supposition that you wish, or will, or <hi rend="ital">can</hi>, put up with your <ref target="places.html#Putney">Putney</ref>
                    station for a time.—I shall not be surprised at any sudden dismissal on their
                    part, or at any disgust on yours, only particularly remember that your friend Mr
                    Moor is not to be treated with any thing but that love and respect which your
                    own heart, (I hope) dictates already.</p><p rend="indent1"> I wish I was nearer to you, but pocket the £30 and wait events as
                    I do.—I make rhimes when I can, and am not in despair. I shall soon see you
                    altogether in London for better or worse, and in the mean time be what you have
                    been, sober and discreet, and I shall be your Anxious Father</p><closer><signed rend="right">Rob Bloomfield</signed></closer><postscript><p>When did you see <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot">Charlotte</ref>? We want to hear from her, perhaps she is very busy,?
