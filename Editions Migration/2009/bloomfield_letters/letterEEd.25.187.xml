                    on which you date yours from <ref target="places.html#Fulham">Fullham</ref>.
                    With respect to <ref target="people.html#SharpCatherine">Miss Sharp’s</ref>
                    communication from Wicken, I made a delay and delay caused a blunder &amp;c.
                    &amp;c. &amp;c.—to be accounted for hereafter either to that lady or to
                    you. But so it is that I have sent the Books required not to Northampton shire
                    but to <ref target="places.html#ClareHall">Clare Hall</ref>! I cannot help it,
                    it is done! Your copy is amongst them—but now I am going to broach another
                    subject for I am quite ashamed of this.—For your criticism I thank you and I
                    find so much difficulty in even approaching to what pleases my self in Blank
                    verse that you have no need to fear my relinquishing my jingle. Tell <ref target="people.html#SharpWilliam">your good father</ref> that I have made
                    some progress in the Wars of Troy, but that I shall want the Vollm the best part
                    of the summer if he can spare it. It is all novelty, all charms, only a little
                    too much blood. There’s a critique upon Homer! What do you think of me!! I hope
                    to see your scetches of Forest Trees, and if I might see your short poems <hi rend="ital">scribbled</hi> in blank verse, though I know for a certainty
                    that M.S. poetry is not read with the same advantage with that which is printed,
                    I should feel highly honourd. If I exhibit my ‘first view of the sea’ it will be
                    an effort on my part, for though it is actually printed in the ‘Monthly Mirror,’
                    I have such a distaste towards it as you can hardly conceive.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Monthly Mirror</title>, 20 (1805),

                        The following lines are meant to describe feelings which the circumstances
                        and the scene (the northern approach to Worthing,) rendered particularly
                        impressive. They are much at your service, and submitted with good wishes to

                    subject, what is the use of a man’s saying that the Church in which Nelson was
                    buried is bigger that [sic] the church at <ref target="places.html#Fulham">Fullham</ref> ? Let him <hi rend="ital">tell how big it is</hi>! This I
                    could not do, and therefore do not like the piece, any more than you would a

                    some time on that day, and to leave you on Monday or Tuesday at furthest. I feel
                    just now as if I had a vast deal to talk about, but if I put it into a letter it
                    will encroach on my teatime.</p><p rend="indent1"> Can I conclude this hasty epistle without doing justice to my own
