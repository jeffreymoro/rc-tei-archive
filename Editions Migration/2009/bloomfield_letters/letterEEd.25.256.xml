                    necessary resumption of intercourse, and how genuine and how willingly comes
                    forth the required apology? I am in every sense glad that your <ref target="people.html#SharpCatherine">Cousin Catherine</ref> apprised you of
                    my humours and my objects and my griefs as far as she knows them, for it has
                    precluded the necessity of my doing it, and left me to speak of present and
                    future things the more particularly.</p><p rend="indent1"> Since you saw or heard any part of my Journal,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The journal of the Wye tour of 1807.</note> and I think I
                    remember <hi rend="ital">how far</hi> I had then proceeded in my amusement, much
                    alteration has taken place in the plan and divisions &amp;c. As I advanced I
                    began to conceive that it might even eventualy be renderd fit for publication,
                    and this perswasion set me about a thorough examination and revision. I
                    concieved that it was, owing to the careless and hasty manner of its early
                    composition, much too hudibrastic, and containd a vast deal of useless matter
                    which might give way to the superior graces of nature, or to unbridled fancy. I
                    had finished it, as I thought, according to this plan, last summer; and I had
                    the joint opinion of my <hi rend="ital">then</hi> companions, <ref target="people.html#InskipThomas">Inskip</ref>, himself a poet, and a man of
                    strong mind, and my host, <ref target="people.html#WestonJoseph">Mr.
                        Weston</ref> of <ref target="places.html#Shefford">Shefford</ref>, Beds, and
                    as he has read and thought more than any man I ever found in his station of
                    life, and his age, and is an enthusiast in poetry, with a memory truly
                    astonishing considering his mutifarious reading, I consider him highly capable
                    of detecting what were blemishes in a harum scarum story like mine,—We read it
                    for the purpose of criticizing closely, We all doubted the propriety of Giant
                    Scoop in the outset of the piece, yet all agreed that the ridiculous thought was
                    not without merit, only perhaps out of place.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Giant Scoop’: at the beginning of MS <title>The Banks of Wye

                    of memory’, and he, even then, in its ruder state, said that it would probably
                    be well recieved if published, but that it was evident that I had not taken the
                    pains with it which might be taken. I then wrote the whole out again with great
                    emendations, in which state <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr. Lofft</ref>
                    gave the opinion which I very barely stated to you. I took his hints and the
                    others in conjunction, and wrote <hi>the whole out again</hi>, still in the
                    mending way with additions and curtailments, and in this new dress, without the
                    personage above mentioned, Scoop, I submited the piece to the calm, judicious,
                    and candid <ref target="people.html#ParkThomas">Mr Park</ref> of <ref target="places.html#Hampstead">Hampstead</ref> (He had seen the giant long
                    ago and said nothing in his praise, which I know how to understand) He was
                    decidedly of opinion that the thing would do me credit, and at the same time
                    pencil’d his doubts and remarks. With this encouragement I <hi rend="ital">once
                        more</hi> wrote out the whole; gave the brat a name; and offer’d it to My
                    Bookseller. I know of nothing which can <hi rend="ital">now</hi> retard its
                    ultimate appearance before the world. It will be devid’d into 4 Books, and it
                    now contains incidental Ballads, (a great relief to the sameness and length of
                    the tale) entitled ‘The Gleaners Song’ attatchd to that delicious scene,
                    Coldwell springs—‘Morris of Persfield’,—‘The Maid of Landoga’,—and ‘a funeral
                    Song’, at the Hay.—I wish, as you say, most sincerely that I could submit it
                    still to <ref target="people.html#CooperRobert">Mr Cooper</ref>, but it will be
                    out of my power. It is intended to engrave 4 plates only, for my Booksellers are
                    averse to the costly and fashionable stile of publishing; One or two of which
                    plates they seem allmost determin’d to take from <hi rend="ital">my own</hi>
                    scetches on the spot, this, I fear may appear strange to you, but not surely if
                    you recollect that <hi rend="ital">their</hi> object is to lay hold of every
                    thing which can <hi rend="ital">interest</hi> or bias in the <hi rend="ital">sale</hi>. Remembering what you have said as to your own drawings, I hope,
                    though it is a delicate point, to obtain from <ref target="people.html#CooperRobert">Mr Cooper</ref> two of his to be the
                    ornaments of my present venture; and, may, I tell you? that the Journal will
                    bear at least an ample record of pleasure, with some starts of fancy, and some
                    of tenderness, whatever may be thought of its general merit, or the merit of the
                    Theme!</p><p rend="indent1"><date when="1811-01-23">Jan. 23.</date> And now, after this rest, I resume my
                    theme again, And have to say that I think <hi rend="itl">my</hi> drawings will
                    escape the ordeal of publicity, and I accordingly apply to <ref target="people.html#CooperRobert">Mr Cooper</ref> for 4.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The engravings based on Robert Bransby Cooper's
