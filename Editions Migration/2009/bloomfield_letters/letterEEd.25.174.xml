I am afraid you sent us all your crop of Raspberry’s, they are a good sort, but no fruit is sweet hitherto this cold Summer. Order Coals at <ref target="people.html#WestonJoseph">Mr Weston’s</ref>, and say that your Father will settle for them when he comes home. Call and pay the income Tax and take a receipt. You are to buy a yard and half of Cambric Muslin and make <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot">Charlotte</ref> a Frock.</p><p rend="indent1">	Go to <ref target="people.html#HoodThomas">Mr Hood’s</ref> and ask for two mirrors, and two Museums,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The journals <title>The Monthly Mirror</title> and <title>The Ladies’ Museum</title>, in which Bloomfield’s and Lofft’s verse frequently appeared, and which Bloomfield regularly despatched from London to Lofft in Suffolk.</note> and pack one of each in a small parcell, and Direct it, ‘<ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</ref> Esq. <ref target="places.html#Troston">Troston</ref> Hall, near <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury</ref>.

We dined at Mr Norton’s the day after you went home. I have seen them catch flat-fish and pickd up plenty for our suppers and the folks down stairs. The nets drew ashore a great many Scuttle fish, not with the shell which you have seen, This is the live fish after he has cast his shell. they are now not more than five inches long, round, and transparent like a long bladder of water. they have long feelers round the head, and contain a quantity of black liquid which if you throw them down they will spurt out to the distance of a foot, and then lie exhausted. They grow large before they cast their shell. They caught a Sea Serpent, and Eels, and several sorts of flat fish, young Sprats, and a large headed fish about 8 inches or less in length, which has a sharp poisonous fin on his side with which he can wound you and cause swelling and pain for a week. One small fish was drawn on the sand, with round fins in size and colour like those of the beautiful blue Butterfly spotted like them and still more bright. I faild in securing him, for the net buried him in the sand.</p><p rend="indent1">	Mr Harris, (father in law to Mr Norton) gave <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">Charles</ref> a ride yesterday on a neddy. Mrs Spooner wrote to offer the use of her Library and Newspapers.
