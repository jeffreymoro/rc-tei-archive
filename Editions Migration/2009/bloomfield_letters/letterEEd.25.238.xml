                                Verse; Honington Green, a Ballad . . . and Other Poems</title> (London, 1803). Nathaniel’s poem took the grim line
                            argued by Thomas Malthus in <title>An Essay on the Principle of Population</title> (1798) that war was to be welcomed
                            because it relieved poverty by keeping population in check. The argument of Holloway (here referred to as ‘Will’) was that
                            it was an evil, a punishment for humanity’s sinfulness.</note></l><l rend="indent3"> Men like the Bees in swarms combined,</l><l rend="indent3"> In hopes each social joy to

                                War</title> was hostile. <title>The Critical Review</title>, 37 (1803), 406–15 criticised the Malthusian argument of
                                <title>An Essay</title> as a perversion of Christian doctrine and suggested Nathaniel lacked the strength of mind
                            required to write blank verse. Other reviews focused on the poem’s awkwardness and suggested that the hyperbolical praise
                            that Lofft heaped upon it in his preface did the author a disservice. <title>The Annual Review</title>, 2 (1803), 585–88,
                            called Lofft ‘mistaken’ in supposing he had ‘found a nest of poets’ and remarked, ‘the poem being bad, Mr. Capel Lofft is
                            ignorant. Q.E.D, lamentably ignorant, and presumptuously obtrusive in his ignorance’ (p. 587). Cf. <title>The Monthly
                                Review</title>, 42 (1803), 379–81. <title>The British Critic</title>, 22 (1803), 81–82 declared ‘Another Bloomfield,
                            and a poet! Are all the Bloomfields poets?’ (p. 81). All noted that Lofft had drawn attention to Nathaniel’s embarrassment
                            at being a tailor and, while disavowing any snobbery about this profession, argued that he was not a good enough poet to
                            give it up. Byron was crueller about labourer poets, and Nathaniel in particular, in <title>English Bards and Scotch
                                Reviewers</title> (London, 1809), lines 765–94. <lg><l rend="indent3">When some brisk youth, the tenant of a stall,</l><l rend="indent3">Employs a pen less pointed than his awl,</l><l rend="indent3">Leaves his snug shop, forsakes his store of shoes,</l><l rend="indent3">St. Crispin quits, and cobbles for the muse,</l><l rend="indent3">Heavens! how the vulgar stare! how crowds applaud!</l><l rend="indent3">How ladies read, and literati laud!</l><l rend="indent3">If chance some wicked wag should pass his jest,</l><l rend="indent3">‘Tis sheer ill-nature—don’t the world know best?</l><l rend="indent3">Genius must guide when wits admire the rhyme,</l><l rend="indent3">And Capel Lofft declares ‘tis quite sublime.</l><l rend="indent3">Here, then, ye happy sons of needless trade!</l><l rend="indent3">Swains! quit the plough, resign the useless spade!</l><l rend="indent3">Lo!
