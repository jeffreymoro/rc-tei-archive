                    so immediately as I ought. Your 2d gives me great pleasure in all respects were
                    it not that I doubt from it your health is not fully recovered.</p><p rend="indent1"> I suppose the agreement is upon a proper agreement stamp so as to
                    be in a state to be given in evidence if necessary &amp; that you have a
                    duplicate of it in your possession also duely executed and stampt.</p><p rend="indent1"> I wish to be remembered to <ref target="people.html#HillThomas">Mr Hill</ref> whom I hope that you will find well &amp; happy.</p><p rend="indent1"> A musical friend at Thetford (as all musical friends have been to
                    whom I have shown them) is greatly pleased with your songs to Hooke’s
                        lessons.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bloomfield added words to
                        the melodies given in Hook’s <title>Guida di Musica</title>. The resultant
                        poems were published in <title>Remains</title> (pp. 51–56). Hook himself set
                        a Bloomfield poem to music: <title>Rosy Hannah, A Much Admired Song, with an
                            Accompaniment, for the Harp or Pianoforte, Composed for Mr. Braham, by
                            Mr. Hook (The Words from Bloomfield’s Poems)</title> (London, [?
                        1810]).</note> Might you not while in town make an agreement on that subject
                    with Mr Hooke which would be [? pleasant] advantageous to both for publishing
                    them as separate songs.</p><p rend="indent1"> It is very [illegible word] that going up at a moment’s notice
                    &amp; you know in what roads &amp; weather &amp; scarcely having an
                    instant to spare I did forget, not having your letter by me, that you had
                    written to the <ref target="people.html#GraftonGeorgeHenry4">Duke of
                        Grafton</ref>. I am very happy in the Result and thank you for your friendly
                    attention as to the other matter.</p><p rend="indent1"> I would write to you in London but you have given me no
                    address.</p><p rend="indent1"> I think I informed you of the sudden &amp; unenviable fate of
                    poor dear little comet. For some days &amp; while the delightful February
                    days and starlight nights continued we were [illegible word] pleased with the
                    beautiful appearance of Venus and its moon. About 3 days short of the new moon
                    darkness is found with frost I own that I have almost enough of it.</p><p rend="indent1"> This is the anniversary of our marriage <ref target="people.html#LofftSarah">Mrs Lofft</ref> Sara &amp; Laura are all
                    well: Capel at school: Nancy on a visit at Stanton.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> I am yrs with great esteem</salute><signed rend="right"><ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</ref></signed></closer><postscript><p>As you say nothing to the contrary I hope that <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn">Mrs</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldHannah">Miss Bloomfield</ref> &amp;
                        the rest of your family are well.</p><p rend="indent1"> Would not this be the time to propose publishers in a neat
                        but cheap &amp; popular form Richard &amp; Kate. If separately
                        publisht my opinion has always been that there is scarcely a cottage where
                        the owners or any of their children can read in where it would not be. And
                        it is very desirable that it should for the same reason I have wisht an
                        edition of the Farmer’s Boy such as [? ]ingham &amp; [? ]by have
                        publisht of the Lessons should be separately publisht for general use.</p><p>The case appears to be very distinctly candidly I already stated.</p><p rend="indent1"> The Law of copy-right, by the case decided, appears
                        [illegible word] thus</p><p rend="indent1"> Where an authour in his life have parted with his whole copy
                        right generally in a particular work if he survives the 14 years the
                        Purchaser by such general [? consent/covenant] have the benefit of the
                        reversionary 14 years given to the author as his assignee under the
                        [illegible word] of [? mone]y.</p><p rend="indent1"> But where, as was done properly in the agreement in question,
                        the author makes an agreement expressly for 14 years,—if he survives that
                        term or so much as was unexpired at the term of the agreement he is at
                        liberty to make a new agreement as to that work.</p><p rend="indent1"> The printing of a stereotype edition of your other works
                        publisht since the Farmers Boy successively does not prejudice that right,
                        but leaves it as it were, as to the Farmers Boy. The other works though
                        publisht with it in this stereotype edition by your consent stand upon their
                        own separate footing &amp; distinct periods of publication.</p><p rend="indent1"> In this upon the statement of the case I see no difficulty or
                        doubt in point of law or equity.</p></postscript><closer><date>10 Mar: 1814</date><signed rend="right"><ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft </ref></signed><address><addrLine><rs>Address: </rs><name>Mr Bloomfield</name>, / <placeName><ref target="places.html#Shefford">Shefford</ref>, / nr Bedford,</placeName> / <date when="1814-03-11">11 Mar; 1814</date> [re-addressed]: <placeName>No 19 Dogget’s Court, / Moorfields, / London.</placeName></addrLine></address></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
