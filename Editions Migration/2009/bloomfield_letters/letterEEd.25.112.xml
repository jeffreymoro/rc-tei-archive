                    morning to <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury</ref>; and late at
                    Night, after I had determined not to go, <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteAunt">Charlotte</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldElizabeth1789">Bet</ref> came up to see for
                    me, and to say that they had prevail’d on <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">Nat</ref> to accompany me. But abiding by
                    my determination you see that neither of us came. Our intention was only to
                    tarry two days and learn how you stood affected yourselves as to the general
                    armament, and if possible hold a council on our own situation as inhabitants of
                    this great Babalon. The measures persued by Government are such as to cause here
                    the greatest consternation and alarm. Great numbers are entering as Vollunteers
                    without knowing I doubt, what they have to trust to, or what will be their
                    privilidges. We hesitate whither to enter now, or to wait <hi rend="ital">and be
                        forced</hi>. I am sorry to say that <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">Nat’s</ref> domesticated manners, and quick and irritable feelings render
                    him a real sufferer under this awful and unbounded appeal to arms. Judging from
                    events at Dublin, it is not unreasonable to infer that whatever may be in the
                    woomb of time that London will be the chief scene of action. As to real invasion
                    we deem it less threatening than an appeal to the exercise of rights by those of
                    our own land. Our parish of Shoreditch contains thirty six thousand inhabitants,
                    how great a proportion of <hi rend="ital">men</hi> that number will give I know
                    not, but assuredly sufficient to place us in what I shall deem an armd Mob. I
                    cannot help wishing that my family were in the interior of the kingdom instead
                    of being in the nest of confusion. I could then join my third class and do no
                    more of the work of death than I am forced to do. but as it is, we shall most
                    probably stand our ground with our neighbours—</p><p rend="indent2"><date when="1803-08-02">Tuesday Afternoon 4 Oclock</date></p><p rend="indent1"> I now resume my letter which I had laid by with a 2d
                    determination of treating ourselves with a ride to Suffolk but after a council
                    we thought that a meeting of 5 of us under such circumstances and at such a time
                    would affect <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my Mother</ref> in the
                    wrong way, and would not produce the satisfaction to any of us that ought to
                    attend long separated friends. If the time comes that I <hi rend="ital">must</hi> absolutely be a Soldier, I feel an inclination to be on
                    Horseback, but perhaps without knowing whither it be best. I long to know how
                    you stand as to politicks at <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury</ref>
                    — Here, the old jeers about the <hi rend="ital">impossibility</hi> of invasion,
                    have taken flight from all companies. The gazers at Drilling soldiers discard
                    risibility from the corners of their mouths, and every one led by hand-Bills or
                    by hearing, are acting according to their pride, or their fear, or their
                    interest. Perhaps the storm may blow over soon, or assume another aspect. I
                    detest, I had allmost said scorn the profession Soldier; and hope that
                    Government will never have much occasion for us 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> class men: If they should, I will send my <hi rend="ital">live stock</hi> into the country out of the way.—</p><p rend="indent1"> We expect from you a letter on this red-coat mania as the most
                    interesting subject you could write upon. We have here within a hundred yards of
                    us, the thunder of drums, and the discharge of field pieces and Musquetry every
                    night in a field adjoining, and nothing is talkd of, or thought of but War.—</p><p rend="indent1"> We are all pretty well. The Newspapers say that the <ref target="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Duke of Grafton</ref> is at
