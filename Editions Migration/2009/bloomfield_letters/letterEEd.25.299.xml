                    contained nothing of Burton. Well, I suppose we must give it up. I am afraid Mr
                    Phillips is ill, and I may have had brighter hopes in that quarter than were
                    warranted by any friendships that may have existed between us. </p><p>—Sunday 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>—You see I had intended to write sooner, but Miss
                    Badger came in for a gossip and put me out. I am happy to say that <ref target="people.html#WestonJoseph">Mr Weston</ref> is still better, or in
                    fact as well as the concerns of the world will let him. Miss Weston is quite
                    well, but if you should write to her pray remember to say nothing that will
                    intimate that you had heard of her brother’s ill health. I will give you ample
                    and full sufficient reasons for this injunction hereafter. I suppose you have
                    learnd by this time that <ref target="people.html#WhitbreadSamuel">Whitbreads</ref> Gamekeeper was lately shot by a gang of poachers? It
                    happen’d in that part of the <ref target="places.html#Southill">Southill</ref>
                    road leading down to the lodge gate from peppercorn’s farm, and not far from a
                    large Single Oak which you may remember standing on the right, near the
                    roadside. The Funeral past through this place on Wednesday. He is buried
                    somewhere beyond Hitchen.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am truly glad to hear of even the remotest prospect of your
                    getting employment, and if your entertainers mention the subject again I advise
                    you by every consideration of love and interest to accept that, or any similar
                    offer. I want your company more than you can imagine, it is therefore <hi rend="ital">much against the grain</hi> of my affection that I thus urge
                    with warmth and earnestness your continuance abroad at least till after March. I
                    give you the following reasons for such <hi rend="ital">earnestness</hi>.</p><p rend="indent1"> Up to this moment I cannot even <hi rend="ital">guess</hi> what I
                    shall get for my reversion of copy. If I get but a small sum I must make it
                    larger by parting with <hi rend="ital">half</hi> my share of the whole concern,
                    which will reduce our income <del rend="strikethrough">by</del> just
                    half.—Whether I be compeld to this or not, all the Town knows that I must
                    probably move at Lady-day. And I can not untill I learn my London affairs, judge
                    either of my ability to hire another House at all, or of what path I shall take.
                    There seems to be no House in the Town fit for our purpose. This is too large
                    and some others would be too small. If you return to see me in the depth of my
                    uncertainty and trouble, and then have to move with us in three months, it will
                    make your home very uncomfortable. Would to God I could receive you better, but
                    if you come home sooner, here is my Heart and my porridge pot now and for life.
                    I write to your <hi rend="ital">Reason,</hi> and not to your <hi rend="ital">affection</hi>. The latter is my treasure, I wish it would pay my debts!
                    Yet make yourself happy on my account. I am not deprest, I am not ill, but this
                    plaguy suspence worries me sadly sometimes. I shall know my fate as to London in
                    a few weeks, and the rest must depend on that. Learn all you can. Make yourself
                    usefull. Yours ultimately must be the gain. You have given a very good critique
                    on the Orphan, I should have liked to have seen it. We have mountebanks in the
                    Town. Leevit won a shoulder of mutton, and one of the Wright’s, a leg.—</p><p rend="indent1"> —All in the House have had colds but myself—The post hour is
