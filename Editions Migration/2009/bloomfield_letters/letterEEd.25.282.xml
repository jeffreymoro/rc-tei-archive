                    this will make amends. I have seen Bullock’s Museum,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">William Bullock’s Museum, known as the London or Egyptian
                        Museum, opened at 22 Piccadilly in 1812. It featured 15000 items of natural
                        history and art, including some from ancient Egypt and others brought from
                        the Pacific by Captain Cook’s expeditions.</note> in company with Isaac and

                    Ostritch, whose shoulders, (besides his immense neck) is just the height of my
                    head. What unpardonable fools we have been to live so long in London without
                    seeing such worthy, such rational, and astonishing productions of nature!
