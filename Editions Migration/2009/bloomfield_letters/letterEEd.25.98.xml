                        Gregory, <title>The Economy of Nature Explained and Illustrated on the

                    which was at <ref target="places.html#Honington">Honington</ref>, and I now send
                    the second Vollm.—I had a letter of Lamentation from <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my Mother</ref>, and one from <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac</ref> by which I can find
                    that much unhappiness must have been felt by you all. The Irishman when he was
                    going to be tried for horsestealing observed as he enterd the court ‘Now here
                    they are going to make a Hundred words about this D——d Old Horse.’ If he had
                    seen <ref target="people.html#GloverJohn">my Father</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac</ref> begining to strip
                    the Thatch off he might have used the same observation with the alteration of
                    one word. On so delicate a subject as a family squabble how can I advise? What I
                    have written to <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my Mother</ref> is my
                    best answer to it all. And realy it is destressing that she should be made to
                    feel more than her natural temper may subject her to, either by the effects of
                    poverty in one Son or the Worlds crosses in another, for I realy suspect that
                    you felt, and still feel some pressure of trouble that is unknown to me. Speak
                    ingenuously, have you any <hi rend="ital">other</hi> objection to my standing
                    the whole expense besides that of its being <hi rend="ital">expensive</hi> and
                    appearing in you eyes unfair?? Or do my part of the business appear like
                    swallowing the House, Tiles and all, against your will? I don’t want the House!
                    I only say that nobody out of the family shall have it if I can help it. and
                    this, with your permission, I will stick to. In thus looking forward you cannot
                    pretend to set bounds to my Fancy nor I to yours. suppose I say that, ‘twenty
                    years hence I mean to buy what <hi rend="ital">was</hi><ref target="places.html#HoningtonGreen">Honington Green</ref> and throw it open
                    and erect upon it a pedestal in honour of the pastoral Muse! This is dreaming
                    with a vengence; but if you dislike it you may say somthing to wake me. I have a
                    great and an inexplicable veneration for the House and the place of our birth.

                    infant children for joys to come, and for the expansion of brighter views. And
                    to induce you to it I have to add, that it is the intention of the Booksellers,

                    know, by the further compliment of £100, in consequence of their great sale. As
                    this is but a verbal promise I say nothing of it to <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref>. You will find that I have

                    by the enclosed Note to him, and under all these circumstances I trust with a
                    strengthened confidence in the ultimate triumph of affection over the yowls of
