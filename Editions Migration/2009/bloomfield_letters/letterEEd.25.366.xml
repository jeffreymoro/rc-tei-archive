                    anxious about you for some days before. You may thank Golding and Sparham<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Mr Sparham is mentioned in Letter 357 as
                        the probable buyer of the house in Honington.</note> that you have no great
                    coat this season, I feel for you, but cannot help you.—<ref target="people.html#InskipThomas">Inskip</ref> talks of your paying us a
                    visit &amp;c. but to me it appears very imprudent so to do at this season of
                    the year, and when you must want every shilling for other purposes. After an
                    absence of only six months to travel two hundred and forty miles to ‘go to see’
                    smells too much of <ref target="places.html#Rotherhithe">Rotherhithe</ref>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Bloomfield’s disapproval of his wife’s
                        family is also expressed in Letter 356.</note>—I have misd your company
                    severely, and am always thinking about you, but I will at the same time give you
                    the best advice in my power. Before you get this I hope to receive your poetical
                    pieces, and I shall proceed with ‘Gosling John’<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">For ‘John Gosling’ see Letter 324.</note> as fast as I can,
                    and try hard to keep my spirits up and to rekon upon another season or two of
                    existence at least, when my affairs, I think, will mend themselves. I have never
                    had my old dreadfull sickness at the stomach since the morning before we left
                    London for Margate.</p><p rend="indent1"> Old Dick Thompson, and Jem Cooper’s mother were buried lately.
