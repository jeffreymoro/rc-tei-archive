                    you will not fail to write for our mutual satisfaction, and for the pleasure it
                    will give our poor old <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">mother</ref>,
                    who is still living, and as well as she has been for many years past.</p><p rend="indent1"> I sent you a letter directed to Philadelphia long ago. We have
                    heard nothing from you since, nor indeed any ray of information since your
                    letter which gave some account of your voyage to that place. <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">Nat</ref> has long entertained a notion
                    that as you have something of the rambler in your disposition you meant to
                    forbear writing that you might one day surprise us with your sudden appearance
                    in London, but I find he now gives you over for dead, thinking that nothing but
                    death could induce you to keep your friends thus in total darkness, both as to
                    your health or sickness, prosperity or poverty; for what if you are as poor as
                    Job, did any of your relations expect you to grow rich? You set out a friendless
                    adventurer, and what if you remain such, is that a reason for your breach of
                    communication with your mother? Dear wench, think of these things, and believe
                    that a letter, directed to ‘Mrs. Bloomfield, to be left at No. 14, <ref target="places.html#BellAlley">Great Bell Alley</ref>, Coleman’s-street,
                    London’ will be highly acceptable to us all. You may probably receive this in
                    October, and then, when may we expect a reply?</p><p rend="indent1"> With respect to myself my ‘Farmer’s Boy’ has run through six
                    editions, and the last publication ‘Rural Tales’ has been reprinted largely. I
                    know, that of the first, you have, on your side of the water, several editions
                    of your own, (American editions) and this circumstance alone makes me wonder
                    that you have not written to me on so great and so interesting a subject to us
                    all. There is a French translation of the Farmer’s Boy at Paris, which is now
                    reprinting in London. </p><p rend="indent1"> Your brothers and sisters are well, and their families. <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldKitty">Katharine</ref> is still unmarried. If
                    I have no reply in a reasonable time I will get some of the great and good
                    friends whom fortune has thrown in my way, to employ some person residing in
                    your city to ascertain the truth of your situation, if living; or to transmit
                    the particulars of your demise. </p><p rend="indent1"> Remaining in anxious uncertainty,</p><closer><salute rend="indent2"> Your affectionate brother, </salute><signed rend="indent3"> Robert Bloomfield</signed></closer><postscript><p><label>P.S.</label> You may, if you like it better, direct to ‘Robert
