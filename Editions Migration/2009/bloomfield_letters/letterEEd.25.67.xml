                    I formerly felt on the subject of the preface and Apendix to the Farmer’s Boy
                    when they were objected to: (the preface as originally written I never heard
                    anything against) and you know that presuming on my correspondence with <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref> I had incurred allmost his
                    displeasure by communicating as much as I dare of the matter. In this present
                    publication I begd the same original friend to see the pieces which had his
                    approbation, through the press. It unfortunately happend that the notes to this
                    vollm did not meet the opinion of people here as to their <hi rend="ital">situation</hi>. I presumed on the friendship of <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref> and ventur’d to tell him. The
                    consequence has been that I am forbidden to write to <ref target="places.html#Troston">Troston</ref>. My last letter informd him that
                    the vollm would now be printed as intended by him, with the notes attachd to
                    each piece. for I had venturd to suggest the putting the notes at the end, which
                        <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref> will not agree to.
                    Remember the despute is not about the <hi rend="ital">exclusion</hi> of the
                    notes, or of <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr <hi rend="ital">Lofft’s</hi></ref><hi rend="ital">name</hi>, no one has thought of such a Thing; but tis whither
                    it be prudent to place notes at the foot of each piece, or at the end. I in a
                    private letter to <ref target="places.html#Troston">Troston</ref> forewarned my
                    once friend of this opinion, which I knew existed, and I have lost him! My wish
                    is then, that you will somehow, as I must not, let <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref> know that this day the
                    publisher has been to the printer’s, and orderd the notes to stand at the end of
                    the Voll. I was not consulted. And if I had, must in truth have answerd that I
                    had brought myself into trouble by the mention of it. As I know that <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref> does not consider the notes
                    in their present shape fit to stand at the end; and he has desired me to strike
                    them and his name out of the work; and as I wish most ardently not to do any
                    such thing; will you ask him to say to you, as he has discarded me, whither he
                    has any particular dislike to the notes appearing at the end in their present
                    shape, and whither he will calmly reflect on it, and say the same in some other
                    shape. You see <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref>; that I
                    am driven to this delema. By <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr
                        Loffts</ref> refusal to alter <hi rend="ital">the place</hi> of the notes I
                    must either suffer them to be printed at the end against his consent; or he will
                    withdraw his name entirely from it. I have acted in the best manner I am able.
                    It is a distressing situation. pray say to this effect, or copy thus far of this
                    letter, and give me news on this head as soon as you can.* <hi rend="ital">You
                        know</hi> that <hi rend="ital">I</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">I</hi> only,
                    prevented the striking out of some of the matter from the Farmers Boy. I found
                    that I must meet what I now meet if I sufferd it. I must now oppose <ref target="people.html#HoodThomas">Hood</ref> to the utmost if I wish to please
                    at <ref target="places.html#Troston">Troston</ref>. this I will not do!! but
                    take my chance, my friend perhaps will turn enemy. ‘But while I keep conscience
