                    could plainly discern the Church at Ridge, but not a glimpse of your mansion: I
                    left it embosom’d in the woods, and felt the warmest wishes for its inhabitants.
                    Rode by a Return’d Chaise comfortably to London; and found all well except <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot">my Charlotte</ref>, who, from a
                    fever and inflammation, had intirely lost her sight, and in which state she has
                    remained until this morning; she can now peep, and is getting better. I had the
                    indescribable joy of meeting <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my
                        Mother</ref> the same evening I return’d. She is as well as years and their
                    accompanying fears and debility will permit, and I hope to keep her and <ref target="people.html#GloverJohn">her partner</ref> here ’till the end of next
                    week or longer.—</p><p rend="indent1"> Amongst the letters which met my eye on my return, was one from
                        <hi rend="ital">your own</hi><ref target="people.html#LloydBakerMary"> Mrs Baker</ref> in her best style and
                    highly flattering with respect to the ‘Good Tidings’ which I have brought into
                    the world. I had your note yesterday, requesting six aditional copies, which I
                    am happy to send together with the pocket microscope which you commissioned me
                    to purchase. And here, as I promised to be faithful, I may add that for the
                    glass micrometer and the little black magnifying glass, they charged me an
                    additional 4/6.—You will observe that to use the black magnifier, take away the
                    three others and screw him into their place <hi rend="ital">alone</hi>, this
                    matter hamper’d me a little so I hold up a light to assist you.—The micrometer
                    you will see is scratch’d into squares so minute that each square form’d by the
                    intersections is but the <hi rend="ital">ten thousandth part</hi> of an inch. I
                    hope you will not feel any disappointment as to its convenience or powers for I
                    know that my manner of speaking of what pleases me, is apt to make others feel a
                    blank. Yet I think your own good sense and your admirable perseverance will
                    enable you to appreciate its merits, and thus I have no doubt as to the pleasure
                    you may derive from so pleasing an insight into nature with so little
                    trouble.—You have three ranges of objects as part of your purchase, but if I
                    might direct your attention I could point out others, as for example—take your
                        <hi rend="ital">pride</hi> (which, by reason that you had no microscope when
                    I was with you I could never see at all) and place it consciously in a good
                    light:—but as such objects to the naked eye are so disgusting I doubt this would
                    give you but little pleasure if you should place the glass so as to find
                    it—secondly you may endeavour with the small spring tweezers to place your <hi rend="ital">affectation</hi> in the focus of the magnifier by which means
                    you will at once determine the power of the instrument, as you will then have an
                    object absolutely never seen before. It may be put to another use still,
                    whenever any man shall approach you with a view of sharing your affection and
                    your heart you may immediately put all the best of his virtues into the
                    insect-box and when you have magnified them to your liking give him your
                    hand.—</p><p rend="indent1"> The kindness of yourself and your most affectionate <ref target="people.html#SharpMrs">Mother</ref> to me, has left on my mind those
                    impressions and feelings which virtue and goodness will and must for ever
                    inspire, I love you both. May your hearts never know sorrow and, and &amp;c
                    &amp;c I was going to flourish, but had better only beg that you will both
                    believe me to be your most sincere and humble servant</p><closer><signed rend="right">Rob Bloomfield.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
