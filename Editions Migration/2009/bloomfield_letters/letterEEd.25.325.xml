                    the widow foul with respect to the share she held in the concern, there seen no
                    doubt of it. He has been very ill, and is still under the watch of a keeper, he
                    being quite deranged. Mrs How buried her eldest son while we lived in town, and
                    the next, a lame lad took his place; he too died a month ago, and the mother
                    never was well after, and died on Sunday last, leaving a consumptive boy, and a
                    girl of Nineteen!</p><p>Poor Old Fisher died last Thursday in a madhouse at Hoxton. She eat most
                    veraciously at Uncles, and was very well, on the Easter Monday; and from that
                    time (11 days) she eat not a morsel more. This is not bad news, for she was
                    utterly unfit to live.</p><p>When Mrs Austin was in town it was to see her son Gardner, who about three years
                    before had run away from Suffolk and had not been heard of. It appears he had
                    begd himself in at a grocer’s shop (two respectable old people) in East
                    Smithfield; from them he again ran away to Briston for a few weeks, but was
                    again taken in by them on his return, and was with them till his mother came to
                    see him die in the foul ward of the London infirmary. He is however recoverd and
                    returnd to his place, strictly watchd.</p><p rend="center">—Diary continued—</p><p rend="center">Thursday</p><p>A very dull day, talk’d much with <ref target="people.html#AnsteadMiss">Miss

                    my account in two or three days. He has printed 5500 copies in <hi rend="ital">new</hi> Editions and I therefore doubt whether I shall have a farthing to
                    recieve. The Iron Bridge of only <hi rend="ital">three arches</hi> is in great
                    forwardness from Queen Stt to the Borough, and another is projected to cross the
                    Thames at Rotherhithe, but what are Bridges to me compared to the good dinner I
