<lb/>
<lb/> WEEK THE FIRST.<lb/> The Imprisonment.</head>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l>My Friends are gone! Harsh on its sullen hinge</l>
					<l>Grates the dread door: the massy bolts respond</l>
					<l>Tremendous to the surly Keeper’s touch.</l>
					<l>The dire keys clang with movement dull and slow</l>
					<l>While their behest the ponderous locks perform:</l>
					<l>And, fastened firm, the object of their care</l>
					<l>Is left to Solitude,--to Sorrow left! </l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> But wherefore fastened? Oh still stronger bonds</l>
					<l>Than bolts, or locks, or doors of molten brass,</l>
					<l>To Solitude and Sorrow would consign </l>
					<l>His anguish’d Soul, and prison him, tho' free!</l>
					<l>For, whither should he fly, or where produce</l>
					<l>In open day, and to the golden Sun,</l>
					<l>His hapless head! whence every laurel torn,</l>
					<l>On his bald brow sits grinning Infamy;</l>
					<l>And all in sportive triumph twines around</l>
					<l>The keen, the stinging Adders of Disgrace!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> Yet what’s Disgrace with Man? or all the stings</l>
					<l>Of pointed Scorn? What the tumultuous voice</l>
					<l>Of erring Multitudes? Or what the shafts </l>
					<l>Of keenest Malice, levell’d from the bow</l>
					<l>Of human Inquisition?—if the God,</l>
					<l>Who knows the heart, looks with complacence down</l>
					<l>Upon the struggling victim; and beholds</l>
					<l>Repentance bursting from the earth-bent eye,</l>
					<l>And Faith’s red cross held closely to the breast!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> Oh Author of my being! of my bliss</l>
					<l>Beneficent Dispenser! wond’rous Power,</l>
					<l>Whose eye, all-searching, thro’ this dreary gloom </l>
					<l>Discerns the deepest secrets of the Soul;</l>
					<l>Assist me!--With thy ray of light divine</l>
					<l>Illumine my dark thoughts; upraise my low;</l>
					<l>And give me Wisdom’s guidance, while I strive</l>
					<l>Impartially to state the dread account,</l>
					<l>And call Myself to Trial! Trial far</l>
					<l>Than That more fearful—tho' how fearful That</l>
					<l>Which trembling late I proved! Oh aid my hand</l>
					<l>To hold the balance equal, and allow</l>
					<l>The few sad moments of remaining life </l>
					<l>To Retrospection useful! Make my End,</l>
					<l>As my first wish (thou know’st the heart) has been,</l>
					<l>To make my whole of Being to my Friends,</l>
					<l>My fellow-pilgrims thro' this world of woe,</l>
					<l>Instructive!—Oh could I conduct but one,</l>
					<l>One only with me, to our Canaan’s rest,</l>
					<l>How could I meet my fate, nor think it hard!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> Not think it hard?—Burst into tears, my Soul;</l>
					<l>Gush every pore of my distracted frame, </l>
					<l>Gush into drops of blood!—But one; save one, </l>
					<l>Or guide to Canaan’s rest?—when all thy Views</l>
					<l>In better days were dedicate alone</l>
					<l>To guide, persuade to that celestial rest</l>
					<l>Souls, which have listened with Devotion’s ear</l>
					<l>To Sion’s songs enchanting from thy lips,</l>
					<l>And tidings sweet of Jesu’s pardoning Love!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> But one, save one?—Oh, what a Rest is this!</l>
					<l>Oh what a Sabbath in this dungeon’s gloom,</l>
					<l>This prison-house, meet emblem of the realm</l>
					<l>Reserv’d for the ungodly! Hark, methinks </l>
					<l>I hear the cheerful melody of Praise</l>
					<l>And penitential Sweetness! <note n="2" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Referring more immediately to the duty of the
							Magdalen-Chapel.</note> ‘Tis the sound,</l>
					<l>The well-known sound, to which my Soul, attun’d</l>
					<l>For year succeeding year, hath hearken’d glad,</l>
					<l>And still with fresh delight: while all my powers</l>
					<l>In blest employ, have prest the saving truths</l>
					<l>Of Grace Divine, and Faith’s all-conquering might,</l>
					<l>On the sure Rock of Ages grounded firm.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Those hours are gone! and here, from Heaven shut out,</l>
					<l>And heavenly works like these, on this lov’d day, </l>
					<l>Reft of my God,--I only hear around</l>
					<l>The dismal clang of chains; the hoarse rough shout</l>
					<l>Of dissonant Imprecation; and the cry</l>
					<l>Of Misery and Vice, in fearful din</l>
					<l>Impetuous mingled; while my frighted mind</l>
					<l>Shrinks back in horror! while the scalding tears,</l>
					<l>Involuntary starting, furrow down</l>
					<l>My sickly cheeks; and whirling thought confus’d</l>
					<l>For giddy moments, scarce allows to know</l>
					<l>Or where, or who, or what a Wretch I am!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Not know?—Alas! too well it strikes my heart,</l>
					<l>Emphatical it speaks; while dungeons, chains,</l>
					<l>And bars and bolts proclaim the mournful truth,</l>
					<l>“Ah what a Wretch thou art! how sunk, how fallen,</l>
					<l>"<note n="3" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Milton. Par. L. B. 5. 540.</note>From what high state of bliss, into what woe!”</l>
					<l>Fallen from the topmost bough that plays in air</l>
					<l>E’en of the tallest cedar; where aloft</l>
					<l>Proud Happiness her tow’ring eyrie built;</l>
					<l>Built, as I dreamt, for ages. Idle dream!</l>
					<l>And yet, amongst the millions of mankind, </l>
					<l>Who sleep like me, how few like me deceiv’d,</l>
					<l>Do not indulge the same fantastic dream!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> Give me the Angel’s Clarion!—Let me sound,</l>
					<l>Loud as the blast which shall awake the dead;</l>
					<l>Oh let me sound, and call the slumberers forth</l>
					<l>To view the vision, which delusive charms;</l>
					<l>To shake the potent incantation off;</l>
					<l>Or ere it burst in ruin on their Souls,</l>
					<l>As it has burst on mine.—Not on my Soul!</l>
					<l>Retract the dread idea: Righteous God! </l>
					<l>Not on my Soul! Oh Thou art gracious all;</l>
					<l>And with an eye of pity from thy Throne</l>
					<l>Of Majesty Supernal, Thou behold’st</l>
					<l>The creatures of thy hand, thy feeble sons,</l>
					<l>Struggling with Sin, with Satan, and the World,</l>
					<l>Their sworn and deadly foes; and, having felt</l>
					<l>In human flesh the trials of our kind,</l>
					<l>Know’st sympathetic how to aid the Tried!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Rock of my hope! the rash, rash phrase forgive;</l>
					<l>Safe is my Soul; nor can it know one fear, </l>
					<l>Grounded on Thee Unchangeable! Thee first,</l>
					<l>Thee last, great Cleanser of all human sin!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> But tho' secure the vessel rides in port,</l>
					<l>Held firm by Faith’s strong anchor,--well it suits</l>
					<l>The mariner to think, by what strange means</l>
					<l>Thro' perils unconceivable he pass’d;</l>
					<l>Thro' rocks, sands, pirates, storms, and boisterous waves,</l>
					<l>And happily obtain’d that port at last.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> On these my thoughts are bent: nor deem it wrong,</l>
					<l>Ministring Angels! whose benignant talk </l>
					<l>Assign’d by Heav’n, is to console Distress,</l>
					<l>And hold up human hearts amidst the toil</l>
					<l>Of human woe! <note n="4" place="foot" resp="Dodd">See Psalm xxxiv. 7. Heb. i. 14.</note> --Blest Spirits, who delight</l>
					<l>In sweet, submissive Resignation’s smile,</l>
					<l>To that high Will you know for ever right;--</l>
					<l>Deem it not wrong, that with a weeping eye,</l>
					<l>Deem it not wrong, that with a bleeding heart,</l>
					<l>I dwell awhile,--unworthiest of my race,--</l>
					<l>On those black rocks, those quick-sands, waves and storms,</l>
					<l>Which in a sea of trouble have engulf’d </l>
					<l>All, all my earthly comforts; and have left</l>
					<l>Me, a poor naked, shipwreck’d, suffering wretch</l>
					<l>On this bleak shore, in this confinement drear;</l>
					<l>At sight of which, in better days, my Soul</l>
					<l>Hath started back with horror! while my Friend,</l>
					<l>My bosom-partner in each hour of pain,</l>
					<l>With antidotes preventive kindly arm’d,</l>
					<l>Trembling for my lov’d health; when christian calls</l>
					<l>And zeal for others welfare, haply brought</l>
					<l>My steps attendant on this Den of Death!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> Oh dismal change! Now, not in friendly sort</l>
					<l>A christian Visitor, to pour the balm</l>
					<l>Of christian comfort in some wretch’s ear,--</l>
					<l>I am that Wretch myself! and want, much want,</l>
					<l>The christian consolation I bestow'd;</l>
					<l>So cheerfully bestow'd! want, want, my God,</l>
					<l>From Thee the mercy, from my fellow-man</l>
					<l>The lenient mercy, which,--great Judge of Hearts,</l>
					<l>To Thee I make the solemn, sad appeal--</l>
					<l>That mercy which Thou know'st my gladsome soul</l>
					<l>Ever sprang forth with transport to impart!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Why then, mysterious Providence! pursued</l>
					<l>With such unfeeling ardour? why pursued</l>
					<l>To death's dread bourn, by men to me unknown!</l>
					<l>Why--Stop the deep question; it o'erwhelms my soul;</l>
					<l>It reels, it staggers!--Earth turns round!--my brain</l>
					<l>Whirls in confusion! my impetuous heart</l>
					<l>Throbs with pulsations not to be restrain'd:</l>
					<l>Why?--where?--Oh Chesterfield! my son, my son!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Nay, talk not of composure! I had thought</l>
					<l>In olden time, that my weak heart was soft,</l>
					<l>And Pity's self might break it.--I had thought</l>
					<l>That marble-eyed Severity would crack</l>
					<l>The slender nerves which guide my reins of sense,</l>
					<l>And give me up to madness. 'Tis not so:</l>
					<l>My heart is callous, and my nerves are tough:</l>
					<l>It will not break; they will not crack; or else</l>
					<l>What more, just Heaven! was wanting to the deed,</l>
					<l>Than to behold--Oh that eternal Night </l>
					<l>Had in that moment screen'd me from myself!--</l>
					<l>My Stanhope to behold, whose filial ear</l>
					<l>Drank pleas'd the lore of wisdom from my tongue.</l>
					<l>My Stanhope to behold!--Ah piercing sight!</l>
					<l>Forget it; --'its distraction:--Speak who can!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">But, I am lost! a criminal adjudg'd!</l>
					<l>A guilty miscreant!--Canst thou think, my Friend,</l>
					<l>Oh Butler,--midst a million faithful found!--</l>
					<l>Oh canst thou think, who know'st, who long hast known</l>
					<l>My inmost soul; oh canst thou think that life, </l>
					<l>From such rude outrage for a moment sav'd,</l>
					<l>And sav'd almost by miracle, <note n="5" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Referring to the case reserved for the solemn decision of the
							twelve Judges; and which gave the prisoner a much longer space than his most sanguine friends could have expected, from
							the complexion of the Process. See the Sessions Paper for Feb. 1777.</note> deserves</l>
					<l>The languid wish, or e'er can be sustain'd?</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">It can--it must! That miracle alone</l>
					<l>To life gives consequence. Oh deem it not</l>
					<l>Presumptuous, that my grateful soul thus rates</l>
					<l>The present high deliverance it hath found;--</l>
					<l>Sole effort of thy wisdom, Sovereign Power,</l>
					<l>Without whose knowledge not a sparrow falls!</l>
					<l>Oh may I cease to live, ere cease to bless </l>
					<l>That interposing Hand, which turn'd aside,--</l>
					<l>Nay, to my life and preservation turn'd</l>
					<l>The fatal blow precipitate, ordain'd</l>
					<l>To level all my little hopes in dust,</l>
					<l>And give me to the grave! Rather, my hand,</l>
					<l>Forget thy cunning! Rather shall my tongue</l>
					<l>In gloomy silence bury every note</l>
					<l>To my glad heart respondent, than I cease</l>
					<l>To dedicate to Him who spar'd my life,</l>
					<l>Each breath, each power, while He vouchsafes to lend </l>
					<l>The precious boon!--To Him be all its praise!</l>
					<l>To Him be all its service! Long or short,</l>
					<l>The gift's the same: to live or die to him,</l>
					<l>Is gain sufficient, everlasting gain:</l>
					<l>And may that gain be mine!--I live, I live!</l>
					<l>Ye hours, ye minutes, bounty of his grace,</l>
					<l>Fleet not away without improvement due:</l>
