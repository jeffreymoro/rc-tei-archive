					<l>Oh, not that thou goest hence--sweet drooping flower,</l>
					<l>Surcharg'd with Sorrow's dew!--Not that thou quitt'st</l>
					<l>This pent and feverish gloom; which beams with light,</l>
					<l>With health, with comfort, by thy presence cheer'd,</l>
					<l>Companion of my life, and of my woes</l>
					<l>Blest soother! Not that thou goest hence to drink</l>
					<l>A purer air, and gather from the breath</l>
					<l>Of balmy Spring new succour, to recruit</l>
					<l>Thy waning health, and aid thee to sustain,</l>
					<l>With more than manly fortitude, thy own </l>
					<l>And my afflictive Trials! Not that here,</l>
					<l>Amidst the glories of this genial day,</l>
					<l>Immur'd, thro' iron bars I peep at Heaven,</l>
					<l>With dim, lack-lustre eye! --Oh, 'tis not this</l>
					<l>That drives the poison'd point of torturous Thought</l>
					<l>Deep to my spring of life! It is not this</l>
					<l>That prostrate lays me weeping in the dust,</l>
					<l>And draws in sobs the life-blood from my heart!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> Well could I bear thy Absence: well, full well;</l>
					<l>Tho' Angel comforts in thy converse smile,</l>
					<l>And make my dungeon Paradise!--Full well</l>
					<l>Could I sustain thro' iron bars to view</l>
					<l>The golden Sun, in bridegroom-majesty</l>
					<l>Taking benignant Nature to his love,</l>
					<l>And decking her with bounties! Well, very well</l>
					<l>Could I forego the delicate delight</l>
					<l>Of tracing nature's germens, as they bud;</l>
					<l>Of viewing Spring's first children, as they rise</l>
					<l>In innocent sweetness, or beneath the thorn</l>
					<l>In rural privacy; or on gay parterre</l>
					<l>More artful, less enchanting!--Well, very well</l>
					<l>Could I forego to listen,--in this house</l>
					<l>Of unremitted din,--and nought complain;</l>
					<l>To listen, as I oft have stood with Thee</l>
					<l>Listening in fond endearment to the voice</l>
					<l>Of Stock-dove, thro' the silence of the wood</l>
					<l>Hoarse murmuring:--Well, oh could I forego</l>
					<l>These innocent, tho' exquisite delights,</l>
					<l>Still new, and to my bosom still attun'd</l>
					<l>In moral, mental melody!--Sweet Spring!</l>
					<l>Well could I bear this sad exile from Thee,</l>
					<l>Nor drop one tear reluctant: for my Soul,</l>
					<l>Strong to superior feelings, soars aloft</l>
					<l>To eminence of misery!--Confin'd</l>
					<l>On this blest day--the Sabbath of my God!</l>
					<l>--Not from his House alone, not from the power</l>
					<l>Of joyful worship with assembling Crouds, <note n="7" place="foot" resp="Dodd">See Psalm lxxxiv.</note>
</l>
					<l>But from the labours once so amply mine,</l>
					<l>The labours of his love. Now, laid aside,</l>
					<l>Cover'd my head with ignominious dust,</l>
					<l>My voice is stopp'd! and, had I e'en the power,</l>
					<l>Strong shame, and stronger grief would to that voice</l>
					<l>Forbid all utterance!--Ah, thrice hapless voice,</l>
					<l>By Heaven's own finger all indulgent tun'd</l>
					<l>To touch the heart, and win th' attentive soul</l>
					<l>To love of Truth Divine: how useless now,</l>
					<l>How dissonant, unstrung!--Like Salem's harps,</l>
					<l>Once fraught with richest harmony of praise,</l>
					<l>Hung in sad silence by Euphrates' stream,</l>
					<l>Upon the mournful willows! There they wept,</l>
					<l>Thy captive People wept--O God!--when Thought</l>
					<l>To bitter memory recall'd the songs,</l>
					<l>The dulcet songs of Sion! Oh blest songs,</l>
					<l>Transporting chorus of united hearts,</l>
					<l>In cheerful music mounting to the praise</l>
					<l>Of Sion's King of Glory!--Oh the joy</l>
					<l>Transcendant, of petitions wing'd aloft</l>
					<l>With fervour irresistible from throngs</l>
					<l>Assembled in thy earthly Courts, dread King</l>
					<l>Of all-dependant Nature!--looking up</l>
					<l>For all to Thee, as do the Servants' eyes</l>
					<l>Up to their fostering Master! Joy of joys,</l>
					<l>Amidst such throng'd assemblies to stand forth,</l>
					<l>To blow the Silver Trumpet of thy Grace;</l>
					<l>The gladsome year of Jubilee to proclaim,</l>
					<l>And offer to the aching Sinner's heart</l>
					<l>Redemption's healing mercies! And methinks</l>
					<l>(--Indulge the pleasing reverie, my soul!</l>
					<l>The waking dream, which in oblivion sweet</l>
					<l>Lulls thy o'erlabour'd sense!) methinks, convey'd</l>
					<l>To Ham's lov'd shades, --dear favourite shades, by Peace</l>
					<l>And pure Religion sanctify'd,--I hear</l>
					<l>The tuneful bells their hallow'd message sound</l>
					<l>To Christian hearts symphonious! Circling Time</l>
					<l>Once more hath happily brought round the day,</l>
					<l>Which calls us to the Temple of our God:</l>
					<l>Then let us haste, in decent neatness clad,</l>
					<l>My cheerful little Household, to his Courts.</l>
					<l>So lov'd, so truly honour'd! There we'll mix</l>
					<l>In meek, ingenuous Deprecation's cry;</l>
					<l>There we'll unite in full Thanksgiving's choir, </l>
					<l>And all the rich melodiousness of praise.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> I feel, I feel the rapture! David's harp</l>
					<l>Concordant with a thousand voices sounds:</l>
					<l>Prayer mounts exulting: Man ascends the skies</l>
					<l>On wings of Angel-fervour! Holy writ</l>
					<l>Or speaks the wonders of Jehovah's power,</l>
					<l>Or tells, in more than mortal majesty,</l>
					<l>The greater wonders of his Love to Man!</l>
					<l>Proofs of that love, see where the mystic Signs,</l>
					<l>High emblems of unutterable Grace,</l>
					<l>Confirm to Man the zeal of Heaven to save,</l>

					<l>Thy Sabbaths with peculiar wisdom shine;</l>
					<l>First and high argument, Creation done,</l>
					<l>Of thy benign solicitude for Man,</l>
					<l>Thy chiefest, favourite creature. Time is thine:</l>
					<l>How just to claim a part, who giv'st the whole!</l>
					<l>But oh, how gracious, to assign that part</l>
					<l>To Man's supreme behoof, his soul's best good;</l>
					<l>His mortal and his mental benefit;</l>
					<l>His body's genial comfort! Savage else,</l>
					<l>Untaught, undisciplin'd, in shaggy pride</l>
					<l>He'd rov'd the wild, amidst the brutes a brute</l>
					<l>Ferocious; to the soft civilities</l>
					<l>Of cultivated life, Religion, Truth,</l>
					<l>A barbarous stranger. To thy Sabbaths then</l>
					<l>All hail, wise Legislator! 'Tis to these</l>
					<l>We owe at once the memory of thy works,</l>
					<l>Thy mighty works of Nature and of Grace;--</l>
					<l>We owe divine Religion; and to these</l>
					<l>The decent comeliness of Social Life.</l>

					<l>--Religion, sainted Pilgrim,--shelter safe,</l>
					<l>Or honourable greeting;--thro' the land,</l>
					<l>If led by high and low, in giddy dance, </l>
					<l>Mad Profanation on the sacred day</l>
					<l>Of God's appointed rest, her revel-rout</l>
					<l>Insulting heads, and leaves the Temple void?</l>
					<l>--Oh, my lov'd Country! oh, ye thoughtless Great,</l>
					<l>Intoxicate with draughts, that opium-like</l>
					<l>For transient moments stupefy the mind,</l>
					<l>To wake in horrors, and confusion wild!--</l>

					<l>Ah me,--thy day of duty is declin'd!</l>
					<l>Thou, rather, to the quick probe thine own wounds;</l>

					<l>"Delight in thy lov'd Sabbaths!" Well Thou know'st--</l>
					<l>For Thou know'st all things,--that the cheerful sound</l>
					<l>Of that blest day's return, for circling weeks,</l>
					<l>For months, for years, for more than thrice seven years,</l>
					<l>Was music to my heart! My feet rejoic'd</l>
					<l>To bear me to thy Temples, haply fraught</l>
					<l>With Comfort's tidings; with thy Gospel's truth,</l>
					<l>The Gospel of thy Peace! Oh, well Thou know'st,</l>
					<l>Who knowest all things, with what welcome toil,</l>
					<l>What pleasing assiduity I search'd</l>
					<l>Thy heavenly Word, to learn thy heavenly Will;</l>
					<l>That faithful I might minister its truth,</l>
					<l>And of the high Commission nought keep back</l>
					<l>From the great Congregation! <note n="8" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Psalm xl. ver. 10.</note> Well thou know'st,</l>
					<l>--Sole, sacred witness of my private hours,--</l>

					<l>The humble efforts of my trembling pen;</l>
					<l>My best, weak efforts in my Master's cause;</l>
					<l>Weak as the feather 'gainst the giant's shield,</l>

					<l>How, anxious to improve in every grace,</l>
					<l>That best to Man's attention might commend</l>
					<l>Th' important message, studious I applied</l>
					<l>My feeble talents to the holy art</l>
					<l>Of 'suasive Elocution; emulous</l>
					<l>Of every acquisition which might clothe</l>
					<l>In purest dignity the purest work,</l>
					<l>The first, the highest office man can bear;</l>
					<l>"The Messenger of God!" And well Thou know'st,</l>
					<l>--For all the work, as all the praise is Thine--</l>
					<l>What sweet success accompanied the toil:</l>
					<l>What harvests bless'd the seed-time! Well thou know'st,</l>
					<l>With what triumphant gladness my rapt Soul</l>
					<l>Wrought in the vineyard! how it thankful bore</l>
					<l>The noon-day's heat, the evening's chilly frost,</l>
					<l>Exulting in its much-lov'd Master's cause</l>
					<l>To spend, and to be spent! and bring it home</l>
					<l>From triple labours of the well-toil'd day,</l>
