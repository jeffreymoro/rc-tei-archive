            <p class="indent1">Here I am at last, after twelve weeks absence, &amp; a journey of nearly 900 miles. We
               got home on Monday, &amp; found every thing well. Never was a more fortunate journey,
               – we had only two wet days during the whole time, which was while we were with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</a>, – &amp; we never met with accident let or hindrance of any kind.</p>
