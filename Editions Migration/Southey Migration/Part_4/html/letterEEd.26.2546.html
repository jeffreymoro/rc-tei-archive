                  </div> The delay has not been from idleness, but from over-occupation; and in some respects
                  it has been fortunate, for I understand Perring’s plans have now been so far adopted
                  as to satisfy him, and a most essential step has been taken towards improving the
                  condition of the men, by setting them free after twenty-one years of service, with
                  a fair pension for life: a measure which I earnestly called for some years ago.

                           announced publicly in January 1815. Southey had advocated similar ideas in the Quarterly

                           than The Corsair (1814), the review expressed: ‘regret that Lord Byron should not

                           ascribed to an ideal personage, such as Childe Harold, the same language might be
                           tolerated, as dreadfully appropriate to the character: but when the poet in his own

                  </div> But there is a radical and characteristic fault in most of his tales, which has not
                  been sufficiently exposed: the characters which he describes are impossible; no such
                  ever have existed, or ever can exist. It is perfectly absurd to suppose that anything
                  like the strong, abiding, soul-rooted feeling of love can be found in a buccaneer
                  – setting all the other unaccountable parts of the story out of the question. His
                  characters are made up of contradictions; and because the parts are all powerfully
                  drawn, common readers never pause to ask themselves whether they could possibly cohere.
                  Do not imagine that I blame him for portraying <span class="ital">mixed</span> characters – there is alloy enough in the best of us, God knows! – I condemn him for
                  making an impossible mixture. The real cause of this monstrosity is sufficiently obvious.
                  Like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontgomeryJames">Montgomery</a>, he has been painting from the looking-glass; but he had not so good an original,
                  and, unlike <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontgomeryJames">Montgomery</a>, his day-dreams have been of evil. His fancy has brooded upon his own heart, and,
                  cameleon-like, taken its colour from thence: unhappily, the colour is a dark one.
                  And being conscious that he is in many of his feelings, and most or all of his opinions
                  (certainly in all that relates to the highest and holiest subjects), a sort of outlaw
                  in the world, he makes his heroes bid defiance to all positive law, and transfers
                  to them all his own unhappy principles. But men who act like his characters are men
                  not of <span class="ital">bad</span> principles, but of <span class="ital">no</span> principles; not of <span class="ital">diseased</span> feelings, but of <span class="ital">callous</span> ones. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Byron">Lord B.</a> has just married a woman who is said to be one of the loveliest and most accomplished

                  for some time to come, there are abundant seeds of war left to germinate. Italy ought
                  to have been formed into one great state. I would rather have seen it a federal republic

                  most in fashion, I would gladly have seen it a kingdom, and given to anybody – who
                  had not actually deserved the gallows. Had Buonaparte been a wise man, he would, at
                  the Peace of Amiens, have restored the Bourbons, and taken Italy for himself; but
