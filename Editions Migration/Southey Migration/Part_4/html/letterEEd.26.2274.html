               <p><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George Fricker</a> died on Thursday noon, &amp; was buried yesterday. Had <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KingJohn">Rex</a> been here I should have wished the body to be opened, as the case was a remarkable
                  one. He has not died of consumption; for he never expectorated pus, &amp; indeed for the
                  last fortnight the cough was troublesome, – neither were there any night sweats, or
                  any diarrhœa: I believe I mentioned in my last that this symptom had appeared, – but <span class="strikethrough">I was misinformed</span> it was a mistake. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> thinks those ducts must have been obliterated which convey nutriment to the system
                  so that his food did not nourish him – very likely I am making his opinion appear
                  like ignorance by putting it in my own words; if so the ignorance is mine not his.
                  The decay was more rapid than any which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> ever before witnessed, &amp; he was more like a skeleton before his death than any thing
                  I ever saw alive, but he suffered no pain &amp; was utterly unconscious of danger. Latterly
                  he was seldom sensible &amp; went off at last without a struggle. His sisters

                  with M<sup>r</sup> Lunell in that silly manner,

                           a young woman, but the charges seem to have been dropped; see Southey to Charles Danvers,
                           7 October 1812 (Letter 2154) and 29 October 1812 (Letter 2165).</span></div>
                  </div> for otherwise he would have died in lodgings, with all <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> discomforts &amp; anxieties about his expences, &amp; the whole burden of attending him would
                  have fallen upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Frickerfamily">Eliza</a>. The expence too which would <span class="strikethrough">then</span> have fallen upon me, would have been heavy. His sisters have now done their duty to
                  the utmost &amp; to the last, – &amp; he had every thing which he could possibly want or wish
                  for, that it was possible to procure.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I shall be in London in about three weeks, &amp; before I leave town will send you the
               10£ you advanced him for me, &amp; likewise what little also I may be in your debt. This
               indeed would have been done some time ago if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John Ballantyne</a> had not stopt payment with me, declaring that he is already in advance, – when I
               have in reality 225£ due. How this will end I know not, but shrewdly apprehend that
               he will play the rogue with me, till bankruptcy puts an end to his tricks &amp; his embarassments
               together.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I &amp; my summer cold go on as usual; except however <span class="strikethrough">thex</span> as far as the nose is concerned I am in good health &amp; now that the house is beginning
               to resume its usual order, in good spirits &amp; activity. Hitherto as you may suppose
               I have been sadly disjointed. Latterly indeed my study was given up to the women for
               poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</a> lay in the wing room, &amp; here they watched him day &amp; night with both doors open. To
