            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your letter has too long lain unanswered; an apparent neglect which you will easily
                  account for, and which I trust you will be more ready to excuse in me than I am to
                  excuse in myself. I should blame myself the more if all which I could possibly say
                  upon the subject of your disappointment at Cambridge must not already and often have
                  occurred to your own reflections; as, for instance, that your purpose in going to
                  the University was not to obtain college honours (things in themselves not less mischievously
                  than preposterously overrated), but to qualify yourself for one of the most useful
                  and honourable offices in society, that of a minister of the Church of England; and
                  that this end having been obtained, it is neither right nor reasonable to repine if
                  you have failed in gaining a collateral object of unmeasurably less importance.

                           have been disappointed that he did not win any college prizes, as these would have
                           helped pay his fees and aided his future career prospects in the Church of England.</span></div>
                  </div> I am sure you have felt and reasoned thus; and you well know that the opinion which
                  I express respecting University distinction is not advanced for the present purpose,
                  but is that which I have uniformly entertained upon the subject. Go cheerfully forward,

                  fondness for poetry as a trifling or silly pursuit, and express sometimes a hope that
                  he had done with it. It will be better to communicate my wish to the family, and learn

                  The fever clearly seems to have differed in some respects from any which had formerly

                  the cause is so little known, or rather so entirely unknown, that all precautions
