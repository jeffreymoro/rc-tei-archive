                  as a matter of speculation, but as a recompence for having made the reputation of
                  the work proves to be worth nothing, (at least according to all appearance;) – &amp; not
                  contented with having thus deluded me of 209 £, they are at this time attempting to
                  with hold from me about 225 £ more, due upon the forthcoming volume, upon the plea
                  of loss upon my twelfth share. I have brought up all the necessary papers with me
