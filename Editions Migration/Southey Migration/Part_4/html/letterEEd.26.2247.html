               private characters has become a regular trade in England, and miscreants of one description
               take to it just as miscreants of another to the more dangerous, but not more nefarious,

Both magazines depended for their sales on the virulence of their attacks
               on public figures. <em>The Satirist</em>, 2 (1808), 61, had described Southey as guilty of ‘perpetual and inimitable absurdity’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in his view, abusing the liberty of the press and thus provoking unrest amongst the
               poor. He had compared them to the journalists and revolutionaries Jacques Hébert (1757–1794),
               Jean-Paul Marat (1743–1793) and the radical politician Pierre Gaspard Chaumette (1763–1794).
               All three had met violent ends. Southey’s article had not mentioned Hunt by name,
               but it did draw clear parallels between revolutionary France and contemporary Britain.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7.. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey was being disingenuous. He had not actually named Hunt, but his target was
               clear. Southey had quoted and dismissed the <em>Examiner</em>’s observations on the ‘crisis in Portugal’ (<em>Examiner</em>, 9 (20 January 1811), 39), <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</em>, 4.1 (1813), 245–246. That said, Hunt came off lightly compared to Cobbett, who,
               in the same chapter was labelled a ‘demagogue’ and accused of ‘virulent and malicious
               misrepresentation’, Ibid., 246.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               for publishing an article condemning military flogging (<em>Examiner</em>, 8 (2 September 1810), 557–558). Although the <em>Examiner</em> did not mention Coleridge by name, the concluding paragraph made it clear that he
               was the target: ‘Retire … to your patrons and a bottle; and there, calling for white
               handkerchiefs and pouring out libations to the departed <span class="ital">Friend</span>, lament over the shocking increase of humanity and public spirit, so fatal to selfishness
               and public corruption’, <em>Examiner</em>, 9 (3 March 1811), 131. The next issue published, at Coleridge’s request, a note
               that denied his authorship of the offending article, <em>Examiner</em>, 9 (10 March 1811), 154.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               to work upon, will make a man exceedingly didactic; … he will sometimes deceive his
               very self into a notion that he is a worthy person, and attribute his bad habits to
               a vague sort of destiny that besets him, and renders him more to be pitied than blamed.
               The most didactic and talkative person of the day appears to be one of this description,
               and wants nothing but his supply of brandy and water to be set a-doling about the
