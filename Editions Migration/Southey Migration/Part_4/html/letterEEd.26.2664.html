                  of twelve hours from Calais. Our route was from Ghent to Courtreys, Menin, Ypres &amp;
                  Dunkirk. We leave this place as soon as the Custom House can be got thro, &amp; we have
                  agreed to sleep tomorrow night at the house of our fellow-travellers the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VardonMr">Vardens</a> at Greenwich.
