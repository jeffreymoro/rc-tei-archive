                  </div> in point of high finishing, I can truly say that I think it a versification of a better
                  kind – flowing more naturally, less monotonous and therefore less wearying. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Charles</a> I perceive has marked several passages in my copy as imperfect rhymes, – I cannot
                  consider them as blemishes; it is from the French that our critics have learnt to
                  condemn them, and a comparison of their theory of verse with that of other countries
                  would prove that the objection proceeds rather from obtuseness of ear than from delicacy.
                  The only thing I should object to in your lines is when you occasionally pronounce
                  what use has made a mute syllable, for instance:</p>

                  </div> The Odyssey is a delightful poem, and the most delightful parts of it are yet to come.
                  And tho’ there is a richness and fulness in the Greek hexameter which no English metre
                  can imitate (and least of all the couplet, which I hold to be the very worst possible
                  metre for narration) yet your version represents Homer more faithfully than either
                  Pope or Cowper:
