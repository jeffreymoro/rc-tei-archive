               <p>You will have heard from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Mess<sup>rs</sup> Longman</a> respecting the new editions of Madoc &amp; Roderick.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A fourth edition of Madoc appeared in 1815 and a third of Roderick, the Last of the
                           Goths in 1816.</span></div>
                  </div> Of the latter I cannot send a copy because the second edition

                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The second edition of Roderick had been published earlier in 1815.</span></div>
                  </div> has not yet reached me; – do you therefore procure one &amp; print from it; &amp; I will,
                  when I receive one, inform you by letter of any errors which may be to be avoided.
                  There is one unavoidable source of error, – when a paragraph ends at the bottom of
                  a page, &amp; the book is reprinted in a different form, the compositor not perceiving
                  the pause which the subject requires &lt;naturally&gt; connects it with the following one.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">A copy of Madoc I send off this day. I have expunged an infinite number of commas,
               which we use so redundantly in <span class="strikethrough">the</span> modern printing as &lt;to&gt; create a difficulty in punctuation.</p>
            <p class="indent1">There is one general correction to which I wish the compositor would attend: – that
               of every where restoring the <span class="ital">e</span> to the participle past, &amp; the third person singular. We never omit it in prose, tho
               in prose it is never pronounced. Where it is to be pronounced in verse it may be indicated
               to the reader by a mark thus ë, <span class="ital">ordained</span> – for instance upon the common pronunciation, or if the third syllable be pronounced,
               <span class="ital">ordainëd</span>.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The proofs of Madoc I wish to see. Remember that they must be uncut. The last sheets
               which you sent me were uncut, but tho &lt;this&gt; was manifest in the folding, &amp; tho “Single
               Proof Sheet” was written upon them, they were charged double at your Post Office.
               To insist upon having the sheet cut is both illiberal &amp; unusual: – but when the letter
               of the law has been observed, it is provoking to have the trouble of recovering an
               overcharge, which proceeds rather from incivility than mistake.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I look every post for the Titles &amp;c to the Poems.
