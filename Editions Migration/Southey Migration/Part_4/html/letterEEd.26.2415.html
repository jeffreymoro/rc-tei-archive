                  </div> . . . They contain much to repay a perusal, and a man need not be as tolerant as I
                  am to excuse a little that he may disapprove, for the sake of a great deal which deserves
                  his approbation.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Like all other journals, it sins sometimes on the side of severity, and drags an unhappy
               author into notice for the mere purpose of disgracing him. If it professed to notice
               every work which comes out, it would, of course, be proper to condemn all that deserved
               condemnation; but even in that case, it is condemnation enough to be merely noticed
               without praise. Beyond this, severity is unnecessary (except where there be some especial
               demerit), and therefore, I think, not to be justified. . . .</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Faults of this kind will never injure the sale of the journal, for even in that portion
                  of the public for whom it is more particularly designed, the more amusing it is the
                  better it will be received.

                           Bible Society. The Evangelical Magazine (1793–1904) looked to a similar audience,
                           but lacked the Eclectic’s broad view of literature, focusing more on missionary endeavours
                           and religious publications.</span></div>
                  </div> In this point of view I think there are <span class="ital">some</span> theological articles which would have been better adapted to the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em>. Professing to be eclectic, it is certainly not necessary to notice works which have
                  no other merit than that of being orthodox according to the creed of the <em>Review</em>. Of divinity, I should think that one article for controversy and one for edification
                  would be a sufficient proportion for each number – speaking entirely with reference
                  to the interests of the publisher. The publisher also should write more in it himself.</p>

               <p>In the October number, page 368, I was pleased to see that you had said of artists
                  exactly what I had said of men – that, to judge their works fairly, we must look at
                  them in the same light in which they were considered by the authors. You will find
                  my sentence, with its wide application, in the reviewal of Bogue and Bennet, page

                           Eclectic Review, 9 (October 1813) argued: ‘it is necessary, in order to obtain a fair
                           estimate of the artist’s powers, or to appreciate his success, that his readers understand
                           his intentions – the effect he designed, and the object to which this effect was to
                           be subservient’. Southey compares this with his own assessment of David Bogue (1750–1825;
                           DNB) and James Bennet (1774–1862; DNB), The History of Dissenters, from the Revolution

                  </div> There is another remark of yours which shows that your thoughts and mine have been
                  travelling in the same direction; it is when you ask whether the character of a poem
                  determines its form, or the form determines its character. No man but a poet could
                  have asked the question. I find the metre influences the style so materially, that
                  nothing ever embarasses me so much as the choice of the mould in which a new poem
                  shall be cast. The only thing of which experience has made me certain is, that blank
                  verse, of all measures the easiest to a beginner, is the most difficult to a proficient
                  in versification.</p>

                  as an ode a poem to which I affixed a generic name purposely, that an ode might not
                  be expected.

                  </div> The Greeks, on such an occasion, would have had an oration; our custom required something
                  in verse. The circumstances and the subject therefore led me to compose an oration
                  in verse, to which the running strain of thanksgiving gives the unity which is required
                  in a poem. I am at work upon an epithalamium for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WalesCharlottePrincess">the Princess’s</a> marriage, which in its moral tone may redeem that class of compositions from their

                           his endeavours: ‘Here new channels of benevolence may be opened; and if the smiles
                           of Heaven descend on the undertaking, Bigotry may receive a more fatal wound’.</span></div>
                  </div> Indeed, this is very rash, and dreadfully ill timed. The partisans of the Inquisition
                  in Spain have by no means given up the hope of recovering the ground which they have
                  lost. In Portugal, on the other hand, those persons who know the evil which that devilish
                  institution has brought upon their country, are endeavouring silently to destroy its
                  power. I know of nothing which would tend so materially to defeat the efforts of the
                  good in one country, and to assist the persecuting party in the other, as the appearance
                  of this heretical missionary. He himself may be thrown into prison (which no doubt
                  he would cheerfully encounter) – this is a light evil; but he may bring his own country
                  into most unpleasant difficulties with the Spanish Government; and I am perfectly
                  sure that he must impede the good work which he is desirous of accelerating. God knows,
                  there never was a man who felt a more rooted abhorrence than I do for the abominations
                  of Popery, or who longs more earnestly to see the Bible brought into action against
                  them. But this mode of proceeding is madness. The only way to get the Bible into use
                  there is through the agency of persons of their own religion and their own country.
                  There are some priests who are really pious enough to do it. An Englishman settled
                  in Spain might have an edition of the licensed Spanish Bible printed there, and distribute
                  it through such persons. There is no other way in which we could interfere safely,
                  and even this might involve him in some difficulties. If you should ever, as you talked
                  of, embark in a Magazine, let it be a part of your plan to collect for the missionary
                  societies as much previous information as can be found to direct their future or assist
                  their present establishments. At this time, a paper upon the state of religion in
                  the Peninsula, written with proper knowledge of the subject, might perhaps prevent
                  this very injurious and mischievous experiment.</p>
