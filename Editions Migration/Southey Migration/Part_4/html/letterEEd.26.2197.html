            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Many happy new years to you, and may those which are to come prove more favourable
                  to you in worldly concerns than those which are past! I have been somewhat unwell
                  this Christmas; first with a cold, then with a sudden and unaccountable sickness,
                  which, however, has not returned, and I now hope I have been physicked into tolerable
                  order. The young ones are going on well: little <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</a> thrives, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">your god-daughter</a> is old enough to figure at a Christmas dance, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> will very soon be perfect in the regular Greek verb. A Testament is to come for him
                  in my next parcel, and we shall begin upon it as soon as it arrives. No child ever
                  promised better, morally and intellectually. He is very quick of comprehension, retentive,
                  observant, diligent, and as fond of a book and as impatient of idleness as I am. Would
                  that I were as well satisfied with his bodily health; but in spite of activity and
                  bodily hilarity, he is pale and puny: just that kind of child of whom old women would
                  say that he is too clever to live. Old women’s notions are not often so well founded
                  as this; and having this apprehension before my eyes, the uncertainty of human happiness
                  never comes home to my heart so deeply as when I look at him. God’s will be done!
                  I must sow the seed as carefully as if I were sure that the harvest would ripen. My
                  two others are the most perfect contrast you ever saw. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</a>, whom I call Queen Henry the Eighth, from her likeness to King Bluebeard,

                  Shall I never show you this little flock of mine? I have seen almost every one of
                  my friends here except you, than whom none would be more joyfully welcomed.</p>

                  injure the sale. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> has most probably ordered a large impression, calculating upon its going off as a
                  midshipman’s manual, which design is thus prevented. If, however, this impression
                  can pass off, I shall have no fear of its answering his purpose when printed in a
                  suitable form; for though the subject was not of my own choice, and might be reasonably
                  thought to be out of my proper line, I have satisfied myself in the execution far
                  more than I could have expected to do. The second sheet of the second volume is now
                  before me. I have just finished the battle of Copenhagen,

                  </div> which makes an impressive narrative. Two chapters more will complete it, and I hope
                  to send you the book by the beginning of March. My labour with it will be completed
                  much before that time, probably in ten days or a fortnight; and then the time which
                  it now occupies will be devoted to the <span class="ital">indigesta moles</span> of Mr. Walpole’s papers.

                  </div> I find the day too short for the employment which it brings; however, if I cannot

                  I get through it all. My poem

                  </div> comes on well; about 2700 lines are written; the probable extent is 5000; but the
                  last half is like going down hill, – the difficulty is over, and your progress accelerates
                  itself. The poem is of a perfectly original character. What its success may be I cannot
