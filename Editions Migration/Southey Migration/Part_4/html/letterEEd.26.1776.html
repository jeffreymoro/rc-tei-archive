                  </div> But on no point was I ever more clearly &amp; coolly satisfied that my opinion was in
                  the strictest sense of the word impartial. An opinion prevails that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Wordsworth</a> &amp; I are in close habits of intimacy, – &amp; the notion of a literary connection <span class="strikethrough">is a</span> existing between us is so prevalent, that each of us is made partner in whatever censure
                  or satire is levelled at the other. It is very likely that from this supposed intimacy
                  you may <span class="strikethrough">hi</span> have suspected my praise of his pamphlett to have proceeded from &lt;feelings of&gt; personal
                  friendship. But the truth <span class="strikethrough">t</span> is that this general opinion is altogether erroneous, founded upon an intimacy between
                  him &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">M<sup>r</sup> Coleridge</a>, – that when Criticasters <span class="strikethrough">x</span> began to sneer at us as joint founders of a new school of poetry, I had not seen him
                  more than twice, – &amp; that highly as I estimate his talents both as a poet &amp; a political
                  philosopher, there never has existed, &amp; I believe never will, any such intercourse
                  between us as could in any degree induce me to overvalue his productions.</p>
