                  much he was gratified by it, – by the full &amp; liberal praise which it awarded him,
                  – by the ability &amp; discrimination which were shown, but above all by the spirit which
                  it breathed, which is so unlike the prevailing tone of criticism.

                           afford readers ‘such familiar and complete access’ to the ‘human heart’ (22) and described
                           the poem as a work that ‘will live’ (39). It did, however, express reservations about
                           the poem’s lack of religious sentiment: ‘The love of Nature is the purest, the most
                           sublime, and the sweetest emotion of the mind … yet the love of Nature alone cannot

               <p>I think your objection to the warlike part of Rodericks character is not well founded;

                  tho wars are most unquestionably forbidden by the Gospel, there are wars of that description
                  in which it is allowable to take part, – unless we suppose that even self-defence
                  is unlawful, which is an absurdity.

                           He had also reviewed it for the Eclectic Review, 3 (April 1815), 352–368; and expressed
                           particular concern about Roderick’s invocation of God to justify his killing of others:
                           ‘the vengeance pursued by him [Roderick], is vengeance against infidels, traitors
                           and usurpers. Be it so; but still let the patriot fight, and the avenger slay, in
                           any name, except in the name of Him, whose “kingdom is not of this world”’ (361).</span></div>
