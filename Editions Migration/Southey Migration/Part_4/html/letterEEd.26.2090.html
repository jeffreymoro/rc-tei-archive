                  </div> Our meeting was mutually serviceable, – I reformed his life, &amp; he disposed me toward

                  applicable against the Socinian scheme. He remained three or four weeks at Oxford,
                  &amp; we planned a Utopia of our own, to be founded in the wilds of America upon the basis
                  of common property, – each labouring for all, – a Pantisocracy, – a republic of reason

            <p class="indent1">For this dream I gave up every other prospect. How painfully &amp; slowly I was awakened
               from it, this is not the time to say, for my purpose is but to show you where I have
               been upon my Pilgrims Progress, &amp; how far I have advanced upon the way. I became a
               Socinian from the reasonableness of the scheme, &amp; still more so because I was shocked
               by the consequences of irreligion, such as they were seen in my daily intercourse
               with sceptics, unbelievers &amp; atheists. I remained in it till I learnt &amp; felt <span class="strikethrough">that</span> how vain it is to build up a religion wholly upon historical proofs, – I learnt that
               religion could never be a living &amp; quickening principle, if <span class="strikethrough">it was</span> &lt;we only assented to it as&gt; a mere act of the understanding. Something more was necessary,
               – an operation of Grace – a manifestation of the Spirit – an inward revelation, –
               a recognition of revealed truth. This drew me towards Quakerism, – yet with too clear
               a perception of the errors &amp; follies of the Quakers to be wholly in union with them.
               – In what has <span class="strikethrough">it</span> &lt;all this&gt; ended <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> you will ask? – that I am still what in old times was called a <span class="ital">Seeker</span>, – a sheep without a fold, but not without a Shepherd; – clinging to all that Christ
               has clearly taught, – but shrinking from all attempts at defining by articles of faith
               those points which the Gospels have left indefinite. I am of no visible Church, –
               but assuredly I feel myself in the communion of Saints.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Hence perhaps it is that wherever I find love &amp; faith &amp; devotement <span class="strikethrough">whether it be in</span> there I am, so far, in communion; I look to those points which we hold in common,

                  to the differences of belief, – on the contrary no man has a stronger conviction of
                  the fatal consequences which result from the corruptions of Christianity. You have
