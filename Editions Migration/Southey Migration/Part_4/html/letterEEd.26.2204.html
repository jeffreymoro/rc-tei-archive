               <div class="l">As one whose soul impatiently endur d</div>

               <div class="l">Curbing his spirit made him yet awhile</div>
               <div class="l">Sustain the weight of bondage. Here alone</div>
               <div class="l">Of all the Gothic baronage the Moors</div>
               <div class="l">Watchd with regard of wary policy,</div>
               <div class="l">Knowing his powerful name, his noble mind,</div>
               <div class="l">And how in him the old Iberian blood</div>
               <div class="l">Of royal &amp; remotest ancestry,</div>
               <div class="l">From undisputed source, flowd undefiled;</div>
               <div class="l">His mother’s after guilt attaining not</div>

               <div class="l">He too of Chindasuintho’s regal line</div>
               <div class="l">Sole remnant now, drew after him the love</div>
               <div class="l">Of all true Goths, uniting in himself</div>
               <div class="l">Thus by this double right the general heart</div>
               <div class="l">Of Spain. For this the renegade crew,</div>
               <div class="l">Wretches in whom their conscious guilt &amp; fear</div>
               <div class="l">Engendered cruellest hatred, still advised</div>
               <div class="l">The extinction of Pelayo’s house: but most,</div>
               <div class="l">The apostate Prelate, in iniquity</div>
               <div class="l">Witizas genuine brother as in blood,</div>
               <div class="l">Orpas, pursued his life. He never ceas’d</div>
               <div class="l">With busy zeal, true traitor, to infuse</div>
               <div class="l">His deadly rancour in the Moorish Chiefs;</div>
               <div class="l">Their only danger, ever he observed,</div>
               <div class="l">Was from Pelayo; root his lineage out</div>
               <div class="l">The Caliphs empire then would be secure,</div>
               <div class="l">And universal Spain, all hope of change</div>
               <div class="l">Being lost, receive the Prophets conquering law.</div>
               <div class="l">Then did the Archvillain urge the Moor at once</div>
               <div class="l">To cut off future perils, telling him</div>
               <div class="l">Death was a trusty keeper, &amp; that none</div>

               <div class="l">Their sordid souls, saw thro the flimsy show</div>
               <div class="l">Of policy with which they sought to cloak</div>
               <div class="l"><span class="strikethrough">Of</span> Old enmity, &amp; selfish sins: he scornd</div>
               <div class="l">To let their private purposes incline</div>
               <div class="l">His counsels; &amp; believing, Spain subdued:</div>
               <div class="l">Smiled in the pride of power &amp; victory,</div>
               <div class="l">Disdainful at the thought of farther strife.</div>
               <div class="l">Howbeit he held Pelayo at his court,</div>
               <div class="l">And told him that until his country men</div>
               <div class="l">Submissively should lay their weapons down,</div>
               <div class="l">He from his children &amp; paternal hearth</div>
               <div class="l">Apart <span class="strikethrough">fro</span> must dwell, nor hope to see again</div>
               <div class="l">His native mountains &amp; their vales beloved,</div>
               <div class="l">Till all the Austrian &amp; Cantabrian Hills</div>
               <div class="l">Had bowed before the Caliph: Cordoba</div>
               <div class="l">Must be his nightly prison till that hour</div>
               <div class="l">This might be special favour from the Moor</div>
               <div class="l">Askd &amp; vouchsafd, he past without the walls,</div>
               <div class="l">Keeping his yearly vigil; on this night</div>
               <div class="l">Therefore the princely Spaniard could not fly,</div>
               <div class="l">Being thus in strongest bonds by honour held.</div>
               <div class="l">Nor would he by his own escape expose</div>
               <div class="l">To stricter bondage, or belike to death</div>
               <div class="l">Count Pedro’s son: the ancient enmity</div>
               <div class="l">Of rival houses from Pelayo’s heart</div>
               <div class="l">Had, like a thing forgotten, past away.</div>
               <div class="l">He pitied child &amp; parent, separated</div>
               <div class="l">By the stern mandate of unfeeling power,</div>
               <div class="l">And almost with a fathers eyes beheld</div>
               <div class="l">The boy, his fellow in captivity.</div>
               <div class="l">For young Alphonso was in truth an heir</div>
               <div class="l">Of natures largest patrimony; rich </div>
               <div class="l">In form &amp; feature, growing strength of limb,</div>
               <div class="l">A gentle heart, a soul affectionate,</div>
               <div class="l">A joyous spirit filld with generous thoughts,</div>
               <div class="l">And genius heightening &amp; ennobling all.</div>
               <div class="l">The blossom of all manly virtues made</div>
               <div class="l">His boyhood beautiful. Shield, gracious Heaven, –</div>
               <div class="l">In this ungenial season perilous,</div>
               <div class="l">(Thus would Pelayo often breathe in prayer</div>
               <div class="l">The aspirations of prophetic hope)</div>
               <div class="l">Shield the young blooming tree, kind Heaven, &amp; let</div>
               <div class="l">This goodly promise for thy people’s sake</div>
               <div class="l">Yield its abundant fruitage!</div>
               <div class="l">When the Prince,</div>
               <div class="l">With hope &amp; fear, &amp; grief &amp; shame disturbd,</div>
               <div class="l">And sad remembrance, &amp; the shadowy light</div>
               <div class="l">Of days before him, thronging as in dreams,</div>
               <div class="l">Whose quick succession filld &amp; overpowerd</div>
               <div class="l">Awhile, the unresisting faculty;</div>
               <div class="l">Could in the calm of troubled thoughts subued</div>
               <div class="l">Seek in his heart for counsel; his first care</div>
               <div class="l">Was for the boy; how best they might evade</div>
               <div class="l">The Moor, &amp; renegades more watchful eye,</div>
               <div class="l">And leaving in some unsuspicious guise</div>
               <div class="l">The city, thro unfrequented track</div>
               <div class="l">Safeliest pursue with speed their dangerous way</div>
               <div class="l">Consumed in cares like these the fleeting hours</div>
               <div class="l">Went by; the lamps &amp; tapers now grew pale,</div>
               <div class="l">And thro the eastern window slanting fell</div>
               <div class="l">The roseate ray of morn. Within those wells</div>
               <div class="l">Returning day restored no chearful sounds</div>
               <div class="l"><span class="strikethrough">Of</span> &lt;Or&gt; joyous motions, of awakening life;</div>
               <div class="l">But in the stream of light the speckled motes,</div>
               <div class="l">As if in mimickry of insect play</div>
               <div class="l">Floated with mazy movement. Sloping down</div>
               <div class="l">Over the altar past the pillar’d beam,</div>
               <div class="l">And rested on the sinful womans grave,</div>
               <div class="l">As if it entered there, a light from Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">So be it, cried Pelayo, even so!</div>
               <div class="l">As in a momentary interval,</div>
               <div class="l">(When thought expelling thought, had left his mind</div>
               <div class="l">Open &amp; passive to the influxes</div>

               <div class="l">So be it, heavenly Father, even so!</div>
               <div class="l">Thus may thy vivifying mercy shed</div>
               <div class="l">Forgiveness there; for let not thou the groans</div>
               <div class="l">Of dying penitence, nor my bitter prayers</div>

               <div class="l">And thou poor soul, who in the dolorous house</div>
               <div class="l">Of weeping &amp; of pain, dost look to me</div>
               <div class="l">To shorten &amp; assuage thy penal term,</div>
               <div class="l">Pardon me that these hours in other thought</div>

               <div class="l">Henceforth, in woods &amp; mountain fastnesses,</div>
               <div class="l">And tented fields, outwatching for her sake</div>
               <div class="l">The starry host, &amp; ready for the work</div>
               <div class="l">Of day, before the Sun begins his course.</div>

               <div class="l">The noble mountaineer concluding then</div>
               <div class="l">With silent prayer, the service of the night,</div>
               <div class="l">Went forth. Without the porch awaiting him</div>
               <div class="l">He saw Alphonso, pacing to &amp; fro</div>
               <div class="l">With patient step, &amp; eyes reverted oft.</div>
               <div class="l">He springing forward when he heard the door</div>
               <div class="l">Move on its heavy hinges, ran to him</div>
               <div class="l">And welcomed him with smiles youthful love.</div>
               <div class="l">I have been watching yonder moon, quoth he,</div>
               <div class="l">How it grew pale &amp; paler as the Sun</div>
               <div class="l">Scattered the flying shades. But woe is me,</div>
               <div class="l">For on his towers of Cordoba the while</div>
               <div class="l">That baleful crescent glittered in the moon,</div>
               <div class="l">And with its insolent triumph seemd to mock</div>
               <div class="l">The omen I had found. – Last night I dreamt</div>
               <div class="l">That thou wert in the field, in arms for Spain,</div>
               <div class="l">And I was by thy side. The infidels</div>
               <div class="l">Beset us round, but we with our good swords</div>
               <div class="l">Hewd out a way. Methought I stabbed a Moor</div>
               <div class="l">Who would have slain thee, &amp; with that I woke</div>
               <div class="l">For joy, &amp; wept to find it but a dream.</div>

               <div class="l">Thus as he spake, a livelier glow oerspread</div>

               <div class="l">So it be lawful, &amp; within the bounds</div>

               <div class="l">A radiant vision in her joy she moved,</div>
               <div class="l">More like a poets dream, or form divine</div>

               <div class="l">Came to him like a ghost which in the grave</div>

               <div class="l">This was their covenant when in fatal hour</div>
               <div class="l">For Spain &amp; for themselves, in traiterous bond</div>
