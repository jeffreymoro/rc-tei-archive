                  </div> but the main cause of the facility with which the King has overthrown the Cortes is
                  I think certainly to be found in the rooted attachment of the populace to all the
                  follies &amp; all the abominations of their Church Establishment. Under such an Establishment
                  men necessarily either believe every thing, – or nothing: the possibility that another
                  form of Xtianity may be more reasonable never occurs to the thinking part of the community,
                  – luckily for them where such an opinion would lead to martyrdom. The Spaniards therefore,
                  as regards their religious feelings &amp; conduct may be considered as divided into three
                  classes: 1. A certain number of bold spirits among the educated classes (the proportion
                  of whom must be much the same in every country) who disbelieved, &amp; would gladly destroy
                  the prevalent superstition. – 2<sup>dly</sup> those who believed it just as little, – but were snugly provided for in the establishment;
                  &amp; much more disposed to triumph at an auto-de-fe than to suffer in a revolution. –
                  3<sup>dly</sup> an enormous majority in all classes believing all the fables in which they have been
                  brought up, with an intensity of faith which can hardly be credited till it has been
                  seen. Here you have in array all the hypocrisy of a country, all the superstition,
                  all the fanaticism &amp; all the attachment to old customs against –– “all the talents”;

                           the Year XIII’, which was called together in October 1812. One of its major achievements
                           was the ‘Libertad de vientres’ law (1813), which decreed all children born of slaves
                           would be free. An elected congress met in Paraguay in September 1813 and declared
                           the country a Republic, with executive authority in the hands of a first and a second
                           consul, who were to exchange power every four months. The first two consuls were Jose

                  </div> There are two curious laws – worthy of notice in the Quakers magazine being <span class="strikethrough">very</span> I think the newest improvements in Philanthropy. Among some fair provisions for emancipating
                  at a proper age <span class="strikethrough">chi</span> the children of slaves, it is decreed that they shall not be weaned till they are
                  at least twelve months old. – And by another edict all flogging in schools is prohibited,
                  – as a crime of leze-liberty in a free country! – They have a Republic of Paraguay
                  under two Consuls. What will be the end of these things? Ferdinand will send troops,
                  &amp; may very probably get easy possession of B Ayres, – but the revolutionary Government
                  will remove to some town in the interior, – &amp; the extent of the country renders it
                  absolutely impossible to conquer it, if the people chuse to continue their present
                  course. But if our own Americans were unfit for independence, how much more unfit
                  are these! There is something radically wrong in the constitution of all modern colonies.
