               <p>Because there are not demands enough upon my poor Ways &amp; Means I have received this
                  evening a demand of £7. for Absent Commons at Grays Inn to end of Trinity 1814. With
                  an NB. saying “M<sup>r</sup> Southeys address not being known until now, is the reason he hath not been applied
                  to before for his Ab. Com<sup>s</sup>.” – As my address might at any time have been as easily discovered as at the present,
                  this is a very insufficient reason for suffering an account to accumulate against
                  me for fourteen years. It is however well that it amounts to no heavier a sum. Call
                  for me I pray you at the Stewards Office, &amp; secure me against any future demands,
                  when you discharge this, by seeing my name expunged from their books. To complain
                  is of no use; &amp; it would be of as little to regret the loss of what I can very ill
                  afford.
