               <p>About the time that your letter from Easton Grey arrived – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerGeorge">G. Fricker</a> broke a blood vessel, – a thing so bad in itself could never have occurred under more

                  </div> We were just about to set out for Lodore, – &amp; think what a situation we should have
                  been in had it happened there or on the way. The hæmorrhage was not very great, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> found it necessary to bleed him that day &amp; again the next. At present he has pretty
                  well recovered his lost strength &amp; is not in worse state than <span class="strikethrough">before</span> he was before it happened. He had been using no kind of exertion. A very slight cough
                  preceded the hæmorrhage, <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> &lt;but&gt; was not the cause of it, being apparently occasioned by the effusion of blood
                  into the lungs. I never saw any man behave better than he did; – but what a frightful
                  thing it is for any one to witness who is not accustomed to such sights.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">

                  he would rather be out of employment looking for a situation in the latter place than
                  in the former. Perhaps it may be possible to find temporary employ for him in London
                  by &amp; by, while he looks about for something more permanent. But (between ourselves <span class="strikethrough">x</span> for I do not say this to his sisters

                  – &amp; there seems to me fresh reason to apprehend that he is consumptive also. At any
                  rate he will remain here three or four months – till he has enjoyed the country a
                  little in a fairer season, – &amp; this he may very well do, for the danger &lt;does&gt; not <span class="strikethrough">not</span> appear to be close at hand, &amp; I think he has no suspicion of it, <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> he seems to have all the feelings, but none of the fears of a valetudinarian.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I am glad to hear so well of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JardineDavid">David</a>. If his income were twice what it is, or if the Socinians did not like all the dissenters,

               would add little to his means, &amp; tho it is very possible that he might marry a woman
               with some fortune, this is not to be calculated upon. It is as easy to get a wife
               with money as without it – but as more women are fortuneless than otherwise, the probability
               always is that a man who consults only his heart will not enrich himself by marriage.
               In law or physic he may start with the great advantage of having enough to support
               him respectably till he gets into practice, the law has the most &amp; the highest prizes,
               &amp; what is of more importance will leave him most leisure.</p>
