                  </div> The former continues much in the same state as when you last heard from me; there
                  is no immediate danger of his being worse, &amp; I fear no probability of his ever being
                  better. I was upon the island a few weeks ago, &amp; so seldom have I been there that
                  the growth of the trees seemed to alter the place almost as much to my eyes, as it
                  would do to yours. I told Rhodes

                  </div> you might perhaps come down &amp; that you hoped to find it in order, – &amp; this produced
                  an expression of regret from him that the grass was growing for hay, because it would
                  require two or three mowings, he said, to make it look well.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You will have seen by the newspapers that we have lost poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburyHenryWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Bunbury</a>, who seems to have died of premature old age at 61. He is buried in the church here.
               This melancholy occasion, brought down <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburySirHenryEdward">his son</a>, whom I had not seen for nineteen years, since we slept in the same room at Westminster.
               I cannot <span class="strikethrough">now</span> conceive the boy whom I knew then, &amp; the man whom I met <span class="strikethrough">to</span> now to be the same individual, so total is the change – he was then about four years
               my junior, a beautiful boy, precisely the ideal of a Queens page, as he was. He now
               looked as if he was several years my elder, with at least as many grey hairs, &amp; a
               countenance on which the cares of business had left stronger furrows, – than I ever
               discovered in the operation of shaving. But I have seldom met with a man whose conversation
               was more delightful. His official situation gives him, of course, great means of information,
               <span class="strikethrough">of</span> which his strong understanding enables him to display to the best advantage. He means
               to finish <span class="strikethrough">x</span> the house which his father was building, &amp; let it for the present, – telling me when
               he went away, that it would not surprize him if he found himself in the course of
               a [MS illegible] my neighbour. A very desirable one indeed he would prove.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The reason why I have not replied sooner to your last favour has been that I waited
               till I could speak with as much certainty as this uncertain world allows of my movements
               southwards. This I can now do. – If no untoward circumstances should prevent <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<sup>rs</sup> Southey</a> &amp; myself purpose to set off on Monday the 10<sup>th</sup>. We halt at Nottingham on the way, &amp; shall probably not reach <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</a> before the last day of the week. My head quarters for the first part of my stay will
               be with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> at the Parsonage there. Let me find a note from you saying if you shall be at that
               time in town, that if so I may make your hotel in my rounds during the first expedition
               over the Bridges.</p>
