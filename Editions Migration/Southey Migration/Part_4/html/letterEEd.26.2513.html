               <p>Ready as I should be to repent of any unjust severity, or even of just severity if

                  </div> He may be the best natured man in the world, &amp; the most inoffensive, – but he has
                  approached the Ark with irreverent hands, &amp; I as one of the servants of the Altar,
                  am bound to resent the pollution. It is not to be borne that a man who is ignorant
                  of the very nomenclature of poetry, &amp; the commonest principles of versification should
                  undertake to form a Collection of the English Poets, reject &amp; insert writers with
                  no other rule than his own caprice, &amp; pass sentence upon them with oracular solemnity.
                  At <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</a> desire I expunged some passages of personal severity, which were well deserved; –
                  &amp; having done this, &amp; read the article with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>, he as well as myself felt satisfied that nothing more was said than what was due

Perhaps you have heard <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a> speak of his complaints, for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a> knows him. I cannot repent. By the bye I am to have double pay for the article, –
                  a thing equally unexpected &amp; convenient at this juncture, when the Constable is lagging
                  sadly astern.
