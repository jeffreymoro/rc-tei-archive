                           (1774–1856). He had published a German version in 1814 and was probably the author

                  can be given for them. For tho the work is exceedingly curious, it is not likely to
                  bear the expence of publication in the ordinary form. The old Turk, for he was between
                  80 &amp; 90 years of age when he finished his work, is very orthodox, very inquisitive,
                  indefatigable in his enquiries, &amp; as credulous as need be, but by no means wanting
                  in sagacity: – a very extraordinary Turk. He gives a compleat view of the system &amp;
                  strength of the Ottoman Empire at that time, &amp; much of its history, the author having
                  been attached to one of the Grand Viziers – &amp; borne a part in many of the great transactions
                  of his day. I have only seen the last two volumes, the first two not having reached
                  England. – It is a mournful thing that England is the only country where there is
                  a chance of encouragement for literary labours of this kind. – God knows there is
