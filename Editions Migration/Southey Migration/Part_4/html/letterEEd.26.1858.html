            <p class="indent1">I trouble you with a large packet by this post, the property of my good <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AbellaManuel">Spanish Secr.</a> who leaves London the 29<sup>th</sup> or 30<sup>th</sup> on his way to Cadiz, there to hold an office correspondent to our Under Secr. of
               State for the foreign department. He promises me his correspondence, &amp; a regular supply
               of documents, &amp; he leaves me as an earnest of this a collection of gazettes &amp; other
               papers for the whole of the year just expired. I regret much that I have not seen
               him. He has been of most essential service to me – I have made him all the return
