            <p class="indent1">You ask me upon what grounds I apprehend that all established institutions are in
               danger. The stream of events seems to have set against them, and, in the depth and
               sincerity of my heart, I fear that, at no very distant time, they will all be swept
               away.</p>

               <p>You are not old enough to remember the morning of the French Revolution, and the delirious
                  effect it produced upon generous and inexperienced minds. Did you ever inhale the
                  nitrous oxide?

                  </div> We seemed to be <span class="ital">living</span> in such an atmosphere. The republicans and levellers (or, in one word, the Jacobins)
                  of that day consisted of the best and worst members of society. There were the daring
                  and the desperate, the profligate and the atheist; but there were also those who would
                  have offered up their lives like martyrs, and who gave proof of their sincerity by
                  trampling all worldly interests under foot. The Government went mad in an opposite
                  direction, and plunged the country into a war, of which the third act is only just
                  begun! From that error (in my coolest and most unbiassed judgment) I believe the chief
                  calamities of Europe are to be dated. They had the mob with them, who were then anti-Jacobins
                  to a man; and what the spirit of anti-Jacobinism is was shown by the Emperor’s treatment
                  of Lafayette,

               <p>In those days I was a Jacobin, and so was almost every man whom I knew, who had any
                  claims to my love or respect. But you would hardly believe how small a minority we
                  were. I am old enough, and have been diligent enough, to have acquired the groundwork
                  of historical knowledge, without which any political principles must be referred to
                  inclination rather than judgment; and the last twenty-five years have added much to
                  the great book of experience. The Jacobins now are so numerous, that in the lower
                  classes I believe they are greatly the majority. Where there was one reader in those
                  classes then, there are twenty now. There were not half a dozen opposition newspapers
                  then; there are scarcely as many now that are not Jacobinical. And when the half-learned
                  address themselves to the ignorant, their misrepresentations, their mistakes, their
                  malice, and their blunders are all received as gospel. Upon this subject I said something
                  in the <em>Quarterly</em>, which, mutilated as it was, will explain what I would now say more fully than I
                  can express myself.

                  </div> The populace are at this time decidedly Jacobinical. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteNeville">Our friend Neville</a> can tell you how perfectly well they understand the art of finance; and you have lately
                  seen in London, as well as in the Luddite countries, that they are well skilled in
                  the art of insurrection.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>London had been the site of a number of recent popular demonstrations, especially
                           against the Corn Laws in March 1815. The Luddites smashed textile machinery that they
                           saw as a threat to employment and wages. The movement was based in the East Midlands,
                           Lancashire and Yorkshire.</span></div>
                  </div> The question is – is there time for the education which the populace at last are beginning
                  to receive to produce its effect, before the prevailing levelling principles bring
                  about a revolution in this country? I hope so, but verily I think there is not.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am inclined to believe that no doctrines have ever obtained a wide and influential
               belief, without some foundation in truth. Most heresies, for instance, are founded
               upon a strong perception of some particular truth or tenet, which possesses the mind,
               to the exclusion of others not less important in themselves. The evils of the existing
               state of society are but too obvious – every man may perceive them; but every man
               does not know that, in the present condition of the human race, we have only a choice
               of evils, and that if reform be not gradual it brings with it worse evils than those
               which it removes. Inequality, in the extent to which it prevails among us, is an evil;
               I know not how a man of cultivated intellect and feelings can contemplate the difference
               between himself and a hackney-coachman without shuddering. There are evils inseparable
               from a monarchical system; but, gracious God! what are the evils which would overwhelm
               us, if we were to attempt to change it! Our Church Establishment has its evils. You
               and I should not agree as to what those evils are; my conception of them is such as
               to exclude me from the clerical profession. But I am fully convinced of the utility
               of an Establishment; and though, if I were to form one for a colony, it would differ
               materially from our own, I dare not wish an alteration which would entail upon us
               ages of religious anarchy, and perhaps of civil war.</p>

                  </div> There you may see what dangers (in my opinion) assail one part of our complicated
                  system. The monarchy has to contend, not only with the spirit of the times, but with
                  other causes which it is enough to hint at. The science of finance I do not pretend
                  to understand; this, however, is apparent, that it rests upon public credit for its
                  basis, and I <span class="ital">know</span> that if the bullionists in 1811 had carried the question in Parliament, it would have
                  been utterly impossible to have carried on the war.
