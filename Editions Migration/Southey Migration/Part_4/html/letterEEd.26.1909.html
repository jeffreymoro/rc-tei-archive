               <p>Right glad I was to see the superscription of your letter &amp; of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyWilliam">Imperials</a> . The same post brought me one from my good <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</a> , telling me that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Mr T. Southey</a> was dead &amp; had left part of his property to an acquaintance at Bristol,

                  </div> I am neither surprised nor grieved, – but it vexes me to think that he should have
                  behaved so unnaturally to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">his sister</a> , who is now far advanced in years, &amp; had only 400 £. This wretched man turned her
                  out of doors about two years ago, merely because she could not conceal that she thought
                  her nephews rather more worthy subjects than the footboy Tom. You know me well enough
                  to believe that as to the usage which I myself have received I care for just as little
                  as I have deserved it. A light heart &amp; a thin pair of – pantaloons, – you know is
                  the old song upon such occasions.

                  still shall be enabled to do. “I hope God will forgive him, says my poor good <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt</a> , “<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John</a> made himself a slave to get this trash – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">he</a> had made himself a fool to give it away.” – Tis a passage worth transcribing, for
                  it comprizes the sum of the history of two brothers &amp; of 40,000£, – for that is the
                  meaning of the word <span class="ital">trash</span>, a word which was never more passionately nor more fully employed.</p>

                  foundation in some piece of recent history, certainly not in romance.
