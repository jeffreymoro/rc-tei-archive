                  after his arrival, &amp; is now in the last stage of atrophy, produced by a complication
                  of hepatic &amp; pulmonary diseases. For the last week <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> has said that his death might be hourly expected, – still he is alive, &amp; God knows
