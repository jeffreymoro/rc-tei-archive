                  the convenience of arrangement. – The pay three guineas per sheet – amounting to about
                  50 guineas on the fair average. Now Tom comes the beauty of this arrangement. Such
                  a job of course is best done regularly as the papers come in – but where was I to
                  put the scraps that they might be safely &amp; at the same time commodiously kept. I have

               <p>Being thus led to cut up the newspapers I have fallen upon the plan of <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> cutting out all those parts which are the materials for the Annals, &amp; pasting them

This will <span class="strikethrough">be of</span> much facilitate the composition &amp; save much time as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> makes the books. Here too I have <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> introduced an invention worthy of a patent, or a gold medal. Some columns would occasionally
                  occur that could not be pasted down, – because the matter continued to the other side
                  of the page. What then was to be done? Mark my contrivance. I pasted into the blue
                  book a slip of blank paper folded in three folds, the lower fold being fastened to
                  the page. On the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> upper I pasted (this too <span class="strikethrough">by</span> &lt;in&gt; a most ingenious manner) about 2 or 2 ½ inches of tape. The other end of this <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> tape (with like ingenuity) is secured to the top of the column, which then folds up
                  to the <span class="strikethrough">shape</span> &lt;height&gt; of the page. And then when required the tape permits the column to be turned,
                  &amp; read on either side. An admirable contrivance, verily most excellent, &amp; invented
                  wholly by me Robert Southey, Author of Kehama &amp; the History of Brazil.

               Roads in April 1809. Although they achieved some success, the British fleet failed
               to destroy the French navy completely. Captain Thomas Cochrane, later 10th Earl of
               Dundonald (1775–1860; <em>DNB</em>), who had led a highly effective fireship attack at the start of the battle, accused
               his commanding officer, the evangelical Admiral James Gambier, Baron Gambier (1756–1833;

               was also an MP with a reputation for exposing abuses of office, and, in the weeks
               after the battle, he pursued his campaign against Gambier via parliamentary speeches.
               Gambier demanded a court-martial at which he was exonerated and, by implication, Cochrane
               was convicted of libelling a superior officer. Whilst Gambier received public thanks
               from parliament for his actions in the battle, Cochrane was not permitted to rejoin
               his ship for a few months. When he received new orders to serve in the Mediterranean,
               Cochrane refused and went on half-pay, devoting his time to exposing abuses in the
