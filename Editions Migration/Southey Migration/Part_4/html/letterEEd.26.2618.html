               <p>You cannot think of me more frequently, nor more affectionately than I do of you.
                  These recollections begin to have an autumnal shade of feeling, &amp; habitually joyous
                  as my spirits are, I believe, that if we were now too meet, my first impulse would
                  be to burst into tears. I was not twenty when we parted, &amp; one &amp; twenty years have
                  elapsed since that time. Of the men with whom I lived at Oxford <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> &amp; yourself are all that are left. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardEdmund">Seward</a> is in heaven. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CollinsCharles">Charles Collins</a> is dead, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Robert Allen</a> is dead, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> is dead. I have lost sight of all the rest: And chance that throws strangers in my
                  way by scores every summer, has never yet brought a single person whom I knew at College,
                  except Douglas, who having succeeded to his patrimony at Kelso, &amp; settled there as
                  a physician, brought a bride here for two days, some three or four years ago.

                           on 10 December 1810 and visited Southey shortly afterwards; see Southey to Grosvenor

                  at Malta, &amp; having destroyed his constitution embarked for England as a last hope,

                  Malta, – his ship was put in quarantine, &amp; he died in consequence, literally dying
                  in sight of land where his life might certainly have been prolonged, &amp; possibly saved
                  if he <span class="strikethrough">coul</span> could have landed.

                  at Balliol. How long I may continue to abide here is uncertain; the first term of
                  my lease will expire in the spring of 1817, – if I do not <span class="strikethrough">go</span> remove then I must remain for another seven years, &amp; I am far too sensible of the
                  insecurity of life to look beyond that time. Having many inducements to remove nearer
                  London, &amp; many to remain where I am, the trouble &amp; enormous expense of moving (for
                  I have not less than 5000 books) will very probably turn the scale, – certainly they
                  will weigh heavy in it. It is not that I have any business in London as Poet Laureate;
                  – that office imposes upon me no such necessity; – it only requires as a matter of
                  decorum that when I happen to be there I should sometimes attend a Levee, – especially
