               / In the deep stillness of a summer even / Rising behind a thick and lofty Grove,
               / Burns like an unconsuming fire of light / In the green trees; and kindling on all
               sides / Their leafy umbrage turns the dusky veil / Into a substance glorious as her
               own, / Yea with her own incorporated, by power / Capacious and serene: Like power
               abides / In man’s celestial Spirit; Virtue thus / Sets forth and magnifies herself;
               thus feeds / A calm, a beautiful and silent fire, / From the incumbrances of mortal
               life, / From error, disappointment,.. nay from guilt; / And sometimes, so relenting
               Justice wills, / From palpable oppressions of Despair. / Wordsworth.’ The source was
               Wordsworth, <em>The Excursion</em> (1814), Book 4, lines 1062–1077.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

Her supposed condition excited tremendous public excitement and ridicule.
               She was examined by a number of doctors, whose findings were widely reported. Shiloh
               failed to appear and Southcott died on 27 December 1814. Her corpse was wrapped in
               flannel and kept warm for four days. Some of her followers believed that she could
               be resuscitated and Shiloh born. An autopsy was finally conducted on 31 December,
               and no foetus was found. Whilst some of her followers argued Shiloh had mysteriously
               disappeared, others present at the autopsy gave physical explanations for Southcott’s
               condition; see Peter Mathias, <em>The Case of Johanna Southcott</em> (1815). After her death, the Southcottians did fragment, though a core group remained
               loyal to her beliefs and protected the ‘great box’ of sealed prophecies.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
