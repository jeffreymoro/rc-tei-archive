                  </div> – but the thing is totally impracticable, without establishing a principle of violence

                  where he can do it peaceably, – that is in any place where he does not interrupt any
                  body else, or trespass upon any person’s property. No Tom, both with religious &amp; political

                  of the mind: our establishment starves it the Catholicks gorge it even to surfeiting
                  &amp; sickness. The most practicable (I fear the only practicable) remedy is by setting
                  up a new system, an Eclectic church, continuing all that is good in each, yet so philosophically
                  framed that as the world grew wiser it would be adapted for a Catholick – i-e- a universal
                  faith. If I had had the slightest crack in the upper story I should have done this
                  long ago, – &amp; perhaps it is only the multiplicity of my employments &amp; the interest
                  which I take in them &amp; the importance that I have persuaded myself attaches to them,

               us. It still is a blessing because it saves us from persecution; – but its creed will
               not stand the test of sound criticism. The story of the Fall, the plenary inspiration
               of the scriptures, &amp; the miracles must be given up, – abandon these, insist upon a
               diseased moral nature, the necessity &amp; all-sufficiency of grace effecting a moral
               redemption, – preach the doctrine of a perpetual revelation, appeal to the heart of
               man for the truth of these doctrines, – &amp; Christianity becomes invincible. The nature
               of the Fall, &amp; the questions of the Trinity &amp; the super-human nature of Christ may
               safely be left undefined, for every person to understand according to his judgement.
