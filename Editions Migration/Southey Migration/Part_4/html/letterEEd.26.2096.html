               ridiculous interventions in debates. For example, in a debate on the slave trade,
               30 May 1804, he tried to persuade auditors that the living conditions of slaves on
               plantations were superior to that of the labouring-poor in Britain. (Fuller’s vast
               wealth owed much to his estates in the West Indies.) On 27 February 1810 he was forcefully
               ejected from the House of Commons for drunken and rowdy conduct. He spent two days
               in custody, apologised to the House and was reprimanded. Fuller consistently proclaimed
               his independence and attacked sinecures and other abuses. He retired from parliament
               at the dissolution in 1812. He devoted his remaining years to his other interests:
               patronage of science and the arts, and folly building.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
