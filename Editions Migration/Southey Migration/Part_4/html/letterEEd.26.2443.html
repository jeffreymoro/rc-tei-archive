                           had been overseeing the proofs, but as publication was imminent, Southey was aware

               and celebrating the 1814 visit to London of Alexander I (1777–1825; Emperor of Russia
               1801–1825) and Frederick William III (1770–1840; King of Prussia 1797–1840); published
               as <em>Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal Highness The Prince Regent, His Imperial Majesty
                  The Emperor of Russia, and His Majesty the King of Prussia</em> (1814). Bedford had been overseeing the proofs, but as publication was imminent,
               Southey was aware that the corrections sent in his letter were probably too late to
               be implemented.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
