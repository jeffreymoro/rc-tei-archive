                           Savage Landor. A Biography, 2 vols (London, 1869), I, pp. 252–253. This was published
                           as ‘Coresus et Callirhoe’ in Landor’s Poemata et Inscriptiones (London, 1847), pp.
                           36–41.</span></div>
                  </div> tantalized me as a barrel of oysters would have done if set before me without a knife.
                  I could not read them. There is little difficulty in understanding the worst possible
                  hand writing in our own every-day language, – tho I once saw two franks which had
                  travelled all over England, &amp; at last found their way by the lucky guess of some Post
                  Office clerk who wrote on them “try Durham” – they had tried Dublin previously. But
                  when a fore sight of the meaning is necessary to make out the words, any thing not
                  easy in itself becomes very difficult. If I could have read these verses I should
                  have understood them, – <span class="strikethrough">for</span> because I did not understand, I could not read them. The case however is not desperate,
                  in some season of leisure I purpose transcribing them, &amp; shall thus make them out
                  step by step.</p>

               feeling that there are poets enough in the world without me, &amp; that my best chance
               of being remembered will be as an historian. A proof sheet of Kehama, or a second-sight
               scene in Pelayo disperses this cloud, – such however is my habitual feeling, – it
               did not use to be the case in those days when I thought of nothing but poetry, &amp; lived
               as it were in an atmosphere of nitrous oxyd, – in a state of perpetual excitement,
