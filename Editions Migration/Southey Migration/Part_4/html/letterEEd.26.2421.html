                  the political history of those times to feel any interest in them, &amp; the time employed
                  upon such a subject would not have been well bestowed. Yet I would have done it, because

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9.. </span><span class="noteBody">Junius was the pseudonym used by the author – or authors – of a series of letters
               published in the <em>Public Advertiser</em> between 21 January 1769 and 21 January 1772. The letters took a high Whig line. They
               opposed the policies of the government and the king and were generally supportive
               of those of the ex-Prime Minister George Grenville (1712–1770; <em>DNB</em>) and of the radical politician John Wilkes (1725–1797; <em>DNB</em>). There was, from the outset, much debate as to the identity of their author or authors.
               In 1813 Duppa’s <em>Memoirs by a Celebrated Literary and Political Character</em> (i.e. Richard Glover (1712–1785; <em>DNB</em>)) had attempted to prove the latter was the author of Junius’s letters. (Glover was
               the author of the epic <em>Leonidas</em> (1737), a favourite poem of Southey’s.) Duppa defended himself against his critics
               in an anonymous pamphlet, <em>An Inquiry Concerning the Author of the Letters of Junius, with Reference to the Memoirs
                  by a Celebrated Literary and Political Character</em> (1814).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
