                  </div> I suggested to him, as an easy means of giving additional interest to it, that the
                  name of every person should be given under his portrait in a fac-simile of his signature,
                  – where it was possible to procure it, which in most cases it must be. It occurred
                  to me also, that instead of accompanying the portraits with a page of biographical
                  notices, a series of Inscriptions might be written for them. The thought has warmed
                  me, &amp; if I do not deceive myself, I could execute it much to my own satisfaction.
                  This form of poem is from its style peculiarly adapted for conveying precepts, <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> &lt;which&gt; from its brevity, are likely to be impressed upon the memory. – You need not
