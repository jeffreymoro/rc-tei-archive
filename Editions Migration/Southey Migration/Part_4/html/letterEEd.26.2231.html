            <p>Address: To/ John Rickman Esq<sup>r</sup> <br>Endorsement: Fr. RS./ Mar. 1813<br>MS: Huntington Library, RS 203<br>Previously published: Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), <em>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</em>, 6 vols (London, 1849–1850), IV, pp. 28–29 [in part; dated March 1813].<br>Dating note: this letter is a reply to John Rickman to Southey, 12 March 1813 and
               13 March 1813 and was probably written before Southey to John Rickman, [18 March 1813],

            <p class="indent1">You &amp; I shall agree about general education. Ignorance is no preventative in these
               days, if indeed it ever were one which could be relied on. All who have ears can hear
               sedition, &amp; the more ignorant they are the more easy is it to inflame them. My plan
               is (I know not whether <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> has ventured to give it) to make transportation a punishment for seditious-libelling
               – This &amp; this only would be an effectual cure. The existence of <span class="strikethrough">any Government &amp; that</span> a press in the state which ours is in, is incompatible with the security of any Government.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>About the Manufacturing system as affecting the poor rates, doubtless you are best
                  informed. My argument went to show <span class="strikethrough">that the system produced (xxx that xx</span> when under certain circumstances of not unfrequent occurrence, manufactures occasioned
                  a sudden increase of <span class="strikethrough">the</span> craving mouths, – &amp; that the whole previous discipline of these persons fitted them
                  to become Luddites.

                  </div> It is most likely that there may be some ambiguity in this part of the article from
                  the vague use of the word Poor, which ought to be distinguished from Pauper – a distinction
                  I <span class="strikethrough">did</span> never thought of making till your letter made me see the necessity for so doing. –
                  Concerning the Poor-Laws I confess myself altogether incompetent to say anything.
