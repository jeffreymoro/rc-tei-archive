               <div class="l">That aweful silence still endured, when one</div>
               <div class="l">Who to the northern entrance of the vale</div>
               <div class="l">Had turned his casual eye, exclaimd, the Moors!</div>
               <div class="l">For from the forest verge a troop were seen</div>
               <div class="l">Hastening toward Pedro’s hall. Their forward speed</div>
               <div class="l">Was checkd when they beheld his banner spread,</div>
               <div class="l">And saw his ordered spears in prompt array</div>
               <div class="l">Marshalld to meet their coming. But the pride</div>
               <div class="l">Of power &amp; insolence of long command</div>
               <div class="l">Pricked on their chief presumptuous. We are come</div>
               <div class="l">Late for prevention, cried the haughty Moor</div>
               <div class="l">But never time more fit for punishment!</div>
               <div class="l">These unbelieving slaves must feel &amp; know</div>
               <div class="l">Their masters arm! – on faithful Musselmen</div>
               <div class="l">On – on, &amp; hew down the rebellious dogs.</div>
               <div class="l">Then as he spurrd his steed Allah is great</div>
               <div class="l">Mohammed is his prophet, he exclaimd</div>
               <div class="l">And led the charge.</div>
               <div class="l">Count Pedro met the Chief</div>
               <div class="l">In full career: he bore him from his horse</div>
               <div class="l">A full spears length upon the lance transfixd,</div>
               <div class="l">Then leaving in his breast the mortal shaft</div>
               <div class="l">Past on, &amp; breaking thro the turbaned files</div>
               <div class="l">Opened a path. Pelayo who that day</div>
               <div class="l">Fought in the ranks afoot, for other war</div>
               <div class="l">Yet unequipped, pursued &amp; smote the foe;</div>
               <div class="l">But ever on Alphonso at his side</div>
               <div class="l">Retained a watchful eye, The gallant boy</div>
               <div class="l">Gave his gold sword that hour its earliest taste</div>
               <div class="l">Of Moorish blood, – that sword whose hungry edge</div>
               <div class="l">Thro the fair course of all his perilous life</div>
               <div class="l">From that auspicious day, was fed so well</div>
               <div class="l">Cheap was the victory now for Spain atchieved;</div>
               <div class="l">For the first fervour of their zeal inspired</div>
               <div class="l">The mountaineers, – the presence of their chiefs,</div>
               <div class="l">The sight of all dear objects, all dear ties.</div>
               <div class="l">The air they breathd, the soil wherein they trod,</div>
               <div class="l">Duty, devotion, faith &amp; hope &amp; joy.</div>
               <div class="l">And little had the misbelievers ween d</div>
               <div class="l">In such impetuous onset to receive</div>
               <div class="l">A greeting deadly as their own intent;</div>
               <div class="l">Victims they thought to find, not men prepard</div>
               <div class="l">And eager for the fight; their confidence</div>
               <div class="l">Therefore gave way to wonder, &amp; dismay</div>
               <div class="l">Effected what astonishment began.</div>
               <div class="l">Scattered before the impetuous mountaineers</div>
               <div class="l">Buckler &amp; spear &amp; scymitar they dropt</div>
               <div class="l">As in precipitate rout they fled before</div>
               <div class="l">The Asturian sword. The vales &amp; hills &amp; rocks</div>
               <div class="l">Received their blood, &amp; where they fell the wolves</div>
               <div class="l">At evening found them.</div>
               <div class="l">From the fight apart</div>
               <div class="l">Two Africans had stood who held in charge</div>
               <div class="l">Count Eudon. When they saw their countrymen</div>
               <div class="l">Falter, give way &amp; fly before the foe,</div>
               <div class="l">One turn d toward him with malignant rage,</div>
               <div class="l">And saying, Infidel thou shalt not live</div>
               <div class="l">To join their triumph, aim d against his neck</div>
               <div class="l">The moony falchions point. His comrade rais’d</div>
               <div class="l">A hasty hand, &amp; turn d its edge aside,</div>
               <div class="l">Yet so that oer the shoulder glancing down</div>
               <div class="l">It scarrd him as it past. The murderous Moor</div>
               <div class="l">Not tarrying to secure his vengeance fled,</div>
               <div class="l">While he of milder mood at Eudons feet</div>
               <div class="l">Fell &amp; embraced his knees. The conqueror</div>
               <div class="l">Who found them thus withheld at Eudons voice</div>
               <div class="l">His wrathful hand, &amp; led them to his Lord</div><br><div class="l">Count Pedro &amp; Alphonso &amp; the Prince</div>
               <div class="l">Stood on a little rocky eminence</div>
               <div class="l">Which overlooked the vale. Pedro had put</div>
               <div class="l">His helmet off, &amp; with sonorous horn</div>
               <div class="l">Blew the recall, – for well he knew what thoughts</div>
               <div class="l">Calm as the Prince appeard &amp; undisturbed;</div>
               <div class="l">Lay underneath his silent fortitude,</div>
               <div class="l">And that at this eventful juncture speed</div>
               <div class="l">Imported more than vengeance. Thrice he sent</div>
               <div class="l">The long-resounding signal forth, which rung</div>
               <div class="l">From hill to hill, reechoing far &amp; wide.</div>
               <div class="l">Slow &amp; unwillingly his men obeyed,</div>
               <div class="l">The swelling horns reiterated call,</div>
               <div class="l">Repining that a single foe escaped</div>
               <div class="l">The retribution of that righteous hour.</div>
               <div class="l">With lingering step reluctant from the chase</div>
               <div class="l">They turn d, – their veins full swoln, their sinews strung</div>
               <div class="l">For battle still, their hearts unsatisfied;</div>
               <div class="l">Their swords were dripping still with Moorish gore,</div>
               <div class="l">And where they wiped their reeking brows, the stain</div>
               <div class="l">Of Moorish blood was left. But when they came</div>
               <div class="l">Where Pedro with Alphonso at his side</div>
               <div class="l">Stood to behold their coming, then they prest</div>
               <div class="l">All emulous with gratulation round,</div>
               <div class="l">Extolling for his deeds that day display d</div>
               <div class="l">The noble boy. Oh when had Heaven, they said</div>
               <div class="l">With such especial favour manifest</div>
               <div class="l">Illustrated a first essay in arms!</div>
               <div class="l">They blest the father from whose loins he sprung</div>
               <div class="l">The mother at whose happy breast he fed;</div>
               <div class="l">And prayed that their young heros fields might be</div>
               <div class="l">Many, &amp; all like this.</div>
               <div class="l">Thus they indulged</div>
               <div class="l">The honest heart, exuberant of love,</div>
               <div class="l">When that loquacious joy at once was checkd</div>
               <div class="l">For Eudon &amp; the Moor were led before</div>
               <div class="l">Count Pedro. Both came fearfully &amp; pale,</div>
               <div class="l">But with a different fear; the African</div>
               <div class="l">Felt at this crisis of his destiny</div>
               <div class="l">Such apprehension as without reproach</div>
               <div class="l">Might blanch a soldiers cheek, when life &amp; death</div>
               <div class="l">Hang on anothers will, &amp; helplessly</div>
               <div class="l">He must abide the issue. But the thoughts</div>
               <div class="l">Which quaild Count Eudons heart &amp; made his limbs</div>
               <div class="l">Quiver, were of his own unworthiness,</div>
               <div class="l">Old enmity, &amp; that he stood in power</div>
               <div class="l">Of hated &amp; hereditary foes.</div>
               <div class="l">I came not with them willingly, – he cried, </div>
               <div class="l">Addressing Pedro &amp; the Prince at once,</div>
               <div class="l">Rolling from each to each his restless eyes</div>
               <div class="l">Aghast, – the Moor can tell I had no choice,</div>
               <div class="l">They forced me from my Castle; – in the fight</div>
               <div class="l">They would have slain me, – see I bleed – the Moor</div>
               <div class="l">Can witness that a Moorish scymitar</div>
               <div class="l">Inflicted this; – he saved me from worse hurt, –</div>
               <div class="l">I did come in arms, – he knows it all, –</div>
               <div class="l">Speak man, &amp; let the truth be known to clear</div>
               <div class="l">My innocence.</div>
               <div class="l">Thus as he ceased with fear</div>
               <div class="l">And rapid utterance panting open mouthd,</div>
               <div class="l">Count Pedro half represt a mournful smile</div>
               <div class="l">Wherein compassion seemed to mitigate</div>
               <div class="l">His deep contempt. Methinks, said he, the Moor</div>
               <div class="l">Might with more reason look himself to find</div>
               <div class="l">An intercessor, than be called upon</div>
               <div class="l">To play the pleaders part. Didst thou then save</div>
               <div class="l">The Baron from thy comrades?</div>
               <div class="l">Let my Lord</div>
               <div class="l">Shew mercy to me, said the Musselman</div>
               <div class="l">As I am free from falsehood. We were left,</div>
               <div class="l">I &amp; another, holding him in charge; –</div>
               <div class="l">My fellow would have slain him when he saw</div>
               <div class="l">How the fight fard, – I turn’d the scymitar</div>
               <div class="l">Aside, &amp; trust that life will be the meed</div>
               <div class="l">For life by me preserved.</div>
               <div class="l">Nor shall thy trust</div>
               <div class="l">Rejoind the Count, be vain. Say farther now</div>
               <div class="l">From whence ye came, – your orders what, – what force</div>
               <div class="l">In Gegio, &amp; if others like yourselves</div>
               <div class="l">Are in the field.</div>
               <div class="l">The African replied,</div>
               <div class="l">We came from Gegio, ordered to secure</div>
               <div class="l">This Baron on the way, &amp; seek thee here</div>
               <div class="l">To bear thee hence in bonds. A messenger</div>
               <div class="l">From Cordoba, whose speed denoted well</div>
               <div class="l">He came with urgent tidings, was the cause</div>
               <div class="l">Of this our sudden movement. We went forth</div>
               <div class="l">Three hundred men; an equal force was sent</div>
               <div class="l">To Cangas, on like errand as I ween:</div>
               <div class="l">Four hundred in the city then were left.</div>
               <div class="l">If other force be moving from the south</div>
               <div class="l">I know not, – save that all appearances</div>
               <div class="l">Denote alarm &amp; vigilance.</div>
               <div class="l">The Prince</div>
               <div class="l">Fix’d upon Eudon then his eye severe.</div>
               <div class="l">Baron, he said, the die of war is cast.</div>
               <div class="l">What part art thou prepared to take – against</div>
               <div class="l">Or with the oppressor?</div>
               <div class="l">Not against my friends,</div>
               <div class="l">Not against you, the irresolute wretch replied</div>
               <div class="l">Hasty, yet faltering in his fearful speech</div>
               <div class="l">But have ye weighed it well? – it is not yet</div>
               <div class="l">Too late, – their numbers, – their victorious force</div>
               <div class="l">Which hath already trodden in the dust</div>
               <div class="l">The Sceptre of the Goths: – the throne destroyed</div>
               <div class="l">Our towns subdued, – our country over-run</div>
               <div class="l">The people to the yoke of their new Lords</div>
               <div class="l">Resignd in peace. – Can I not mediate</div>
               <div class="l">Were it not better thro my agency</div>
               <div class="l">To gain such terms, – such honourable terms</div><br><div class="l">Terms! cried Pelayo, cutting short at once</div>
               <div class="l">That dastard speech, &amp; checking ere it grew</div>
               <div class="l">Too powerful for restraint the incipient rage</div>
               <div class="l">Which in indignant murmurs breathing round</div>
               <div class="l">Rose like a gathering storm; – learn thou what terms</div>
               <div class="l">Asturias this day speaking by my voice</div>
               <div class="l">Doth constitute to be the law between</div>
               <div class="l">Thee &amp; thy country! Our portentous age</div>
               <div class="l">As with an earthquakes desolating force</div>
               <div class="l">Hath loosened &amp; disjointed the whole frame</div>
               <div class="l">Of social order, &amp; she calls not now</div>
               <div class="l">For service with the voice of sovereign will</div>
               <div class="l">That which was common duty in old times</div>
               <div class="l">Becomes an arduous glorious virtue now,</div>
               <div class="l">And every one as between Hell &amp; Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">In free election, must be left to chuse</div>
               <div class="l">Asturias asks not of thee to partake</div>
               <div class="l">The cup which we have pledged; she claims from none</div>
               <div class="l">The dauntless fortitude, the mind resolved</div>
               <div class="l">Which only God cangive; – therefore such peace</div>
               <div class="l">As thou canst find where all around is war</div>
               <div class="l">She leaves thee to enjoy. But think not Count</div>
               <div class="l">That because thou art weak one valiant arm, </div>
               <div class="l">One generous spirit must be lost to Spain!</div>
               <div class="l">The vassal owes no service to the Lord</div>
               <div class="l">Who to his country doth acknowledge none.</div>
               <div class="l">The summons which thou hast not heart to give</div>
               <div class="l">I &amp; Count Pedro over thy domains</div>
               <div class="l">Will send abroad; the vassals who were thine</div>
               <div class="l">Will fight beneath our banners, &amp; our wants</div>
               <div class="l">Shall from thy lands, as from a patrimony</div>

                  likely enough to inflate him, – for the wretch is equally incapable of bearing prosperous
