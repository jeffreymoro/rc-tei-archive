                  because Horrebow (who wrote before him) does. He says “it is usual with the men about
                  the age of fifty to fall into a decay, by reason of the various disorders that come
                  upon them &amp; at last put an end to their lives. Consumption &amp; asthmas, <span class="ital">the reigning disorders among them</span>, are occasioned chiefly by the many hardships they endure at sea in fishing, &amp; their
                  carelessness of preserving their health. They do not mind jumping into the sea to
                  save their boat from running aground, or receiving damage against the rocks, &amp; frequently
                  keep on their wet cloaths, even in frost &amp; snow, without changing any thing. – Coughs
                  &amp; consumption so afflict them that none hardly ever wear as well, or have such florid
                  complexions as the people of Denmark.”

               biographers, including Southey, who used a similar format in his edition of William
