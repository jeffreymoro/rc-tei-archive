                  a sound man again, he may yet enjoy years of life. He moves the left hand (which was
                  the side affected) &amp; can hold any thing in it, but the sense of touch is lost in it.
                  His intellect is unimpaired, &amp; his speech which at one time was affected is recovered. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<sup>rs</sup> Wilson</a> conveyed your kind message to him; – the people with whom he lives were afraid it
                  would flurry him to hear it, they were however mistaken, for he expressed great pleasure
                  at hearing you were concerned about him, <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> it put him in good spirits &amp; he talked a great deal about you.</p>

               <p>I cannot reply to the other part of your letter without many painful thoughts. As
