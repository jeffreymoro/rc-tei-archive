                  during my journey made me almost despair of being ready for your next number, &amp; I
                  was on the point of writing to say so, but as you speak of Oct. 1. as the intended
                  day of publication there is little doubt that I shall be prepared in time. The subject
                  is very important, &amp; I will do my best.
