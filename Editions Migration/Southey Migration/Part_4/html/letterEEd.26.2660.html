            <p class="indent1">I have a happy habit of making the best of all things &amp; being just at this time as
               uncomfortable as the dust &amp; bustle &amp; all the disagreeables of an inn in a larger filthy
               manufacturing city can make me, I have called for pen ink &amp; paper &amp; am actually writing
               in the bar, the door open to the yard opposite this unwiped table, the folding doors
               open to the public room where two men are dining, &amp; talking French, &amp; a woman servant
               at my elbow lighting a fire for our party. Presently the folding doors are to be shut,
               the ladies will descend from their chambers, the bar will be kept appropriated to
               our house, the male part of the company will get into good humour, dinner will be
               ready &amp; then – I must lay aside the grey goose quill. As a preliminary to these promised
               comforts, the servant is now mopping the hearth, which is composed (like a tesselated
               pavement) of little bricks about two inches long by half an inch wide, set within
               a broad black stone frame. The fuel is of fire balls, – a mixture of pulverised coal
               &amp; clay. I have seen a great deal &amp; heard a great deal more indeed than I can keep
               pace with in my journal, tho I strive hard to do it: but I minute down short notes
               in my pencil book with all possible care &amp; hope in the end to lose nothing.</p>

               <p>As for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> &amp; his party I know nothing more of them than that they landed at Ostend a week before
                  us &amp; proceeded to Bruges. This we learnt from M<sup>rs</sup> Harrison at Ramsgate.

                  </div> I wrote to him from Ostend; my letter was not lying at the Brussels post office, therefore
                  I conclude he received it. Tomorrow we shall probably learn tidings of them at Spa.
                  Meantime we have joined company with some fellow passengers, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VardonMr">M<sup>r</sup> Vardon</a> of Greenwich with his family &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">M<sup>r</sup> Nash</a> an artist who has lived many years in India.</p>

               <p>Flanders is a most interesting country. – Bruges the most striking city that I have
                  ever seen: an old city in perfect preservation; – it seems as if not a house has been
                  built during the last two centuries, &amp; not a house suffered to go to decay. The poorest
                  people seem to be well lodged, &amp; there is a general air of sufficiency, cleanliness,
                  industry &amp; comfort which I have never seen in any other place. The cities have grown
                  worse as we advanced. Ghent (tho very interesting) is less so than Bruges, – there
                  is more that is modern, more that is vicious, more that is wretched. Brussels has
                  some very fine parts the work of old times. – The modern parts are fine also but they
                  are French, &amp; the city has the credit (which you &amp; I shall agree in thinking the worst
                  possible character) of being a second Paris. At Namur we reached a dirty city, situated
                  in a romantic country. The Meuse there reminded me of the Thames from your delightful
                  house, an island in size &amp; shape resembling that on which I have often wished for
                  a grove of poplars coming just in the same position. From thence along the river to
                  this abominable place. The country is for the greater part as lovely as can be imagined,
                  – especially at Huy, where we slept last night &amp; fell in with one of the inhabitants,

               <p>Our weather hitherto has been delightful: this was especially fortunate at Waterloo
                  &amp; at Ligny where we had much ground to walk over. It would surprize you to see how
                  soon Nature has recovered from the injuries of war. the ground is plowed and sown,
                  – &amp; grain &amp; flowers &amp; weeds already growing over the field of battle, which is still
                  strewn with vestiges of the slaughter, caps cartridge boxes, hats &amp;c. We picked up
                  some French cards, &amp; some bullets, &amp; we purchased a French pistol, &amp; two of the eagles
                  which the infantry wear upon their caps. What I felt upon this ground, it would be
                  difficult to say, – what I saw &amp; still more what I heard, there is no time at present
                  for saying. In prose &amp; in verse you shall one day hear the whole.

                  </div> I saw two graves which probably the dogs or the swine had opened, – in the one were
                  the ribs of a human body projecting thro the mould, in the other the whole skeleton
                  exposed. Some of our party told me of a third in which the worms were at work – but
                  I shrunk from the sight. You will rejoice to hear that the English are as well spoken
                  of for their deportment in peace as in war. It is far otherwise with the Prussians,
                  concerning them there is but one opinion, – their brutality is said to exceed that
                  of the French, &amp; of their intolerable insolences I have heard but too many proofs.

                  passed a party on their way toward France – some hundred or two – two Gentlemen &amp;
                  two Ladies of the country in a carriage had come up with them, &amp; these ruffians would
                  not allow them to pass, but compelled them to wait &amp; follow the slow pace of foot
                  soldiers! This we ourselves saw. Next to the English the Belgians have the best character
                  for discipline.</p>

                  </div> to be completed &amp; sent after me, the price 500 franks. This is an invaluable acquisition.
                  Neither our time or money will allow us to reach the Rhine, – we turn back from Aix
                  la Chapelle, &amp; take the route of Maestricht &amp; Louvaine to Antwerp thence to Ghent
                  again, &amp; cross from Calais. I bought at Bruges a French history of Brazil just published
                  by M Alphonse de Beauchamp in three volumes octavo.

                  to see if any new light had been thrown upon the subject by modern authors. Meantime
                  a compilation upon this history had appeared in England but the English Author M.
                  Southey had brought no new lights. he had promised much for his second volume, – but
                  the hope of Literary Europe had been again deceived for this second vol. so emphatically
                  promised had not appeared. – I dare say no person regrets this delay so much as M.
                  Beauchamp himself, he having stolen the whole of his two first vol. &amp; about a third
                  part of the other from the very M Southey whom he abuses. He has copied my references
                  as the best of his own authorities (Manuscript &amp; all!) &amp; he has committed blunders
                  which prove beyond all doubt that he does not even understand Portugueze. I have been
                  much diverted by this fellows impudence. The table is laid &amp; the knives &amp; forks rattling
                  a pleasant note of preparation as the woman waiter arranges them. God bless you. I
                  have hurried thro the sheet, &amp; thus pleasantly beguiled what would else have been
