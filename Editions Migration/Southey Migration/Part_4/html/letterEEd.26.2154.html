                  </div> You anticipated its effect truly, – I was most compleatly astonished, &amp; my astonishment
                  at one time found a very natural vent in the form of laughter, – but it is a vexatious
                  business; &amp; it affected <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> so much that I was really afraid <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> in the course of the night that some serious <span class="strikethrough">injuri</span> consequences might have ensued.

                  </div> yard? how was it possible that three men should not succeed in forcing a woman thro
                  an open door? &amp; some other circumstances tending to excite a suspicion that it was
                  a trumped up story by the girl. If however she swears to her story &amp; to him, &amp; the
                  Landlady swears to an alibi, the case must then be decided by character, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</a> I think is safe enough. Still Juries are so very far from being infallible that I
                  am not without &lt;some&gt; anxiety <span class="strikethrough">xx x</span> concerning the court – for disagreable as it would be to himself to be convicted,
                  I verily believe it would produce more serious evil to me just at this time. – Who
                  would ever think of drawing such a piece of ill luck as this in the lottery of life?
                  However if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerGeorge">Georges</a> Counsel does his duty, there can be little fear. He must be prepared to prove <span class="strikethrough">the history of</span> in what manner he past the evening, &amp; to show that he was sober. If it were not for
                  the unaccountable circumstance of the key, the case could hardly be brought into court.
                  – Was the door found unlocked the next morning, or is it pretended that he stopt to
                  lock it? I cannot help suspecting roguery. It is so absurd to suppose that he would
                  have chosen a place to commit the crime in which so naturally not only lead to suspicion,
                  but to proof against him, – &amp; that any stranger should have a key seems inexplicable.
                  – I wrote to him about money, &amp; wish I could manage better about it. However you will
                  be able to get my <span class="strikethrough">draught</span> draft cashed, &amp; the discount is not worth a thought. I used to draw upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</a> at three days sight, but he has taken advantage of the failure of these Northern banks
                  to make me draw at three months.
