               <p>I delayed writing, being apprehensive that a sick nursemaid, &amp; some ailings among
                  the children might put off our departure. At present our purpose is to set off on
                  Tuesday, that is the day after tomorrow. We stop a day or two at Nottingham, – to
                  save trouble as well as expence we shall travel by mail wherever we can, – so I think
                  we shall breakfast with you on Monday the 17<sup>th</sup>. I would make it a day sooner, but you subject yourself to danger as well as delay
                  if you go on the mail at those times when it is not bound to arrive in London at a
                  given hour. They take that opportunity of breaking in new horses: – in which operation
                  they had once nearly broken my neck. Hasker
