               have vested in a twelfth part of the property of the work, which has been vacated
               for the purpose of attaching me more intimately to its interests; – for this <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJames">Ballantyne</a> gives me his bill at twelve months for 80 £, &amp; this interest will not diminish as
               long as the book keeps up its sale, – which it will do I trust as long as I continue
               to bear the main part in it. 4000 copies are printed. the outlay has been about 2500
               £. – the net profits you see 960 £. The Ballantynes find their account in their additional
               profits, one as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJames">printer</a>, the other as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">publisher</a>, – or in technical phrase, <span class="ital">husband</span> of the work.</p>
