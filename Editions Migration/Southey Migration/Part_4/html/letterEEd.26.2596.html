            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I had resolved upon writing to you this evening, and, alas! my thoughts are drawn
                  towards you very mournfully by a letter which this post has brought, informing me
                  of poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DusautoyJame">Dusautoy’s</a> death. The fever at Cambridge has proved fatal to him, and he, too, like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a>, rests in the cloister of his own college!
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Dusautoy had written to Southey for advice in 1813; see Southey to James Dusautoy,
                           12 February 1813, Letter 2220. Southey told him to go to University, sought the advice
                           of friends, including Neville White, and helped secure the young man’s admission to
                           Emmanuel College, Cambridge.</span></div>
                  </div> You may well suppose that this very much affects me. The poor lad originally wrote
                  to me in consequence of reading <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> “Remains.”

                  </div> I advised him to a course which, to all human foresight, might have seemed most conducive
                  to his welfare, and that course has led him to an early grave. It would be worse than
                  weakness to feel anything like self-reproach, but it is impossible not to feel something
                  more than an ordinary regret. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteJames">James</a> will be shocked at this event. I thank God that <span class="ital">he</span> has escaped this danger, and I pray God the pestilence (for so it may be called) may
                  not spread. My letter (which is from Tillbrooke

                  uninhabited desert!” God be merciful to us! How frail a thing is human life! And if

                  I hardly dare ask myself the question. He goes with the invaluable advantage of having

                  </div> in the University old enough to be his adviser, and not too old to be his friend;
                  he takes with him a larger stock of Greek than is often carried to college, a powerful
                  intellect, good principles, and good feelings. But with these he has some dangerous
                  accompaniments; for he is headstrong, violent, perilously disposed to justify whatever
                  he may wish to do, eccentric in all his ways, and willing to persuade himself that
                  there is a merit in eccentricity. But his greatest danger arises from a mournful cause,
                  against which it is impossible to protect, or even to caution him, – it arises from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father</a>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a> is able to comprehend the powers of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father’s</a> mind, and has for it all that veneration which it is both natural and proper that
                  he should feel. The conduct of the father is, of course, a subject on which no one
                  would speak to the son; and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a>, I believe, contrives to keep it out of his own sight; but if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> should take it in his head to send for the boy to pass any of his vacations with him,
                  there is the most imminent danger of his unsettling his mind upon the most important
                  subjects, and the end would be utter and irremediable ruin. For <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a>, totally regardless of all consequences, will lead him into all the depths and mazes
                  of metaphysics: he would root up from his mind, without intending it, all established
                  principles; and if he should succeed in establishing others in their place, with one
                  of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley’s</a> ardour and sincerity, they would never serve for the practical purposes of society,
                  and he would be thrown out from the only profession or way of life for which he is
                  qualified. This you see it is absolutely impossible to prevent. I know but too well,
                  and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> also knows, what an evil it is to be thus as it were cut adrift upon the sea of life;
                  but experience is lost upon him.</p>
