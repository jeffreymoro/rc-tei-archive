               <div class="l">Of Cordoba where Alahor held his court,</div>
               <div class="l">Lay many a long day’s journey interpos’d</div>
               <div class="l">And many a mountain range hath Roderick crossd</div>
               <div class="l">And many a lovely vale, ere he beheld</div>
               <div class="l">Where Betis wandering thro the unbounded plain</div>
               <div class="l">Roll’d his majestic waters. There at eve</div>
               <div class="l">Entering an inn, he took his humble seat</div>
               <div class="l">With other travellers round the crackling hearth</div>
               <div class="l">Where heath &amp; cistus gave their fragrant flame.</div>
               <div class="l">That flame no longer as in other times</div>
               <div class="l">Lit up the countenance of easy mirth</div>
               <div class="l">And light discourse; the talk which now went round</div>
               <div class="l">Was of the grief that hung at every heart,</div>
               <div class="l">Of Spain subdued; the sceptre of the Goths</div>
               <div class="l">Broken, their nation &amp; their name effaced, –</div>
               <div class="l">Slaughter &amp; Mourning which had left no house</div>
               <div class="l">Unvisited, &amp; Shame which set its mark</div>
               <div class="l">On every Spaniards face. One who had seen</div>
               <div class="l">His sons fall bravely at his side, bewaild</div>
               <div class="l">The unhappy chance which rescuing him from death</div>
               <div class="l">Left him the last of all his family,</div>
               <div class="l">Yet he rejoiced to think that none who drew</div>
               <div class="l">Their blood from him, remaind to wear the yoke</div>
               <div class="l">Be at the miscreants’ beck, &amp; propagate</div>
               <div class="l">A breed of slaves to serve them. Here sate one</div>
               <div class="l">Who told of fair possessions lost, &amp; babes</div>
               <div class="l">To goodly fortune born, of all bereft.</div>
               <div class="l">Another for a virgin daughter mournd</div>
               <div class="l">The lewd barbarians prey: a fourth had seen</div>
               <div class="l">His only child forsake him in his age,</div>
               <div class="l">And for a Moor renounce her hope in Christ:</div>
               <div class="l">His was the heaviest grief of all, he said,</div>
               <div class="l">And clenching as he spake his hoary locks</div>

               <div class="l">Sufficient is the dreadful load of guilt</div>
               <div class="l">Which lies upon his miserable soul!</div>
               <div class="l">O brother do not curse the sinful soul</div>

               <div class="l">But then an old man who had sate till now</div>
               <div class="l">A silent listener from his seat arose,</div>
               <div class="l">And moving round to Roderick took his hand;</div>
               <div class="l">Christ bless thee, brother, for that Xtian speech</div>
               <div class="l">He said, &amp; shame on me that any tongue</div>
               <div class="l">Readier than mine was found to utter it! –</div>
               <div class="l">His own emotion filld him while he spake,</div>
               <div class="l">So that he did not feel how Rodericks hand</div>
               <div class="l">Shook like a palsied limb; &amp; none could see</div>
               <div class="l">How at his well-known voice the countenance</div>
               <div class="l">Of that poor traveller suddenly was changed</div>
               <div class="l">And sunk with deadlier paleness; – for the flame</div>
               <div class="l">Was spent, &amp; from behind him, on the wall</div>
               <div class="l">High-hung, the lamp with feeble glimmering playd</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Oh! it is ever thus! the old man exclaim’d,</div>
               <div class="l">The crimes &amp; woes of universal Spain</div>
               <div class="l">Are charged on him, &amp; curses which should point</div>
               <div class="l">At living heads, pursue beyond the grave</div>
               <div class="l">His poor unhappy soul! As if his deeds</div>
               <div class="l">Had wrought the fall of our old monarchy,</div>
               <div class="l">As if the Musselmen in their career</div>
               <div class="l">Would neer have overleapd the strait which parts</div>
               <div class="l">Iberia from the Mauritanian shore</div>
               <div class="l">If Julian had not beckoned them! Alas</div>
               <div class="l">The evils which drew on our overthrow</div>
               <div class="l">Would soon by other means have <span class="strikethrough">wrought</span> &lt;workd&gt; their end,</div>
               <div class="l">Tho Julians daughter should have lived &amp; died</div>
               <div class="l">A Virgin vowd &amp; veiled.</div>
               <div class="l">Touch not on that</div>
               <div class="l">Shrinking with inward shiverings at the thought,</div>
               <div class="l">The penitent exclaimd, Oh if thou lovest</div>
               <div class="l">The soul of Roderick, touch not on that deed!</div>
               <div class="l">God in his mercy may forgive it him,</div>
               <div class="l">But human tongue must never speak his name</div>
               <div class="l">Without reproach &amp; utter infamy</div>
               <div class="l">For that abhorred act. Even thou, – But here</div>
               <div class="l">Siverian taking up the word, broke off</div>
               <div class="l">Unwittingly the incautious speech; Even I</div>
               <div class="l">Quoth he, who nurst him in his fathers hall</div>
               <div class="l">Even I can only for that deed of shame</div>
               <div class="l">Offer in agony my secret prayers</div>
               <div class="l">But Spain hath witnessd other crimes as foul</div>
               <div class="l">Have we not seen Favilas shameless wife</div>
               <div class="l">Thrond in Witiza’s ivory car parade</div>
               <div class="l">Our towns in regal pageantry, &amp; bid</div>
               <div class="l">The adulterous tyrant in her husbands blood</div>
               <div class="l">Dip his accursed hands! Did we not see</div>
               <div class="l">Pelayo by that bloody kings pursuit,</div>
               <div class="l">And that unnatural mother, from the land</div>
               <div class="l">With open outcry like an outward thief</div>
               <div class="l">Hunted? – And saw ye not Theodofred</div>
               <div class="l">As through the streets I guided his dark steps</div>
               <div class="l">Roll mournfully toward the noon-day sun</div>
               <div class="l">His blank &amp; senseless eye balls! Spain saw this</div>
               <div class="l">And suffered it. – I seek not to excuse</div>
               <div class="l">The sins of Roderick, – Jesu who beholds</div>
               <div class="l">The burning tears I shed in solitude</div>
               <div class="l">Knows how I plead for them in midnight prayer</div>
               <div class="l">But if when he victoriously revenged</div>
               <div class="l">The wrongs of Chindasuinthos house, his sword</div>
               <div class="l">Had not for mercy turnd aside its edge,</div>
               <div class="l">Oh what a day of glory had been seen</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the banks of Chrysus! Curse not him</div>
               <div class="l">Who in that fatal conflict to the last</div>
               <div class="l">So valiantly maintaind his countrys cause.</div>
               <div class="l">But if your sorrow needs will find its vent</div>
               <div class="l">In curses, let you imprecations strike</div>
               <div class="l">The caitiffs, who when Rodericks horned helm</div>
               <div class="l">Rose eminent amid the thickest fight,</div>
               <div class="l">Betraying him who spar’d &amp; trusted them,</div>
               <div class="l">Forsook their King, their Country &amp; their God,</div>
               <div class="l">And gave the Moor his conquest!</div>
               <div class="l">Aye, they said,</div>
               <div class="l">These were Witizas hateful progeny,</div>
               <div class="l">And in an evil hour the unhappy King</div>
               <div class="l">Had spar d the viperous brood. With that they talkd</div>
               <div class="l">How Sisibert &amp; Ebba thro the land</div>
               <div class="l">Guided the foe, &amp; Orpas who had cast</div>
               <div class="l">The mitre from his renegado brow,</div>
               <div class="l">Went with the armies of the Infidels.</div>
               <div class="l">And how in Hispalis, even where his hands</div>
               <div class="l">Had ministerd so oft the bread of life,</div>
               <div class="l">The circumcised apostate did now shame</div>
               <div class="l">To show in open day his turband head.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">But Roderick while they communed this had ceased</div>
               <div class="l">To hear, such painfullest anxiety</div>
               <div class="l">The sight of that old venerable man</div>
               <div class="l">Awoke. A sickening thought came over him, –</div>
               <div class="l">The hope which led him from his hermitage</div>
               <div class="l">Seemd now for ever gone; for well he knew</div>
               <div class="l">Nothing but death might break the ties which bound</div>
               <div class="l">This faithful servant to his fathers house.</div>
               <div class="l">She then for whose forgiveness <span class="strikethrough">she</span> he had yearned</div>
               <div class="l">Who in her blessing would have given &amp; found</div>
               <div class="l">The peace of Heaven, she then was to the grave</div>
               <div class="l">Gone down disconsolate at last! in this</div>
               <div class="l">Of all the <span class="strikethrough">griefs</span> &lt;woes&gt; of her unhappy life</div>
               <div class="l">Unhappiest that she did not live to see</div>
               <div class="l">God had vouchsafd repentance to her child.</div>
               <div class="l">But then a hope arose, – perchance she lived,</div>
               <div class="l">The weighty cause which led Siverian here</div>
               <div class="l">Might draw him from her side: – better to know</div>
               <div class="l">The worst than fear it. And with that he bent</div>
               <div class="l">Over the embers, &amp; with a head half-raisd</div>
               <div class="l">Aslant, &amp; shadowd by his hand, he said,</div>
               <div class="l">Where is King Rodericks mother, – lives she still?</div>
               <div class="l">God hath upheld her, the old man replied,</div>
               <div class="l">She bears this last &amp; heaviest of her griefs</div>
               <div class="l">Not as she bore her husband wrongs, when hope</div>
               <div class="l">And her indignant heart supported her,</div>
               <div class="l">But patiently like one who finds from heaven</div>
               <div class="l">A comfort which this world can neither give</div>
               <div class="l">Nor take away, – Roderick enquired no more,</div>
               <div class="l">His breath a silent prayer in gratitude,</div>
               <div class="l">Then wrapt his cloak around him, &amp; lay down</div>
               <div class="l">Where he might weep unseen.</div>
               <div class="l">When morning came,</div>
               <div class="l">Earliest of all the travellers he went forth</div>
               <div class="l">And lingered for Siverian by the way,</div>
               <div class="l">Beside a fountain where the constant fall</div>
               <div class="l">Of water its perpetual gurgling made,</div>
               <div class="l">To the way faring or the musing man</div>
               <div class="l">Sweetest of all sweet sounds. The Xtian hand</div>
               <div class="l">Whose general charity for man &amp; beast</div>
               <div class="l">Built it in better times, had with a cross</div>
               <div class="l">Of well hewn stone crested the pious work,</div>
               <div class="l">Which now the misbelievers had cast down</div>
               <div class="l">And broken in the dust it lay defild.</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick beheld it lying at his feet,</div>
               <div class="l">And gathering reverently the fragments up</div>
               <div class="l">Placed them within the cistern, &amp; restord</div>
               <div class="l">With careful collocation its dear form,</div>
               <div class="l">So might the waters like a chrystal shrine</div>
               <div class="l">Preserve it from pollution. Kneeling then,</div>
               <div class="l">Oer the memorial of redeeming love</div>
               <div class="l">He bent, &amp; mingled with the fount his tears</div>
               <div class="l">And pourd his spirit to the Crucified.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">A Moor came by &amp; seeing him exclaimd</div>
               <div class="l">Ah Kaffer! Worshipper of wood &amp; stone,</div>
               <div class="l">God’s curse confound thee! – &amp; as Roderick turned</div>
               <div class="l">His face, the miscreant spurnd him with his foot</div>
               <div class="l">Between the eyes. The indignant King arose</div>
               <div class="l">And felld him to the earth. with that the knave</div>
               <div class="l">Drew forth his dagger, rising as he cried,</div>
               <div class="l">What, darest thou thou infidel &amp; slave</div>
               <div class="l">Strike a believer? And he aimd a blow</div>
               <div class="l">At Rodericks breast. But Roderick caught his arm</div>
               <div class="l">And closd &amp; wrenchd the dagger from his hold</div>
               <div class="l">(Such timely strength did those emaciate limbs</div>
               <div class="l">From indignation draw) &amp; in his neck</div>
               <div class="l">With mortal stroke he drove the avenging steel</div>
               <div class="l">Hilt deep: – then as the thirsty sand drank in</div>
               <div class="l">The expiring miscreants blood, he lookd around</div>
               <div class="l">In sudden apprehension lest the Moors</div>
               <div class="l">Had seen them. But Siverian was in sight</div>
               <div class="l">The only traveller, &amp; he smote his mule</div>
               <div class="l">And hastened up. Ah brother, said the old man,</div>
               <div class="l">Thine is a spirit of the ancient mold,</div>
               <div class="l">And would to God a thousand man like thee</div>
               <div class="l">Had fought at Rodericks side on that last day</div>
               <div class="l">When treason overpowerd him! Now alas</div>
               <div class="l">A manly Gothic heart doth ill accord</div>
               <div class="l">With these unhappy times. – Come let us hide</div>
               <div class="l">This carrion, while the favouring hour permits.</div>

               <div class="l">So saying he alighted. Soon they scoopd</div>
               <div class="l">Amid loose-lying sand a hasty grave</div>
               <div class="l">And levelld over it the easy soil.</div>
               <div class="l">Father, quoth Roderick, as they journeyd on</div>
               <div class="l">Let this thing be a seal &amp; sacrament</div>
               <div class="l">Of truth between us. – Wherefore should there be</div>
               <div class="l">Concealment between two right Gothic hearts</div>
               <div class="l">In evil days like these? What thou hast seen</div>
               <div class="l">Is but the first fruit of the sacrifice</div>
               <div class="l">Which on this injured &amp; polluted soil,</div>
               <div class="l">As on a bloody altar, I have sworn</div>
               <div class="l">To offer to insulted Heaven for Spain</div>
               <div class="l">Her vengeance &amp; her expiation: this</div>
               <div class="l">Was but a hasty act by sudden wrong</div>
               <div class="l">Provoked, but I am bound for Cordoba</div>
               <div class="l">On weighty mission from Visonia sent,</div>
               <div class="l">To breathe into Pelayo’s ear a voice</div>
               <div class="l">Of spirit-stirring power, which like the trump</div>
               <div class="l">Of the Arch-Angel shall awake dead Spain.</div>
               <div class="l">The northern mountaineers are unsubdued,</div>
               <div class="l">They call upon Pelayo for their chief.</div>
               <div class="l">Odoar &amp; Urban tell him that the hour</div>
               <div class="l">Is come. Thou too, I ween, old man art chargd</div>
               <div class="l">With no light errand, or thou wouldst not now</div>
               <div class="l">Have left the ruins of thy masters house</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Who art thou, cried Siverian as he searchd</div>
               <div class="l">The wan &amp; withered features of the King.</div>
               <div class="l">The face is of a stranger, but thy voice</div>
               <div class="l">Disturbs me like a dream.</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick replied</div>
               <div class="l">Thou seest me as I am, a stranger: one</div>
               <div class="l">Whose fortunes in the general wreck were lost,</div>
               <div class="l">His name &amp; lineage utterly extinct,</div>
               <div class="l">Himself in mercy spard, surviving all:</div>
               <div class="l">In mercy . . that the bitter cup might heal</div>
               <div class="l">A soul diseas’d. Now having cast the slough</div>
               <div class="l">Of old offences, thou beholdest me</div>
               <div class="l">A man new-born, in second baptism named</div>
               <div class="l">Like those who in Judea bravely raisd</div>
               <div class="l">Against a Heathens impious tyranny</div>
               <div class="l">The banner of Jehovah, Maccabee.</div>
               <div class="l">So call me: in that name hath Urban laid</div>
               <div class="l">His consecrating hands upon my head.</div>
               <div class="l">And in that name have I myself for Spain</div>
               <div class="l">Devoted. Tell me now why thou art sent</div>
               <div class="l">To Cordoba, for sure thou goest not</div>
               <div class="l">An idle gazer to the Conquerors court.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Thou judgest well, the old man replied, I too</div>
               <div class="l">Seek the Cantabrian Prince, the hope of Spain,</div>
               <div class="l">With other tidings charged, for other end</div>
               <div class="l">Designd, yet such as well may work with thine.</div>
               <div class="l">My noble Mistress sends me to avert</div>
               <div class="l">The shame that threats his house. The renegade</div>
               <div class="l">Munuza, he who for the Infidels</div>
               <div class="l">Oppresses Gegio, insolently woos</div>
               <div class="l">His sister. Moulded in a wicked womb</div>
               <div class="l">The unworthy Guisla hath inherited</div>
               <div class="l">Her mothers leprous taint, &amp; willingly</div>
               <div class="l">She to the circumcised &amp; upstart slave,</div>
               <div class="l">Disdaining all admonishment, gives ear.</div>
               <div class="l">The Lady Gaudiosa saw in this,</div>
               <div class="l">With the quick foresight of maternal <span class="strikethrough">fear</span> love</div>
               <div class="l">The impending danger to her husbands house,</div>
               <div class="l">Knowing his generous spirit neer will brook</div>
               <div class="l">The base alliance. Guisla lewdly sets</div>
               <div class="l">His will at nought; but that vile renegade</div>
               <div class="l">From hatred &amp; from avarice &amp; from fear</div>
               <div class="l">Will seek the extinction of Pelayos line.</div>
               <div class="l">This too my venerable Mistress sees,</div>
               <div class="l">Therefore these valiant &amp; high-minded Dames</div>
               <div class="l">Send me to Cordoba, that if the Prince</div>
               <div class="l">Cannot by timely interdiction stop</div>
               <div class="l">The irrevocable act of infamy,</div>
               <div class="l">He may at least to his own safety look,</div>
               <div class="l">Being timely warn’d.</div>
               <div class="l">Thy Mistress sojourns then</div>
               <div class="l">With Gaudiosa in Pelayo’s hall?</div>
               <div class="l">Said Roderick. Tis her natural home rejoind</div>
               <div class="l">Siverian. Chindasuinthos royal bones</div>
               <div class="l">Hath ever shard one lot of weal or woe</div>
               <div class="l">And she who hath beheld her own fair shoot,</div>
               <div class="l">Struck by Heaven’s bolt, seeks shelter now beneath</div>
               <div class="l">The only branch of its majestic stem</div>
               <div class="l">That still survives the storm.</div>
               <div class="l">Thus they pursued</div>
               <div class="l">Their journey, each from other gathering store</div>
               <div class="l">For thought, with many a silent interval</div>
               <div class="l">Of mournful meditation, till they saw</div>
               <div class="l">The temples &amp; the towers of Cordoba</div>
               <div class="l">Shining majestic in the light of eve.</div>
               <div class="l">Before them Betis rolld his glittering stream</div>
               <div class="l">In many a silvery winding traced afar</div>
               <div class="l">Amid the ample plain: behind the walls</div>
               <div class="l">And stately piles which crownd its margin, rich</div>
               <div class="l">With olives, &amp; with sunny slope of vines,</div>
               <div class="l">And many a lovely hamlet interspers’d</div>
               <div class="l">Whose citron bowers were once the abode of peace</div>
               <div class="l">Height above height receding hills were seen</div>
               <div class="l">Imbued with evening hues; &amp; over all</div>
               <div class="l">The summits of the dark sierra rose</div>
               <div class="l">Lifting their heads amid the silent sky.</div>
               <div class="l">The traveller who with a heart at ease</div>
               <div class="l">Had seen this goodly vision, would have loved</div>
               <div class="l">To linger, seeking with insatiate sight</div>
               <div class="l">To treasure up its image, deep impressd</div>
               <div class="l">A joy for years to come. O Cordoba</div>
               <div class="l">Exclaimd the old man, how princely are thy towers</div>
               <div class="l">How fair thy vales, thy hills how beautiful!</div>
               <div class="l">The Sun who sheds on thee his parting smiles</div>
               <div class="l">Sees not in all his wide career, a scene</div>
               <div class="l">Lovelier, nor more exuberantly blest</div>
               <div class="l">By bounteous earth &amp; heaven! <span class="strikethrough">x</span> the very gales</div>
               <div class="l">Of Eden waft not from the immortal bowers</div>
               <div class="l">Odours to sense more exquisite, than these</div>
               <div class="l">Which breathing from thy groves &amp; gardens now</div>
               <div class="l">Recall in me such thoughts of bitterness!</div>
               <div class="l">The time has been when happy was their lot</div>
               <div class="l">Who had their birthright here, but happy now</div>
               <div class="l">Are they who to thy bosom are gone home,</div>
               <div class="l">Because they feel not in their graves the feet</div>
               <div class="l">That trample upon Spain. Tis well that age</div>
               <div class="l">Hath made me like a child that I can weep.</div>
               <div class="l">My heart would else have broken, overcharged</div>
               <div class="l">And I, false servant, should lie down to rest</div>
               <div class="l">Before my work is done.</div>
               <div class="l">Hard by their path</div>
               <div class="l">A little way without the walls they stood</div>
               <div class="l">An edifice, whereto as by a spell</div>
               <div class="l">Siverians heart was drawn. Brother, said he,</div>
               <div class="l">Tis like the urgency of our return</div>
               <div class="l">Will brook of no retardment, &amp; this spot</div>
               <div class="l">It were a sin if I should pass &amp; leave</div>
               <div class="l">Unvisited. Beseech you, turn with me</div>
               <div class="l">Just while I offer up one duteous prayer.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Roderick made no reply; he had not dar’d</div>
               <div class="l">To turn his face toward those walls, but now</div>
               <div class="l">He followed, where the old man led the way,</div>
               <div class="l">Lord! in his heart the silent sufferer said,</div>
               <div class="l">Forgive my feeble soul which would have shrunk</div>
               <div class="l">From this, – for what am I that I should put</div>
               <div class="l">The bitter cup aside! Oh let my shame</div>
               <div class="l">And anguish be accepted in thy sight!</div>
