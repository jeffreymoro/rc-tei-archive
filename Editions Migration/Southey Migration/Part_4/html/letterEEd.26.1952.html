                  stipulating an advance of 4/ per acre after the first ten. He has also many thousand
                  acres to let for inclosing for the same term, at 3/ for the first ten years, 6/ for
                  the remainder. a rail road is now forming within a mile of the estate, along a level

                  about 1600 acres, to whom he would give every encouragement, but who ought to have
                  about 6, or 7000 £ at command. The Taylors

                  is very low, because the roads are bad, the farming slovenly, &amp; there is a want of
                  large towns to take off the produce. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Llanthony">Lanthony</a> however has fewer of these disadvantages than most other parts of the adjoining country.
