               <p>The same post which brought your letter, has enabled me to remove your anxiety concerning <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a>, – or at least to convert it into temporary anger, – which is a much better kind
                  of commutation than Parliament ever favours us with in the form of a tax. In consequence
                  of a letter from Gale &amp; Curtis
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The London publishers and booksellers John Gale (dates unknown) and Thomas Curtis
                           (1787–1859). In May 1812 they issued Coleridge’s The Friend in book form. It had originally
                           appeared in 1808–1809 in 27 instalments.</span></div>
                  </div> I wrote last night to Penrith to enquire about him, &amp; have just been informed that
                  there he is still, – his delay has partly &lt;been&gt; owing to business about the Friend,
                  partly to the state of the roads, – &amp; to these no doubt he will wholly impute it.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Coleridge was in the Lakes between February-March 1812 to collect unstamped numbers
                           of The Friend (1808–1809), prior to its reissue by Gale and Curtis.</span></div>
                  </div> But latterly the real cause has been that he has not got up early enough to set off
                  at ten in the morning. It is useless to grieve over these things – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> will always sacrifice his own interests &amp; the feelings of all belonging to him, rather
                  than encounter the slightest temporary inconvenience, tho this <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> neglect of duty <span class="strikethrough">x</span> is sure to <span class="strikethrough">bring immediately</span> bring with it its immediate punishment. We must take him as he is, – alike unequalled
                  for moral imbecility, &amp; intellectual strength. – It is more likely that he has never
                  sent you the draft than that it is lost.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I was exceedingly rejoiced to hear from Penrith that the Friend has been sent off
               to Gale &amp; Curtis, – will you if you pass that way, step in &amp; inform them so. Their
               letter was very urgent about it. It came directed to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> C.</a> opened it. You can say <span class="strikethrough">that</span> without reference to this letter, that I have informed you the numbers were sent
               off to them on Tuesday last by the waggon.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thank you about the spoons. I should prefer them plain, but as to size &amp; form as handsome
                  as they can be. Your mention of the motto is lucky, – mine is In Labore Quies.

                  </div> &amp; this under the ancient S will look very well. <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xx xxxx xxx</span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> will not be persuaded to have the case; one of these days perhaps we may collect things
                  enough to want one.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Pray write to us when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> arrives, &amp; tell us from time to time of his proceedings, – for it is vain to hope
               that he will write himself. –</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You seem to suppose that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> has written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>, which is not the case, – he often promised <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> C</a> that he would the next day, but it always proved like the rest of his promises. I
                  wish with all my soul the breach were closed, for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">W.</a> has been no otherwise to blame than in speak unreservedly but not unfriendlily of
                  one friend to another, – the folly of having such a man as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontaguBasil">M.</a> for a <span class="ital">friend</span> I most fully admit.
