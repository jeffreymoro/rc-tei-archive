                           Correspondence, accidentally discovered in Europe, containing a favourable View of

                           By some Unknown Foreigner (1810), in Quarterly Review, 10 (January 1814), 494–530.
                           The author of the offending article, which was highly critical of the United States,

               <p>Allow me, Sir, to reply through the medium of the COURIER, – a very few lines will
                  suffice: – there can be no better means of making my reply known in America; and in
                  this country, as well as in that, it may be useful to shew the exceeding impropriety
                  of attacking any man as the author of an anonymous publication, without the fullest
                  proof that he is so. I did not write the Criticism on Inchiquin’s Letters; and everybody
                  in England who knows the Quarterly Review, knows that I am not the Editor of it.

            <p class="indent1">Had the American writer observed any kind of decency in his attack, I would have addressed
               a private letter to him, through his publisher, requesting that he would publicly
               acknowledge his mistake, and thereby atone, as far as he could, for an unprovoked
               wrong. But the style and temper of his pamphlet preclude all courtesy on my part;
               nor shall I condescend to notice him farther than to express a hope that this letter
               may be copied into the American papers. A writer of his stamp would probably neither
               have sufficient sense of honour to believe my disavowal, nor to make it public.</p>
