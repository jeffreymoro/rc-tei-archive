                  of the son therefore not only cut off all their hopes of again rising in the world,
                  but bereft them of a considerable part of their means of support. Since that event
                  the father has been disabled from discharging the duties of his situation by illness.

                  themselves strenuously, about 300£ might be raised, which would suffice to place the
                  daughter in some way of life that might enable her to support herself &amp; her parents
                  in respectability. I am doing my best to swell the subscription list, &amp; I hope the

                  certainly (in my judgement) capable of attaining a very distinguished rank, had it

                  domestic relation, he was as far as I can learn from his most intimate friends, or
                  judge from his letters, as nearly as man can be supposed to be, without spot or stain.
                  I am sure that no person who subscribes to the book will consider its cost as ill-bestowed,
                  even if in bestowing the half-guinea they looked to the half-guineas worth. In its
