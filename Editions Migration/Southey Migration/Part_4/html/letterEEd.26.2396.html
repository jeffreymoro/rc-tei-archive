               <p>Your letter operated well. Like a good boy I began my task immediately after its arrival,
                  &amp; have now compleated one part, &amp; begun the second of a poem which is to consist of
                  three. Can you give me a better title than <span class="ital">Carmen Maritale</span>?

                           DNB). The poem became The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale (1816), though it celebrated
                           the Princess’s marriage to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790–1865; DNB) and not the Hereditary
                           Prince of Orange, William (1792–1849; King of the Netherlands 1840–1849), whose engagement
                           to Princess Charlotte was broken off in June 1814.</span></div>
                  </div> I distrust my own Latinity, which has long been disused &amp; never was very good. The
                  poem is in six lined stanzas, – first a Proem, so called rather than Introduction,
                  that the antiquated word may put the reader in tune for what follows. <span class="strikethrough">the</span> It is a poets egotism, making the best of the laurel, &amp; passing to the present subject
                  by professing &lt;at first&gt; an unfitness for it. the second part will be a vision wherein
                  allegorical personages give good advice, – &amp; the concluding part a justification of
                  the serious strain which has been chosen, – something about the King,
