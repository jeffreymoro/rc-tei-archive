               <p>I have read Sir J Malcolms book, the first volume with disappointment, the second

                  In the historical part the information is <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> almost exclusively oriental, – when Roman &amp; Byzantine writers might have supplied

                  There can be no better book for a Reviewers purpose. It is a principle with me &lt;in

               Bell in 1808. Southey clearly intended to compare Bell’s methods with those of the

               pursue their own interests and draw their own conclusions. The book Southey had purchased
