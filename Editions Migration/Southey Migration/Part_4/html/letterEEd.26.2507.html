                           1774–1792) appointed a commission, which reported in 1788, to examine how French hospitals
                           could be improved. Southey probably culled his story of the anonymous Frenchman’s
                           view on English hospitals from John Lingard (1771–1851; DNB), The Antiquities of the

                  </div> – &amp; here with due caution respecting <span class="ital">place</span> &amp;c. I wish to tell your story.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am fully convinced that a gradual improvement is going on in the world, has been
               going on from its commencement, &amp; will continue till the &lt;human&gt; race <span class="strikethrough">of men</span> shall attain <span class="strikethrough">the</span> all the perfection of which <span class="strikethrough">they are</span> &lt;it is&gt; capable in this mortal state. This belief grows out of knowledge, – that
               is it is a corollary deduced from the whole history of mankind. It is no little pleasure
               to believe that in no age has this improvement proceeded so rapidly as in the present,
               &amp; that there never was so great a disposition to promote it in those who have the
               power. The disposition indeed is alloyed with much weakness, &amp; much superstition;
               &amp; God knows there are many disturbing powers at work. But much has been done, more
               is doing, &amp; nothing can be of more importance than giving this disposition a good
               direction. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Percevals</a> death was one of the severest losses that England has ever sustained: he was a man
               who not only desired to act well, but desired it ardently; his heart always strengthened
               his understanding, &amp; gave him that power which rose always to the measure of the occasion.
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord Liverpool</a> is a cold man; you may convince his understanding, but you can only obtain an inert
               <span class="strikethrough">consent</span> assent, where zealous cooperation is wanted. It is however enough for <span class="ital">us</span> to know <span class="ital">what</span> ought to be done. The <span class="ital">how</span> &amp; the <span class="ital">when</span> are in the hands of One who knows when &amp; how it may be done best. Oh if this world
               of ours were but well cultivated &amp; weeded well how like the Garden of Eden might it
               be made! – Its evils might almost be reduced to physical sufferings &amp; death; – the
               former continually diminishing, – &amp; the latter always indeed an aweful thing, but
               yet to be converted into hope &amp; joy.</p>
