            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I lose no time in replying to your letter, though the point upon which you consult
               me is one upon which your own opinion is sufficient. In matters of business nothing
               is so desirable as to deal with persons of whom we think well. I, myself, have full
               confidence in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans’</a> house, as is, indeed, apparent by my long connection with them.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We were, indeed, improvident in ever adding to the “Remains,” but it was a very excusable
                  error, arising from a desire to make the work as complete as possible.

                           in 1810 and 1811.</span></div>
                  </div> However, something no doubt may yet be gleaned, and this letter

                  </div> of which you speak is an earnest one. There is no danger of incurring the charge of
                  book-making; “Illustrations” being the title, the purchaser knows that he is buying
                  embellishments for the “Remains,” and the additional pieces which he may find there
                  are so much clear gain. It would be needless to send me the “Illustrations of Scott,”
                  of which you speak. I have seen some, and perhaps the one which you may mean, and
                  I know the nature of such publications.
