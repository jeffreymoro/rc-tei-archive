               <p>Your letter has relieved us this evening from a most anxious expectation. to say that
                  it has increased my vexation would not be true, for nothing could add to that. It
                  is beyond measure vexatious to think that this White-widow as poor Jopy Nicolson

                  </div> — I thought of poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburySirHenryEdward">Bunbury’s</a> house, but it seems <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburySirHenryEdward">Col. Bunbury</a> is coming to it himself. It is not likely however that he will think of making it
                  his residence, even if he withdraws from public life. — There is General Peches great
                  house,

                  </div> — but that is far too large, even if the old part were let off, which it might be,
                  being sufficiently separate: &amp; they ask a heavy rent for it — 70£. I think, — this
                  will never be given for it, but still it will hardly be lowered to any reasonable
                  price, even if the house were in other respects more desirable. As for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs Coleridges</a> part,

                  to us as soon as you can, &amp; look about at leisure. White-Widow has a three years lease,
                  &amp; is laying out money as if she meant to make it her permanent abode. But she goes
                  to London in the winter, &amp; her money is likely enough to get her taken out of our
                  way, in the way of honest matrimony. Besides the backguard boys call her Neddy in
                  the street, &amp; perhaps this may dispose her to think of moving. There is this chance;
                  — there is the probability of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburySirHenryEdward">Col. Bunbury’s</a>, something else may turn up &amp; you must come &amp; wait for the chance.</p>

               <p>— Your letter has justified my fears. I can perfectly enter into your feelings, —
                  but am not the less sorry that they should have this gratification. I always apprehended
                  that when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">Sir E</a>. made his will he would forget that money is not of the same value now that it was

                  </div> In the disposal of his property he seem to have acted with the most perfect propriety:
                  perhaps it would have been better not to have had this disposition kept secret, if
