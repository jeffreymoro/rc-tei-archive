            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your letter gives me the greatest pleasure, far greater than if it had told me of
               the accomplishment of your military schemes. In that case a secret upbraiding would
               have accompanied you thro life, for no man ever yet sacrificed his duty to his inclinations
               without paying the penalty of repentance, unless his nature were compleatly brutalized
               and perverted. I am sure you will be a happier man than if you wore a red coat, I
               think you will be both a wiser and a better one. You will have enough leisure, and
               you know how to employ it.</p>

                  read it with avidity. It came on Christmas Day when we had a house full of company,

                  </div> made their appearance among us most unexpectedly. The next day came my three tea chests
                  from London, and I have not yet stowed away their contents, nor had my room recovered
                  from the litter into which it has been thrown. I have read about half your journal
                  with very great pleasure, more than is to be ascribed to the deep interest which I
                  naturally take in the subject. I think it very probable, more than probable that you
                  might make it into a book which could be generally interesting, but upon this subject
                  I will write to you fully when I have finished that portion which you have sent me.
                  The only objection to publication arises from the necessity of suppressing anything
                  which reflects upon the personal character of individuals, or could give them pain.</p>

                  this, but I can hardly think that the Acta Sanctorum (52 folios of large Size) could
                  be contained in the same package with my other purchases from Ver Beyst,

                  which makes me doubt is that Verbeyst was to have drawn on me for payment for this
                  work (500 francs) and I have received no notice of the bill. Be this as it may. I
                  suppose the books are at this time on board one of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VardonMr">Mr. Vardon’s</a> ships, and, as soon as they arrive I shall forward your maps, and whatever else of

                  which interested me so warmly in the latter part of the article, might have given
                  me cause for jealousy respecting the beginning. My comfort is that the passage must
                  appear like an interpolation from its inconsistency to every thinking reader; and
                  that at no very distant time. I shall have the satisfaction of exposing its fallacy
                  when I write the history of that Convention and stigmatize it as it deserves.
