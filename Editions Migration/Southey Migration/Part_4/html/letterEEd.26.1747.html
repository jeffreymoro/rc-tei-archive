               Jesuit English College at St Omer, France. He moved to England, converted to Protestantism
               and worked as a spy, informing on many of his former fellow Catholics. In 1652 he
               published, under the pseudonym ‘Major John Wright’, <em>The Civil Wars of Spain, in the Beginning of the Reign of Charles the Fifth, Emperor
                  of Germanie, and King of that Nation</em>, a translation of Prudencio de Sandoval (c. 1560–1620), <em>Historia de la Vida y Hechos del Emperador Carlos V</em> (1604–1606). The preface to Wadsworth’s translation was signed by James Howell (1594?–1666;
               <em>DNB</em>), historian, political writer and advocate of moderate, pacifist royalism.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

Wadsworth was received into the Catholic faith in Salamanca
               in August 1605. He remained in Spain, where he was given a pension by the king and
               work by the Inquisition. From 1610–1620 he maintained a good-tempered theological
               debate with his old university friend William Bedell (bap. 1572, d. 1642; <em>DNB</em>), Bishop of Kilmore. Their correspondence was published after Wadsworth’s death by
               Bedell himself in <em>The Copies of Certaine Letters which have Passed betweene Spaine and England in Matter
                  of Religion</em> (1624), and some of the letters were included in Gilbert Burnet (1643–1715; <em>DNB</em>), <em>Life and Letters of Bishop William Bedell</em> (1685), no. 497 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Shuldham’s son. In 1802 Southey had borrowed a Portuguese manuscript from him, a ‘very
               curious paper, written about 1740, by a Portuguese Secretary of State, and containing
               his plans for the improvement of Portugal’. This had previously been summarised by
               Southey as ‘On the State of Portugal’ in <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</em> (Bristol, 1797), pp. 407–463; see Southey to John Rickman, 2 June 1802, <em>Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

               Molyneux Shuldham, Baron Shuldham (1717/18?–1798; <em>DNB</em>). Shuldham had died in Lisbon and his body was brought home in the <em>Colossus</em>, which was also carrying Sir William Hamilton’s (1731–1803; <em>DNB</em>) collection of Greek vases. The ship was wrecked off the Scillies, many of the vases
               were lost, but Shuldham’s corpse was recovered. In 1803 Margaret Shuldham had married
               Richard Meade, 2nd Earl of Clanwilliam (1766–1805). After his death in 1805 she was
               therefore widowed for the third time.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
