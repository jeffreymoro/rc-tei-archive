                  Spenser &amp; Milton held before me, &amp; desire to be judged by those rules.

                  he overlooks every thing which displays either a knowledge of human nature, or a power
                  of affecting the passions, &amp; merely looks for a specimen of <span class="strikethrough">rich</span> &lt;able&gt; versification, – specimen of which he might have found by pricking with a pin
