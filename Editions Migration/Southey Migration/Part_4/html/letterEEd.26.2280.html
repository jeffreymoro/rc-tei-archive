                  If a spirit of colonization could be excited it would be one of the best preventatives
                  of evil &amp; promoters of good. In the wilder parts of the earth this seems to be the
                  best mode of spreading the blessings of civilization &amp; true religion. A regular settlement
                  upon one of the S Sea Islands, would in a very few generations absorb the indigenous
                  population. What a benefit (for instance) it would have been to Otaheite, if the first
                  Missionaries had erected a fort &amp; founded an English town?
