                    said to every body else. &#8211; I, as I had been taught by <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Sir Domine</ref>, bent my right knee, managed the sword with my left hand, &amp; putting

        <p rend="indent1"> Your feelings respecting this appointment will very soon be
                    changed. In me, of all men, it would have been at once gross folly &amp; rank
                    cowardice to have refused it. It becomes honourable if I make it so, &#8211; &amp;
                    what reason have I to distrust either my own intentions or my own powers? &#8211; As
                    for the ridicule which it at first provoked, a well-turned jest will amuse me as
                    much as it can <del>x</del> any one else, &#8211; &amp; even a dull one does me the
                    unintended service of making me appear of importance to the reader. The more
                    abuse, the more censure, the more satire, the more sarcasm the better, &#8211; because
                    the lathe will soon be turned. For be you assured that I shall derive honour
                    from the office <del>from</del> by giving honour to it.</p>

                    at least five hundred guineas. Or if we could only get 200 copies thus disposed
