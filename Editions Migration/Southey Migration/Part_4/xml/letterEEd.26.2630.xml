        <p>British Library, Add MS 30927.  Previously  published: John Wood Warter (ed.), Selections from the
                            Letters of Robert Southey, 4 vols (London, 1856), II, pp. 418&#8211;420.Note: In this letter, Southey sets a conundrum for his reader: in the MS, he writes numbers
                        above certain letters of the alphabet; when the letters are put together in their numerical order, they spell out the solution (see the end of the letter). It is not possible
                        to reproduce this in the electronic text; instead, Southey&#8217;s numbers have been placed in superscript within square brackets after the letter of the alphabet to which they
                        refer.</p>
        <p>These letters were edited with the assistance of Carol Bolton, Tim Fulford and Ian Packer</p>
        <p>For permission to publish the text of MSS in their possession, the editor wishes to thank the Beinecke Rare

											York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations; the Bodleian Library Oxford University; the
