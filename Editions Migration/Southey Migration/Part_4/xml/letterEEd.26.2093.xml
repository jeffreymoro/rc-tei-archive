        <p rend="indent1"> The warm season began with us yesterday, the leaves are now showing themselves, &amp; in the month of May, it is
                    time for those who travel in June to think of their plan of operations. You we fully expect to see, shall we see Hort<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Jillard Hort (1764&#8211;1849), Unitarian minister at Frenchay Chapel in Bristol 1803&#8211;1815 and
                        later in Cork. He taught in the school run by John Prior Estlin and was the addressee of Coleridge&#8217;s &#8216;To the Rev. W. J. H.&#8217;,
                            <title>Poems on Various Subjects</title> (London and Bristol, 1796), pp. [12]-14.</note> also? I have
                        <del>considered</del> informed two visitors from London that they may come to me at any time except during the midsummer holy
                    days, &#8211; hoping that he may come with you. Tell him there is a bed reserved for his use, &amp; that <del>x</del> we shall be very
                    glad if he will come &amp; occupy it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In case he should not come, I think you would like perhaps to make a march Eastward &amp; see two or three persons
                    who would be highly gratified by seeing you. And it so happens that &lt;there&gt; are a number of interesting objects upon the
                    road. I would make a march with you to Durham by way of Newcastle, passing a day with <ref target="people.html#LoshJames">Losh</ref>, &#8211; we would visit the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Doctor</ref> &amp; the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Captain</ref> &#8211; whose <ref target="people.html#SoutheySarah">wife</ref> you will be much
                    pleased with, &amp; who is <del>very</del> desirous of seeing you, above all other persons, &amp; then taking a different road
                        <del>xxx</del> &lt;back&gt; thro the finest part of Yorkshire I would leave you either at Kendal or Lancaster on your way to
                    Liverpool. &#8211; If Hort comes with you we cannot compass this. &#8211; he will have no time to spare from the Lakes &amp; Mountains.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I received a very gratifying communication a few days ago. A letter from the Consul at Bahia telling me that &#8211; the
                    Directors of the Public Library there had commissioned him to forward me some manuscripts relating to Brazil, in the hope that
                    they might be found serviceable in my pursuits.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The diplomat Frederick Lindeman (dates
                        unknown), who had taken up his post at Bahia in 1810. Southey had been sent a copy of Jos&#233; de Anchieta (1534&#8211;1597),
                            <title>Arte de Grammatica da Lingoa mais Usada na Costa do Brasil</title> (1595). This was no. 1530 in the sale catalogue
                        of Southey&#8217;s library, inscribed by him: &#8216;This singularly rare and curious book was sent to me from the Public Library of Bahia
                        de Todos, or Santos, by desire of the Conde des Arcos, then Governor of that Captaincy.&#8217; See also Robert Southey to John May,
                        16 September 1812, Letter 2145.</note> A very unexpected &amp; remarkable instance of liberality. I know but one person at
                    Bahia, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry&#8217;s</ref> late brother-in-law,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        George Sealy (1781&#8211;1843) of the merchants Sealy, Duncan, Walker &amp; Co. Southey had first met him in Portugal in 1800&#8211;1801.
                        He was the brother of Henry Herbert Southey&#8217;s first wife, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMaryHarriet">Mary</ref>.</note> &#8211;
                    &amp; he as, I believe, never looks into any other books than those in his counting house, there is no reason to attribute this to
                    him. Such a thought is very unlikely ever to have entered his head, &#8211; &amp; indeed if it had, in all probability he would have
                    told me of it himself, &#8211; or the Consul would have mentioned his name had he been in any way concerned. The papers are at the
