        <p rend="indent1"> Your project of a View of the World has hardly been out of my
                    thoughts since the receipt of your letter. I meant in the Life of George 3. to
                    have given a summary account of the state of all those countries over which the
                    influence of G Britain extends &lt;or with which its political history was in
                    any degree connected&gt;.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Neither a
                        &#8216;View of the World&#8217; or the &#8216;Life&#8217; of George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of the
                        United Kingdom 1820&#8211;1830; <title>DNB</title>) were written.</note> My plan
                    may perhaps be the better for having its object limited.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I was at <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref>
                    table when the scheme of his Collection of Voyages &amp; Travels was first
                    suggested: &amp; I was asked to undertake it. This I declined upon the ground
                    that it required that sort of scientific knowledge which <ref target="people.html#BurneyJames">Cap<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Burney</ref>
                    possesses, &amp; of which I knew nothing, &#8211; but at his desire I wrote to him
                    upon the subject, showing in what manner, according to my judgement, such a
                    collection ought to be formed. First I proposed a geographical arrangement; &#8211;
                    then that the best accounts of the respective regions, should be printed entire,
                    in chronological order, &amp; the great mass of inferior works brought to
                    elucidate them in the form of notes &amp; appendices; Thus giving the whole
                    substance of the great standard works, &amp; the whole essence of all the
                    others. &#8211; You see what a disgraceful <del>work</del> &lt;job&gt; Pinkerton has
                    made of it! If the titles of <del>xx</del> different voyages had been put in a
                    bag, &amp; he had drawn them out by lottery to the amount of the quantity
                    required, the probability is that the Collection would rather have been better
                    than worse.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Pinkerton
                        (1758&#8211;1826; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A General Collection of the Best and
                            Most Interesting Voyages and Travels in all Parts of the World</title>,

        <p rend="indent1"> What you propose I clearly comprehend. Not a mere compilation,
                    but a work which might live, &amp; which the character of the authors mind

                    world as it is, with references enough to what it has been for all purposes of

                    history of the human race, or in looking forward to their amelioration, &amp;
                    collecting the light of the past as in the focus of a mirror to fling it before
                    me <del>into</del> that I may see into the future. I have therefore a great
                    capital <del>xxx xxx</del> to begin upon, &#8211; few men, if any can have more, for
                    this peculiar kind of knowledge has for more than twenty years been my favourite
                    pursuit. I have many good materials, some of the best, &amp; not a few rare
                    ones. Still there would be many to seek.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You seem to guess well at the extent, &amp; to go to the extent
                    in your estimate. Concerning the form, that which would carry with it most
                    appearance of respectability would be best; because a work which may at first be
                    taken for a mere piece of patchwork, ought to make some pretensions at its
                    outset; &#8211; the first half dozen pages would overcome all prejudice of this kind.
                    Prints would be indispensable, &#8211; <del>xxx</del> the views &lt;might perhaps best
                    be&gt; <del>xxx</del> given in outline, the costume in colours, &amp; the
                    natural history in wood for head &amp; tail pieces.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The arrangement of the subject will form itself in my mind long
                    before there will be any necessity for beginning upon it. For this &amp; the
                    life of George 3 must not go on <del>xxx</del> together: &#8211; one at a time will be
                    as much as I can manage with the great series of my Portugueze histories,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>History of
                            Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819) and his unfinished &#8216;History of
                        Portugal&#8217;.</note> &amp; my poems, &#8211; of which I should always wish to have
                    one in hand. I shall not <del>xx</del> see you as I expected <del>xx</del> in
                    May, &#8211; nor before the close of the year. It would be vexatious to arrive in
                    London just when every body is leaving it, &amp; I cannot get from home before
                    this would be the case. Perhaps therefore you will, at your convenience, let me
                    know how far the plan which you &amp; <ref target="people.html#CadellThomas">Cadell &amp; Davies</ref> have meditated, accords with mine, that
                    we may see whether they had better be kept separate, or made to agree. What I
                    propose is not the history of the Age, &#8211; but the <del>spirit</del>
                    &lt;philosophy&gt; of that history: having all the result of research but none
                    of the form of it; &#8211; <del>xxx counts only of xxx xx</del> dealing rather with
                    causes &amp; consequences than with events, <del>&amp; using</del> culling the
                    flow of <del>xx</del> events to illustrate, &amp; elucidate, &amp; enhance &amp;
                    adorn &amp; extracting their essential spirit to be the life of the book. &#8211;
                    There is one reason why the view of the world (this title would not do for it)
                    seems entitled to precedence in order of time, &amp; that is that the Age of
                    George 3 is not yet at an end. Perhaps the ensuing campaign may bring with it
                    the consummation so devoutly to be wished for. If Alexander had reestablished
                    Poland as a kingdom I should have had little anxiety for the result: not having
                    done this I fear that France is as certain of finding strength there, as
                    Alexander is in Germany.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Alexander I
                        (1777&#8211;1825; Tsar of Russia 1801&#8211;1825). Southey hoped he would reverse the
                        partition of Poland between Russia, Austria and Prussia in 1792&#8211;1795 and
                        establish an independent Kingdom of Poland. As he had not agreed to do this,
                        Southey feared the Poles would side with France.</note> &#8211; A proper paper
