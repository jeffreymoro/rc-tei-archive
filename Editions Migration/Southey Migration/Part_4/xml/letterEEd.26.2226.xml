          <l rend="indent3"> Doubting this female presence, half in fear</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> The boy was not alone; he not for that</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Delayed the summons, but lest need should be</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Laying hand upon his sword, toward him bent</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> In act soliciting speech, &amp; low of voice,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Enquired if friend or foe. Forgive me, cried</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Unto whose dutiful care &amp; love when sent</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To this vile bondage, I was given in charge.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> How could I look upon my fathers face,</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Who was to me found faithful? &#8211; Excellent boy!</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Exclaimd Pelayo, as he wrung his hand</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Started: brave boy! good boy! &amp; in his heart</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> He said, supprest in silence, blessed be</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Remote from frequency, &amp; dales retired,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Forest &amp; mountain glen. Before their feet</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The fire-flies, swarming in the woodland shade</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Sprung up like living sparks, &amp; round their way</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> When all the soothing sounds of eve had ceased,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The distant watch-dogs voice at times was heard</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Answering the nearer wolf. All thro the night</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Among the hills they travelled silently,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Till when the stars were setting, at what hour</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The breath of heaven is coldest, they beheld</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Within a lonely grove the expected fire</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Where Roderick &amp; his comrade anxiously</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Lookd for the Prince&#8217;s coming. Halting there</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Disturb&#8217;d the deep contentment of that love;</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> The grief &amp; wonder of good men, the gibes</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of vulgar ribaldry, the reproach of all,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Profaning the most holy sacrament</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of wedlock, to become chief of the wives</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of Abdalazis, of the Infidel,</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> All know her now: but they alone who know</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> What Roderick was, can judge his wretchedness</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To that light spirit &amp; unfeeling heart</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> In hopeless bondage bound. No children rose</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Exuberant health diseases him, frail worm;</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Aye, thou well mayst groan! My evil fate</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Made me an inmate of the royal house;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And Roderick found in me, if not a heart</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> One which at least felt his surpassing worth, </l>

          <l rend="indent3"> To my awakened soul her guilt &amp; shame,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And in those agonies with which Remorse</l>
          <l rend="indent3">
            <del>Doth triumph oer the lacerated heart</del>
          </l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Wrestling with weakness, &amp; with cherished sin,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Doth triumph oer the lacerated heart,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That night, that miserable night, I vowed</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A virgin dedicate to pass my life</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Immured, &amp; like redeemed Magdaline</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Or that Egyptian penitent, whose tears</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Fretted the rock, &amp; moistened round her cave</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The thirsty desert, so to mourn my fall.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The struggle ending thus, the victory</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Thus as I deemd accomplishd, I believed</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> My soul was calm, &amp; that the peace of Heaven</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Descended to accept &amp; bless my vow;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And in this faith prepared to consummate</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The sacrifice, I went to meet the King.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> See Father! what a snare had Satan laid!</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For Roderick came to tell me that the Church</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> From his unfruitful bed would set him free</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And I should be his Queen.</l>
          <l rend="indent7"> Oh let me close</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The dreadful tale. I told him of my vow,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And from sincere &amp; scrupulous piety,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> But more I fear me in that desperate mood</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of obstinate will perverse, the which with pride</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And shame &amp; self-reproach, doth sometimes make</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The woman&#8217;s tongue, her own worst enemy</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Run counter to its dearest heart&#8217;s desire, &#8211;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> In that unhappy mood did I resist</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> All his most earnest prayers to let the power</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of holy church, &#8211; never more rightfully</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Invoked, he said, than now in our behalf,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Release us from our fatal bonds. He urged</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With kindling warmth his suit, like one whose life</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Hung on the issue. I dissembled not</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> My cruel self-reproaches, nor my grief,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Yet desperately maintaind the rash resolve</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Till in the passionate argument he grew</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Inflamed, incensed, &amp; maddened, or possessed; &#8211;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For Hell too surely at that hour prevaild,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And with such subtle toils enveloped him</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That even in the extremity of <del>wrong</del> guilt</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> No guilt he purported, but rather meant</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> An <del>life-long</del> &lt;amplest&gt; recompense of
                        life-long love</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For transitory wrong, which fate perverse,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Thus madly he deceived himself, compelled</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And therefore stern necessity excused.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Here then O father, at thy feet I own</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Myself the guiltier; for full well I knew</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> These were his thoughts; &#8211; but vengeance mastered me</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And in my agony I cursed the man</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Whom I loved best!</l>
          <l rend="indent6"> Dost thou recall that curse?</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Cried Roderick in a deep &amp; inward voice,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Still with his head depressed &amp; covering still</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His countenance. Recall it? she exclaimed,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Father I come to thee because I gave</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The reins to wrath too long; &#8211; because I wrought</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His ruin, death &amp; infamy; O God</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Forgive the wicked vengeance thus indulged</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> As I forgive the King! &#8211; But teach me thou</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> What reparation more than tears &amp; prayers</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> May now be made; &#8211; how shall I vindicate</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His injured name, &amp; take upon myself &#8211;&#8211;</l>

        <p rend="indent1"> You have a part of the Poem so difficult to get over, even
                    tolerably, that I verily believe, if I had at first <del>anticipated Rodericks
                        character as</del> thought of making Roderick any thing more than a sincere
                    penitent, this difficulty would have deterred me from attempting the subject. &#8211;
                    There will probably be much to amend in it hereafter, &#8211; but I think it is in the
                    right strain, &amp; that the passion is properly made diffuse.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have endeavoured to do something for your Bill,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor was trying to bring a private
                        enclosure Bill before parliament in order to enclose the common land around
                        his Lanthony estate, see John Forster, <title>Walter Savage Landor. A
                            Biography</title>, 2 vols (London, 1869), I, pp. 374&#8211;375. However,
                        opposition from neighbouring county members forced him to abandon the Bill
                        early in the parliamentary session.</note> &amp; am told that the opinion of
                    the county members in its favour will be worth more than any thing else.</p>
