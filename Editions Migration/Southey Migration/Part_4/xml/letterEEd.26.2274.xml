          <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George Fricker</ref> died on Thursday noon, &amp; was buried yesterday. Had <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">Rex</ref> been here I should have wished the body to be opened, as the case was a remarkable
                    one. He has not died of consumption; for he never expectorated pus, &amp; indeed for the last fortnight the cough was troublesome,
                    &#8211; neither were there any night sweats, or any diarrh&#339;a: I believe I mentioned in my last that this symptom had appeared, &#8211; but
                        <del>I was misinformed</del> it was a mistake. <ref target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> thinks those ducts must
                    have been obliterated which convey nutriment to the system so that his food did not nourish him &#8211; very likely I am making his
                    opinion appear like ignorance by putting it in my own words; if so the ignorance is mine not his. The decay was more rapid than
                    any which <ref target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> ever before witnessed, &amp; he was more like a skeleton before
                    his death than any thing I ever saw alive, but he suffered no pain &amp; was utterly unconscious of danger. Latterly he was seldom
                    sensible &amp; went off at last without a struggle. His sisters<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith Southey</ref>, <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Sara
                            Coleridge</ref>, <ref target="people.html#FrickerMary">Mary Lovell</ref> and <ref target="people.html#Frickerfamily">Eliza
                                Fricker</ref>.</note> had sat up with him for the last week. &#8211; How fortunate it that he lost
                    his situation with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lunell in that silly manner,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Peter
                        Lunell (1758&#8211;1840), prominent Bristol merchant, antiquarian and anti-slavery activist, with premises in Brunswick Square.
                        George Fricker had been accused of assaulting a young woman, but the charges seem to have been dropped; see Southey to Charles
                        Danvers, 7 October 1812 (Letter 2154) and 29 October 1812 (Letter 2165).</note> for otherwise he would have died in lodgings,
                    with all <del>xx</del> discomforts &amp; anxieties about his expences, &amp; the whole burden of attending him would have fallen
                    upon <ref target="people.html#Frickerfamily">Eliza</ref>. The expence too which would <del>then</del> have fallen upon me, would
                    have been heavy. His sisters have now done their duty to the utmost &amp; to the last, &#8211; &amp; he had every thing which he could
                    possibly want or wish for, that it was possible to procure.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall be in London in about three weeks, &amp; before I leave town will send you the 10&#163; you advanced him for me,
                    &amp; likewise what little also I may be in your debt. This indeed would have been done some time ago if <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John Ballantyne</ref> had not stopt payment with me, declaring that he is already in
                    advance, &#8211; when I have in reality 225&#163; due. How this will end I know not, but shrewdly apprehend that he will play the rogue with
                    me, till bankruptcy puts an end to his tricks &amp; his embarassments together.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I &amp; my summer cold go on as usual; except however <del>thex</del> as far as the nose is concerned I am in good
                    health &amp; now that the house is beginning to resume its usual order, in good spirits &amp; activity. Hitherto as you may
                    suppose I have been sadly disjointed. Latterly indeed my study was given up to the women for poor <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</ref> lay in the wing room, &amp; here they watched him day &amp; night with both
                    doors open. To day I have reentered.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Lately I had a letter from <ref target="people.html#WilberforceWilliam">Wilberforce</ref> about the Missions &amp;
