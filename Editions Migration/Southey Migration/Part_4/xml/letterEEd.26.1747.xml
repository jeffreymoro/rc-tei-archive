        <p rend="indent1"> I have the book<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Wadsworth (b. 1604; <title>DNB</title>), writer and
                        government official. Wadsworth had been educated in Spain and at the Jesuit English College at St Omer, France. He moved to
                        England, converted to Protestantism and worked as a spy, informing on many of his former fellow Catholics. In 1652 he
                        published, under the pseudonym &#8216;Major John Wright&#8217;, <title>The Civil Wars of Spain, in the Beginning of the Reign of Charles
                            the Fifth, Emperor of Germanie, and King of that Nation</title>, a translation of Prudencio de Sandoval (c. 1560&#8211;1620),
                            <title>Historia de la Vida y Hechos del Emperador Carlos V</title> (1604&#8211;1606). The preface to Wadsworth&#8217;s translation was
                        signed by James Howell (1594?&#8211;1666; <title>DNB</title>), historian, political writer and advocate of moderate, pacifist
                        royalism.</note> you mention, Wadsworth the translator published a sort of history of himself in 1629 called the English
                    Spanish Pilgrim,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The English Spanish Pilgrime, or, A New Discoverie of Spanish Popery and Jesuitical Strategems</title> (1629) described

                    great rascal, for as soon as he turned Protestant he became a spy, &#8211; &amp; so far your ms. note is confirmed. &#8211; But that the
                    translation was paid for by the Parliamentary party cannot have been the case, for it comes out under the sanction of Howel the
                    Epistolist, &#8211; a decided Cavalier. I believe I wrote to you about this book, because Howel says the original was supprest in Spain,
                    &#8211; in which I think he must have been mistaken. It is most likely the <del>xxxx</del> Libro 1. of Sandoval Hist of Carlos V.
                    Wadsworths Father went over to the Ch. of Rome in good earnest, &amp; some letters which past between him &amp; Bp. Bedell upon
                    the subject were published by Bp. Burnet.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Wadsworth (c. 1572&#8211;1623;

                        ambassador to Spain in 1605. Wadsworth was received into the Catholic faith in Salamanca in August 1605. He remained in Spain,
                        where he was given a pension by the king and work by the Inquisition. From 1610&#8211;1620 he maintained a good-tempered theological
                        debate with his old university friend William Bedell (bap. 1572, d. 1642; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Kilmore. Their
                        correspondence was published after Wadsworth&#8217;s death by Bedell himself in <title>The Copies of Certaine Letters which have
                            Passed betweene Spaine and England in Matter of Religion</title> (1624), and some of the letters were included in Gilbert
                        Burnet (1643&#8211;1715; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Life and Letters of Bishop William Bedell</title> (1685), no. 497 in the sale

                    but his writings are good for nothing, whereas the latter has related one or two curious anecdotes. </p>

                        a &#8216;very curious paper, written about 1740, by a Portuguese Secretary of State, and containing his plans for the improvement of
                        Portugal&#8217;. This had previously been summarised by Southey as &#8216;On the State of Portugal&#8217; in <title>Letters Written During a
