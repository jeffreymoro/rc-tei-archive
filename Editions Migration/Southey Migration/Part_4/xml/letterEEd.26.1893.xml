          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>

        <p rend="indent1"> Upon receiving advice from my bookseller of the contents of a
                    parcel sent per waggon, I was at a loss to guess who could have presented me
                    with a treatise upon Bullion.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> J. T.
                        Koster, <title>A Short Statement of the Trade in Gold Bullion: with an
                            attempt to shew that bank-notes are not depreciated</title>
                        (1810).</note> Having gone to sleep over Huskissons&#8217; pamphlet,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Huskisson (1770&#8211;1830;
                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Question Concerning the Depreciation of
                            our Currency Stated and Examined</title> (1810).</note> and experienced
                    the same lulling effects from the Quarterly Review of the question,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Huskisson&#8217;s pamphlet was reviewed in
                            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 4 (November 1810), 414&#8211;453.</note> I
                    had made up my mind to the satisfactory conclusion that it was one of those
                    things for which I had no capacity, a conclusion to me perfectly satisfactory,
                    for I have long perceived the necessity of being ignorant on many points, and am
                    neither more sorry nor more ashamed of an inaptitude for finance, than for the
                    want of a musical ear, or a hand for painting. It is true I had a sort of saving
                    opinion that when any thing was clearly understood, it could not be very
                    difficult to make a man of fair intellect understand, and therefore when there
                    any wide difference upon principles, and both parties appeared perplexed, I
                    thought it exceedingly probable that both were still in the dark.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have proved this to the case upon the Bullion question, and
                    of all the discoveries which have been talked of in our days (setting the
                    chemists aside) unless I am grievously mistaken, yours is the only one which
                    will stand the test of time and sound criticism. Horne Tooke<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Horne Tooke (1736&#8211;1812;

                            Purley</title> (1786&#8211;1805), an important philological treatise that
                        helped democratize grammar by attempting to reduce all words (including
                        conjunctions) to verbs or nouns, or derivatives of these parts of
                        speech.</note> has credit for a discovery in language, which no men could be
                    ignorant of who had ever translated the word <hi rend="ital">notwithstanding</hi> or <hi rend="ital">nevertheless</hi>, or thought of
                    their meaning. Malthus<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Robert Malthus
                        (1766&#8211;1834; DNB), <title>An Essay on the Principle of Population</title>
                        (1798), which argued that population, which grew at a geometric ratio,
                        always tended to outstrip food supply, which only increased at an arithmetic
                        ratio.</note> has credit for a discovery, of which all that is true is to be
                    found in every writer who ever took the future condition of mankind into

                    of being kept at a maximum than any other commodity of which the supply and the
                    consumption are liable to variations, has never (to my knowledge) been advanced
                    before, and when once advanced, like the discovery of gravitation, it makes that
                    the subject of science which before was only hypothesis and guess-work. I am
