        <p rend="indent1"> You judge rightly respecting <ref target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham&#8217;s</ref> commission.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Brougham had written to Hill to enquire whether Southey would be willing to translate Lucien
                        Bonaparte&#8217;s (1775&#8211;1840) as yet unwritten epic <title>Charlemagne, ou l&#8217;Eglise D&#233;livr&#233;e</title> (1814). The commission was
                        refused.</note> A bad poem would not be worth translating, &#8211; &amp; to translate a good one would take as much time as writing
                    one myself. Profit is a thing never to be taken into account upon such subjects. I have done with writing verses for money, since
                    I ceased to be Poet to the Morning Post at a guinea a week,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had ceased regular
                        employment for the <title>Morning Post</title> in 1799, though he did contribute a few poems on an occasional basis until
                        1803.</note> &#8211; in which capacity I produced all those pieces of mine in the An. Anthology,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Annual Anthology</title> (1799&#8211;1800).</note> &amp; was better paid for them at that rate than for
                    any other verses, either before or since.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If <ref target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> makes any direct application to me I will recommend
                    &lt;him&gt; to Sir Abraham Elton&#8217;s son,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poet, translator and occasional reviewer for
                        the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, Charles Abraham Elton (1778&#8211;1853; <title>DNB</title>), son of Revd Sir Abraham Elton
                        (1755&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#8211; who is precisely the fit person for such an employment; he versifies exceedingly
                    well, is fond of versifying, &amp; prefers translation to original composition, thereon forming a just estimate of his own
                    powers.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">B.</ref> lives 18 miles from hence, but I think it more likely that he will write,
                    than come over. I have passed an evening in his company at Edinburgh, &amp; exchanged cards with him in the street at London, &#8211; so
                    that he needs no introduction.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Quarterly has not reached me. I had written a long article for it (with some help in statistics from a quarter
                    which you would suspect on seeing it) &#8211; upon Pasley&#8217;s book,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir Charles William Pasley
                        (1780&#8211;1861; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Essay on the Military Policy and Institutions of the British Empire</title> (1810).
                        Southey&#8217;s review was deemed by Gifford to be &#8216;perfectly incorrect and dangerous&#8217; with the result that the version published in
                        the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 5 (May 1811), 403&#8211;457, was much altered by Croker, in consultation with Gifford and <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>; see <ref type="l" target="/reference/qr/index/10.html">Jonathan Cutmore, <title>The Quarterly Review Archive</title>
            </ref>. Southey received help with the &#8216;statistics&#8217; from Rickman.</note>
                    &amp; after I had corrected the proofs, the fear of the Sicilian Embassador<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Fabrizio
                        Ruffo, Prince of Castelcicala (1763&#8211;1832), Sicilian minister to the Court of St James 1802&#8211;1815. Southey disliked the Bourbon
                        regime in Sicily that Castelcicala represented, both for its reactionary nature and its unwillingness to fight the
                        French.</note> came over <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>, &amp; my article is at present in the hands
