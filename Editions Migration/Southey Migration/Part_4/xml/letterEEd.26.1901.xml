                        applying British training methods to the Portuguese army, to which he had been appointed Marshal. In early 1811 he was given a
                        field command. Unfortunately, as the manoeuvres leading up to the battle of Albuera (16 May 1811) revealed,
                        Beresford was significantly more effective on the parade ground than in combat. Although Albuera was an allied victory, it
                        came at great human cost and Beresford&#8217;s tactics were roundly condemned. His career never fully recovered.</note> will recover
