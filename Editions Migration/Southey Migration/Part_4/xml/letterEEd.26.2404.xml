        <p rend="indent1"> I ought to have slept upon your letter before I answered it.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Cottle had written to Southey on 14
                        April 1814 soliciting his support for his plan to raise an annuity of &#163;100
                        for Coleridge via subscription. For Cottle&#8217;s letter see Lynda Pratt, &#8216;The
                        &#8220;sad habits&#8221; of Samuel Taylor Coleridge: Unpublished Letters from Joseph
                        Cottle to Robert Southey, 1813&#8211;1817&#8217;, <title>Review of English
                            Studies</title>, 55 (2004), 78&#8211;80. Southey had replied on 17 April 1814,
                        Letter 2403. He had rejected Cottle&#8217;s subscription plan and suggested
                        instead that Coleridge return to Keswick and work to support his
                        family.</note> In thinking over the subject, &#8211; for you may be sure it was
                    not in my power to get rid of the thought, &#8211; the exceeding probability occurred
                    to me, that <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Cs</ref> children<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    dependent upon chance &amp; charity for their education, &amp; all that
                    <del>xxxx</del> depends upon it. Even now <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> is

                    the University. That his father will make an exertion to send him there is not
                    impossible, &#8211; that he will continue those exertions to support him there no
                    person who knows him can for a moment imagine. Here then is an <del>cris</del>
                    emergency full in view, &amp; at no long distance, upon which it may, &#8211; &amp; I
                    believe <hi rend="ital">must</hi> be necessary to solicit the aid of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C&#8217;s.</ref> friends: &#8211; &amp; for this emergency I think their aid
                    should be reserved. &#8211; When you talk in your circular of his producing great
                    things if his mind were relieved by the certainty of a present income, you
                    suffered your feelings to overpower your memory. &#8211; <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> had
                    that income for many years,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. the

                        (1769&#8211;1843) of &#163;150, which they gave to Coleridge in 1798. Josiah stopped
                        paying his half of the money in 1812.</note> &#8211; <del>&amp; when xxx this
