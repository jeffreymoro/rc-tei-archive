        <p rend="indent1"> In Adm. Keats&#8217;s<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Admiral Sir Richard Goodwin Keats (1757&#8211;1834;
                            <title>DNB</title>). Spain had been compelled by France to provide an Army to assist Bonaparte&#8217;s campaigns in northern
                        Europe. When Spain was invaded by France in 1808, Keats was in command of the operation to help these Spanish troops escape
                        from Denmark and return to Spain to fight the French. Keats&#8217; letter was widely reported; see, for example, <title>National
                            Register</title>, 1 (28 August 1808), 551&#8211;552.</note> Official Letter (Aug 11. 1808) &#8211; respecting his bringing off the
                    Spanish troops from Denmark <del>th</del> he says &#8216;the arrival of the Spanish Officer in the Edgar, on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; of whose spirited escape to the squadron you were informed by Cap<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Graves,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Graves (d. 1834), Captain of HMS <title>Brunswick</title>.</note> greatly facilitated our means of
                    communication.&#8221; This letter of Capt Graves has never been published. Now I am at this time <hi rend="ital">Registering</hi> this
                    part of the years history, &amp; it would be a very great satisfaction to me if I could obtain a copy of it, &#8211; you need not be
                    told what meagre work history is when Gazette accounts are the only documents for it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> For
                        Southey&#8217;s account of these events, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 333&#8211;335. It did not make
                        use of Graves&#8217; letter. &#8216;Gazette accouts&#8217; are those drawn up from official news published in the government daily paper, the
                            <title>London Gazette</title>.</note> If <ref target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry</ref> can render me this service I
                    shall be very much obliged to him. Keats&#8217;s official letters are better than those of any other man in the service, &#8211; but they
                    leave altogether <del>xxxx xxx</del> unexplained the manner in which he opened a communication with the Spaniards &#8211; that in fact
                    not being called for in a dispatch. This letter must throw some light upon the subject, &amp; if <ref target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry</ref> can give me any other information he will enable me to compleat my work
                        <del>more to my own satisfaction, which is</del> so as to satisfy myself, &#8211; <del>xx</del> be it known unto you M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bedford there is no other person of whose satisfaction I am so solicitous, for this reason among others that it is
                    much more easy to satisfy any body else.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have mist the spirit of the last Kehama &#8211; books a good deal.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey
                        had sent Bedford drafts of <title>The Curse of Kehama</title>, published later in 1810.</note> What Ereenia goes for is to
                    learn what course he is to pursue, &amp; he is accordingly told to go to the throne of Yamen. The ladders<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    therefore not merely that the word is unexceptionable, but that it is the only proper one in that place.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I must now send you a-begging, &#8211; &amp; I believe in such a case that you will go to work with good will. A poor

                    but having failed, had obtained an inferior situation in the Customs, &#8211; which with the profits of a lodging house, &amp; <ref target="people.html#RobertsWilliamIsaac">Williams</ref> salary of 70&#163; from a Bank, just sufficed for the <del>suff</del>
                    decent support of the family. The sons death therefore was not only a deep affliction, but in the mere worldly sense of the word a
                    great loss, &#8211; the father has since been disabled by an apoplectic stroke, &amp; in consequence has lost his situation, &#8211; &amp; the

                        (1811).</note> Unquestionably he was a youth of first-rate promise, &amp; did as much at nineteen, as it is possible for a
                    youth of nineteen to do. Upon his moral character there was neither speck nor stain, &#8211; neither vices, nor follies, nor
                    eccentricities, as humble in his <del>h</del> worldly hopes, as <del>wise in his views</del> elevated in better things, as noble
                    in his nature, as wise in his views as I should wish a son of my own to be. &#8211; Now the object <del>Ja</del> which <ref target="people.html#JamesPaulMoon">James</ref> has, <del>xx</del> (I being of the privy council on this occasion) is to obtain
                    subscribers enough to raise a sum which may place Eliza Roberts in a situation to maintain herself &amp; her parents respectably.
                    He prints 1250 copies, &#8211; in this he has not waited for my opinion, which would have been not to print till the number of
                    subscribers could be ascertained. The price will be 10/6- for <del>xx</del> &lt;a&gt; volume &lt;in&gt; crown 8vo &#8211; the money paid
                    on delivery of the book. &#8211; Go to work for me Grosvenor, ask, beg &amp; solicit &#8211; with all your rhetoric. There is no hope of
                    obtaining any extensive sale for the book &#8211; because poor fellow he had not been bit by the Evangelicals, &#8211; neither is there the
                        <hi rend="ital">reading</hi> interest about his life that there is about <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">H K
                        Whites</ref>, &#8211; because, he poor fellow, could make no effort to lift himself above his situation, his little salary being
                    essential to the support of a family that had been born to better prospects, &amp; had sunk in the world from unavoidable
                    misfortunes. Still it will be a book which those who read in the manner of common readers will be pleased with, &#8211; &amp; which will
                    make a mans heart ache who can see the promises of excellence that these poor fragments contain. &#8211; There is a danger of saying too
                    little as well as of saying too much about such things, &#8211; so the best way is to send you the first sheet of the Poems, &#8211; half a
                    dozen having been sent me for <del>this purpose</del> &lt;such dispersal&gt;. &#8211; It has pleased Providence that <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Perceval</ref> should for wise purposes however inscrutable be
                    minister just at this time, &amp; therefore I will enclose another letter upon the same errand to <del>xxxxx</del> give him an
                    opportunity of doing some good by franking it. &#8211; Ask every body you can ask, &#8211; &amp; if they know me, ask it as a thing for which
                    I shall feel personally obliged. In short levy a poll tax upon all your friends &amp; acquaintances &#8211;</p>

                    Graves for me, &#8211; if he can do it <del>all</del> at all, the more I shall be obliged to him. In fact I have a portion of copy ready
                    for the Printer which is waiting for it. You will judge from my solicitude about this, how desirous I am to do what I have
                    undertaken, as well as I can, sparing <del>x</del> no pains <del>to</del> in collecting information from all the sources within my
                    reach. &#8211; If you damn the Spaniards I shall damn you, &amp; you will deserve <del>it</del> to be damned. <del>And</del> Take notice
