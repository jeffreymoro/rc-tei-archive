                        6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &amp; 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> stanzas of the poem, &#8211; telling him however that as I know nothing of

                            them in 1813 survive and it is highly probable that no more were sent. The letter mentioned here is probably Taylor&#8217;s of
                            19 January 1813, which began with commendations of Henry Herbert Southey, see J. W. Robberds (ed.), <title>A Memoir of the

                            written to Taylor on 18 November 1813, announcing his acceptance of the Laureateship (II, pp. 415&#8211;419), but Taylor did not
                            reply until 13 March 1814 (II, pp. 419&#8211;422).</note>
