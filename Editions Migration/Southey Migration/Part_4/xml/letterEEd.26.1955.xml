        <p rend="indent1"> I know not how it happened that you were not among the first persons whom I wrote to you after my return. Here we
                    have been twelve days, great part of which have been employed in unpacking books, arranging them, disarranging others to make room
                    for new comers, playing with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Lunus</ref>, &amp; enjoying the feeling of being once more
                    at home.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> enclosed me no note from <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Perceval</ref>, &#8211; but Perceval wrote me a
                    very civil note himself, enclosing Yorkes<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Philip Yorke (1764&#8211;1834;

                    ignorant Clerk at the Post Office charging it because it was not dated, &amp; as I was leaving Bristol there was not time for me
                    to write to <ref target="people.html#FreelingFrancis">Mr Freeling</ref>, &amp; instruct the Clerk in the nature of Treasury
                    privileges) I wrote a letter of thanks to <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Mr Perceval</ref>,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> This has not survived.</note> &amp; another to <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Mr Croker</ref>, as it was
                    incumbent on me to do, &#8211; the latter enquiry seems to imply that the letter never reached him, &#8211; it is however far more likely that
                    he has forgotten it, than that it should have miscarried, &#8211; &amp; I am sorry for this, because it seems to make him suspect me of
                        inattention.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had been thanking those individuals instrumental in obtaining
                        promotion for his brother Tom; see Southey to Herbert Hill, 12 May 1811, Letter 1921, and Southey to Charles Watkin Williams
                        Wynn, 4 August [1811], Letter 1943.</note> As for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> it is no excuse for his
                    slighting you, that he hurried out of town without even letting <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">his Uncle</ref> know he
                    was about to depart.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I take shame to my self for not having written to make my acknowledgements to <ref target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref>. The only reason was that I waited to ask you under what cover I should

        <p rend="indent1"> This leads me to remember that <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> made an expedition to call
                    on you which proved unsuccesful.
