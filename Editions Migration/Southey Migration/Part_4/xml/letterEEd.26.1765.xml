        <p rend="indent1"> It <hi rend="ital">is</hi> very long since you have heard from me, &#8211; &amp; for a two fold reason, &#8211; first because
                    your verses<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor had sent Southey an idyll written in Latin hexameters, John Forster,
                            <title>Walter Savage Landor. A Biography</title>, 2 vols (London, 1869), I, pp. 252&#8211;253. This was published as &#8216;Coresus et
                        Callirhoe&#8217; in Landor&#8217;s <title>Poemata et Inscriptiones</title> (London, 1847), pp. 36&#8211;41.</note> tantalized me as a barrel of
                    oysters would have done if set before me without a knife. I could not read them. There is little difficulty in understanding the
                    worst possible hand writing in our own every-day language, &#8211; tho I once saw two franks which had travelled all over England, &amp;
                    at last found their way by the lucky guess of some Post Office clerk who wrote on them &#8220;try Durham&#8221; &#8211; they had tried Dublin
                    previously. But when a fore sight of the meaning is necessary to make out the words, any thing not easy in itself becomes very
                    difficult. If I could have read these verses I should have understood them, &#8211; <del>for</del> because I did not understand, I could
                    not read them. The case however is not desperate, in some season of leisure I purpose transcribing them, &amp; shall thus make
                    them out step by step.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The other reason was that I might send you the first section of Pelayo<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        early incarnation of <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> &amp; this I have been prevented from
                    compleating because my hours for poetry have been partly employed in correcting Kehama,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810). Landor had been instrumental in encouraging Southey to continue with the
                        poem.</note> partly diverted to the pressing business of the Edinburgh Register.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title> (1810).</note> Kehama is half printed, &amp; the remaining half still
                    requires correction, &#8211; I want to get rid of the Snake in the Water-Chambers,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> A passage
                        that followed <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810), Book 16, line 211, but was deleted in the printed version.</note> &#8211;
                    which is neither well-conceived, nor well written, &amp; something is wanting at the conclusion. It will probably be published in
                    June. I have made my usual bargain with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">the bookseller</ref>, &#8211; that is to say no bargain
                    at all, &#8211; they print &amp; I share the profits. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> recommended strongly the quarto
                    form, &amp; quarto accordingly it is, my own opinion being that <del>x</del> in whatever form it appeared a sale to clear the
                    expences was certain, &amp; any thing beyond that exceedingly improbable.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> It is a mark of strength or of weakness, of maturity, or of incipient decay, that it is more delightful to me to
                    compose history than poetry, &#8211; not perhaps that I feel more pleasure in the act of composition, &#8211; but that I go to it with more

                    ominous feeling that there are poets enough in the world without me, &amp; that my best chance of being remembered will be as an
                    historian. A proof sheet of Kehama, or a second-sight scene in Pelayo disperses this cloud, &#8211; such however is my habitual feeling,
                    &#8211; it did not use to be the case in those days when I thought of nothing but poetry, &amp; lived as it were in an atmosphere of

                    passionately loved. His <del>brot</del> father was a Brewer,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Roberts (dates
