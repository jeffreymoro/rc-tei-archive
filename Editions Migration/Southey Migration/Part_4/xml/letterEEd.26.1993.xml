        <opener>
          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Before your letter arrived this evening, I had resolved to send
                    off the commencement of my book of <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">Bell</ref> &amp; the <ref target="people.html#LancasterJoseph">Dragon</ref>;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Southey&#8217;s <title>The Origin, Nature and Object, of the New System of
                            Education</title> (1812), an expansion of his advocacy of Bell in
                            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 6 (August 1811), 264&#8211;304.</note> &#8211;
                    according to all probability it will be finished before the first proof sheet
                    can reach me. &#8211; You will perceive among the additions such a view of the New
                    System as you very probably felt the want of in the reviewal. It was drawn up
                    with great care for the purpose of sending it to Cadiz, &#8211; where plans of
                    education are even in this season of danger, contemplated by the Spanish
                    Government. &amp; having had the advantage of <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bells</ref> presence
                    at the time I am certain of its accuracy. The system cannot be more concisely
                    stated, &amp; I hope it is as perspicuous as possible.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your hint respecting <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</ref> is one which I ought always to bear <del>mi</del> in mind, my
                    own nature leading me to speak strongly what I feel strongly. For the most part
                    I shall deal in sarcasm, &#8211; &amp; when I speak with serious severity it will be
                    in the tone of a Judge, not of an accuser. Tell me as the work goes thro the
                    press, if any thing seems too strong, or strikes you as in any way
                    injudicious.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The title will be &#8216;The Origin, Nature &amp; Object of the New
                    System of Education.&#8221; &#8211; you will of course say reprinted from the Q.R. &amp;c &#8211;
                    with considerable additions, &amp; <del>dedicated</del> &lt;a dedication&gt; to
                    the <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Editor of the Ed.
                    Review</ref>. This portion is about two thirds of the whole, &#8211; a little
                    less perhaps. As to the form of publication you are the best judge, I will only
                        <hi rend="ital">suggest</hi> (leaving it wholly to your decision) that if
                    instead of the loose pamphlet form, it were printed in duodecimo, it would then
                    bind up with the rest of my works, which I am very desirous it should accompany.
                    For tho the subject is of temporary interest, <hi rend="ital">some</hi> value it
                    must always possess as <del>the</del> being the true history of a most important
                    discovery, &amp; a detection <del>as</del> compleat as that of Lauder.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The forger William Lauder (c. 1710&#8211;1771;
                            <title>DNB</title>).</note> It will fall from seven to eight duodecimo
                    sheets, &#8211; thick enough to be put in <del>xx</del> boards &amp; so to assume a
                    substantial &amp; substantive shape.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is not time to reply to the rest of your letter. &#8211; &#8220;The
                    Life of Horatio Lord Nelson &#8211; I suppose will be the appropriate title. My name
                    you will either add or withhold as you judge best.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was named on the title page of <title>The Life
                            of Nelson</title> (1813).</note> I <hi rend="ital">think</hi> it would
                    be better withheld, &#8211; for the volume (like Espriella)<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Letters from England</title> (1807) was published
                        anonymously.</note> will regularly accompany my acknowledged works when they
                    are ordered in sets; &amp; the little uncertainty that may exist about the
                    author is always useful to a book that excites any attention. But I have no <hi rend="ital">wish</hi> upon the subject &amp; leave it wholly to you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> &#8211; One thing I will request &#8211; if you have no stronger reason
                    against it. &#8211; that you would put both volumes into the hand of <ref target="people.html#PopleWilliam">Pople</ref> in Chancery Lane to print
                    them: &#8211; he has a <ref target="people.html#LovellRobertJr">nephew-in-law</ref> of mine apprenticed to him, &#8211; &amp; moreover
                    I have a great desire to be of all the use to him I can, having known him for
                    &lt;very&gt; many years,</p>
