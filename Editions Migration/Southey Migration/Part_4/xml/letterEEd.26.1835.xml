                        Figueira (1573&#8211;1643), <title>Arte da Grammatice do Lingua Brasilica</title> (1621). Southey later acquired an edition of 1687,
                        no. 3396 in the sale catalogue of his library. The edition of 1795 was edited by Jose Mariano da Conceicao Velloso
                        (1742&#8211;1811). Southey had been lent a copy of this edition by the merchant Thomas Kinder (c. 1781-1846), who had lived in South
                        America 1808-1810.</note> The whole impression was most probably shipped off for Brazil; for it was printed at the <hi rend="ital">Officina Patriarcal</hi>, probably at the expense of the Church, as a missionary concern. I never saw it mentioned
                    in any bookseller&#8217;s list; and had it been on sale in Portugal, <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my uncle</ref> must have

                            <title>Arte de Grammatica da Lingoa mais Usada na Costa do Brasil</title> (1595). This was no. 1530 in the sale catalogue
                        of Southey&#8217;s library, inscribed by him: &#8216;This singularly rare and curious book was sent to me from the Public Library of
                        Bahia, de Todos, or Santos, by desire of the Conde des Arcos, then Governor of that Captaincy.&#8217; The Marcos de Noronha e Brito,
                        Conde dos Arcos (1771&#8211;1828) was Governor General of Bahia 30 September 1810&#8211;26 January 1818.</note> I have borrowed a copy of
                    this book, which came from B. Ayres, and I am working at it; but I wish to possess one as a fit part of my collection, and to have
                    at hand for the purpose of correcting the press, when my summary of it shall be printed. Your brother William<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Henry May (1785&#8211;1849), John May&#8217;s youngest brother and business partner in Brazil.</note>
                    I have no doubt can obtain one for me at the Rio; perhaps also he could meet with a Guarani grammar, and with it the &#8220;Vida de
                    Padre Joam de Almeida,&#8221; by P. Siman de Vasconcellos;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Simon de Vasconcellos (1599&#8211;1670),
                            <title>Vida do Joam d&#8217;Almeida</title> (1658). This was a life of the English-born Jesuit missionary, John Almeida
                        (1571&#8211;1653).</note> a book for which I have long been particularly anxious. Almeida earned his beatitude in that part of the
                    country, and therefore it is very likely that his history may be found there.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are some questions which your brother can answer for me. Are there any of the native race near the Rio? If
                    any, in what state of freedom, servitude, or slavery, and of what tribes? What does he conceive the proportions to be in the city
                    of the mixed race and of the negroes to those of European blood? Is the Portuguese language in any degree mingled there with the
                    Brazilians? for in many parts of Spanish America a mixed language has been found, and in some the native tongue predominates. At
                    As&#231;uncion, for instance, many of the Creole women speak nothing but Guarani. This is a curious process going on in the world. Just
                    as the Latin grew out of the Greek, and our southern tongues out of the wreck of the Latin, just so are there new languages
                    rapidly forming from the amalgamation of European, negro, and American dialects. The <hi rend="ital">talkee talkee</hi> of the
                    slaves in the sugar islands, as it is called, will prevail at Surinam, and become the language of Guiana. They have a printed
                    Bible in it already.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Moravians&#8217; translation of the Bible into the creole language now
