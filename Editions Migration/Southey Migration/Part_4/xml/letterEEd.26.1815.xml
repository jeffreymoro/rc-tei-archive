                        (c.1781&#8211;1846) had spent some time in South America. Kinder lent Southey &#8216;a volume of Noticias del Paraguay &#8230; in manuscript&#8217;,

                        Kinder also lent Southey a manuscript of Ruy Diaz de Guzman (1558&#8211;1629), <title>La Argentina, y Historia de las Descubrimento

                        Sebastian I (1554&#8211;1578; King of Portugal 1557&#8211;1578). He was presumed killed at the Battle of Alc&#225;cer Quibir (Battle of the
                        Three Kings), though his corpse was not found, giving rise to the legend that he would return again at the nation&#8217;s hour of
                        greatest need. His dynasty died out in 1580 and the throne was inherited by Philip II (1527&#8211;1598; King of Spain 1556&#8211;1598),

                    documents so good that I expect to produce a work more popular as well as more truly philosophical than any which has preceded

                        Southey is talking about defeatist and incompetent Portuguese leaders. A civilian called Setaro had certainly failed to
