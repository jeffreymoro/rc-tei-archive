        <p rend="indent1"> A wicked head ache, the cause of which I suspect will in the
                    course of an hour be removed from its present situation into a wash-hands-bason,
                        <del>prevents</del> makes me incapable of any thing except beginng a letter,
                    &#8211; whether it will allow me to finish it is what I cannot tell. Nothing has yet
                    been heard of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>.
                    What you said of him induced me to write him a short letter in plain but proper
                        terms,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s letter has not
                        survived.</note> &#8211; asking him if he did not himself feel how idle it was to
                    go about looking for external aid (&#8211; for I wished to prevent the ultimate shame
                    of his applying to Abernethy<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        surgeon John Abernethy (1764&#8211;1831; <title>DNB</title>), later famed for his
                        lectures and his participation in the vitalist debate. Abernethy was an
                        eminent medical practitioner and had a large, lucrative private practice in
                        London. He was renowned for his brusqueness with patients and for referring
                        all ailments to disorders of the digestion. The &#8216;shame&#8217; would have involved
                        Coleridge seeking medical help for his addiction, something he eventually
                        did in 1816. He did not consult Abernethy in 1810&#8211;1811.</note>) &#8211; urging him
                    to return here, this being the best place for him whether he adopts a wiser mode
                    of life, or persists in his present destructive one, &#8211; &amp; beseeching him to
                    let me &lt;be&gt; his task-master for three months in which time, if he would
                    only submit to the performance of as much daily work as I should require, (&amp;
                    I would require but little) I would engage that he should lie down at night with
                        <del>xx</del> a heart at ease, &amp; rise in the morning with a chearful
                    one. &#8211; Something too I said about his children.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        Coleridge</ref>.</note> He has given me <del>xx</del> no answer, &#8211; which is
                    easily accounted for, for I have no doubt that this letter, as well as two
                    former ones which I have written him, is still unopened. This practise of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge&#8217;s</ref> is of all his
                    wretched practises that for which I can least pardon. It is a sort of wilful
                    outlawry, or excommunication of himself, &#8211; he makes himself deaf &amp; dumb to
                    all who have any claims either of affection or duty upon him. Never I believe
                    did any other man for the sake of sparing immediate pain to himself inflict so
                    much upon all who were connected with him, &amp; lay up so heavy &amp;
                    unendurable a burthen of self-condemnation.</p>
