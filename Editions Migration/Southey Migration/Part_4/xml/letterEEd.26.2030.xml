        <p rend="indent1"> I have too long delayed to thank you for your Letter of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> November, &amp; the manner in
                    which you comment upon the intolerance of my last Annals.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. Southey&#8217;s contributions to
                        the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title> (1811).</note> I readily admit that any thing written in a spirit of
                    asperity is, generally speaking, imprudent, &#8211; &amp; am by no means disposed to think that my own language towards Whitbread<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The radical MP Samuel Whitbread (1764&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>). For an example of
                        Southey&#8217;s comments: &#8216;Mr Whitbread rose, as usual, to play the part of advocate for Buonaparte, and to revile the allies of
                        England&#8217;, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 303.</note> can be deemd an exception to the rule.
                    All I can say is, that if the Spanish war had been as long past as the American one<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        American War of Independence 1775&#8211;1783.</note> (when you say I should disapprove of such a manner of narration) &#8211; or as the
                    siege of Troy, I should have written with just the same feeling. But the fact is, that in speaking of things which are long gone
                    by, this liberty is allowd to the historian, &#8211; whereas if the contemporary annalist arrogates it, it is at his peril. &#8211; To the
                    charge of want of compression I can better reply, &#8211; the volume is upon the same scale as its predecessor, &amp; its bulk is
                        <del>only</del> &lt;owing&gt; to the greater quantity of the matter which the year afforded. <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</ref> has <del>xxxx</del> censured it upon this score in a manner worthy of
                        himself,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 18 (August 1811), 391, suggested <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title> (1811)
                        was &#8216;rather too long to be conveniently read through within the year&#8217;.</note> especially after what passed about the former
                        volume.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title> (1810).</note> Not dreaming that I was the author, he called upon <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</ref> a few days after its publication, (being the first time he had ever
                    entered his shop) expressly to state his approbation of the manner in which the work was written, tho he said, he differed in many
                    &amp; indeed in most points from the writer.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn,
                        27 August 1810, Letter 1803.</note> I believe the censure is one which implies a compliment to the work, &#8211; for it means that
                    people wish to read the book, &amp; yet do not wish to give so much time to it as its length requires. Now Annual Registers have
                    hitherto not been read, &#8211; they are professedly works rather for reference than for reading, &#8211; &amp; therefore the more minute they
                    are <del>the more</del> &lt;the better&gt; they answer the purpose for which they are designed. If therefore he who reads the book
                    now thinks it too long, &#8211; he who consults it ten year hence will not be disposed to censure it upon that score. &#8211; I am close at
                    work upon 1810, &amp; have this morning dispatched your honours speech upon the Bribery Bill.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> A Bill to prevent bribery of voters and also the purchasing of parliamentary seats; see <title>Edinburgh

                    his power to terminate? I censure the conduct of the war on our part as strongly as you can do, in keeping that army in Sicily
