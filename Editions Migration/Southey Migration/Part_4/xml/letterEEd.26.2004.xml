        <p rend="indent1"> I have to thank you for some excellent brawn, &amp; <ref target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calvert</ref>, who is not more fond of writing than some of his neighbours, has
                    requested me to convey his thanks also.</p>

                        Keswick resident who was looking after Peachy&#8217;s affairs in the locality.</note> is daily expected back from the Isle of Man,
                    where he has been for some weeks. As soon as he arrives your message with your direction shall be communicated to him.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Last night I received a singular &amp; gratifying proof that in some of my late endeavours I have not altogether
                    been labouring in vain. A circular letter was sent me from the Bristol Church of England Tract Society,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The object of the Bristol Church of England Tract Society, founded in 1811, was &#8216;to circulate in a cheap form,
                        among the poor members of the Church of England, her Homilies, the Lives of their Reformers and Martyrs, Extracts from her
                        Writings, and from the Publications of her Bishops; with such short Pieces illustrative of the primitive History, Constitution
                        and Discipline of the Church, as the Committee may approve&#8217;; see <title>The Christian Guardian (and Church of England
                            Magazine</title>), 4 (July 1812), 252.</note> &#8211; probably you may have heard of the Society &amp; seen the letter, &#8211; the
                    Society is founded for the purpose which I recommended in the Quarterly Review, when treating of the Methodists,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In a review of <title>Hints to the Public and the Legislature, on the Nature and Effect of
                            Evangelical Preaching. By a Barrister</title> (1809), in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 4 (November 1810),
                        480&#8211;514.</note> &amp; the letter in question, consists partly of my own words. If I were upon the spot I would attend the
                    meetings of the Committee, &amp; caution them against publishing Tracts too uninviting to be read, as the Society for the
                    promotion of Xtian knowledge<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge was the oldest
                        Church of England mission society, founded in 1698.</note> has sometimes done. Books designed for popular instruction
                        <del>wou</del> must be written in a popular manner, &amp; addressed as much to the feelings as to the understanding. If we
                    would act upon men to any good purpose, we must win their attention first, &amp; I am afraid that the Homilies &amp; the writings
                    of the Reformers are not suited to this purpose. The other publications which the Society proposes cannot fail of being useful, &#8211;
                    I am only anxious that none of their funds should be misdirected in printing what is little likely to be read.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The specific object which I proposed in that reviewal, &#8211; that of making the people acquainted with the history of
                    their own church,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> An early idea for the <title>Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note>
                    it is very likely that I shall attempt to accomplish, upon a plan which I communicated to <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bell</ref>, &amp; he to the Bp. of Meath,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Lewis
                        O&#8217;Beirne (1747&#8211;1823; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Meath 1798&#8211;1823. The son of a County Longford farmer, he had been educated
                        for the Catholic priesthood, but converted to Protestantism and became a Church of Ireland clergyman. He had been a well-known
                        Whig, but by 1811 he was increasingly conservative and a defender of the Church of Ireland.</note> &amp; which they both urged
                    me to execute. I want nothing but leisure for the task, &amp; it will be some months before I can command that. My plan is briefly
                    this, &#8211; to show 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>
          <del>the</del> what were the superstitions of the various nations from whom we are descended &#8211; the Britons, Romans &amp; Northern
                    Tribes, with the effect of those superstitions upon the manners &amp; morals, &#8211; consequently upon the happiness of society, &#8211;
                    these being the evils from which England was delivered by its conversion to Christianity. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> a picture of
                    Popery &amp; the evils from which the Reformation delivered us. 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> Puritanism rampant &amp; the evils from
                    which the restoration of the church delivered us. &#8211; 4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> a picture of Methodism &amp; the wilder sects,
                    showing what the evils are from which the Church Establishment preserves us. Under the three first heads the history of the
                    English Church would be included, with biographical sketches of all its greatest characters. &#8211; In the composition my aim would be
                    so to write as to impress the feelings of the young, making every thing as level as possible to their capacity, in the manner,
                    &amp; as impressive as possible to their imagination, while the matter should stand the test of critical examination &amp; satisfy
                    the maturest judgement. I should call it, the Book of the Church, &amp; (if I write it) shall not improbably accompany it with a
                    Book of the Constitution<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> This was not written.</note> for[MS torn] a similar plan. I am
                    inclined to think that two such books if put into the hands of youth would tend to attach [MS torn] strongly to the institutions
                    of their country, by making them understand [MS torn] love them.</p>
