        <p rend="indent1"> Last night on my return home after an absence of about three weeks I found your letter, which had arrived a few
                    hours before me. An interval of idleness, dissipation, &amp; that sort of discomfort which I always feel when disturbed from my
                    ordinary course of life, has made me hungry after quiet employment. I shall clear off a load of letter writing tomorrow, &amp;
                    begin upon the Tongatabou book, &#8211; of which I will send off a reviewal in the course of next week.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Vason (1771/2&#8211;1838), <title>An Authentic Narrative of Four Years&#8217; Residence at Tongataboo, One of the
                            Friendly Islands</title> (1810), used by Southey in his review of <title>Transactions of the Missionary Society in the
                            South Sea Islands</title>, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 2 (August 1809), 24&#8211;61 (esp. 36&#8211;37); Southey&#8217;s more detailed
                        appraisal of Vason is in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 3 (May 1810), 440&#8211;455.</note> That done I will fall to work totis

        <p rend="indent1"> Believe me I am truly grateful for your assistance in my historical pursuits. The MS. history of Lima<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Unidentified.</note> would be a treasure to me, &#8211; so would the Descripcion de las provincias

                        a duplicate is nowhere to be found, was given me by Mr Murray; it contains the fullest account which has yet been published on
                        the old Vice-royalty of Peru, province by province. The information was obtained from the respective Corregidores, and printed
                        for many successive years in the Lima Almanack, from whence some curioso cut out the whole collection, and formed them into
                        this <hi rend="ital">most valuable volume</hi>&#8217;.</note> The whole of the Mercurio Peruano<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Mercurio Peruano</title> (1790&#8211;1795), the first newspaper published in Peru.</note> I have seen, &amp; gutted of all
                    that it contains to my purpose. A second volume will compleat the history of Brazil.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Southey was mistaken; two further volumes of his <title>History of Brazil</title> appeared, in 1817 and 1819
                        respectively.</note> I have no intention of treating any other portion of S American affairs, &#8211; tho there is ample room for
                    histories of Mexico, of Peru, &amp; of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Modern Colombia and
                        parts of Venezuela.</note> subjects independent of each other, &amp; rich in interest materials. My plan is confined to
                    Portugal &amp; all its dependencies, &amp; this perhaps is as much as I have any reason to calculate upon life for accomplishing,
                    &#8211; if so precarious a thing as life could be calculated upon at all. I have however got thro <del>more th</del> not less than half
                    my task. The history of the mother country<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s long-planned, but never completed,
                        &#8216;History of Portugal&#8217;.</note> will fill three volumes, &#8211; that of its conquests in Asia, two, &#8211; &amp; a supplementary one will
                    probably be required for its African &amp; insular possessions. This done, &#8211; if I live to do this, my wish is to conclude my
                    historical labours with a history of the Monastic Orders,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> This was planned, but never
                        completed.</note> &#8211; which I think I could render equally amusing &amp; important.</p>

                    I have no doubt that the perfect independence with which it is written will be far more beneficial to the work, than any thing
                    could have been which displayed the spirit of a partizan.</p>
