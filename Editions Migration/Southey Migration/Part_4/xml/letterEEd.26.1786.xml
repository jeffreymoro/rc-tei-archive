        <p rend="indent1"> From Alstone to Penrith is twenty miles, &amp; the road is now so
                    much improved that a chaise can travel it. The distances on the other side of
                    Alstone I do not know; but I believe that from thence to Durham is something
                    more than forty miles. You may very well get here in the manner you propose.</p>

                    to be set in, &#8211; so as there is nothing to be done out of door I have invented a

                    know where to dispose of it, nor perhaps <del>xxx</del> discern its use. There
                    are many books which I am obliged to read over again, having read them too
