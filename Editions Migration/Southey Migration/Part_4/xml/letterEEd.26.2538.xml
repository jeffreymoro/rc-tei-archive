                    believe may safely be left to nature, which seems to be doing her part. Secondly concerning Roderick.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        Taylor (1772&#8211;1851), gentleman farmer, classicist and occasional contributor to the <title>Quarterly Review</title>: father of
                        Southey&#8217;s literary executor, <ref target="people.html#TaylorHenrySir">Sir Henry Taylor</ref>.</note> for his motto, which I
                    immediately sent to be placed on the back of the title page to the second edition.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title>, 2nd edn, 2 vols (London, 1815), had a motto from Publius Cornelius Tacitus (AD
                        56&#8211;117), <title>Histories</title>, Book 3, chapter 51: &#8216;Tanto acrior apud majores, sicut virtutibus gloria, ita flagitiis
                        p&#339;nitentia fuit. Sed h&#230;c aliaque ex veteri memori&#226; petita, quotiens res locusque exempla recti, aut solatia mali poscet, haud
                        absurd&#233; memorabimus.&#8217; The Latin translates as: &#8216;So much livelier among our ancestors was repentance for guilt as well as glory
                        in virtuous action. Such deeds as this and others like them, drawn from our earlier history, I shall not improperly insert in
                        my work whenever the theme or situation demands examples of the right or solace for the wrong&#8217;.</note> I <del>x</del> have

            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title>, 2nd edn, 2 vols (London, 1815), had the following epigraph: &#8216;As the ample
                        Moon, / In the deep stillness of a summer even / Rising behind a thick and lofty Grove, / Burns like an unconsuming fire of
                        light / In the green trees; and kindling on all sides / Their leafy umbrage turns the dusky veil / Into a substance glorious
                        as her own, / Yea with her own incorporated, by power / Capacious and serene: Like power abides / In man&#8217;s celestial Spirit;
                        Virtue thus / Sets forth and magnifies herself; thus feeds / A calm, a beautiful and silent fire, / From the incumbrances of
                        mortal life, / From error, disappointment,.. nay from guilt; / And sometimes, so relenting Justice wills, / From palpable
                        oppressions of Despair. / Wordsworth.&#8217; The source was Wordsworth, <title>The Excursion</title> (1814), Book 4, lines

                    cannot guess at its reception, for there is no calculating upon such a weathercock as popular favour. Rokeby certainly was not
                    popular, yet in point of dramatic conception of character it was the best of his poems. I read it thro as soon as it arrivd,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Scott&#8217;s <title>Rokeby: A Poem</title> (1813). For Southey&#8217;s reading of the poem; see

                    exceedingly curious.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1814 Joanna Southcott had announced that she was pregnant with
                        Shiloh (<title>Genesis</title> 49: 10); see <title>The Third Book of Wonders, Announcing the Coming of Shiloh</title> (1814)
                        and <title>Prophecies Announcing the Birth of the Prince of Peace</title> (1814). Her supposed condition excited tremendous
                        public excitement and ridicule. She was examined by a number of doctors, whose findings were widely reported. Shiloh failed to
                        appear and Southcott died on 27 December 1814. Her corpse was wrapped in flannel and kept warm for four days. Some of her
                        followers believed that she could be resuscitated and Shiloh born. An autopsy was finally conducted on 31 December, and no
                        foetus was found. Whilst some of her followers argued Shiloh had mysteriously disappeared, others present at the autopsy gave
                        physical explanations for Southcott&#8217;s condition; see Peter Mathias, <title>The Case of Johanna Southcott</title> (1815). After
                        her death, the Southcottians did fragment, though a core group remained loyal to her beliefs and protected the &#8216;great box&#8217; of

                    difficult would it be for a man properly qualified by talents, audacity &amp; common prudence to found a religion even at this
