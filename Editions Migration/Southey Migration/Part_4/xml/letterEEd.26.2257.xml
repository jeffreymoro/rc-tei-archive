          <salute>My dear Grosvenor</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Three weeks ago I wrote to <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John Ballantyne</ref> for &#163;50.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s letter to Ballantyne does not
                        appear to have survived.</note> To day he writes me from London that he is
                        <del>in</del> already in advance, &#8211; which is false, &#8211; for upon the
                    completion of this volume now in the press about 175 &#163; will be due to me, &#8211;
                    exclusive of the fifty which he has thus refused.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of course this brings things to a crisis. I have written to <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">his brother</ref>,
                    who has the character of a man of honour, &#8211; shown him in what manner <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John B.</ref> shuffles, desired him to
                    take back my share in the work, &amp; likewise to look out for a writer who may
                    succeed me in my department. &#8211; I have some little dependence upon the printers
                    character, &amp; rather more upon his connection with <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>; but lay my account with much
                    plague &amp; perhaps the loss of all that I have embarked in the concern.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Immediate embarrasment is the first consequence. If the money
                    which I sent should by good luck still remain in your desk, send me half of it,
                    &amp; buy in one hundred instead of two. If it is gone, let me have upon the
                    score of my pension<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had
                        received a government pension of &#163;200 p.a. (&#163;144 after tax) since
                        1807.</note> what you can spare me towards that amount. &#8211; The present
                    inconvenience I shall get over, &#8211; tho trouble will fall upon one who is not
                    easily <del>troubled</del> vexed, &#8211; &amp; I hope ultimately to be no loser by
                    disposing of so much time &amp; so much labour in another channel: but this time
                    must show.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am hard at work for <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>, &amp; hope he will be able to wait for me, &#8211; for this
                    article now becomes essential to my ways &amp; means. &#8211; Have you received

                    heart-breaking is this loss of naval-power! &#8211; This last action is perfectly
                    unaccountable. The Peacock was a <hi rend="ital">crack</hi> ship, her Captain as
                    fine a fellow as any in the navy, &#8211; &amp; the enemys superiority in guns a mere
                        nothing.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The 18-gun brig sloop
                            <hi rend="ital">Peacock</hi> had been sunk in action against USS <hi rend="ital">Hornet</hi> off the mouth of the Demerara River, Guyana on
                        24 February 1813. The <hi rend="ital">Peacock</hi>&#8217;s captain, William Peake
                        (1770&#8211;1813), and seven of her crew were killed in the battle and a further
                        nine British sailors died when the ship sank suddenly.</note>
