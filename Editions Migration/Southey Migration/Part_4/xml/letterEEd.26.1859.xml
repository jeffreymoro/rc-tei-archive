        <p rend="indent1"> The unusual circumstance of being engaged in company prevented me
                    from answering your note last night. I have Pasleys book for the Quarterly,
                    having applied for it immediately upon your first intimation of its
                        contents.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir Charles William
                        Pasley (1780&#8211;1861; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Essay on the Military Policy
                            and Institutions of the British Empire</title> (1810). It was sent to
                        Southey for review and Rickman provided him with helpful information and
                        briefing notes. The completed article was deemed by <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> to be &#8216;perfectly
                        incorrect and dangerous&#8217; with the result that the version published in the

                    yet begun the reviewal, tho I expect that every post will bring me a letter
                    enquiring if it is ready. I shall begin forthwith, &#8211; &amp; if <del>by this
                        day</del> &lt;in course of a&gt; fortnight you can supply me with your

        <p rend="indent1"> Did you not tell me that the poor store keeper in the Park the
                    object of Whitbreads<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey
                        recounted the full story in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 352&#8211;353. In 1809 the radical MP Samuel
                        Whitbread (1764&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>) had raised as a possible abuse of
                        office, the appointment of a German, Christian Frederick Walter (dates
                        unknown), to the post of ordnance store-keeper in Hyde Park, with a salary
                        of &#163;100 p.a., a house, and an allowance for coal and candles. Walter looked
                        after the gunpowder that had until recently been stored under the Record
                        Room in the Tower of London. As part of his work, he had to separate the
                        &#8216;serviceable from the unserviceable powder with a copper shovel&#8217;. The result
                        of Whitbread&#8217;s complaint was, as Southey explained, that &#8216;an industrious,
                        inoffensive old man&#8217; was turned &#8216;out of house and out of employment, that
                        is, literally to ruin&#8217; (353).</note> malice was employed in
                    <del>re</del>moving powder with a copper shovel? &#8211; &amp; that this said deposit
                    had formerly been under the room with the archives in the tower? &#8211; I desire
                    never to lose an opportunity of exposing Whitbreads meanness.</p>
