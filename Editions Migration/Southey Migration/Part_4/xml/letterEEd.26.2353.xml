          <salute>My dear Standart</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have behaved very ill to you, &#8211; &amp; am very conscious of having done so. You wrote me a letter twelve months
                    ago which contained one of the most affecting stories I ever read, &amp; which asked me about the fitness of Oxford as a
                    professional station. I began a reply, &#8211; something interrupted it; &#8211; it got into my desk, &amp; there shared the fate of too many
                    others, &#8211; being <del>xxxxxxx</del> buried under <del>the</del> &lt;a&gt; daily accumulation of correspondence. Its purport was
                    that I could only give you one introduction to Oxford, which is to the Chemical Professor <ref target="people.html#KiddJohn">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Kidd</ref>, an old school-fellow of mine, &amp; a good-natured man; &#8211; that I would do my best to obtain
                    others from <ref target="people.html#HeberRichard">Heber</ref>, an all-sufficient person in this case, &#8211; but that I thought it a
                    bad place for any person of your profession, because of Grosvenors<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Probably John Grosvenor
                        (1742&#8211;1823), Surgeon to the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.</note> high reputation, &#8211; &amp; for you in particular, &#8211; because for
                    any man whose thoughts do not travel precisely in the beaten track, the society of an English University is the very worst
                    imaginable. The intellectual atmosphere of the place is a <hi rend="ital">malaria</hi> which I would shun like the Pontine
                    marshes.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Now to your recent letter. You may be assured that if it were in my power to render service to any person for whom
                    you were interested I should be most happy to exert myself. But tho at this <del>xxxxxx</del> time I want employment, or
                    promotion, for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</ref>, I am endeavouring to obtain it from <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Croker</ref> thro the interference of a third person, because I
                    cannot solicit it myself. <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Croker</ref> is a man in power, a man
                    of business, &amp; a man of letters. In the first of these characters there is, for one of my habits, no attraction; &#8211; in the
                    second &#8211; a good deal to repel, &#8211; &amp; my acquaintance with him <del>xxxx xxxx</del> in the third is less than, I dare say, it
                    otherwise would be, if he were not so deeply engaged in official duties, &amp; if he were upon a level with me in worldly
                    circumstances. I am beholden to him for many civilities &amp; for some acts of unsolicited kindness. He asked the office of

                    obtained for me this Laureateship, which I did not desire, but which I could not have declined without cowardice, &amp; to which I
                    shall return the respectability <del>which</del> &lt;that&gt; originally belonged to it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I saw <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</ref> a few days before his departure. The alleged object of his
                    journey is to examine the extinct volcanoes in Auvergne.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Davy&#8217;s travels lasted eighteen
                        months and also took him to Naples, where he observed the eruption of Vesuvius. He was accompanied by his wife and by Michael
                        Faraday (1791&#8211;1867; <title>DNB</title>), who served as assistant and occasional valet.</note> It is surmised that there is a

                    &amp; it will be found less mortifying to form a more modest establishment after a year or two&#8217;s absence, than to confess
                    imprudence by adopting immediate measures of retrenchment. I fear vanity rather than science leads him to France; it gratifies him
                    a little, &amp; <ref target="people.html#DavyJane">his wife</ref> more, to show that they are privileged persons, &amp; can obtain
