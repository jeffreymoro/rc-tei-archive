        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for a profitable letter. &#8211; In return I have only time to say I had <ref target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">another daughter</ref> born this day, &amp; &#8211; in seamans phrase &#8211; all&#8217;s well.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The inclosed goes to request a speedy transmission of the second vol. of the Cortes Journals, which owing to the
                    awkward mode of beginning with the fourth, has not been sent me.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Diario de las Discusiones y Actas de las Cortes, 1810&#8211;1813</title>, 19 vols (1811&#8211;1813), no. 3288 in the sale catalogue
                        of Southey&#8217;s library. &#8216;the fourth&#8217; was the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title> (1813), which Southey was
                        attempting to complete early in order to boost its sales.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Population Book had better travel by the Via Longmannia.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> It is not
                        clear what Southey is referring to here. Possibly Rickman was sending him some material from the 1811 Census, which he had
                        organised. It was sufficiently weighty to warrant transmission by Southey&#8217;s publishers, Longman &amp; Co.</note> I think the
                        <ref target="people.html#BurneyJames">Capitaneus</ref> offered me once a Dutch history of the buccaneers<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Alexandre Esquemelin (1645&#8211;1707), <title>De Americaeneche Zee Roovers</title> (1678). Southey&#8217;s
                        copy, no. 927 in the sale catalogue of his library, was a &#8216;<title>Presentation Copy from Capt. Burney</title>&#8217;. The Spanish
                        translation, <title>Piratas de la America</title> (1681), no. 1462 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, contained much
                        extra material. The first English translation appeared in 1684 as <title>Bucaniers of America</title> and followed the Spanish
                        version.</note> &#8211; that might come also. I wish to see it, because Bryan Edward<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bryan

                            Indies</title> (1793). Southey possessed a later edition of 1807, and Edwards&#8217;s &#8216;suspicion&#8217; appears in vol. 3, p. 136. The
                        book was no. 986 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> throws out a suspicion that the shocking stories of
                    cruelty with which our history abounds are not in the Dutch original, but interpolated by the Spanish translator from whose
                    version it was done into English. &#8211; I believe in the cruelties.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is a secret history about Christian Curwen. He would have carried his election hollow, if he could have faced
                    the stories that would have been brought forward as electioneering weapons against him. The country at this moment rings with

                        concerning his seduction of Dorothy Watson (1777&#8211;1837), eldest daughter of Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, who owned a
