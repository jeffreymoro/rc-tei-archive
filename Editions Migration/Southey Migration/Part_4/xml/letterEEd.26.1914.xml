        <p rend="indent1"> The Austrian money business<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The British opposition had criticised some of
                        the loans and subsidies given to Britain&#8217;s continental allies, e.g. the debate in the Commons on 12 May 1809 in which money
                        given to Austria in particular was discussed, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 302&#8211;304.</note>
                    belongs no doubt to 1810, &amp; I shall come upon it in the course of the Debates. Your information that there are no other papers
                    is more agreable to me at this time than any papers themselves could be. I am getting on strenuously. 448 pages printed, &#8211; that is
                    only ten short of the former volume. 40 in the printers hands. 132 ready for him, &#8211; &amp; still it will be hard work to be ready
                    for setting off the last week in May. An unmerciful year costing me a full ten weeks extra labour.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ballantyne was concerned enough about the length of Southey&#8217;s contributions to insist that the latter
                        explained himself to the readers in a prefatory note; see <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811),

                        18 April 1811. He left nothing to his brother&#8217;s children. The &#8216;acquaintance&#8217; was possibly William Oliver (1775&#8211;1830) of Hope
                        Corner, Taunton.</note> I always thought this likely, &amp; having had no expectations am neither disappointed nor

                        also probably recalling the title of the popular Irish song &#8216;Ally Croker&#8217; (1725).</note>
