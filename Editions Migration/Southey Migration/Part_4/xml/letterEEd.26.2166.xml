                        against the influence of dissenting teachers.</note> is not here; but I have stated to him the case &amp; the claim of your
                    friend, &amp; I shall lose no opportunity of following up what I have begun. But I confess I can hold out no good hopes to you.
                    You know that the late Bishop of London<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Beilby Porteus (1731&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>),
                        bishop of London from 1787 to his death. A supporter of evangelicals and of the abolition of the slave trade.</note> thought
                    it necessary to make an apology for his having given a living to a foreigner, who was thought to have peculiar merit,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Frederick Usko (1760&#8211;1841), a Prussian, was appointed by Porteous as Rector of Orsett in
                        Essex. For Porteous&#8217;s lengthy explanation, see his letter of 20 July 1808, <title>Ecclesiastical and University Annual
                            Register for 1808</title> (1809), 145&#8211;150.</note> &amp; the jealousy of the Clergy of all such appointments is well known.
                    I mention these things to prevent any reliance on any attempts I may have an opportunity of making, not as an apology for not
                    making them. The best chance, as I conceive, would be with Government, or the Chancellor.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon (1751&#8211;1838; <title>DNB</title>), Lord Chancellor 1801&#8211;1806, 1807&#8211;1827. The Lord Chancellor is,
                            <hi rend="ital">ex officio</hi>, the patron of over 500 livings.</note> If your friend can recommend himself to them, they
                    might out of the multitude of their livings perhaps spare such a one as might be an object for him. But even here political &amp;
                    parliamentary interest &#8211; &amp; also the jealousy of the English as to foreigners may stand in the way.&#8221;</p>

                    &#8211; to the great injury of the passage. feudal power &#8211; is but a <del>xx</del> poor substitute. But when the poem was begun the
                    character of Roderick was not formed as it is now, &amp; it is well that no other change is rendered necessary by the modification
                    which it has undergone.</p>
