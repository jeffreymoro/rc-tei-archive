                        pp. 227&#8211;238. It was retitled &#8216;Ode, Written During the War with America, 1814&#8217; in the 1837&#8211;1838 edition of Southey&#8217;s poetical

                    it is in the higher power to exact it. However I shall no longer feel myself bound to volunteer upon <del>xxxx</del> extraordinary

                    mischievously broken off. Willing to be in time, as soon as I was assured that the marriage was to be, I fell to work &amp;
                    produced some fifty six-lined stanzas, &#8211; being about half of a poem, in the old manner, which would have done me credit.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> In June 1814 the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince Regent&#8217;s</ref> only

                        had planned a poem on the forthcoming nuptials. This eventually appeared in 1816 as <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen
                            Nuptiale</title> (1816), in celebration of Charlotte&#8217;s marriage to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790&#8211;1865).</note>
