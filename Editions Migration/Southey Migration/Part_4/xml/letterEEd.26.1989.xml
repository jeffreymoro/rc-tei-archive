        <p rend="indent1"> Idle forms and endless procrastinations seem to be the curse of our nation in all its concerns, from the most
                    momentous war down to the pettiest lawsuit. However, these great people have set their hands and ideas to the work, and that is of
                    great importance.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of
                        the Christian Church had just been founded in November 1811, to promote Bell&#8217;s methods.</note> Under their countenance, there
                    will be no lack of those who will set their shoulders to it. <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> sent me a large
                    packet soon after your departure.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to John Murray, 2 November 1811, Letter

                        Lancaster had satirised Bell as one of the &#8216;Knights of the Rod, who wish to perpetuate the reign of ignorance among the lower
                        classes of society &#8230; These plead, with mighty virulence, for every mode of punishment that can embitter learning, and make
                        school hateful to boys.&#8217; Lancaster added, &#8216;The sinking empire of the rod is tottering daily to ruin, and many and bitter are
                        the lamentations of its partizans&#8217;; see <title>The British System of Education</title> (London, 1810), p. 38.</note> and some

                        series of &#8216;Instruments and Modes of Punishments&#8217;, to discipline refractory pupils. These included: a log placed around the
                        neck; wooden shackles; confinement after school hours, if necessary by tying a pupil to his desk; and a sack or basket in
                        which a pupil could be suspended above the classroom. Public humiliation was also used to enforce discipline: e.g. the faults
                        of the offender were proclaimed before the rest of the school; a girl would wash the face of a dirty pupil before his
                        classmates; inappropriate tone of voice when reading was held up to ridicule; and badly-behaved pupils had to wear labels
                        describing their offence, e.g. &#8216;Idle&#8217;, &#8216;Suck finger Baby&#8217;. Lancaster assured his readers that these punishments had been tried
                        for 13 years with great success.</note> which will not a little enrich the list of that worthy&#8217;s inventions. <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has not sent me the Bishop of London&#8217;s letter,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Beilby Porteus (1731&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), bishop of London from 1791 to his death.
