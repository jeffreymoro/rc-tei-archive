                        of <title>Observador Portuguez</title> (1809), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 4 (August 1810), 1&#8211;24.</note> Both your
                    parcels arrived safely. I thank you for Eltons Poems,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poet, translator, theologian and
                        occasional reviewer for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, Charles Abraham Elton (1778&#8211;1853; <title>DNB</title>). Elton,
                        like Southey, was Bristol-born. In 1810 he published <title>Tales of Romance, with Other Poems</title>.</note> &#8211; he succeeds
                    best when he relies most upon himself, &#8211; some of his blank verse is very beautiful, &amp; I remember in a former volume of his, a
                    sonnet which I thought one of the best &amp; most original that I had ever seen.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Elton&#8217;s
                            <title>Poems</title> (London, 1804), pp. 59&#8211;72, included twelve sonnets.</note> The Spanish volume<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Descripcion de las Provincias Pertenecientes al Arzobispado di Lima&#8217;; no. 3645 in the sale catalogue of
                        Southey&#8217;s library, inscribed in his hand: &#8216;This book of which perhaps a duplicate is nowhere to be found, was given me by Mr
                        Murray; it contains the fullest account which has yet been published on the old Vice-royalty of Peru, province by province.
                        The information was obtained from the respective Corregidores, and printed for many successive years in the Lima Almanack,
                        from whence some curioso cut out the whole collection, and formed them into this <hi rend="ital">most valuable
                        volume</hi>&#8217;.</note> which you have been kind enough to borrow for me, proves to be singularly curious. It consists of
                    accounts of all the provinces under the several governments of Peru Chile &amp;c &#8211; <del>&amp; contains more</del>
                        &lt;<del>far</del>&gt; <del>more information</del> published at the end of the Lima Almanacks from about the year
                        <del>176</del> 1759 &#8211; or 60 to 1776 &#8211; &amp; the information which they contain is far greater than can be gleaned from the

        <p rend="indent1"> When application was made to me some years ago to bear a part in the Edinburgh Review, I refused upon the ground,
                    among other, of the cruel manner of criticism which <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</ref> had adopted, &amp; the
