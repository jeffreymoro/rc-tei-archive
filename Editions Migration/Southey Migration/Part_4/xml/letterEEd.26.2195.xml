        <p rend="indent1"> In the first volume of Clarkes Travels there are the portraits of some Calmuck Gods, &#8211; very notable to me, as
                    distinctly showing me the pedigree of Tezcalipoca &amp; my other Mexican friends, &#8211; traceable in this line to India.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Daniel Clarke (1769&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Travels in Various Countries of

                        245, a set of four &#8216;Sacred Pictures in use among the Calmuck Tribes&#8217;. Southey later acquired an 11-volume edition of Clarke&#8217;s
                            <title>Travels</title> (1816&#8211;1824), no. 601 in the sale catalogue of his library. A student of comparative religion,
                        Southey here connects the Calmuck deities with those of Mexico and India, the latter two featured in <title>Madoc</title>
                        (1805) and <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810).</note> This book of Clarkes is curious. I never derived so much valuable
                    information from any work, which left me with so little respect for the author. Shallow, conceited &amp; prejudiced to the highest
