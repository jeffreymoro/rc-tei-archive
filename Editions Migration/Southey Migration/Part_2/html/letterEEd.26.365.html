            <p class="indent1">We had an adventure this morning which has much amused us. As we were beginning breakfast,
               a well dressed woman entered the room, &amp; said she was come to take a little breakfast
               with us. we thought she was deranged. this however was evidently not the case, &amp; it
               was not without great difficulty I refrained from laughing at the oddity of the visit
               during the whole of the meal time. When she had done she rose up &amp; askd what was to
               pay, &amp; as you may suppose was somewhat confused when she found that we did not keep
               a public house. the poor woman breakfasted I believe in a state of very uncomfortable
               doubt, for the sight of my books which fronted her might have shown her that she had
               made some blunder. She was walking from Bristol some little way farther into the country,
               &amp; found herself so cold &amp; hungry that she determined to breakfast on the road.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My complaint is relieved, &amp; when it returns affects me less because I am accustomed
               to it &amp; acquainted with its cause. when the weather will permit it bathing is prescribed

                  written some sheets, but wanted the talents &amp; the learning requisite (– which God
                  knows he did!) – that he could command the money necessary for publication &amp; an extensive
                  subscription. in short he wanted my assistance &amp; my name. What he meant by a Glossary
                  it was not very easy to comprehend; he had an idea that to understand the English <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxx</span> language it was necessary to read the dictionary thro, &amp; that two or three times,
                  &amp; as far as I could unravel his meaning it was to make a dictionary of elegant words
                  which gentlemen would be very glad to use if they understood them, &amp; which would save
                  them the trouble of studying Johnsons two folios.
