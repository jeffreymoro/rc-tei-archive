            <p class="indent1">I have been long silent. we are with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</a>, &amp; in rambling about this country much time has been employed.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You ask me my opinion how a Lawyer should act. they tell me he should undertake any
               cause, because if he refuses to be the advocate he makes himself the judge. my dear
               friend this may be true – but I never go to my head for an answer when my heart is
               ready with one. certainly I would not plead in a bad cause. I <span class="ital">feel</span> it would be wrong. I have no love for the profession – but I have a strong &amp; honourable
               love of independance, &amp; would labour for it. Sometimes I think I have mistaken the
               road. of all modes of life that of a clergyman would best suit my habits &amp; feelings.
               I should have been happy &amp; useful in the church had my creed permitted it. were I
               again at liberty to chuse my way of life I should not hesitate at becoming a dissenting
               minister. Ambition I have none; &amp; a little satisfies me. I want nothing but independance
               &amp; leisure for my favourite studies. these the law will I hope afford me, &amp; that not
               at too late a period. I should have been more useful as a minister &amp; better satisfied.</p>
