                           measures to relieve the civil disabilities on Roman Catholics. The fall of his ministry
                           was also expected to pave the way for peace with France.</span></div>

               may now be turned successfully against them. Yet on this point, the whole body of
               opposition is with them, &amp; the whole intellect of the country. I rather expect after
               more inefficient changes the establishment of opposition – &amp; peace. the helm requires

                  up the wheat with the tares. the monastic establishments in England ought to be dissolved.
                  as for the Priests, they will for the most part find their way into France. they who
                  remain should not be suffered to recruit &amp; would soon die away in peace. I half fear
