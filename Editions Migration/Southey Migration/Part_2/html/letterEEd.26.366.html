            <p>Address: To/ Grosvenor Charles Bedford Esqr/ Exchequer/ London/ Single<br>Stamped: [partial] OL<br>Postmark: B/ JA/ 4/ 99<br>Endorsement: 3 Janry 1799<br>MS: Bodleian Library, MS Eng. Lett. c. 23<br>Previously published: Kenneth Curry (ed.), <em>New Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 2 vols (London and New York, 1965), I, pp. 179–180.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It is a favourite article of belief with me Grosvenor, that friendship &amp; affections
               will continue in the next world; yet there are some awkward objections to it, it is
               not analogous to what passes here, nothing lasts, – Nature seems to delight in disorganizing
               to reproduce. not only does every thing change around us but we change ourselves –
               the oak indeed was contained in the acorn, but it is not to the human eye that the
               resemblance is visible.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There is a great difference between love &amp; friendship; absence &amp; cohabitation increase
                  the one &amp; slowly destroy the other. if I wishd to preserve a friend I would rather
                  perhaps have him in the East Indies than in the house with me. but even absence weakens
                  this kind of attachment, for the apartments of friendship in the heart are never long
                  vacant. however Grosvenor there is a kind of cabinet or closet in mine belonging to
                  you, &amp; I am sorry that you so long keep it shut up, &amp; only leave in it a parcel of
                  old letters &amp; old recollections by way of keeping possession. I often feel a wish
                  to write to you when some imperious business employs me otherwise, – for by the Lord
                  tho you were Commander in Chief of the Light Horse, Chancellor of the Exchequer, or
                  even a Mamaluck Bey,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)

                           council, or divan, presided over by a Turkish pasha or governor. By the time of the
                           French invasion of Egypt in 1798, the Beys had become warlords, each ruling over their
                           own separate kingdom.</span></div>
                  </div> I should &amp; would call you &amp; think of you Grosvenor Bedford. I never offended any body
                  by my opinions yet except one old woman – &amp; as you are not an old woman I am determined
                  not to offend you – no – tho I were in the punchinello dress of the grand costume
                  of the Great Nation, you should recognize my original nose.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I have not been well Grosvenor, &amp; my indisposition has given me some acquaintance
               with the nervous system. I walk &amp; take ether. the fact is I have hurt myself by sitting
               at the desk; &amp; this is as convenient for me as it would be for a running footman to
               strain his ancle, or an Alderman to have the Mumps. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is of late much mended in her health – for me I look on the spring &amp; the effect of
               bathing.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I shall have a book to send you soon. the frost has been freezing the printers ink
               &amp; paper, &amp; the Devil himself was almost starved. </p>
            <p class="indent1">What is become of you? &amp; what are you thinking of &amp; what interests you now? – four
               years ago you &amp; I were interested in every thing that concerned the other, – I sometimes
               tremble for my favourite article of belief. </p>
            <p class="indent1">Certainly Grosvenor if we both go to heaven we shall only see one another there occasionally
               as visitors, for I shall be among a whole herd of Frenchmen – Revolutionists, &amp; a
               sort of Quaker Christians who have a mortal antipathy to regimentals. however I will
               come to your star sometimes, if the gulph between be passable, &amp; you shall laugh at
               my tricolor cockade, &amp; I will laugh at your court suit.</p>
