            <p class="indent1">And now I have a tale to relate which you might doubt if it came from less authentic
               sources. for thank God these instances of frantic passion are almost unknown amongst
               Englishmen. A serjeant in the English cavalry quartered at Belem was jealous of his
               wife, suspecting her to be attached to one who held the same rank in the same regiment.
               attached to the man she certainly was, but I believe with no other criminality than
               this mental preference. she was handsome &amp; a very well behaved woman. the man remarkably
               decent – these are <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> words. The Husband on account of this jealousy beat his wife. this made the other
               man so unhappy that he declared his intention of destroying himself. accordingly on
               Monday last, &amp; after the hour when the Soldiers are punishable if out of quarters,
               in a taberna, he shot himself &amp; died instantly. at the tidings the Woman came in,
               in a state of frantic agony. she gathered from the ground the blood &amp; the dust with
               which it had mingled &amp; swallowed all she could collect. her husband attempted to force
               her away. she called the Centinel charged him with her husband &amp; threatened to report
               <span class="ital">him</span> to the Colonel unless he took him into custody. The Centinel foolishly did his military
               duty – &amp; the Woman no longer prevented, ran to a Well in the barrack yard &amp; leapt
               down. only solitary confinement &amp; bread &amp; water have prevented <span style="text-decoration: line-through">him</span> &lt;the Husband&gt; from consummating the tragedy by self-murder also. The bodies were
               not brought to Lisbon for Xtian burial, neither was the savage indecency of driving
               a stake thro them perpetrated. a grave was dug in the sands at low water, one grave,
               the Lover &amp; the Wife were laid in it – &amp; the Tagus now flows over them. be sure I
               shall enquire the spot. only the perversion of strong &amp; good feelings could have occasioned
               this madness.</p>
