                  how I can. if I can find any friend disengaged enough to stroll somewhere with me
                  during that time it would be infinitely more agreable than remaining in London. I
                  should like to walk to the Peak &amp; see the wonders of Derbyshire, or to ramble round
                  Kent, much of which country I have never seen, &amp; what would not be new it would be
