                  </div> his wounds are slight but his escape has been wonderful. the Boatswain came to know
                  if they should board the enemy forwards &amp; was told by all means. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> took a pike &amp; ran forwards – he found them in great confusion &amp; as he thought only
                  wanting a leader. he asked if they would follow him, &amp; one poor fellow answered –
                  Aye by God Sir – to Hell! – on this <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> got into the French ship followed as he thought by the rest – but in fact only by
                  this man. just as he had made good his footing, he received two thrusts with a pike
                  in his right thigh &amp; fell. they made a third thrust as he fell, which glanced from
                  his shoulder blade &amp; took a small piece of flesh out of his back. he fell between
                  the two ships &amp; this saved his life, for he caught a rope – &amp; regained the deck of
                  the Mars.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">We expect him home daily. he attended the funeral of poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodAlexanderCaptain">Captain Hood</a>, a man who was uncommonly kind to him, &amp; whom he respected &amp; regrets.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is better one day &amp; worse the next – in that languid &amp; declining way – that fluctuating
               state that seems only to raise hopes to destroy them. Of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> I have hopes it is anxiety that has been the primary source of her illness – but
               I now hope that the causes will soon be removed, &amp; am willing to believe that the
               effect will cease also. Our prospects would be brighter than they ever yet have been
               – were it not for these clouds. I do not love to dwell upon this subject – let what
               will come I am prepared – &amp; knowing this it is better as far as possible to immerse
               myself like a school boy in the present.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Why have you been so silent? do not hint at any of this when you write – I shall see
               you in a fortnight &amp; will then tell you what alteration that time has made. it will
               not be much – I fear me there is a slow wasting away. I am very well myself; but far
               less capable of bearing fatigue than I have been. the machine was not made to last
               long – but it will last as long as I shall wish it.</p>

                  him a birth on board his own ship. he will use his own judgement – &amp; probably I think
                  follow the fortune of Butterfield the 1<sup>st</sup> Lieutenant.

                  something like exultation to know that he would now be respected by his acquaintance
