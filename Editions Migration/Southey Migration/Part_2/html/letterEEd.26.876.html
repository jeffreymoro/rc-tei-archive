               am vexed – perhaps more vexed than you, being more hopeless of the boy, &amp; more convinced
               that there is some radical &amp; incurable defect in his nature. that total want of all
               diffidence – of all shame which has been apparent in him even from his infancy, is
               to me something frightful &amp; monstrous. it is as much a defect in moral organization
               as it is in the bodily frame to be born without head or feet, &amp; God knows a thousand-fold
               worse in its consequences. No doubt he is returned to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his infamous Aunt</a>. you need be under no uneasiness for his immediate fate. but that such a boy can
               ever turn out well &amp; occasion any thing but grief &amp; shame to his relatives, or obtain
               any thing but sorrow &amp; shame for himself is according to all my foresight utterly
               impossible.</p>

               <p>For Gods sake adapt your mode of living to the climate you are going to, &amp; abstain

                  </div> an East Indian Officer here, with whom we dined on Xmas day, told me that in India
                  the officers who were looking out for preferment – as a majority &amp;c. &amp; who kept lists
                  of all above them, always marked those who drank any spirits in a morning with a X
                  &amp; reckoned them for nothing. One day, said he, when we were about to march at day
                  break, I &amp; Capt Somebody were in my tent &amp; we saw a German of our Regiment – so I
                  said we’d try him. We calld to him – said it was a cold morning &amp; asked him if he
                  would drink a glass to warm him – I got him a full beaker of brandy &amp; water &amp; egod
                  – he drank it off. when he was gone, I said – Well – what dy’e think? We may cross
                  him, may’nt we? oh yes – said he – cross him by all means. And the German did not
                  live twelve months. Spice is the stimulus given by nature to hot countries, &amp; eaten
                  in whatever quantities can do no harm. But the natives of all hot countries invariably
                  abstain from spirits as deadly. eat fruits plentifully – provided they do not produce
                  flux. animal food sparingly in the hot season – fish will be better than meat. do
                  not venture to walk or ride in the heat of the sun, &amp; do not be ashamed of a parasol
                  – it has saved many a mans life. I am sure all this is very physical &amp; philosophical
                  sense. But I will desire <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KingJohn">King</a>, who knows the West Indies to write out to you a letter of medical advice. this is
                  certain that bilious people fare worst – &amp; nervous people – for fear predisposes for
                  disease. from those causes thank God you are safe.</p>

                  of course there are no Spanish books except at the Spanish islands – Oh that I were

                  death of a humming bird for the sake of keeping his corpse in a cabinet. but with
                  crocodiles, sharks &amp; land crabs it is fair play – you catch them or they you. Your
