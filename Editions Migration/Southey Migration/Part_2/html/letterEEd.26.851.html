            <p class="indent1">From your long silence I was beginning to be apprehensive that you might be ill. I
               now write under an apprehension of a different nature – lest you should have sent
               me a draft which has miscarried – as in the Falmouth case. the last you gave me was
               in London, &amp; my finances are now drained.</p>

                  now look on as my first ononymous labour. It gives me an awful kind of feeling – for
                  it is now fifteen years since I first took up the subject – &amp; almost as long since
                  you first heard of it. so many hours have been devoted to it – it has occupied so
                  many of my thoughts &amp; feelings – &amp; when it is once gone forth I shall feel as if my
                  harvest was got in &amp; the winter hard at hand.</p>

                  Some six months hence I must perhaps move to see Madoc thro the press – &amp; in that
                  case shall prefer Edinburgh to London, being nearer, &amp; because I have never seen it
                  – &amp; my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> will be there. My plan is to print the book myself &amp; get subscriptions – that is names,
                  not publishing this intention, till I have first felt whether or not it be likely
                  to succeed. the price shall be a guinea – it shall be printed in quarto if that price
                  will allow it – if not in a smaller size. I am puzzled for a device for your arms
