            <p class="indent1">I have not had the heart to write to you, though the long silence has lain like a
               load upon my conscience. When we parted I had as much present happiness as man could
               wish, and was full of all cheerful hopes: however, no man, if he be good for any thing,
               but is the better for suffering. It has long been my habit to look for the good that
               is to be found in every thing, and that alchemy is worth more than the grand secret
