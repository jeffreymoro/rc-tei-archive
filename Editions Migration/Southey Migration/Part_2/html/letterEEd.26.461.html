               <p>The journey gave me increased pain, less however than I expected, &amp; I feel no ill

I have consulted with one Physician before I put myself under <span class="ital"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</a>, in whom I have perfect faith</span>. he was inclined to believe it nervous, the effect of excessive irritability. recommended
                  exercise, as little application as possible to any study – &amp; by no means the leaning
                  posture of writing. my chest he said was by no means of a consumptive make, but he
                  hinted the cow-house as a remedy.
