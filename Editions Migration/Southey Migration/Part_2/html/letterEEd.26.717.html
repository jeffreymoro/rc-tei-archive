               will I trust excuse me. a domestic circumstance of the dearest nature – the birth
               of a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">first child</a> – had made me forget it.</p>

                  is merely to compile – &amp; it has been done to serve the family, not from any pleasure
                  which the object itself afforded. A quantity of unpublished poems have been discovered
                  – for the most part mere rubbish – party-poems or personal – but always <span style="text-decoration: line-through">discove</span> displaying a facility &amp; sometimes a power of language, which might I think have produced
                  great things. Chattertons character appears to me to be solved by madness. It is the
