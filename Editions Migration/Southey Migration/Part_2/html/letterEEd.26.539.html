                  one without some kind of fear. poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillMargaret">Peggy</a>! – her disease I thought incurable – but still it was intermitting &amp; its long intervals
                  might be intervals of enjoyment. she would always be dependent – but I am looking
                  on to better days, &amp; trusted that at some, no very remote time, I should be able to

                  the startings &amp; head seizures returned. it was not merely climate that I wished to
                  seek as medicinal, it was the plunging into &lt;new&gt; scenes – the total abandonment of
                  all irksome thoughts &amp; employments – it has succeeded. my spirits have been as my
