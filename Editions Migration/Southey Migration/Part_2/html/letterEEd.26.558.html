                  could be apprehended from invasion. no such danger has ever existed. before a French

                  is kept in chests ready at a moments alarm. the multitude of ships always in the Tagus

                  sugar casks sweeten their lemonade. besides provisions are scarce both here &amp; in Spain.
                  a hostile army could not subsist six weeks. If however the French should chuse to
                  take possession of Lisbon in order to distress England – the blow would speedily recoil.
