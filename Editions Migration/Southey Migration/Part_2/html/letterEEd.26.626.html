            <p>Address: To/ Miss Barker.<br>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick Jnr, ‘The Letters
               of Robert Southey to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826’ (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967),
               pp. 20-21 [where it is dated December 1801]<br>Previously published: John Wood Warter (ed.), <em>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 4 vols (London, 1856), I, pp. 180–181.<br>Dating note: Miss Barker had visited Southey in London and left by 3 December 1801
               (Southey to Danvers 2-3 December 1801, Letter 634). This letter was written in reply
               to a letter of Mary Barker’s and in expectation of her visit. A date of mid-late November
               1801 can therefore be suggested for this letter.</p>
