                  I have among my friends some of wealthy &amp; extensive connections, who would effectually
                  assist the first foundation. will not the chief difficulty be in making respectable

                  </div> whom I knew (the author of letters from Barbary Spain &amp;c.) among his other whims had
                  a quaint one for making cross breeds to improve the human species; so he married a
                  Spaniard. but upon his theory I should think the best breed would be from a French
                  mother &amp; an English father. the state of women in the East, is to my judgement, the
                  main cause why those countries are enslaved &amp; stationary or rather retrogressive.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Polygamy enslaves necessarily &amp; voluptualizes the women. so, except in perpetuating
               the race, they do no good in society – &amp; one might doubt whether they do any good
               by that – for better is a wilderness than a Turkish province. in a harem vanity &amp;
               envy will predominate, &amp; each seeks the caresses of the husband to mortify the rest,
               &amp; the whole of female education there is limited to instructions how to stimulate
               desire. the perpetual excitements of polygamy probably occasion at least half the
               libidinous habits attributed to climate. early debility is the consequence, &amp; such
               men must be slaves.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In Arabia the women are not ashamed to shew their faces to a stranger – because they
               are not unchaste. polygamy is not common, &amp; I believe the usual vice of the East,
               almost unknown. voluptuousness is not the characteristic of the Arabs – yet their
               climate is at least as hot as any part of Persia.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Popular superstitions cannot have occasioned the despotisms of the East. perhaps no
                  religion is hostile to improvement (except the Hindoo –) but every religious establishment.

                  in referring the inferiority of the Orientals to polygamy as the chief cause? China
