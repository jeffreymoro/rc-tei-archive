                  has more than once ravaged this country. It has extended from Cadiz over all Andalusia.

                  of the contagion by the rains, it must I think <span style="text-decoration: line-through">infall</span> inevitably reach us. We talk of this with more coolness than you will hear of it.
                  If danger approaches we shall fly – but not I think to England. more probably to the
                  north of Portugal, to some little town or village among the mountains: the cause of
                  our flight would be painful, but a residence entirely among the natives would be useful

                  whether on the whole this migration be not desirable. so is it that individuals profit

                  sky rockets &amp; merry-making all the way. four Angels on horseback were in the procession.
                  on the fifth night they returned – &amp; the four Angels then alternately addressed their
                  Lady – informed her of all they had been doing to her honour &amp; glory, &amp; besought her
