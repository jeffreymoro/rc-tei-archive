            <p>MS: Untraced; text is taken from John Feltham, <em>A Tour Through the Island of Mann</em> (1798)<br> Previously published: John Feltham, <em>A Tour Through the Island of Mann, In 1797 and 1798; Comprising Sketches of its Ancient
                  and Modern History, Constitutions, Laws, Commerce, Agriculture, Fishery, &amp;c.</em> (Bath, 1798), p. 124.<br> Note on text: the letter survives only as one sentence, extracted from a letter sent
               by Southey to Feltham and included in the latter’s <em>Tour</em>. Feltham’s publisher was Richard Cruttwell, who had also issued Southey and Robert
               Lovell’s <em>Poems</em> (1795).</p>
