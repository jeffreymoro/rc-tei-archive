               <p>So long is it since I have written to you that I write almost at random. a thousand
                  changes may have happened – perhaps I may misdirect. day after day &amp; week after week
                  have I thought of writing, &amp; always something to do or think of has prevented me.

                  state of health – she looks sixty years of age. in other respects they are the same
                  women as ever, but I saw them &amp; remember them with pain. never was a family so destroyed.</p>

               of relations. sedentary habits, always my choice &amp; of late rendered necessary, have
               injured my health something. this I am endeavouring to remedy by a little medicine
               &amp; much exercise. the world &amp; I however agree well together. I have as much enjoyment
               as a man ought to expect or desire, &amp; as for labouring for it, there is something

               years Latin &amp; Greek is necessary for him &amp; in looking round for a school at which
               to place him, you recurred to my recollection. are you still at Kingsbridge? &amp; what
               are the terms of the school in which you are engaged? he is a boy of great talents,
               from whom if he turns out well, much may be hoped. for the last year he has been with
