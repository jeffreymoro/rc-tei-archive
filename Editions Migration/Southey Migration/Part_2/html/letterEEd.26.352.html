            <p class="indent1">Without a map my dear Edith will know nothing of the place I date from, &amp; if she have
               a map to refer to, very probably she may miss the name. we are however near <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Lanthony">Lanthony</a>, if not the most important certainly the most agreable object of our journey. by
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</a>’s letter this day put in the post office at Brecon, you will have learnt how we travelled
               up a most delightful glen to the mountain top, &amp; how after hobbling over turnpike
               roads, which would have overturned any broad wheeld waggon, we reached <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MerthyrTidvil">Merthyr Tidvil</a>, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MaberGeorge">Maber</a>. him I found the same as ever, civil, formal, &amp; tiresome; however the conversation
               about <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> was happily introduced &amp; that matter is well settled. this has reconciled me to my
               journey – for otherwise Edith I should have half repented it. I often wish myself
               at home. all these mountain beauties are pleasant enough to see, but they will be
               pleasanter to recollect.</p>
            <p class="indent1">What have we seen? woods – mountains, &amp; mountain glens &amp; streams. in those woods are
               comprehended all imaginable beauty. sometimes we have been winding up the dingle side,
               &amp; every minute catching the stream below thro the wood that half hid it, always hearing
               its roar. then over mountains where nothing was to be seen but hill &amp; sky, their sides
               rent by the winter streams. sometimes a little tract of cultivation appeared up some
               coomb. places so lovely, so beautiful, – they lookd as tho no taxgatherer ever visited
               them. I have longed to dwell in one of these solitary houses in a mountain vale, sheltered
               by the hills, &amp; the trees that grow finely round the house, the vale rich by the soil
               swept down from the hills a stream before the door, rolling over large stones, pure
               water, so musical too – &amp; a child might cross it. yet at wet seasons it must thunder
               down, a torrent. in such scenes there is a simpleness of sublimity fit to feed imagination.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We left <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MerthyrTidvil">Merthyr</a> this morning after a great breakfast. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MaberGeorge">Maber</a> asked us to sleep but without meaning us to accept his invitation I believe. his
               wife is a good natured woman – we drank tea &amp; suppd there on Friday, &amp; dined &amp; spent
               the evening on Saturday. the morning <span style="text-decoration: line-through">wxx</span> was better past at the inn, whence <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</a> wrote to his mother, &amp; I finished a letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#StuartDaniel">Stuart</a>. at two we reached Brecon, a distance of 18 miles. a little but clean ale house afforded
               us <span style="text-decoration: line-through">eig</span> eight pennyworth of bread cheese &amp; ale. &amp; we departed for <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Crickhowel">Crickhowel</a>, a stage of 13 more. a woman whom we met &amp; of whom we asked the distance, measured
               it by the ‘great inn’ at Bwlch on the way, &amp; we determined to halt there. before we
               got there heavy rain overtook us, &amp; we were <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> wet the lower half when we reachd the ‘great inn at Bwlch’ which is not quite so
               good as the memorable ale alehouse at Tintern. however we have seen good beds here,
               the cream was good, &amp; the tea excellent thanks to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MaberGeorge">Mabers</a> peach leaves which we put in requisition.</p>
            <p class="indent1">So we have eat, drank, dried ourselves &amp; grown comfortable. also we have had the pleasure
               of the Landlords company, who being somewhat communicative &amp; somewhat tipsy, gave
               us the history of himself &amp; family &amp; of his own &amp; his daughters complaints. hers <span style="text-decoration: line-through">was xx</span> is a sore leg. his is not.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We reach <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Crickhowel">Crickhowel</a> to breakfast tomorrow. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Lanthony">Lanthony</a> is not far from thence, but whether we reach Hereford that night, or the next day
               to dinner is uncertain. hitherto, except the trifling inconvenience of this evenings
               rain our whole journey has been fortunate &amp; pleasant. the waterfalls indeed were deficient
               in the slight article of ––––– water. all else has equalled our expectations.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I much like the appearance of the Welsh women. they have all a [MS torn]ter in their
               countenances, an intelligence which is very pleasant [MS torn] round shrewd national
               physiognomy is certainly better than that of the English peasantry &amp; we have uniformly
               met with civility. there is none of the insolence &amp; brutality which characterises
               our colliers &amp; milkwomen.</p>
            <p class="indent1">At <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MerthyrTidvil">Merthyr</a> we witnessed the very interesting custom of strewing the graves. they are fenced
               round with little white stones, &amp; the earth, in the coffin shape, planted with herbs
               &amp; flowers, &amp; strewn with flowers. two women were thus decorating a grave, the one
               a middle aged women, &amp; much affected. this affected me a good deal. the custom is
               so congenial to ones heart – it prolongs the memory of the dead, &amp; links the affections
               to them.</p>

            <p>Monday morning.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Last night was not so comfortable as last evening. our sheets were beastly dirty &amp;
               we could procure no clean ones. dirty sheets are not an endurable evil, so we pulled
               them out &amp; lay in our cloaths between the blankets. I did not easily get to sleep
               from the idea of nastiness, &amp; the howling of the wind. however this morning I woke
               refreshed &amp; rejoiced at daylight. we are now at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Crickhowel">Crickhowel</a> where we have breakfasted. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Lanthony">Lanthony</a> is twelve miles from hence. eight miles from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Lanthony">Lanthony</a> is Lanvihangle, whe[MS obscured] hope to find beds, &amp; if so, the 19 miles to Hereford
               will be easy wo[MS obscured] tomorrow. this part of Brecknockshire is most beautiful.
               the Usk rolling [MS obscured] a rich &amp; cultivated vale, &amp; mountains rising on every
               side. we feel as if [MS obscured] &amp; I get more comfortable every day now our faces
               are turned homewards.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>God bless you my dear Edith. shall I not find a letter at Hereford. the clouds fell
                  all last night, &amp; the weather now looks well. but these [MS obscured] alas how slippery!
                  farewell – &amp; now for the Black Mountain &amp; S<sup>t</sup> David.
