                  almost the most beautiful that I have seen in this Island. this treaty will in all

               weeks the least reading &amp; writing in which I have indulged has been an imprudence.
               sickness I have got rid off. but my eyes continually miserably weak. the lower lids
               are inflamed – &amp; I am obliged usually to pass my evenings in darkness. this is a heavy

               he is too vain to know that the feeling which has been rankling in him is envy, &amp;
               it is now ripening into hatred! – he is now in London waiting for a situation, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">characteristic</span> in character, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DyerGeorge">George Dyer</a>, in character also, is looking out for one for him. a tutorship here, &amp; that a very

               whenever I think of his unhappy folly, that a man should be at once so very proud
               &amp; so utterly helpless. so <span style="text-decoration: line-through">ignorant</span> proud of what he will be, &amp; so ignorant of what he is. as to his quarrel with me

                  in the merits of all my industry, there is a principle of idleness at the bottom,
                  to read &amp; to compile are occupations of no effort – they are <span style="text-decoration: line-through">things</span> &lt;works&gt; of amusement, &amp; never make the face burn or the brain throb. sometimes I think
