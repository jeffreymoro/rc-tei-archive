But its contents, including

                  </div> I expected more &amp; wishd more, because what there is is good. there is a certain swell
                  – an elevation in the flow of the blank verse, which I know not how, produces an effect
                  like the fullness of an organ-swell upon the feelings. I have felt it from the rythm

                  </div> – a pleasure wholly independant of that derived from the soul of the poetry, arising
                  from the beauty of the body only – I believe a man who did not understand a word of

                  the character drawn of Theora is I think out of place – it is not a common character.

               an apprenticeship, or involves the necessity of such multifarious knowledge. I want
               an equal reader to judge my poems, one whose knowledge &amp; taste is commensurate with
               mine, who has thought as much upon the subject – or else one who pretends not to criticise
