                           Southey wished to reserve them for his next collection, which appeared in 1799. However,
                           ‘Lord William’ was eventually included in Lewis’s Tales of Wonder, 2 vols (London,

                  as for un tres mauvais poem – I quoted the phrase of Millin, because it was his condemnation
                  for I had never read the Canons poem.

                  was prest into the service. he had served in America, &amp; was one of those men who volunteered
                  once to carry dispatches in a boat thro the French fleet. his understanding was strong

                  – but when once he had comprehended it, it was fixed for ever in his memory. I had
                  almost forgotten the <span class="ital">more</span> striking features of his life. he had seduced the woman whom he <span style="text-decoration: line-through">aft</span> afterwards married &amp; as he told <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a>, he could not bear his own reflections till he had married her. they were very happy,
