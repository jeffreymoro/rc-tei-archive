            <p>Address: To/ C W W Wynn Esq<sup>r</sup> M. P./ Wynnstay/ Wrexham<br>Stamped: KESWICK/ 298<br>MS: National Library of Wales, MS 4819E<br>Unpublished.<br>Dating note: The earliest this letter could have been written was when Southey heard
               of James Mackintosh’s knighthood, which was announced on 21 December 1803; Southey
               sent a section of the next book of <em>Madoc</em> to Tom Southey on 17 February 1804 and had completed revisions to the first part
               of the poem by this date, so this letter is unlikely to have been sent after mid-February
               1804.</p>

               <div class="l">There had his quiver moulderd, his stone axe</div>

               <div class="l">Grow wild, she could have given to guests like us</div>
               <div class="l">A worthier welcome. Soon a man approachd</div>
