               that suits me – &amp; I have not to pay for it. nothing like a thorough reformation! radical
               improvements! the waters are abating &amp; the country losing its dreariness &amp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> sublimity. the night of our arrival it was magnificent. I stood on the bridge – you
               have heard me describe it. the water washes the walls of a small but striking ruin.
               above stands the keep, with a huge rift in the side thro which the sky is seen. behind,
               the church, one of the finest in the Kingdom. to the right &amp; left the flats were inundated.
               the night was wild, the moon rolling among driven clouds, &amp; the rush of the flood
               now mingled with the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> roar of the wind, &amp; now was heard in its pauses. every object was distinct &amp; solemn

                  to a common &amp; cursory eye – but having in its vicinity much variety of scenery. the
