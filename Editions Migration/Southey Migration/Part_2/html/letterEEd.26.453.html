                  from my head to the very termination of the rectum, sore all the way. a bowel-complaint
                  has in three days reduced me to almost a palsied debility – &amp; this is not the worst
                  – for I had before &amp; still have certain achings, physical ones – at the heart, that
                  puzzle me to account for them. a settled dull obtuse aching just enough to attract
                  continual attention – &amp; show that all is not as it should be. If this continues I
