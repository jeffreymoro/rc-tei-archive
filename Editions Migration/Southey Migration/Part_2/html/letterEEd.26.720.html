               <p>You will have received a letter from Pyle. this goes from Swansea, Tuesday evening

               graves whitelimed too. You know the graves are all planted with flowers. the country
               has disappointed me in most places – but about Neath it is remarkably fine &amp; the house
               of which we are in hopes is in the richest part in a vale among mountains. If it turn

               from medical assistance. Gronow answered he rode there in half an hour. I believe
               him by his looks to be a man whose talents might be trusted, &amp; am sure we should often
               see him. Of course I shall conclude nothing till I see you &amp; know your opinion. but
               this seems a very promising place. the climate excellent – &amp; regular vessels to Bristol
