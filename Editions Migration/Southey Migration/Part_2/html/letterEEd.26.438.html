            <p class="indent1">Since last I wrote I have seen something of South Devon. a country which has been
               so over-praised as compleatly to disappoint me. some particular spots were striking,
               but the character of the whole is bald – high hills, with hedges &amp; no trees, &amp; broad
               views that contained no object on which the eye could fix. I remember with most pleasure
               a little vale amid high hills of which one was well wooded, many streams intersected
               it, &amp; all over the green vale were fine old ash trees, as if a grove had been rooted
               up &amp; these left standing. the ash is our most <span class="ital">beautiful</span> tree, not our <span class="ital">finest</span>, but in a quiet secluded scene our most appropriate – the leaves are so transparently
               green, &amp; hang with so feathery a lightness, &amp; the bark is more strongly coloured than
               that of any other tree. there was a mill in this vale, quite a comfortable dwelling,
               a saw-pit by – just enough of man to enliven the scene – not to spoil it. it pleased
               me mightily.</p>
