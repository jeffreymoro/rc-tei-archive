            <p class="indent1">The <span class="ital">estrado</span> is not exactly the <span class="ital">dais</span>, tho had I recollected that word it would have been better than the original. the
               dais is the raised part of great halls – the <span class="ital">estrado</span> was in every room, &amp; is often used <span class="ital">plurally</span>. I cannot tell what it was. In Portugal it is still not the common custom to use
               chairs. the female peasantry &amp; servants usually squat down like the Moors, very sensibly,
               for in houses that have no fire places, &amp; doors &amp; windows that never shut close the
               petticoats thus keep the feet warm. there are round mats sold for them to squat upon;
               they puzzled me for some time, seeing them in the shops. In that part of Portugal
               which was last Moorish, the beds are laid upon a square platform about half a foot
               high – this is perhaps something like the old <span class="ital">estrado</span>. once &amp; once only I saw it reach across a room like a <span class="ital">dais</span>. some such platform in days of dirt, when the floors were strewn with rushes, was
               probably placed for the gentle Dames &amp; Damsels to squat upon. you will allow it to
               have been very necessary at one period when Kts, Lords, &amp; Kings lived in such hourly
               dangers that they kept their horses ready saddled in their bed chambers.</p>

                  suspicion is a part of his character which does not appear in the first book, but

                  indeed, unawares – as the door is to do upon the bed chamber that is fit for a Bishop.

                  of words in the narration peculiar to England &amp; to the summer season of English genius.
                  but the character of Amadis is naked narration – the plain fact plainly told with
                  little variety of phrase.
