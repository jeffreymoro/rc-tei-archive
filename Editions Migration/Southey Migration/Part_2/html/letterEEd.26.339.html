            <p class="indent1">The subject on which I am about to write will I hope excuse me in thus addressing
               a stranger. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GilbertWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> William Gilbert</a> is now in Liverpool, from whence he intends to work his passage to Africa. he is
               a man of much information &amp; much genius, but afflicted with that worst calamity, mental
               derangement; &amp; should he leave England without money, &amp; on the wild idea of being
               divinely called to Africa, the fatigues of such a voyage &amp; the situation he would
               be in at its close would probably be fatal to him. What Sir I have taken the liberty
               to request of you is, that you would inform the Captain of any African vessel about
               to sail that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GilbertWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Gilbert</a> is deranged, that they might refuse to take him. this will give his friends time
               to consider &amp; act. if also <span style="text-decoration: line-through">if</span> &lt;by&gt; any accident you should meet with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GilbertWilliam">Gilbert</a>, I beg no notice may be taken of any interference on the part of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">me &amp;</span> his Bristol acquaintance.</p>
