            <p class="indent1">It is not without a serious self shame that I reflect upon my silence to you. daily
               intentions – daily procrastination – &amp; much to do &amp; more time dissipated make but
               poor excuses – nor were it better alledge how many of my friends have the same cause
               of complaint. From <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</a> you know the contents of my letters to him. Since their date I know nothing more
               of my own destination, nor indeed do I soon expect it. some situation I look to in
               Italy, of salary equal to the expenditure of an unexpensive man, &amp; of business sufficiently
               easy to allow leisure for literary amusement, from which I hope to afford the superfluities.
               you will not of course talk of these things to any one but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</a>. a Southern residence I feel too necessary to my enjoyment of life, &amp; happily it
               suits my inclination as well as my health. that it removes me from my friends is a
               less evil to me than it would be to those who have known more family comforts. settle
               where I would, letter-intercourse would be my only means of communicating with most
               of my friends – &amp; it matters little whether that be done by a ship or a mail coach.
               Immediate <span class="ital">ease</span> of circumstances is promised by this plan – possible affluence.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I write from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</a>, where I arrived on Wednesday last. probably <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> will come here to see the Lakes, &amp; in that case I shall get into his gig &amp; return
               with him, for the purpose of visiting Wales, &amp; travelling Madocs road. Whether we
               winter here or not time must determine. inclination would induce me to<span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> but it is as cold as at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</a>, &amp; I am now growling at clouds &amp; Cumberland weather. the Lakes at first disappointed
               me. they were diminutive to what I had expected. the mountains little compared to
               Monchique – &amp; for beauty – all English – perhaps all existing scenery must yield to

               <p>Of Lisbon politics I am uncomfortably ignorant. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> writes me that the English must probably soon leave Portugal. So it appears to me,
                  not from any ill will originating in the court of Lisbon, or even in Spanish influence,
                  but from the foolish &amp; plundering spirit of our own politics. We may take possession
                  of Madeira in trust

               justified, &amp; with an earnestness which only long affection would have produced. he
               has not replied, &amp; what I have seen in his letters to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</a> was only such as equally vexed &amp; provoked me. he writes as a man of neglected merit,
               offended with the world for overlooking talents – which he has never given the world
               an opportunity of estimating. meantime he has no employment – &amp; thi[MS missing] for
