               <div class="salute">My dear friend</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I should have acknowledged the receipt of the bill yesterday had there been any post
               to London. there was no inconvenience whatever in our not receiving it sooner.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In about ten days our future habitation will be made habitable. the former tenant
               has quitted – &amp; the carpenter &amp; the mason &amp; the whitewashes &amp; the painter are busy
               in repairing the dilapidations of many years. two beggarly cottages will soon be revolutionized
               into a decent dwelling. these necessary alterations are not at our expences – the
               little improvement which savour of luxury we set about ourselves as soon as we get
               in, such as papering &amp; filling up an ugly corner with a convenient cupboard. the house
               will be small, but large enough to be comfortable &amp; to have a spare bed room, a sine
               qua non with me. the garden is a large piece of ground, &amp; quite empty, so that I may
               please myself in filling it, &amp; have already in my head allotted out its various divisions
               of potatoes, peas, cabbages, artichokes, currant &amp; gooseberry bushes, &amp; the near turf
               plat where a few larger fruit trees may be ornamentally planted – planting is a trifling
               expence, &amp; I shall at least have the pleasure of seeing the trees grow – tho perhaps
               the changes of life may prevent me from enjoying any other advantage. a spring rises
               close by the garden &amp; fills a fishpond at the bottom. I mean to take much of my due
               exercise in the useful employment of gardening, which will be putting out time upon
               good interest.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I mentioned to you if I recollect aright some time ago, that we were uneasy respecting
               a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerGeorge">brother of Edith</a>, who went to sea &amp; had not been heard of. after being driven by storms into Spain
               &amp; walking thro that country into Portugal he is returned. the boy is about fifteen,
               &amp; has been much neglected, but he is a good boy, &amp; thoroughly sick of the sea life
               <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> which I believe he originally adopted rather from want of any better employ than
               from inclination. As soon as we are settled I mean to send for him, &amp; do what I can
               in the way of informing him, by setting about this properly I can save time which
               is the most important thing. my after views are to make a printer of him. because
               it is a business which he may exercise without a long apprenticeship – &lt;which&gt; requires
               perhaps a smaller capital than any other, &amp; because whenever he shall be able to exercise
               it I can at once put into his hands three fourths of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">that</span> employment necessary for his support.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have made some progress in my metrical Romance, Thalaba the Destroyer. a poem from
                  which I expect credit &amp; emolument. it will give me pleasure to read it to you when
                  you visit <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Burton">Burton</a>. the extent will be ten books, of which the fourth is nearly finished. it will probably
                  be ready for publication in the spring. The second Anthology

                  </div> soon goes to press – this is a work which chiefly interests me as it is connected
                  with many friends – a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">sort of</span> memorial of those who are distant. These then are my employments, I wish I could give
                  you as good an account of my health – but that certainly does not improve.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My opinions upon all important subjects have long since ceased to fluctuate. I repose
                  upon Christianity, aware of the arguments against it, &amp; flinging like JJ Rousseau,
                  the weight of hope into the scale of reason.

                  </div> there is a preponderance of argument in its favour certainly, yet I perceive my own
                  belief more the effect of volition than conviction; my reason might possibly be biased
                  from it, but my affections could not. it is adapted to my wants &amp; to my wishes, it
                  is a matter of feeling with me. – is not this faith in its true meaning? – the mysteries
                  attached to the orthodox creed shock my reason &amp; disgust me. to define the Deity,
                  is to increase Atheism. the Athanasian &amp; Nicene creeds
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> make me imagine Atheism comparitively wise &amp; pious – but I walk abroad &amp; see the Deity
                  in all things – I close my eyes &amp; I feel his presence. surely this is faith.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">So far you will readily comprehend me – but you will not perhaps understand how my
               political opinions are founded upon feelings precisely the same. I examine the extremes
               of society &amp; know that they are not fitted to the nature of man – that both extremes
               necessarily deprave him. I am &lt;too&gt; metaphysical <span style="text-decoration: line-through">enough</span> &lt;not&gt; to know that our characters are for the most part the effect of surrounding
               circumstances, &amp; I am too pious to believe that God can have made us naturally sinful,
               therefore necessarily wretched. hence the love of equality which is rooted in my heart
               &amp; blended with all <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx xx</span> my associations. I see evil produced by existing establishments &amp; know that it might
               be better &amp; am with all the ardour &amp; sincerity of my soul a Republican. On all points
               that <span style="text-decoration: line-through">may</span> can come into action there is little difference between us. with most of my friends
               I agree in some essential point, scarcely with any in all.</p>
