            <p>[Southey inserts a floor-plan of his residence in Lisbon]</p>
            <p>This Tom is the plan of our house, the ground floor which belongs wholly to the servants,
               is exactly the same, &amp; this is the plan of Portugueze building. 1 &amp; 5 are the bed
               rooms – for seperate beds are necessary in this climate. by removing the folding doors
               2 &amp; 3 are made into one room, in length 18 of <span class="ital">my</span> feet, in breadth 6½ only. In the great room we dine &amp; receive company. the house
               was built for two families &amp; there is a kitchen on each floor. 1 was designed to serve
               that purpose &amp; the fire place is marked in it. but it is a Portugueze fire&lt;place&gt;
               the hearth stone, 3 feet from the ground, so that the cook may stand at his work –
               for they know not the use of grates: an earthern pan furnishes a Portugueze kitchen.
               in this they stew every thing, or fry it in oil. Now for the ornamental part. our
               great room has four doors, two windows &amp; two balconies. the walls are simply white
               limed. do not however suspect us of too plain an appearance. around the top &amp; the
               middle of the walls runs a broad board painted like marble veined with blue. Each
               door<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> has a pilaster &lt;wood&gt; framing of green veined marble, with the base streaked red.
               purple marbled tiles go round the bottom. the cieling<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> is a floor of wood, painted white &amp; edged with flesh colour. the windowshutters &amp;
               balcony doors are green. the other doors have yellow pannels in mahogany coloured
               frames. &lt;the window frames mahogany coloured&gt; our carpet is a zigzag [Southey inserts
               sketch of the pattern] thunder &amp; lightning pattern of all the rainbow colours. the
               balconies have also glass doors. the huge stone which forms the standing place is
               rough as the paving by Northumberland house in the Strand, &amp; enters some foot into
               the room, a notch is cut across it &amp; a hole made thro, so that this serves as a sink
               to carry away what rain enters. The locks &amp; latches are coarse beyond your conception.
               under every window frame &lt;&amp; round it&gt; is a stone three inches broad, its surface rough
               from the stone cutters chissel. the window frames are fastened with screws broader
               than a halfcrown on their leads. the glass in every window is floored with bricks.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The garret is one room over all so propped up with crooked sticks that it would be
               difficult to lay a bed either length-breadth or athwart-ways. this propping is a fine
               specimen of Portuguese building. the ends of the poles are let into rude holes cut
               in the floor – &amp; some that were not long enough for this, nor smooth enough to rest
               upon the ground, have another uncouth stick stuck under them – as we steady a table
               in England on an uneven floor. there are pigeon holes to admit light &amp; air like a
               church <span style="text-decoration: line-through">tower</span> &lt;tower&gt; – windows no bigger than church-pigeon holes – &amp; three large windows thus
               [Southey inserts illustration] so contrived that if you open the shutters of the middle
               one, one of the sides must remain shut, &amp; if you open the sides you fasten the middle.
               The roofing is like all other houses here – the tiles are shaped thus [Southey inserts
               U shaped sketch], they therefore lay on one row in that direction [Southey inserts
               illustration] – &amp; then lest the rain should enter, cover it with a row reversed, [Southey
               inserts illustration]. thus doubly loading the roof.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The bedsteads instead of sacking have planks – a better thing as it does not harbour
               vermin. the woods here are exceedingly beautiful, they come from Brazil &amp; are many
               of them handsomer than mahogany. &lt;sets of specimens are often sold made like little
               books, &amp; lettered each with its name.&gt; The Portugueze perfume their houses by burning
               sugar or lavender – <span style="text-decoration: line-through">you frxx</span> a whiff of this incense often surprizes me in the middle of a stink as I walk the
               streets.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The English when strangers here are so suspicious of the natives as to be very rash
               in misinterpreting them. A young man whom I knew, fired at the watch one night, when
               they accosted him. the ball passed thro the watchmans hat. he was seized &amp; confined,
               &amp; it required interest &amp; money to excuse him, for what was inexcusable. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</a> walking one night with a midshipman was stopt by persons bearing a young man who
               had been run thro the body by a Lieutenant. they had stopt him seeing his companions
               uniform, but knowing <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> suffered him to pass, after telling the circumstance. The Lieutenant was drunk. the
               young man was a gentleman who seeing him staggering about the streets, took him by
               the arm to lead him home. the Englishman did not understand what he said, &amp; run him
               thro.</p>
            <p class="indent1">As yet we have not <span style="text-decoration: line-through">done</span> received all our visits of ceremony. we are going the first night we are at liberty,
               to the Portugueze play. The court have shown a strange caprice about the opera. they
               permitted them to have a few female singers, &amp; the proprietors of the opera sent to
               Italy for more &amp; better ones. they came – no! they would not license any more – the
               present <span style="text-decoration: line-through">people</span> women might act – but not the new comers. you must not expect me to give you any
               reason for this inconsistency – tis the sheer whim of authority. but an odd reason
               was assigned for permitting two who still act. one – because she is very religious.
               The other <span style="text-decoration: line-through">We x xx</span> because she is Portugueze &amp; of a certain age.</p>

                  sight from our window, the town all starred – &amp; the moving lights of the shipping.
                  at ten a second discharge gave notice that we might put out our candles. But the river
                  seen by moonlight from hence is a far finer spectacle than art can make. it lies like
                  a plain of light under the heaven – the trees &amp; houses, now forming a dark &amp; distinct
                  foreground, &amp; now undistinguishable in shades, as the moon moves on her way &lt;Almada
                  stretching its black isthmus into the waters, that shine like midnight snow.&gt;. we
                  [MS torn] enough when it blows, to see the rush of foam behind the boats. – A magnificent
                  equipage passed our window on Monday. it was a nobleman, either going to be married,
                  or to court. [MS obscured] carriage was drawn by four horses, each covered with a
                  white netting &amp; crested with white plumes. they were very restive – indeed but half
                  broke in. I had seen them breaking them in before, &amp; on these occasions they always
                  fill the carriage with servants to make it heavy – so that their necks also run a
                  chance of being broken in. it was like the pomp of romance. – They bury in covered
                  buildings that adjoin the church. the graves are built in divisions – like a tanners
                  pits. you may perhaps remember such at Bristol, at S<sup>t</sup> Pauls,

                  consumed. still the bones accumulate, &amp; occasionally these places are cleaned out.
                  burying is every where miserably managed. that superstition should once induce the
                  desire to be interred in consecrated ground was natural. the Church being Gods fort,
                  the Devil would not come immediately under its <span class="ital">bell</span>-guns, the sound of a church bell being more formidable to Beelzebub than cannon-balls
                  to sailors. but now, when that folly is extinct, that the dead should all be huddled

                  a singular mode of fishing at Costa, a sort of wigwam village in the sands south of
                  the bar. the gang of fishermen to each net is about fifty all paid &amp; fed by the Captain
                  regularly, not according to their success. half hold one end of a rope – the other

                  boat, themselves breast deep &amp; stooping under every wave that meets them. the others
                  row round to shore, &amp; then they all haul in. – this place is about nine miles only
                  from Lisbon, yet criminals run away there &amp; are safe. sometimes a Magistrate goes
                  down, but they always know that he is coming &amp; away to the woods for the day. it is
                  common to go there from town &amp; dine upon the sands. the people are civil &amp; inoffensive,
                  indeed generally so over Portugal except among the boatmen, who have enough intercourse
                  with foreigners to catch all their vices.</p>
