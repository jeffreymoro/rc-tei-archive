                  – still less to an Irish boy of sixteen, who has been found too unmanageable to be

                  is always unpleasant, &amp; would now be impossible for a reason which you are not yet

                  – a small garden – near a market &amp; yet not in a town – &amp; not so near a great road
                  as to be annoyed by its dust. These are easily found at a greater distance from London,
                  &amp; with a difference of expence that has half staggered me – but the advantages of

                  him. her immediate agitation was very visible. she wrote to her friends to get her
                  out – I believe by the regular way of dispensation. this letter was intercepted. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">her</span> &amp; an account of her death spread. She had contrived to get down a flight of steps

                  sate with her very late seeing how dispirited she was – so late that the lamp went
                  out in the cloisters &amp; she lay down on a stone bench lest by mistake she should enter
                  a wrong cell in the dark. she went back at day light to tell her friend how she had
                  past the night &amp; found her with her throat cut. At that sight she dropt &amp; was found
                  in a fit in the door way by those who came to bring their prisoner food. this is the
                  story – <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the manner by which</span> &lt;how&gt; Jane Power got at her I do not understand. It should be remembered that there
                  is no reason to suspect this as the invention &amp; calumny of a renegade. Jane Power
                  continues a Catholic – &amp; her friends are procuring her a dispensation from Rome to
