            <p class="indent1">I thought I recognized your seal – &amp; it gave me very great pleasure to find myself
               not forgotten by persons who I often recollect with pleasure &amp; gratitude. Six years
               have elapsed since I left school, &amp; since last I saw you. All my views in life &amp; many
               of my opinions have been changed more than once during that period; the result is
               – that at twenty four I am married, without a want, almost without a wish unsatisfied.
               Time &amp; Experience have done me much good, &amp; somewhat tamed me: imagine me taller &amp;
               still thinner than in 1792, &amp; with even spirits which nothing either elevates or depresses,
               &amp; you will have most of the alterations that the interval has produced.</p>

               has obliged us to quit London for the present, &amp; thus interrupted my professional
               pursuits. I have been alarmed by her indisposition, but she is now better, &amp; indeed
               my prospects are in every direction brightening. I have had some difficulties, but
               they are over. necessity joined with inclination to make me an author, &amp; now only
               the pleasant motive remains. I acquired some money &amp; more reputation. the one soon
               went, but it supported me when I had no other support. the other I trust will not
               be lost. I have many plans &amp; great ones to execute should it please God to allow me
