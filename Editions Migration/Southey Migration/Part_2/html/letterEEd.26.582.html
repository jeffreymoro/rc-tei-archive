               <p>A letter of mine, chiefly relating to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a>, must assuredly have been lost. it matters little. at this distance, all I could

                  </div> To <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a> I wrote some five or six weeks ago – recommending an unbiased choice – rather wishing
                  him to follow his <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">Uncles</a> plan, than <span style="text-decoration: line-through">recom</span> advising it. of his private allowance – I could only promise him five pounds quarterly
                  – a sum which if good fortune enabled me I should willingly double, but which you
                  must be aware – knowing the extent of my resources – to be the utmost that I can spare
                  from my own wants &amp; the demands upon me from other quarters. some little – a possible
                  ten pounds – may be yearly hoped from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a>, who is ready to do all he can. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> will I know supply any deficiency. yet I think in calculating from 30 to 40 pounds
                  yearly as necessary, circumstances have not been sufficiently considered. my own personal
                  expences have never reached even to the smaller sum. I do not expend 15 pounds yearly
                  in &lt;the whole of my&gt; <span class="ital">dress</span>. with all linen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a> would be supplied from home. it is however always better to allow a young man too
                  much than too little. I have felt the latter evil myself. – The great expence of returning
                  will sink me for some time below the world. hitherto my resources have always been
                  kept equal with my expenditure, by obscure &amp; unintermitted labour. from those means
                  a residence here has inevitably cut me off. my expences also have been increased by
                  travelling. I could indeed make my journeys more than pay the&lt;ir&gt; own cost did I deem
                  it advisable to publish the materials which I have collected for a miscellaneous volume
                  relative to this country. from 60 to 80 pounds would doubtless be paid me for a first
                  edition – but from the time it would deduct from the greater work I should think it
                  a bad speculation in a pecuniary point of view – &amp; in that point I must consider it.
                  I have therefore no literary pay to expect, (except from the success of Thalaba) till
                  a first volume of my History
