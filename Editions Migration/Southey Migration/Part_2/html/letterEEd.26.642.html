            <p class="indent1">I have delayed writing some time in the hope of recovering your last letter. its loss
               cannot be attributed to misdirection. a large packet from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> has never reached me. by the same post he wrote under cover to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</a> inclosing a forty pounds bill – else that also had gone. – If <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KingJohn">King</a> will house the boxes I shall be greatly obliged to him – it vexes &amp; hurts me that

               lessening of my little leisure. tho she certainly is not consumptive, the decay is
               so total that I hardly can hope her recovery. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is miserably &amp; vexatiously depressed in spirits. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</a> are very good – uncommonly good. she suffers no pain, &amp; is even chearful. only at
               times she regrets having left Bristol – because she should have liked to have been
               buried with my father. yet if the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxx</span> &lt;winter&gt; should not relapse to its severity we may yet make her weather it out <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx xxx xxx</span> – &amp; in the summer take out a new lease. there is no dangerous disease about her –
