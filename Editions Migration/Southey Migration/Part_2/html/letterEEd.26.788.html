               <p>Why Tom you must be mad – stark, staring mad – jumping mad – horn mad – to be lying
                  in port all this time. for plain or stark madness I should prescribe a simple strait
                  waistcoat. staring madness may be alleviated by the use of green spectacles. for jumping
                  madness I have found a remedy in a custom used by the Siamese when they take prisoners
                  – they burn their feet to prevent them from running away.
