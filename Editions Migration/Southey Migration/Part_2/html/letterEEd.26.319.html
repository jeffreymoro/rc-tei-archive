            <p class="indent1">Well Grosvenor – &amp; how is it? am I to congratulate or to console? there is fortunately
               so much to be said on either alternative, that were a man to write a declamation he
               might toss up to determine on which side he should declaim. however Grosvenor God
               prosper you in this &amp; every other wish of your heart. </p>
