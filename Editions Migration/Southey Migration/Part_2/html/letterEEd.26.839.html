               broken – I myself am ashamed that so common a calamity should have wounded me so deeply.
               However like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George the Second</a> I shall be compelled to work – to drudge at Reviewing &amp; to manufacture rhymes for
               the Morning Post, God knows with how little heart, for the thoughts which are uppermost
               shall have no vent. I shall take this task work like physic, with this happy difference,
               that in the account I shall be on the creditor side the bill.</p>
