            <p>this said personage I have not yet seen, whereby I was kept in a state of purportless
               idleness. he is gone to his own country, playing truant from business among his friends.
               tomorrow his return is probable. I like his character he does business well &amp; with
               method, but loves his amusement better than business &amp; prefers books to official papers.
               It does not appear that my work will be anyways difficult copying &amp; letter writing
               which any body could do, if any body could be confidentially trusted. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">John Rickman</a> is a great man in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</a> &amp; in the eyes of the world, but not one jot altered from the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">John Rickman</a> of Christ Church, save only that in compliance with an extorted promise he has deprived
               himself of the pleasure of [MS illegible] his head by putting powder on it. he has
               astonished the people about him – the government stationer hinted to him when he was
               giving an order, that if he wanted any thing in the pocket book way – he might as
               well put it down in the order. But he pulled his own – look Sir – I have bought one
               for two shillings. his predecessor admonished him not to let himself down by speaking
               to any of the clerks – why Sir – said <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">John Rickman</a> – I should not let myself down if I spoke to every man between this &amp; the bridge
               – &amp; so he goes on in his own right way. he has been obliged to mount up to the third
               story, before he could find a room small enough to sleep in – &amp; there he led me to
               show me his government bed, which because it is a government bed contains stuff enough
               to make a dozen – the curtains being compleatly double &amp; mattress piled upon mattress,
               so that tumbling out would be a dangerous fall. – About our quarters here when we
               remove hither in June, he will look out. the filth of the houses is intolerable –
               floors &amp; furniture offending you with Portugueze nastiness. but it is a very fine
               city – a magnificent city – such public buildings &amp; the streets so wide. for these
               advantages <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</a> is indebted to the prodigal corruption of its own government. every member who asked
               money to make improvements got it – &amp; if he got 20,000 pounds – in decency spent 5
               for the public, &amp; pocketed the rest. these gentlemen are now being hauled a little
               over the coals, &amp; they have grace enough to thank God the Union did not take place
               sooner.</p>

                  their love of “fun” eternally engages them in mischievous combinations, which are
                  eternally baffled by their own blessed instinct of blundering. the United Irishmen
