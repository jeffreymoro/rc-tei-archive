                  </div> printed at Strasburg in 1791, I find some curious remarks on the ecclesiastical discipline
                  of Spain, and on the authority of the Inquisition, which I flatter myself will not
                  be unacceptable to your readers.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">“One day,” says the duke, “the Archbishop of Toledo took me aside, and with the most
               lively emotions, said to me: for Heaven’s sake, Sir, let your bishops in France beware
               of the following the example of their brethren here in Spain. For, by little and little,
               Rome has brought us under her yoke, and reduced us to mere cyphers in our own dioceses.
               Mere priests of the inquisition are become our teachers and our masters, and are in
               possession of our authority; and we are daily indebted to our very servants for the
               information, that a decree on doctrinal points is affixed to the doors of our cathedrals,
               of which we had no previous knowledge, but to which we must submit without reply.
               The correction of vice and the regulation of the manners of the people belongs also
               to the inquisition. In the concerns of the bishop’s court, whoever pleases may disregard
               the proper officers and go to the tribunal of the nuncio, where, if dissatisfied with
               his officers too, he has only to appeal from their decision to that of the nuncio.
               So that, deprived as we are of all authority, we have only the powers of ordination
               and of confirmation left us: in truth, we are no longer the bishops of our own dioceses.
               The pope is the immediate bishop of every diocese here, and we are no more than his
               vicars, consecrated indeed, and mitred, but for the sole purpose ordaining priests,
               and of performing a few other manual operations, without daring to intermeddle with,
               otherwise than by blindly submitting to, the inquisition, the nunciature, and whatever
               is sent us from Rome: and should a bishop happen to displease them in the smallest
               tittle, he is instantly punished, without being allowed to offer any thing in his
               own defence; because nothing less than the submission of deaf and dumb animals is
               expected from him. It seldom indeed happens now, that any one is sent to the prison
               of the inquisition, or to Rome, bound and gagged, because these instances, in past
               times, have been too frequent, and because they wish to run no risk; yet we are not
               entirely without such punishments, and these very recent.</p>
            <p class="indent1">“Judge then, Sir, what weight and authority the constitution can derive from the acceptance
               of bishops thus enslaved, as we in Italy, Portugal, and Spain are; and from the universities,
               the doctors, and the secular, regular, and monastic bodies of the clergy in the same
               countries. But this is not all. Do you imagine that a single individual among us would
               have accepted the bull, if the pope had not, by his nuncio, commanded it? Our very
               acceptance of it would itself have been a crime, which would not long have remained
               unpunished. It would have been deemed an encroachment on the infallibility of the
               holy father; for to dare to accept what he decides, is to judge that he has decided
               aright. Now who are we to add our judgment to that of the Pope? When he has spoken,
               silence and blind obedience are our portion: we must bow down in perfect adoration
               to what he has said, and surrender, as I may say, into his hands, our will, memory,
               and understanding. So that far from daring to contradict, move any amendment, or ask
               for any explication, we are not allowed to approve, accept, or do any thing, that
               bespeaks an active part in what he decrees.</p>
            <p class="indent1">“Such, Sir, is the nature of the acceptance given by Spain, by Portugal, and by Italy,
               and which I find, is so much extolled in France, and held out as the free judgment
               and approbation of all the churches and schools! But, in truth, they are no better
               than slaves, whose matter has condescended to open his lips, and has prescribed the
               form of words that they are to pronounce, and which, without the change of a letter,
               or an iota, they have servilely pronounced. This is the pretended judgment, that is
               so much talked of in France, and which we have given indeed unanimously, because the
               same form was prescribed to us all!</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>“At this view of the calamitous situation of the church, the archbishop could no longer
                  contain himself, but melted into tears. He intreated me, for obvious reasons, not
                  to mention to any one what he had said. Accordingly I kept the secret inviolably as
                  long as he lived, but as he is now no more, I think myself equally bound to reveal
                  it to the world.”

               <p>The inquisition, Mr. Editor, which generally narrows and debases the mind of those
                  who live within the sphere of its activity, had little or no effect, it seems, on
                  this sensible primate of Spain, whoever he was – for I am not sufficiently conversant
                  in the history of Roman Catholics to know his name, nor of what constitution and bull
                  he speaks, unless of that which is called <em>Unigenitus</em>, which, as history tells us, convulsed all France and Flanders in the beginning of
                  the present century

                  </div> – yet, as his language appears to be so very unusual in the mouths of bishops of the
                  Romish communion, I shall be glad to learn, from some of your correspondents, what
                  degree of credit is due to Louis de Saint-Simon, and to the archbishop. Permit me
                  also to ask, whether the inquisition ever found its way into England before the Reformation;
                  or whether any such tribunal now exists among the Roman Catholics of this kingdom.
                  I hope, for the credit of Englishmen, they are under no such baneful influence. Yet
                  as they acknowledge the Bishop of Rome to be the head of their church, they cannot
                  but be influenced, in some degree, by him. What then has hitherto been the nature
                  of this influence? and, what change is it likely to undergo from the present state
                  of affairs at Rome?
