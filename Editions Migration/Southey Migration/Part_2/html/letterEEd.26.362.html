            <p class="indent1">I was very glad to see your hand writing again. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> did not rightly, it appears, understand my leaving Bristol; it was merely to keep
               a term, that is to eat three indifferent dinners in bad company.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I know not how to say any thing about settling <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a> under <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</a>, except by stating to you how I am circumstanced respecting him. it is not easy to
               take care of a ready-made family without a ready-made fortune, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> is no ways connected with me except by friendship, he knew that it would greatly
               embarrass me to support <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a>, &amp; offered to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">dis xxx</span> discharge his school bills. his intent was to place him under his own tutor, a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeGeorge">brother of Coleridge</a>; but the school was full, &amp; Henrys age would otherwise have been an objection. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> then requested me to look out any school or situation which I thought proper. Under
               these circumstances you will see the impropriety of my placing him at all expensively,
               &amp; were <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</a> to lower his terms to the thermometer of my feelings, that would be burthening me
               with another obligation. I cannot educate him myself, I have no time, my family is
               already quite as large as my means, &amp; the utter retirement in which we live would
               be unfavourable for an age when he ought to be forming friendships. I should like
               him to be with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</a> because he himself wishes it, &amp; because there would be less danger of his contracting
               any vices there than in a large &amp; promiscuous school, &amp; this is what is most to be
               feared. the danger you mention I fear he would be likely to incur in most situations.
               what do you think the lowest sum which it would not be improper to propose to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</a>?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have been much indisposed &amp; my recovery I am afraid will be slow. my heart is affected,
                  &amp; this at first alarmed me because I could not understand it. however I am scientifically
                  satisfied that it is only a nervous affection. sedentary habits have injured my health, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> this prescription of exercise prevents me from proceeding with the works that interest
                  me, &amp; only allows time for the task labour which is neither pleasant to look on to
                  or to remember. my leisure is quite destroyed. had it not been for this I should ere
                  now have sent you the remainder of my Eclogues, it is now almost too late for the

               <div class="l">Tis an idle sort of task, so he built up</div>
