               <p>I write at a five minutes’ notice. The unforeseen and unlucky departure of my only

                  how I hunger and thirst for Bristol news. I long to be among you. If I could bring
                  this climate to Bristol, it would make me a new being: but I am in utter solitude
                  of all rational society; in a state of mental famine, save that I feed on rocks and
                  woods, and the richest banquet nature can possibly offer to her worshippers. God bless

            <p><span class="">P. S.</span>– * * * The zeal of the Methodists and their itinerant preachers, has reprieved for
               half a century the system; but you must be aware, that sooner or later, the Church
               of England will absorb all those sects that differ only in discipline. The comfortable
               latitude that takes in the Calvinist and the Arminian, must triumph. The Catholic
               system will perhaps, last the longest; and bids fair to continue as a political establishment,
               when all its professors shall laugh at its absurdity. Destroy its monastic orders,
               and marry the priests, and the rest is a pretty puppet-show, with the idols, and the
               incense, and the polytheism, and the pomp of paganism. God bless you.</p>
