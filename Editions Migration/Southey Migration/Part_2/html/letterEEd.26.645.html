               were well enough to need it! – for this last fortnight we have been retarding the
               progress of a diarrhœa by opium. still it continues – she has been at time delirious
               – she is <span class="ital">more drowsy</span> than only the opium would make her – her appetite wholly gone. there exists but a
               possibility of her recovery. happily there is no pain whatever.</p>
