                  </div> I should much like to insert. for the most part it is very good – but some of the
                  epigrams are obtuse – or else my comprehension is. As far as 29 all is fair satire
                  &amp; well executed. 33 I do not like. the bull contained in these lines &amp; the flat conclusion
                  do not characterize the poem – which inaccurate as it is in thought, is the work of
                  no ordinary talents. 38. I do not well understand – unless it mean that you like &amp;
                  yet dislike the lines. 54 is a misrepresentation. it was the Acolhuan who would not
                  fight. 67 is an excellent analysis of an inane poem. 69 would be better if only its
                  conclusion were preserved. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">77. I know not</span>. Selene is too long. I wonder at your praise of the Song of Pleasure. the latter
                  Stanzas of the Sons of Genius from Thus the pale moon – to scorn the lunar ray – appear
                  to me worth a myriad of such poems. it has luxury of language – but nought else. I
                  have burnt piles of such poetry. 102. merely an argument of the poem – no epigram.

                  is not a place to fix at – I am recommended by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a> to Vicenza or Padua – if that part of Italy be safe – to Vicenza for its exquisite
                  beauties of situation – to Padua for its society. Tuscany is perhaps safer. somewhere
