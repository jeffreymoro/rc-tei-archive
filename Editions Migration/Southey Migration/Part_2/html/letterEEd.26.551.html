               evidence in the previous letter to Tom Southey, 7 October 1800 (Letter 550), and the
               endorsement ‘8<sup>th</sup>’ suggests that this second letter was not finished and sent until ‘Nov. 6’, the date
               given at the end. The editors have therefore placed it after his letter to Tom Southey
               of 7 October 1800.</p>

                           542–543, told how the Franciscans had been deprived of Mafra by Sebastiao Jose de
                           Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal (1699–1782; Prime Minister of Portugal 1750–1777).
                           Their loss was shortlived. As Southey explained: ‘When the Prince of Brazil married,
                           his Confessor, who is a Franciscan himself, informed him that he never would have
                           a child unless the Franciscans were reinstated in possession of Mafra. The Prince
                           had faith, the mendicants had Mafra, St. Francisco had pity, and the Princess had
                           a child’ (p. 543)…</span></div>
                  </div> a pity – for they are good stories &amp; true. We yesterday went there from Cintra – a
                  distance of three leagues (12 miles). A quinta of the Marquis Pombal on the way forms
                  a pleasing object from the olives which are planted to screen the vines – the grey
                  foliage &amp; the lively sunshine as it were – of the vines contrasting very well, the
                  quarries are near whence the fine stones is dug for the Lisbon buildings. two columns
                  are now lying by the road which in the great Pombals time were hewn for the Square
                  at Lisbon, each of a single stone. a foolish waste of labour only becoming Barbarian
                  pride for columns whose parts are put together upon the spot look as well &amp; are in
                  reality as firm. there they lie – like the Square itself, &amp; the half-finished streets,
                  &amp; the missing kingdom – monuments to the memory of Pombal. Two leagues on the way
                  lies a place called Cheleiras, – it may contain 50 scattered houses. – I assuredly
                  speak on the outside its number – but the place is a <span class="ital">town</span>, &amp; its inhabitants strangely jealous of its title. Some lads lately passing thro
                  enquired the name of the <span class="ital">village</span>; the man replied angrily it was a town – &amp; as they, not believing it, laughed at
                  him – he raised an uproar – &amp; they were actually in danger of being stoned by the
                  offended townsmen. A bridge has been lately built here over a valley; &amp; a great work

                  stands would not be noticed for beauty in a cultivated country, but here it appears
                  beautiful from the contrast of vine &amp; olive yards with naked &amp; sun burnt hills. the

                  the hill top to avoid a steep descent leads to Mafra. there is a bye path nearer by
                  two miles, which I advise none but a pedestrian to take. – Mafra itself is a small

                  </div> – a holy day in all Franciscan communities – more especially here because the Prince
                  conceives himself under great obligation to S<sup>t</sup> Francisco &amp; regularly attends his festival at Mafra. of course the country was assembled
                  there – food &amp; fruit exposed for sale in the Plaza, &amp; all the women equipped in all
                  their finery. we went to mass – the Prince followed the Host as it was carried round
                  the church – in the evening there was a procession – &amp; the Prince paraded with it.
                  &amp; thus the Regent of Portugal passes his time – dangling after saints &amp; assisting
                  at puppet-shows – &amp; no doubt he laid down last night thoroughly satisfied that he
                  had done his duty!</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The church &amp; convent &amp; Palace are one vast building – whose front exhibits a strong
               &amp; trusty Portugueze mixture of magnificence &amp; meanness. in part it has never been
               faced with stone – a mud plaister is in its place. the windows are not half glazed,
               red boards filling up the work-house looking casements. the church is beautiful –
               the library the finest book-room I ever saw, &amp; well-stored – tho poor in English books.
               the friar who accompanied us said it would be an excellent room to eat &amp; drink in
               &amp; go to play afterwards – “&amp; if we liked better to play in the dark – we might shut
               the windows!” He heard the servant remark to me that there &lt;were&gt; books enough for
               me to read there – &amp; asked if I loved reading – &amp; I said he – love eating &amp; drinking.
               honest Franciscan. he told us also that the dress of their order was a barbarous dress.
               &amp; that dress did not change the feelings. I suspect this man wishes he had professed
               in France. A Portugueze of some family was a nun in France: after the dissolution
               of the monasteries her brother immediately engaged with <span style="text-decoration: line-through">some</span> &lt;a&gt; Portugueze abbess to receive her, &amp; wrote in all haste for the distressed nun
               – she wrote in answer that she was &lt;much&gt; obliged to him – but she <span style="text-decoration: line-through">had</span> was married.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You have a superb convent here – said I. yes said the Monk, but it is a wretched place
               in winter. we suffer so from the cold – the rheumatism kills many. we have no fire
               in our cells – only in the kitchen. – such is Mafra – a library whose books are never
               used, a palace with a mud wall front – &amp; a royal convent inhabited by wretches who
               loathe their situation! The Monks often desert, in that case they are hunted like
               Deserters, &amp; punished if caught with confinement &amp; flogging. I heard of one poor fellow
               who was apprehended in a garden, where he had for three months earned his living honestly
               &amp; usefully as a labourer. They take the vows young – at fourteen. those who are most
               stupidly devout may be satisfied with their life – those who most abandoned in all
               vice may do well also. but a man with any feeling, any conscience, any brains must
               be miserable. The old men, whose necks are broken to their yoke, whose feelings are
               all blunted, &amp; who are by their rank or age exempt from some services, &amp; indulged
               with some privileges – these men are happy enough. A literary man would be well off
               – only that literature would open his eyes.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The library was not originally a part of the foundation. the Franciscan order excludes
                  all arts, all science. no picture ought to profane their churches. but when Pombal
                  turned these beggarly vermin out of this Palace, he removed to it the regular Canons
                  of S<sup>t</sup> Vincent.

                  Franciscan is by far the most numerous monastic family. A Convent that subsists upon
                  its revenues must necessarily be limited in its numbers – but every consecrated beggar
                  gets more than enough for his own support – so of course the more the merrier. Besides
                  in an order of gentlemen, &amp; such are the landed orders, the recruits are taken from
                  the higher ranks of society. but the blackguard who would live without working, or

               by Sebastiao Jose de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal (1699–1782; Prime Minister
               of Portugal 1750–1777). Their loss was shortlived. As Southey explained: ‘When the
               Prince of Brazil married, his Confessor, who is a Franciscan himself, informed him
               that he never would have a child unless the Franciscans were reinstated in possession
               of Mafra. The Prince had faith, the mendicants had Mafra, St. Francisco had pity,
               and the Princess had a child’ (p. 543). These ‘anecdotes’ did not appear in the second
               edition of the <em>Letters</em> published in 1799.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
