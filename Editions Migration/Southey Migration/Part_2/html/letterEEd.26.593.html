            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your letter found me on the point of setting out for Worcester, to meet <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a>, with whom I was to take counsel as to my future destination. He will procure for
                  me the place of secretary to some legation in the south of Europe, – probably to Naples.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The proposal by Wynn that Southey should become Secretary to Sir William Drummond
                           (c. 1770-1828; DNB), classical scholar, poet and diplomat; Charge d’Affaires in Denmark
                           1800-1801, Minister-Plenipotentiary in Naples 1801-1803 and 1807-1808, and Ambassador
                           to the Ottoman Empire in 1803.</span></div>
                  </div> This will be a permanent establishment, with a prospect and probability of something
                  better; it will settle me, also, in a good climate, which I feel an object of more
                  importance than I could wish. I know not what the salary may be – small certainly,
                  but certainly more than adequate to the official duty, which will allow me ample leisure
                  for my historical pursuits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I perceive, by your account, that a bill for 30<span class="ital">l</span>., which I exchanged at Falmouth, had not then reached you; my two journeys in Portugal,
                  the return home, and, above all, the heavy expense of the books which I have purchased
                  will account for the balance, and, I trust, acquit me of all extravagance. In the
                  spring, my appointment will probably take place, the person who at present holds the
                  office at the Neapolitan court

                  I shall then, I trust, soon be able to lighten myself of all debts, though the sense
                  of obligation, as it ought, will ever remain. An unhappy circumstance precludes me
                  from immediately lessening the balance. The costs of my cousin <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillMargaret">Margaret’s</a> illness – a year’s heavy illness – must be defrayed by me: she may yet linger some
                  months, though recovery is impossible, and from me her support must also continue
                  to be derived. Under this pressure I need not apologise for delay. I have written
                  to my London publisher, proffering him another poem,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey offered Longman either Madoc, a version of which had been written in 1797-1799,
                           or The Curse of Kehama, which he had begun in Portugal.</span></div>
                  </div> to be ready for the press by the end of the winter, but requesting a part of the payment
                  now, an offer to which he doubtless will accede. On this I should have lived and sequestered
                  my quarterly remittances to you. But for these demands I am in deep water; but I can
                  swim, and happily there is land in sight.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You will ask why I treat for a poem rather than for the materials which, with so much
               cost and labour, I have procured in Portugal. To Portugal I must one day return, to
               correct those materials when they are digested, and to gather what remains. It is
               even possible that I may one day hold an official situation in that country. To publish
               any thing now would be barring the doors of the archives against me: my first volume
               must touch popery to the quick. Thus have I a year’s labour lying dead. These, then,
               are my plans. I am about soon to visit <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>; his house will hold us, and there I shall devote myself to labour as unremitting
               as will be consistent with health and prudence.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I look with anxiety for Lisbon news. Should <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my uncle</a> return to England, as I hope and expect, it will relieve me from a weight of much
               anxiety. He is much pleased with the prospects which are opening upon me. If they
               only gave me a prudent opportunity of seeing Italy, that were much; but they also
               afford rational expectations of opulence, while they bestow immediate independence.</p>
