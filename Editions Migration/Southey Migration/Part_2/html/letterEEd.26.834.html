               the massacre at Jaffa, and the more atrocious tale of the poisoned soldiers’. Napoleon
               Bonaparte (1769-1821, First Consul 1799-1804, Emperor of the French 1804-1814) had
               conquered Jaffa in March 1799, ordering the execution of 3,000 Turkish soldiers. When
               he evacuated Jaffa on 27 May 1799 he ordered 50 or so soldiers who could not accompany
               the army because they were too ill with plague to be poisoned with laudanum – though
               there is no record of any of them dying from this ‘treatment’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               by the Spartan army. Possibly Wynn had suggested Southey should translate some of
               Tyrtaeus’s verses to aid the patriotic effort in 1803.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
