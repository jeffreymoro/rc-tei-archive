               soon found that was not the case. sure enough breakfast she did – I was obliged then

               half a hundred apologies, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp;</span> the servant had a shilling, we had a good morning laugh for ourselves &amp; a good story
               for our friends &amp; she had a very good breakfast. I wish you had been here.</p>
