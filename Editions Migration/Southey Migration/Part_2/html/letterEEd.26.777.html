               <p>Your with the bank-post bill of £40 for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</a> arrived safely &amp; the money has been paid. the first part of your letter gave me great
                  pleasure. what relates to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> is every way unpleasant, – what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</a> palliates as only an imprudence I feel to be a very serious &amp; a very dangerous fault. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry’s</a> allowance is surely a sufficient one. my dress, including every article, costs me
                  upon the average not more than £15 a year, set down 5 more for the indulgence of a
                  pardonable pride of appearance – &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> ought to be contented. he must after his washing &amp; other little necessary expences
                  be paid have a clear ten pounds for his yearly pleasures. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> his journey to Paris did not break in upon his allowance. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Taylor</a> you know bore his expences there, conditioning that he should pay for his own journey, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> said he had his unencumbered quarterly sum for that – but I gave him ten guineas for
                  the occasion. The mischief is that prodigality is in his nature &amp; in the nature of
                  all my brothers. he must write to Lisbon now – the act of writing will give him some
                  pain, &amp; the very gentle reproof which he will receive <span style="text-decoration: line-through">from</span> &lt;in&gt; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> answer ought to give <span style="text-decoration: line-through">more</span> &lt;him&gt; more – for he knows how <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>, who would else be an opulent <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> man, has been &amp; is still kept needy by spendthrift connections. I will write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Taylor</a>. I do not like that substitution of honour for steady principle, which he is disposed
                  to make. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harrys</a> prospects are as good as he could wish if he did not mar them by his own folly. let
                  him keep out of debt &amp; about four years hence, he is almost secure of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx xxxxx</span> a good practise in Norwich &amp; he will probably marry well – ambition will make him
                  prudent <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> in that instance. he will do well in the world – but I have no expectation of his
                  doing good in the world. he has great talents, but no genius. <span class="ital">videri</span> might be his motto. I should chuse <span class="ital">esse</span> to be mine.

               <p>I shall perhaps see you in the course of the summer. it was my design to go to London

                  </div> – this I had determined to delay, but an unpleasant complaint has been stealing upon
                  me unawares, for which exercise is one of the main remedies, &amp; I know no place <span class="strikethrough">where</span> that so compels me to great exercise as London. the complaint is diabetes with a disposition
                  in the kidneys to manufacture <span style="text-decoration: line-through">lime</span> calculus matter, which I hope has been discovered in time to prevent the bladder from
                  becoming a lime-kiln. soda is the peculiar medicine needful – aided by the red sulphat
                  of iron, which is certainly the most powerful general tonic that has yet been discovered.
                  I know &lt;not&gt; how I can take so much exercise with so little expence &amp; so <span style="text-decoration: line-through">much</span> little loss of time as by passing a fortnight with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> in London, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">on</span> resting myself for two hours at midday in the Museum.</p>

               <p>I must have expressed my<span style="text-decoration: line-through">self</span> &lt;meaning&gt; improperly in my last if you understood that I considered the present period,
                  upon the general average of good &amp; evil, as worse than older times. On the contrary
                  it appears to me very far the best, as being the most enlightened. it is the best
                  for the best men, virtues &amp; talents which would have been blasted formerly can grow
                  up &amp; flourish now. what I meant to express was that the condition of the greater part
                  of society – of the poor, is more uniformly miserable now than it ever has been in
                  any former period, &amp; that, in consequence <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx</span> of the inevitable effects of our commercial system. they were exposed to sudden calamities
                  formerly from which we are now tolerably secure – war we have not at home – nor pestilence,
                  nor actual famine. but when neither of these <span style="text-decoration: line-through">ravages</span> &lt;visitations&gt; happened to be let loose the peasantry &amp; labourers of England in old
                  times enjoyed a degree of comfort &amp; plenty which they now never can attain. their
                  morals &amp; their health were not poisoned by the soul-&amp;-body-murdering plan of herding
                  together in large &amp; unwholesome manufactories. the aggregate of human wisdom &amp; human
                  virtue is greater now. but the aggregate of human misery is increased also. Upon my
                  view of the moral government of the world, these progressive steps have all been needful
                  – a state of <span class="ital">innocence</span> is necessarily insecure. the Tree of Knowledge
