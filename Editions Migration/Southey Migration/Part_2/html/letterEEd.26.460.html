            <p>My dear Friend,</p>
            <p class="indent1">Do not from my long silence suspect me of negligence. I have been ill–so reduced by
               a nervous fever as neither to read nor write. On recovery I repaired to Bristol, to
               seek relief for a worse complaint. My heart is affected, nervously I <span class="ital">hope</span>; but pain there, and frequent irregularity in pulsation, convinced me that I ought
               not to delay obtaining able advice.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My hexameters come to you in a ragged state. I meant to have corrected them with care;
               but as they are, they may serve as a specimen of what I can do in this way, and it
               would be foolish to wait till I have leisure for correcting. These liberties I have
               allowed myself– sometimes a superfluous short syllable at the beginning–sometimes
               the pyrrhic–sometimes the amphimacer. These licences must of course be sparing; and
               what you will meet with would probably have been altered in correction.</p>
