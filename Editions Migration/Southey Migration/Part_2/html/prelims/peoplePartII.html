         <li class="item" id="d31e32"><span style="font-weight:bold" id="AikinJohn">Aikin, John [as Editor of the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>] (1747–1822; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">physician, author and brother of Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743–1825; <em>DNB</em>). In the mid-1790s, Southey and Aikin moved in the same circles in London. Aikin
               was a regular contributor to periodicals and his review of <em>Joan of Arc</em> appeared in the <em>Analytical Review</em> in 1796. In 1797 Aikin and his son, Arthur Aikin (1773–1854; <em>DNB</em>), translated the first volume of Necker’s <em>On the French Revolution</em>. Southey translated the second. In the mid-1790s, Southey (using a variety of pseudonyms)
               corresponded with Aikin in the latter’s capacity as literary editor of the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e58"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="AllenRobert">Allen, Robert (1772–1805):</span> <span class="gloss">surgeon and journalist. Educated at Christ’s Hospital (where he was a contemporary
               of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Lamb) and University College, Oxford (BA 1796,
               MA 1803, MB and MD 1803). He first met Southey, who was flirting with a career in
               medicine, at the Anatomy School in Oxford in early 1794. They became firm friends,
               Southey later describing how in 1794 Allen had been his ‘bosom-companion’ and had
               ‘rendered many hours delightful which would otherwise have passed in the destructive
               daydreams of solitude’. Allen wrote poetry and, in Oxford in June 1794, introduced
               Southey to Coleridge. In 1794–1795, Allen was possibly a convert to Pantisocracy.
               In 1796, he enrolled at the Westminster Hospital and married a wealthy widow, Catherine,
               daughter of Nathaniel Forster (1726–1790; <em>DNB</em>). She died within a year. In 1797, with the encouragement of Anthony Carlisle, he
               became deputy surgeon with England’s Second Royals, then stationed in Portugal. He
               was back in Britain by 1802 and from 1803 until his death worked as a journalist,
               writing for (according to Charles Lamb) the London newspapers the <em>Oracle</em>, <em>True Briton</em>, <em>Star</em> and <em>Traveller</em>.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e77"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BarkerMary">Barker, Mary (c. 1780- 1853):</span> <span class="gloss">author, painter and close friend of Robert Southey. Born in Congreve, Staffordshire,
               daughter of Thomas Barker, an ironmaster, and Mary Homfray. Author of <em>A Welsh Story</em> (1798), she moved in literary circles. She met Southey in Portugal in 1800 and subsequently
               visited the Southeys frequently in Bristol, London and Keswick. Godmother of Southey’s
               first child, Margaret (d. 1803). Southey had a high opinion of Mary Barker’s talents
               and proposed that she should illustrate <em>Madoc</em> (1805). She appears as the ‘Bhow Begum’ in <em>The Doctor</em> (1834-1837). Mary Barker lived at Greta Lodge in Keswick, next to Greta Hall, between
               1812 and 1817, becoming a close friend of the Coleridges and Wordsworths, as well
               as the Southeys, and teaching music to the girls of the families. Financial difficulties
               forced her to move to Boulogne in 1819 and she never returned to England. Southey
               met her for the last time on his trip to France in 1825. In 1830 she married a Mr
               Slade, who was much younger than her and thought to be a ‘mere adventurer’ by her
               Keswick friends.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e92"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BeddoesThomas">Beddoes, Thomas (1760–1808; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">chemist and physician. Born at Shifnal, Shropshire, son of Richard Beddoes and Ann
               Whitehall. Educated at Bridgnorth Grammar School, by private tutor, and at Pembroke
               College, Oxford (matric. 1776, BA 1779, MB and MD 1786), and Edinburgh. Reader in
               Chemistry at Oxford from 1788. In the early 1790s, a growing reputation as a radical
               led to his surveillance by Home Office spies and failure to gain the Regius Chair
               in Chemistry. He left Oxford for Bristol in 1793 and married Anna Edgeworth (1772-1824),
               sister of the novelist Maria (1768-1849; <em>DNB</em>), in the following year. Beddoes was involved in the political protest movements
               of the mid-1790s and possibly first met Southey in 1795, during the latter’s immersion
               in Bristol politics. In 1799, Beddoes opened the Pneumatic Institute (from 1802 the
               Preventive Medical Institution for the Sick and Drooping Poor) in Hotwells, Bristol.
               Southey participated in the experiments with gases carried out by Beddoes and Humphry
               Davy, and recorded in <em>Notice of Some Observations Made at the Medical Pneumatic Institution</em> (1799). Beddoes was a prolific writer on medical, political and educational reform.
               He was also a poet: author of <em>Alexander’s Expedition</em> (1792) and a contributor to Southey’s <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799). Southey respected Beddoes’s medical judgment, consulting him on more than
               one occasion. In 1809 he recorded that ‘From Beddoes I hoped for more good to the
               human race than from any other individual’. However, disagreements about poetry ensured
               that their personal relationship was not warm. Southey dismissed Beddoes as a ‘hypercritic
               of the Darwin school’ and was furious when his ‘Domiciliary Verses’ (a parody of Samuel
               Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth and Southey) found its way into the first volume
               of the <em>Annual Anthology</em>. Joseph Cottle, who was responsible for the poem’s inclusion, was ordered by Southey
               not to solicit any further contributions from Beddoes.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e113"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="Bedfordfamily">Bedford family:</span> <span class="gloss">the Bedford family lived at Westminster and Brixton. The household consisted of the
               parents, Charles and Mary Bedford, three sons (Grosvenor, Horace and Harry) and a
               cousin, Mary Page. Southey was on good terms with the entire family. He made use of
               the library in their Westminster home and wrote the first draft of <em>Joan of Arc</em> during an extended stay at their house in Brixton in summer 1793. Southey corresponded
               with Grosvenor and Horace.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e124"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford, Grosvenor Charles (1773–1839):</span> <span class="gloss">civil servant and miscellaneous writer. The son of Charles Bedford (Deputy Usher of
               the Exchequer, as Horace Walpole’s substitute) and Mary Page. Educated at Westminster
               School (adm. 1784), but did not attend university. Assistant clerk in the Exchequer
               Office, 1792–1803; clerk of the cash book, 1803–1806; clerk of the registers and issues,
               1806–1822; chief clerk in the auditor’s office, 1822–1834. Admitted to Gray’s Inn,
               26 January 1797. Bedford did not marry, despite regularly seeking Southey’s advice
               on his love affairs. Bedford and Southey met at Westminster School and their friendship
               endured for the remainder of their lives. Bedford had literary inclinations. He was
               involved in the ill-fated <em>Flagellant</em> (1792), contributed poems to the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (1797) and the first volume of the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799), and privately published his translation of Musaeus, <em>The Loves of Hero and Leander</em> (1797). He worked with Southey on <em>Specimens of the Later English Poets</em> (1807) and contributed an unsigned notice of Southey’s <em>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</em> (1814) to the <em>Quarterly Review</em>. His other publications included <em>A Letter to the Right Hon. William Pitt on his Political Experiments</em> (1804, anonymous) and a <em>Memoir</em> of Barré Charles Roberts (1814).</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e153"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BedfordHenry">Bedford, Henry (‘Harry’) (dates unknown):</span> <span class="gloss">the younger brother of Grosvenor and Horace Bedford.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e162"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BedfordHoraceWalpole">Bedford, Horace Walpole (c. 1776–1807):</span> <span class="gloss">civil servant and miscellaneous writer. The younger brother of Grosvenor Charles Bedford
               and named after his father’s patron. He was educated at Westminster School (adm. 1784),
               where his nickname was ‘the Doctor’ or ‘Dr. Johnson’. He did not attend university
               and later held a post at the British Museum. Like his older brother, he did not marry.
               Southey’s friendship with Horace began at school and their correspondence (though
               occasionally intermittent) lasted until at least 1797. Southey’s relationship with
               Horace was slightly different from that with Grosvenor Charles Bedford. He treated
               Horace as a younger brother: encouraging him and worrying about his tendency to laziness.
               He also fostered the younger man’s literary ambitions. Horace’s poems appeared in
               the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (1797) and the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799).</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e175"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BiddlecombeCharles">Biddlecombe, Charles (dates unknown):</span> <span class="gloss">neighbour and friend. Biddlecombe met Southey in summer 1797 when the latter moved
               to the village of Burton in Hampshire. Southey described him as ‘rich enough to buy
               books, and very friendly, all that a neighbour should be’. Biddlecombe married in
               summer 1798. His wife had died in childbirth by April 1799, leaving him with an infant
               daughter. During Southey’s numerous absences, Biddlecombe appears to have looked after
               the cottage at Burton and when it was finally given up in 1802 arranged for a sale
               of part of the furniture and stored some of Southey’s possessions, including books,
               for a number of years. During his 1817 visit to France, Southey ran into Biddlecombe,
               whom he had not seen for several years, and his invalid daughter, describing the latter
               as ‘short and plethoric, with a countenance of prepossessing good nature’.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e184"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BiggsNathaniel">Biggs, Nathaniel (dates unknown):</span> <span class="gloss">a printer and stationer in Bristol. He printed books, including works by Beddoes,
               Coleridge, Estlin and Southey, for congeries of publishers in London and the South-West
               of England. In the mid-late 1790s, he entered into a business partnership with Joseph
               Cottle, printing the Bristol edition of Coleridge and Wordsworth’s <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798), and the revised editions of 1800 and 1802.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e195"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BoucherJonathan">Boucher, Jonathan (1738-1804; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">schoolmaster, clergyman and lexicographer. Southey corresponded with him in 1802 concerning
               Thomas Chatterton (1752-1770; <em>DNB</em>).</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e209"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BunburyCharlesJohn">Bunbury, Charles John (1772–1798):</span> <span class="gloss">soldier. Educated at Westminster School, where he was a friend of Southey’s, and Trinity
               College, Cambridge. In 1789, Bunbury presented Southey with a copy of Thomas Warton’s
               <em>Poems</em> (3rd edn, 1779). Their friendship did not last. In 1793, Bunbury tried to avoid Southey
               when the latter was visiting Cambridge. Southey, in turn, claimed that Bunbury’s ‘debauchery’
               was the direct result of his public school education. Bunbury joined the army and
               died at the Cape of Good Hope. Bunbury’s father, the artist Henry William Bunbury
               (1750–1811; <em>DNB</em>), and his younger brother, Sir Henry Edward Bunbury (1778–1860; <em>DNB</em>), later became close friends of Southey’s and members of his circle in Keswick.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e224"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BurnettGeorge">Burnett, George (c. 1776–1811; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">writer. The son of John Burnett, a farmer, of Huntspill, Somerset. Educated at Balliol
               College, Oxford (matric. 1793). His varied career included time spent as a student
               at a dissenting academy in Manchester, pastor to a Unitarian congregation in Great
               Yarmouth, medical student at the University of Edinburgh, assistant to John Rickman,
               domestic tutor to the sons of Lord Stanhope, assistant surgeon to a militia regiment
               and (in Poland) tutor to the family of Count Zamovski. Burnett was also a professional
               writer, whose works included <em>View of the Present State of Poland</em> (1807; from essays originally published in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>), <em>Specimens of English Prose Writers</em> (1807; a companion to George Ellis’s <em>Specimens of the Early English Poets</em>) and <em>Extracts from the Prose Works of Milton</em> (1809). Southey met Burnett at Balliol and the two became friends. Burnett was one
               of the originators of Pantisocracy and in true Pantisocratic spirit proposed to Martha
               Fricker, who turned him down. In 1795, he shared lodgings with Southey and Coleridge
               in Bristol. From 1797–1798, he was minister to a Unitarian congregation in Great Yarmouth,
               Norfolk, where he also tutored Henry Herbert Southey. Burnett moved in metropolitan
               literary circles and was friendly with Charles Lamb and John Rickman. His relationship
               with Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge became deeply ambivalent – by 1803 he was
               accusing both of treating him badly. Burnett was an opium addict and his last years
               were probably spent in poverty. He died in the Marylebone Infirmary.</span></li>

               Martha Sherwood (1775-1851; <em>DNB</em>), author of <em>The Fairchild Family</em>. Educated Westminster (adm. 1788) and Christ Church, Oxford (matric. 1792, BA 1796,
               MA 1799). Curate of Witley, Worcestershire; Rector of Oddingley, Worcestershire from
               1806 and Vicar of East Garston, Berkshire from 1806. Author of <em>The Last Vision of Daniel</em> (1808) and other works. His first wife was Mary Ann Congreve; his second, Jemima
               Hubbal. Butt was a friend of Southey’s at Westminster School and Oxford.</span></li>

               they did not keep in touch in later life. Their last meeting was at Falmouth in 1801,
               when Campbell was on his way to take up a living in Antigua.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e284"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle, Anthony (1768-1840; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">eminent surgeon, born in Stillingfleet, Durham. Trained in York and Durham and moved

               the Royal College of Surgeons, 1800; Fellow of the Royal Society, 1804; Professor
               of Anatomy at the Royal Academy, 1808; surgeon-extraordinary to the Prince Regent
               and knighted in 1820. Carlisle probably met Southey in 1795, through Grosvenor Bedford.
               He was a friend by 1797-1798, when he introduced Southey to his first reviewing job
               at the <em>Critical Review</em> and participated in Southey and May’s plan for a convalescent hospital. Carlisle
               attended Southey’s mother in her last illness in 1801-1802, but after Southey settled
               in Keswick the two men saw much less of each other.</span></li>

               Order and Professor of Theology at the University of Coimbra 1751-1755. Cenaculo was
               closely associated with the reforms of the Marquis of Pombal, Prime Minister of Portugal
               1750-1777, and retired to his bishopric when Pombal fell in 1777, devoting his energies
               to his library and promoting education. When Southey visited Portugal in 1800-1801
               he obtained a letter of introduction to the Bishop from his uncle, Herbert Hill, and

               – four-decade relationship with Coleridge had a major impact both on Southey’s life
               and on his critical posterity. It began in Oxford in summer 1794 when Robert Allen
               introduced Southey to a visitor from Cambridge – Coleridge. It was a fateful meeting,
               leading to the failed scheme of Pantisocracy, literary collaboration, and – eventually
               – mutual disenchantment. As Southey later recorded: ‘that meeting fixed the future
               fortunes of us both ... Coleridge had at that time thought little of politics, in
               morals he was as loose ... as men at a university usually are, but he was a Unitarian.
               my morals were of the sternest Stoicism ... that same feeling which made me a poet
               kept me pure ... Our meeting was mutually serviceable, – I reformed his life, &amp; he
               disposed me toward Xtianity’.</span></li>

               1795. Her relationship with Southey, who provided her with advice and support during
               her later marital difficulties, was affectionate, and at times jokey and rumbustious.
               Indeed, Sarah’s daughter and namesake recorded that Southey had been romantically

               Greenwich, Kent. Educated at Westminster and Christ Church, Oxford (matric. Jan 1793).
               Married Jane Forman, by whom he had one son. Died c. 1806. Collins’s biography is
               difficult to reconstruct as <em>Records of Old Westminsters</em> and <em>Alumni Oxoniensis</em> both confuse him with his son, also named Charles Collins, and give a later date
               of death. A note, now in the Huntington Library, written by an eponymous descendant
               confirms that he died young. In 1815, Southey referred to Collins’s widow and in 1828
               described him as long dead. Southey met Collins at Westminster and later described
               him as ‘one of my most intimate school and college friends’. However, by early 1794
               their friendship had cooled and they seem to have had no contact with one another
               after Southey’s departure from Oxford later that year.</span></li>

               from 1821 and of Donyatt, from 1821. Southey met Combe at Westminster and later described
               him as one of his ‘most intimate acquaintances’ during his years at school. Combe
               was known by the nicknames ‘His Majesty’ or the ‘King of Men’. Although their close
               friendship did not outlast Oxford, Southey did visit Combe in 1824.</span></li>

               Educated Royal School, Antrim and BA, Trinity College, Dublin, 1773. Succeeded his
               father as MP for Newry in the Irish Parliament, 1776. Originally an opposition MP,
               he first gained office as surveyor-general of the ordnance in 1788 and rose to be
               Irish chancellor of the exchequer in 1799 -1804. Always a controversial figure, he
               fought a duel with the opposition MP, Henry Grattan (1746-1820; <em>DNB</em>), in 1800. He supported the British government’s policies of Union between Britain
               and Ireland and Catholic Emancipation, but was still dismissed by the prime minister,
               William Pitt (1759-1806; <em>DNB</em>) in 1804. Rickman secured Southey the post of Corry’s secretary in 1801-1802.</span></li>

               sect (‘the Cottlelites’), and three sisters Ann, Martha and Mary, though there were
               possibly as many as eight siblings in total. Southey seems to have been acquainted
               with the entire Cottle family. After their secret marriage in November 1795, his wife
               Edith lived with the Cottle sisters for some of the time Southey was absent in Spain
               and Portugal.</span></li>

               Richard Henderson (1736/7–1792) at Hanham, near Bristol, and Magdalene College, Cambridge
               (matric. 1795, BA 1799). He then embarked on a legal training. He spent the final
               year of his life in London, where he was a friend of George Dyer and Charles Lamb,
               and died in his chambers at Clifford’s Inn. Author of <em>Icelandic Poetry, or, The Edda of Saemund, Translated into English verse</em> (1797; published by Joseph Cottle and with dedicatory poem by Southey). Several of
               his other poems were collected posthumously in the fourth edition of Joseph Cottle,
               <em>Malvern Hills, With Minor Poems and Essays</em> (1829). Southey probably met Amos Cottle through his younger brother Joseph. The
               two shared an interest in Scandinavian literature and mythology and it was Southey
               who encouraged Amos to produce a verse, rather than prose, translation of the <em>Edda</em> and who reviewed it in the <em>Critical Review</em>.</span></li>

               Dykes Campbell joked ‘I never heard of ... [Cottle’s] having ... any [parents], and
               think it very doubtful. I should think he was found under a booksellers counter wrapped
               in Felix Farley’s newspaper’, Joseph was in fact the second child of Robert and Sarah
               Cottle. He was educated at the school run by Richard Henderson (1736/7–1792) at Hanham,
               near Bristol. In 1791 he opened a shop as a printseller, stationer, binder and bookseller
               in Bristol. Cottle abandoned bookselling in 1798 but continued publishing. Between
               1791 and 1800 he sold, printed or published 114 works, in congeries with Joseph Johnson,
               Benjamin Flower, H. D. Symons and others. In 1800 he began to sell his copyrights
               to the London firm of Longman. A poet and prose writer, his works included: <em>Poems</em> (1795), <em>Malvern Hills</em> (1798; with a prefatory poem by Southey), <em>Alfred</em> (1800), <em>The Fall of Cambria</em> (1808), <em>Early Recollections, Chiefly Relating to the Late Samuel Taylor Coleridge, During
                  his Long Residence in Bristol</em> (1837) and <em>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</em> (1847). Cottle and Southey were introduced by Robert Lovell in 1794. Although not
               wealthy, Cottle provided generous financial help to Southey throughout the 1790s,
               even lending him money for his wedding ring. He published <em>Joan of Arc</em> and the majority of Southey’s earliest works, including <em>Poems</em> (1797) and <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</em> (1797). His professional collaboration with Southey also included contributing poems
               to the <em>Annual Anthology</em> and co-editing the works of their fellow Bristolian Thomas Chatterton (1752-1770;
               <em>DNB</em>). What Cottle did not know, was that Southey viewed his poetry with a merriment that
               verged on contempt. The two men met less frequently after Southey’s move to Keswick
               in 1803, but maintained their correspondence. Southey’s final tour of the West Country
               in 1836-1837 included a visit to Cottle in Bristol. After Southey’s death, Cottle
               was a central figure in the successful campaign to erect a monument to his memory
               in Bristol cathedral. He recorded his association with Southey for posterity in his
               controversial <em>Reminiscences</em> (1847), itself a reworking of the equally contentious <em>Early Recollections</em> (1837).</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e477"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="CroftHerbert">Croft, Herbert 5th Baronet (1751–1816; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">writer and lexicographer. Born at Dunster Park, Berkshire, the son of Richard Croft.
               He inherited the Croft baronetcy from a relative in 1797, but no money or lands to
               accompany the title. He practised as a barrister in London in the late 1770s, and
               gained some reputation as a miscellaneous writer. Perennially short of money, Croft
               changed direction and graduated from University College, Oxford in 1785 and was appointed
               Vicar of Prittlewell in Essex and chaplain of the British garrison in Quebec. Most
               of his time in the late 1780s and early 1790s was devoted to a new dictionary, but,
               despite amassing 11,000 entries, he could not find enough subscribers to publish the
               book and the project was abandoned in 1793. In 1795 Croft was arrested for debt and
               fled to Hamburg, only returning to England in 1800-1802, after which he lived in France,
               dying in Paris. In 1780 Croft had published <em>Love and Madness</em>, the story of James Hackman (c. 1752-1779; <em>DNB</em>), who had shot Martha Ray (1742?-1779; <em>DNB</em>), the lover of the Earl of Sandwich (1718-1792; <em>DNB</em>). The book contained a lengthy digression into the life of the Bristol poet Thomas
               Chatterton (1752-1770; <em>DNB</em>). Southey published a letter in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> for November 1799, accusing Croft of obtaining some of Chatterton’s letters by deception
               from the poet’s mother and sister, and refusing to pay them any share of his profits
               from <em>Love and Madness</em>. Croft’s defence, to say the least, was evasive. In 1803 Southey and Joseph Cottle
               published a new version of Chatterton’s works for the benefit of his sister and niece.</span></li>

               related to the regicides Sir John Danvers (1584/5–1655; <em>DNB</em>) and General Thomas Harrison (c. 1616–60; <em>DNB</em>) and to the diarist Celia Fiennes (1662–1741; <em>DNB</em>). (Southey possessed a manuscript of Fiennes diary which he had been given by the
               Danvers family and included unacknowledged excerpts from it in his and Coleridge’s
               <em>Omniana</em> (1812)). Danvers’ father had ‘been a person of some property’, though the family’s
               fortunes had since declined. Danvers seems to have had two brothers and two sisters.
               He never married. A dissenter, he died in London ‘during a short tarriance there’
               and was buried in Asplands Burial Ground, Hackney. Danvers knew Southey from childhood.
               In 1797, their friendship flourished when Southey and his wife lodged in a house in
               Kingsdown, next door to Danvers and his mother. In 1799, Southey finished the fifteen
               book version of <em>Madoc</em> in Mrs Danvers’ ‘parlour on her little table’. When Southey went to Portugal in 1800–1,
               he left a copy of his poetic magnum opus with Danvers and also delegated the task
               of collecting materials for the third <em>Annual Anthology</em> to him and Davy. This volume did not appear. Danvers visited Southey at Keswick in
               summer 1805 and kept a journal of his tour, now in the British Library, Add MS 30929.
               Extracts from this were published in Kenneth Curry, ‘A note on Wordsworth’s “Fidelity”’,
               <em>Philological Quarterly</em>, 32 (1953), pp. 212–214.</span></li>

               her death in the influenza epidemic of 1803, Southey described her as someone ‘whom

               grammar schools and apprenticed to an apothecary-surgeon in Truro. Davy had wide interests
               as a young man, writing poetry as well as conducting chemical experiments on the nature
               of heat, light and acidity. In October 1798 he went to Bristol to work for Thomas
               Beddoes at his Pneumatic Institution, which opened in March 1799. Davy soon became
               friendly with Southey and Coleridge, and they both participated in his experiments
               with nitrous oxide, or ‘laughing gas’. Southey published some of Davy’s early poems
               in the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799) and (1800) and suggested Davy should write a poem on Mango Capac, the first
               Inca, after Southey had failed in his plan to identify Madoc with the Inca ruler.
               In January 1801 Davy moved to London to work at the Royal Institution, where he became
               a Professor in 1802. After this time Southey saw much less of Davy. However, his work
               on electricity was regarded as a brilliant contribution to Britain’s scientific reputation
               and he was elected President of the Royal Society in 1820.</span></li>

               and Louisa Dolignon seems to have acted as his guardian during his time at Westminster
               School. William Vincent wrote to her (and not to Southey’s parents) regarding his
               involvement in <em>The Flagellant</em>. Southey, in turn, went from Westminster to the Delameres’ house after his suspension
               from school. Southey later recorded his ‘utmost reverence and affection’ for Dolignon.</span></li>

               and Susannah Duppa. Educated (late in life) at Trinity College, Oxford (matric. 1807);
               entered Middle Temple 1810; graduated LLB Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1814. His publications
               included: <em>A Brief Account of the Subversion of the Papal Government in 1798</em> (1799), <em>A Selection of Twelve Heads from the Last Judgment of Michael Angelo</em> (1801), <em>Memoirs of a Literary and Political Character</em> (1803), and <em>The Life and Literary Works of Michael Angelo Buonarotti, with His Poetry and Letters</em> (1806). The latter contained translations by Southey and William Wordsworth. Southey
               and Duppa were introduced by Edmund Seward in Oxford in 1793. Duppa was related to
               Seward and, according to family lore, distantly related to Southey. Part of Southey’s
               circle, he was at one time engaged to Mary Page, the cousin of Grosvenor Charles and
               Horace Walpole Bedford. In the 1790s, Southey sought Duppa’s advice about projected
               illustrated editions of his poems. Later, Duppa provided the material on art in Southey’s
               <em>Letters from England</em> (1807).</span></li>

               London. Educated at Christ’s Hospital and Emmanuel College, Cambridge (BA 1778). From
               the late 1780s to mid 1790s he was active in reformist causes, a member of the Constitutional
               Society and author of <em>An Inquiry into the Nature of Subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles</em> (1789, second revised edn 1792), <em>Complaints of the Poor People of England</em> (1793) and <em>A Dissertation on the Theory and Practice of Benevolence</em> (1795). After 1795, he abandoned active politics, turning instead to scholarship
               and literature. He was a prolific poet whose works included, <em>Poems, Consisting of Odes and Elegies</em> (1792), <em>The Poet’s Fate</em> (1797), and <em>Poetics</em> (1812). Dyer met Southey in c. 1794–1795, probably through Coleridge. He was enthusiastic
               about Pantisocracy and encouraged the publication of <em>The Fall of Robespierre</em> (1794). He seems to have corresponded with Southey from the mid 1790s, but none of
               these earliest letters survive, making it difficult to judge the actual extent of
               their friendship. It is, however, fair to say, that this has probably been underestimated.
               A handful of letters written by Southey to Dyer from later periods do exist. Dyer’s
               close connections with Southey’s literary circle are evidenced in a letter sent to
               him by Joseph Cottle, 22 April 1797 now in the Houghton Library (Autograph File: Cottle,

               and Christ Church, Oxford (matric. 1791, BA 1794, MA 1797, BD and DD 1823), he was
               described as ‘the fattest undergraduate of his day’ (<em>DNB</em>). Ordained and presented to the living of Little Horkesley, Essex, on his uncle’s
               death in 1802 he relinquished his duties and income to a curate, though he continued
               to hold the living until 1816. He made a brief move to Edinburgh, where he met the
               founders of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, to which he became a contributor. He returned to London and in 1807 moved to Kent,
               where he lived with his mother until 1816. During this time he produced editions of
               Aristophanes, Sophocles and Euripides and a number of learned papers on classical
               subjects, published in the <em>Quarterly Review</em> and other periodicals. He travelled at length in Europe c. 1816–1818 and settled
               in Oxford in 1818. In 1823 (having been unsuccessfully proposed for the Regius Chair
               of Divinity at Oxford and having turned down the See of Calcutta) he was elected Camden
               Professor of Ancient History and Principal of St Alban Hall, Oxford, offices he held
               until his death in 1825. Southey and Elmsley met at Westminster School and remained

A supporter of William Pitt (1759-1806; <em>DNB</em>), in the 1790s Freeling was involved in monitoring the activities of corresponding
               societies and supporters of the French revolution. A bibliophile, he was elected to
               the fellowship of the Society of Antiquaries in 1801. Southey and Freeling were both
               the sons of Bristol tradesmen. They corresponded over financial matters connected
               to Southey and Joseph Cottle’s 1803 edition of the works of their fellow Bristolian,
               Thomas Chatterton (1752-1770; <em>DNB</em>).</span></li>

               Sarah, Mary, Edith, Martha (b. 1777), Eliza (b. 1778) and George (b. 1785). The failure
               of his business speculations (including the manufacture of sugar pans) contributed
               to Stephen Fricker’s early death and to a sharp decline in the fortunes of his family.
               The family home was sold, Mrs Fricker moved into lodgings in Bristol and opened a
               dame school, and her three eldest daughters became seamstresses, whose clients included
               Southey’s mother and aunt, Elizabeth Tyler. Southey knew the Frickers from childhood
               and was ‘partly educated’ with the three eldest girls. The similarity between their
               situation and his own (Southey’s father was also a bankrupt) was perhaps an important
               factor in what was to be a lifelong relationship.</span></li>

               employment, at a bank in Bristol in 1800 and on one of Rickman’s statistical projects
               in 1804. Though Southey respected George’s good qualities, he was frustrated by his
               ‘uncommon dullness’. He died at Greta Hall after a long illness.</span></li>

               House of Assembly. In 1788 he came to England to work as a lawyer, but suffered a
               mental collapse and was placed in an asylum run by Richard Henderson (1736/7-1792)
               at Hanham near Bristol. (In an earlier career as a schoolmaster, Henderson had numbered
               Joseph Cottle among his pupils.) Gilbert was released after a year and went to London,
               where he worked as an astrologer and maker of magic talismans. In 1795 he went to
               Bristol, where he became friends with Southey and Coleridge. In 1796 he published
               <em>The Hurricane: a Theosophical and Western Eclogue</em>. He disappeared in 1798. It was thought he had left Bristol in search of the ‘Gilberti’,
               an African tribe with whom he believed he had a spiritual affinity. Southey made enquiries
               after him, but to no effect. Although by 1820 Southey spoke of Gilbert as long dead,
               he was in fact probably still alive, dying c. 1825.</span></li>

Brought up in a Dissenting home in London, she first found fame with her <em>Cursory Remarks on an Enquiry into the Experience and Propriety of Public Worship</em> (1792). This propelled her into the circle of radicals around the publisher Joseph
               Johnson (1738-1809; <em>DNB</em>). Hays’s <em>Memoirs of Emma Courtney</em> (1796) gained her some notoriety, as it was a thinly-disguised version of her relationship
               with the radical William Frend (1757-1841; <em>DNB</em>). She was caricatured in, among other places, Charles Lloyd’s <em>Edmund Oliver</em> (1798), but her main claim to posthumous fame has been her feminist writings, especially
               <em>An Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in Behalf of Women</em> (1798). Southey met Hays in London in 1797 and corresponded with her in the early
               1800s.</span></li>

               College, Oxford (BA 1796, MA, 1797). Heber edited some minor classical writers, but
               his main interest was his book collection, which finally totalled over 100,000 volumes
               housed in eight different locations. Though he concentrated on early English poetry
               and drama his library included classical works and a wide selection of European and
               Latin American literature. Heber was exceptionally generous in lending his books,
               and let Southey use his copy of <em>Amadis of Gaul</em>. Heber was MP for Oxford University 1821-1825, but resigned and spent several years
               on the continent after rumours of a homosexual relationship began to circulate. However,
               he was never prosecuted and eventually returned to England.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e785"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="HillHerbertUncle">Hill, Herbert (1750–1828):</span> <span class="gloss">Southey’s maternal uncle. Hill was the product of a second marriage, and after his
               father’s death was left short of money (even having to ‘pay his own school bills when
               it was in his power’) and on extremely bad terms with his older half-brother. Hill
               was educated at Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1772, MA 1774). From 1792–1807, he was chaplain
               to the British factory at Lisbon. On his return to England, Hill took up a living
               he owned at Staunton-Upon-Wye, remaining there until 1810 when the Duke of Bedford
               presented him to a living in Streatham. In 1808 Hill married a woman twenty-five years
               his junior, Catherine Bigg (b. c. 1775), a friend of Jane Austen (1775–1817; <em>DNB</em>). The marriage produced six surviving children, all of whom were on good terms with
               Southey and his family. Hill’s son and namesake, Herbert Hill Junior (1810–1892),
               married Southey’s daughter Bertha in 1839. Hill took a paternal interest in his nephews,
               and helped finance Southey’s education. Hill’s concern about Southey’s refusal to
               take the path mapped out for him (a path leading to ordination), his relationship
               with Edith Fricker, and his politics, led him to visit England in 1795. He returned
               to Portugal with Southey in tow. Oblivious to the fact that his nephew had married
               Edith the day before their departure, Hill used every opportunity to introduce Southey
               to more suitable women. Nevertheless, the time Southey spent with his uncle in 1795–1796
               greatly strengthened their relationship, which remained close until Hill’s death in
               1828. Hill encouraged his nephew’s interests in Spanish and Portuguese history and
               literature, and later bought books and manuscripts on his behalf. Southey dedicated
               his <em>Colloquies</em> (1829) to his uncle.</span></li>

               his wife Elizabeth Fear. Educated locally and at North Petherton School. Apprenticed
               to a Bristol apothecary in 1786. He contributed poems to the <em>European Magazine</em> and in 1794 published <em>The Times</em>, a satire. Jennings moved to London shortly after his marriage to Charlotte Sawier,
               probably the only daughter of Southey’s landlady Mary Sawier, in 1795. He returned
               to work in his family’s shop in 1801 and remained in Huntspill until the mid-1810s,
               when economic depression led to the failure of the business. He continued with his
               literary pursuits, contributing to the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (from 1807) and publishing <em>Poems, Consisting of the Mysteries of Mendip, the Magic Ball</em> (1810). He returned to London in 1817 and worked as a professional writer, with some
               support from Sir William Paxton, a wealthy banker. His works included the <em>Family Cyclopaedia</em> (1821), <em>Observations on Some of the Dialects of the West of England</em> (1825) and <em>Ornithologia</em> (1828). He founded the short-lived Metropolitan Literary Institution in 1823 and
               was editor of the <em>Metropolitan Literary Journal</em> (1824). Jennings met Southey (and Coleridge) in Bristol in c. 1794. Although they
               were not close friends, he and Southey corresponded (the correspondence has not survived)
               and remained in contact until c. 1828. Jennings was a great admirer of Southey’s writing,
               but the admiration was not reciprocated. Southey nicknamed him ‘poor Trauma’ and ‘the
               traumatic poet’, though he admired Jennings’s ‘moral character’. Jennings shared Southey’s
               interest in educational methods, and in 1813, in collaboration with the local rector
               at Huntspill, established a school conducted on Lancaster and Bell’s monitorial system.
               Jennings included anecdotes of Southey and Coleridge’s early careers in the <em>Metropolitan Literary Journal</em> (1824).</span></li>

               relationship started to blossom in 1797, when Lamb – accompanied by Charles Lloyd
               – paid Southey an unexpected visit. Southey and Lamb shared an interest in Francis
               Quarles (1592–1644; <em>DNB</em>). They quarrelled briefly – and publicly – in 1823, but were reconciled. Although

               Educated at Westminster (adm. 1788); Edinburgh University (1792) and Christ Church,
               Oxford (matric. Dec 1793). Lamb’s family were wealthy, politically influential, well-connected
               family. His father was the government manager at Rye, Sussex. Lamb’s career benefited
               from the patronage of Lord Liverpool (1727-1808; <em>DNB</em>) and his eldest son, Lord Hawkesbury (1770-1828; <em>DNB</em>), a future Prime Minister. Lamb was private secretary to Hawkesbury, then Secretary
               of State for Foreign Affairs, 1801–2, and in 1802 was offered but rejected the consulship
               at Lisbon, a post worth between £2000–2500 per year. He sat as an M.P. for Rye from
               1802–1806, though he seems never to have spoken in the House of Commons. He vacated
               his seat when appointed to the post of Law Clerk at the Home Office by the Ministry
               of ‘Talents’. Following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father, he was Mayor
               of Rye from 1803–1804, 1809–1810 and 1816–1817. He never married. Southey described
               Lamb as ‘one of my oldest – &amp; once one of my most intimate friends’. The two met whilst
               pupils at Westminster and Southey stayed with Lamb’s family in Rye on more than one
               occasion. They drifted apart (though, Southey later noted, ‘without dissention’) during
               Southey’s time at Oxford. Lamb seems to have made an effort to renew their acquaintance,
               seeking Southey out in London in 1802. In later years, however, Southey’s opinion
               of him soured. He described him as one who had ‘discarded decency’ and on reading
               of Lamb’s death in a newspaper admitted that he had: ‘ ... thought more of him, poor
               fellow, in consequence, than I had done for the last four-and-twenty years ... [He]
               had become a mere idle heir of fortune, and not having his estates to manage while
               his father lived, had not even that occupation to keep him from frivolities. He was
               an old man at thirty, and that too being of a family in which it is degeneracy to
               die at an age short of fourscore.’</span></li>

               had become the dominant force on Rye corporation and wielded great political influence
               in the borough. Lamb was the government agent in Rye and sat as an M.P. for the town

               contributions to Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s <em>Poems</em> (1797), <em>Blank Verse</em> (1798) (co-authored with Charles Lamb), the controversial roman a clef <em>Edmund Oliver</em> (1798), <em>Nugae Canorae</em> (1819), <em>Desultory Thoughts in London</em> (1821), <em>Poetical Essays on the Character of Pope</em> (1821), and <em>The Duke d'Ormond</em> (1822). Lloyd’s later life was clouded by mental illness, he was briefly confined
               in Quaker-run asylum The Retreat, York and died in a sanatorium near Versailles. Lloyd
               met Southey at Burton in August 1797, when he and Charles Lamb unexpectedly turned
               up on Southey’s doorstep. Lloyd remained with Southey and his family for several months.
               Southey recognised in him a fellow man of strong emotions, a kindred – yet also unlike
               – spirit, and worried that Lloyd’s ‘feelings ... are not so blunt as we could wish
               them – or as they should be for his own happiness’. Indeed Lloyd’s continued presence
               was increasingly unwelcome and in 1798 his tale-telling led to a major quarrel between
               Southey and Coleridge which was not healed until 1799. After Southey moved to Keswick
               in 1803, Lloyd was on the fringes of his circle. In his edition of Cowper (1836–1837),
               Southey made his final public observations on Lloyd’s tragic history: ‘[his] intellectual
               powers were of a very high order ... when in company with persons who were not informed
               of his condition, no one could descry in him the slightest appearance of a deranged
               mind.’</span></li>

               Trinity College, Cambridge (BA 1786) and Lincoln’s Inn (called to the Bar 1789). He
               visited Paris in 1792 and on his return to England moved in a circle of metropolitan
               and Cambridge-based radicals and reformers that included George Dyer, William Godwin,
               John Horne Tooke (1736-1812; <em>DNB</em>), John Tweddell (1769-1799; <em>DNB</em>), Felix Vaughan (dates unknown), and William Wordsworth. In 1795–1796, ill health
               forced his relocation to Bath, where he moved in the same circles as Southey. Losh
               was amongst the first readers of the manuscript of the first complete version of <em>Madoc</em> and had literary ambitions of his own, publishing an edition of Milton’s <em>Areopagitica</em> (1791) and a translation of Benjamin Constant’s <em>Observations on the Strength of the Present Government in France</em> (1797). He married Cecilia Baldwin in February 1798 and moved permanently to Newcastle
               at the end of the same year. In later life he was a successful lawyer, businessman
               and local politician.</span></li>

               1803) (about whose name there is some confusion – it is recorded variously as Robert
               and Joseph), and numerous children. His first marriage to Edith Bourne (1741–1781)
               had produced at least two sons, Joseph and Robert, and two daughters, whose names
               are not known. Mr Lovell also had a substantial family by a second marriage. Southey
               was on reasonable terms with all the Lovells, but their relationship was clouded by
               struggles over adequate financial provision for the son and widow of Robert Lovell.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e1087"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="LovellMary">Lovell, Mary (née Fricker; 1771–1862):</span> <span class="gloss">Southey’s sister-in-law. The second surviving child of Stephen Fricker and Martha
               Rowles. In the early 1790s she worked as an actress in Bath and Bristol theatres.
               She married Robert Lovell in January 1794, in spite of the disapproval of his family.
               Their son, also called Robert, was born in 1795. After Lovell’s death in 1796, Southey
               tried to persuade his family to provide for his widow and child. He was only partially
               successful. The Lovells gave Robert Lovell Junior the occasional gift (for example,
               £20 in 1802) and made some contribution to the boy’s early education, but they did
               not provide consistent, long-term support. As a result, Mary and her son were dependent
               upon Southey. They lived with or near to the Southeys for the rest of the 1790s and
               early 1800s and in 1803 accompanied them to their new home, Greta Hall. Mary remained
               with the Southeys after her son’s apprenticeship to a London printer. She finally
               moved out when the house was given up after Southey’s death in 1843. She spent her
               final years living with Kate, Southey’s unmarried daughter, and died on 10 August
               1862. She was buried in the Southey grave in Crosthwaite churchyard, on the outskirts
               of Keswick.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e1097"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="LovellRobert">Lovell, Robert (1771–1796; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">poet. Born in Bristol, the son of a wealthy Quaker manufacturer (initially of cabinets
               and later of pins), and his first wife Edith Bourne, a Quaker minister. Lovell possibly
               entered the manufacturing business (on his death he was described as a pin manufacturer)
               but was ill at ease in the commercial world. In 1794 he married Mary Fricker. His
               family disapproved of the match because she was not a Quaker and had worked as an
               actress. Their son, also named Robert, was born in 1795. Lovell died at Bristol on
               3 May 1796 of a fever contracted on a trip to Salisbury and exacerbated by refusing
               to take medical advice before returning home. One of his final letters to his wife
               is in the Huntington Library, San Marino, another in Bristol Reference Library. Lovell’s
               father was reluctant to provide regular financial support for Mary Lovell and her
               child and both became part of Southey’s extended household. Lovell and Southey were
               introduced by Sarah Fricker in Bristol in late 1793. Lovell was also a poet, his <em>Bristol: A Satire</em> appeared in 1794, and he and Southey embarked on a period of collaboration: planning
               two co-authored collections, only one of which was published under the pseudonyms
               ‘Bion’ [Southey] and ‘Moschus’ [Lovell] in late 1794. Lovell was also involved in
               the 1794 revisions to Southey’s <em>Joan of Arc</em>. The advent of Coleridge in summer–autumn 1794 seems to have led (at least temporarily)
               to a reorientation of literary relationships. Lovell was pushed to the margins. His
               contribution to <em>The Fall of Robespierre</em> was dropped and Coleridge was openly critical of his poetry. Lovell was, however,
               involved in Pantisocracy and it was through him that Southey and Coleridge were introduced
               to Joseph Cottle. After Lovell’s death, Southey tried – and failed – to produce a
               subscription edition of his poems, to raise money for his widow and child. However,
               Lovell’s writings were included in the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799 and 1800) and <em>Specimens of the Later English poets</em> (1807). In a notice published in <em>Literary Memoirs of Living Authors of Great Britain</em> (1798), David Rivers described Lovell’s poetry as being ‘entitled to considerable
               distinction’. Southey described receiving the news of Lovell’s death as ‘the most
               sudden check I ever experienced’. The full extent of their relationship is difficult
               to gauge because of the survival of only two letters from what must have been an extensive
               correspondence.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e1121"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="LovellRobertJr">Lovell, Robert, Junior (1795-1841):</span> <span class="gloss">The son of Mary and Robert Lovell, his father’s early death left him with few prospects
               (significantly less than those of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s children, whose paternal
               relations were capable of greater generosity). In 1803 the money paid by the Lovell
               family for his education ceased. Southey and John May tried to get Robert Lovell Junior
               into Christ’s Hospital. They failed. The boy was apprenticed to a London printer and
               effectively separated from his mother, who lived with the Southeys in Keswick. The
               impact of this on his character seems to have been profound. In 1836 his first cousin
               Sara Coleridge described his lack of social skills: ‘From nine years old he has had
               to shift and scramble a good deal for himself, to bear up against a hard world which
               would have crushed &lt;or injured&gt; the frame it did not render to a certain degree tough
               &amp; unyielding ... [he] never had the opportunity of acquiring a taste for domestic,
               scarcely even for social enjoyment: we ought not to wonder that he is deficient in
               many qualities which can only be fostered thereby.’ Robert Lovell Junior predeceased
               his mother. He disappeared whilst on a European walking tour in 1841.</span></li>

               He was a foundation member of the Unitarian Society in 1791 and in 1792 was elected
               evening preacher at the chapel at Hackney in which Joseph Priestly preached in the
               mornings. In 1794 he married Priscilla Hurry, daughter of a Yarmouth timber merchant.
               They had ten children, of whom the fifth was the theologian Frederick Denison Maurice
               (1805–1872; <em>DNB</em>). Maurice was distantly connected by marriage to William Taylor. The latter was involved

               friends. May went to Lisbon in 1793, in order to learn the family trade, returning
               to England in 1796. May married Susannah Frances Livius in 1799. The marriage produced
               four children. May and Southey met in Portugal in 1796. Their friendship was to last
               until the latter’s death. May acted as a financial adviser and agent to Southey, lending
               him money – including sums to finance Henry Herbert Southey’s education – and purchasing
               goods on his behalf. Southey reciprocated when May experienced a severe financial
               crisis in 1821 by lending him his life savings of £620. May visited the Southeys on
               several occasions and acted as godfather to Southey’s two eldest children – Margaret
               Edith (1802–1803) and Edith May (1803–1871), the latter named in his honour. <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</em> (1816) was dedicated to him ‘in testimony of the highest esteem and affection’.</span></li>

               <em>Madoc</em>.</span></li>

               Rees (1777-1864; <em>DNB</em>), Unitarian minister and writer on theological history. Owen Rees migrated to Bristol
               where he became a bookseller. He later moved to London and in 1797 was taken into
               partnership by the publisher Thomas Norton Longman. From 1799 Longman and Rees became
               Southey’s main publishers. Rees retired from the business in early 1837.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e1370"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="RickmanJohn">Rickman, John (1771–1840; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">statistician. Only son of Thomas Rickman, vicar of Newburn, Northumberland. Educated
               at Guildford Grammar School (1781–1785) and Oxford (matric. Magdalen Hall, 1788, and
               migrated to Lincoln College, BA 1792). After graduation he joined his father, who
               had retired to live in Christchurch, Hampshire. Rickman worked as a private tutor
               and read widely in economics. He edited the <em>Commercial, Agricultural and Manufacturer’s Magazine</em> (until 1801). In 1796 he wrote a private paper in which he argued for the benefits
               to the nation of a census. George Rose, MP for Christchurch, showed this to the politician
               Charles Abbot (1757-1829; <em>DNB</em>) and in March 1801 the latter steered the census bill into law. Rickman was responsible
               for the first four censuses (1801, 1811, 1821 and 1831) and paved the way for the
               fifth (1841). In 1801 he became Abbot’s personal secretary whilst the latter was Chief
               Secretary for Ireland. On Abbot’s election to the post of Speaker of the House of
               Commons, Rickman became the Speaker’s secretary. In 1820 he became Clerk Assistant
               to the Commons with a salary of £2500 per year. He married Susannah Postlethwaite
               (d. 1836) in 1805. Rickman’s friendship with Southey began at Burton in 1797 and endured
               for the rest of their lives. Shortly after their first meeting, Southey described
               him as ‘rough, coarse, well informed on all subjects, believing nothing, jacobinical’.
               Later in life Rickman became high Tory, anti-Malthusian and anti-semitic. He regularly
               provided ideas and information (especially statistics) for Southey’s articles in the
               <em>Quarterly Review</em> and authored the majority of Southey’s April 1818 <em>Quarterly</em> essay on the Poor Laws. Southey and Rickman planned to collaborate on a sequel to
               the <em>Colloquies</em> (1829) but this was prevented by John Murray’s (1778-1843; <em>DNB</em>) financial problems.</span></li>

               (1778–c. 1820), an illegitimate daughter of John Wilkes (1725–1797; <em>DNB</em>). He served in the judiciary in Demerara and Essequibo and later Ceylon and was knighted
               in 1837. His literary works included <em>Lorenzo di Medici</em> (1797), <em>The Conspiracy of Gowrie</em> (1800), and <em>Lines on the Death of Sir Ralph Abercromby</em> (1800). He was also a contributor to the <em>Gentleman’s Magazine</em> and the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>. Rough and Southey were friends whilst at Westminster School and remained in contact

In 1807, she married the Rev. James Bannister, Rector of Iddesleigh. Her date of
               death is unknown, but she is said to have been living in Honiton, Devon in 1838. Seton
               met Southey during his second visit to Portugal in 1800-1801, and corresponded with

               Southey’s close friend Edmund Seward in 1795 was followed by that of his brother John
               (educated at St John’s College, Cambridge, MB 1795, and physician to the Worcester
               infirmary) in December 1797. Some time afterwards, the eldest brother, William (a
               lawyer, based in Ledbury, Herefordshire) shot himself. A fourth brother, whose name
               Southey does not record, was a ‘mere farmer’ of a ‘methodistical turn’. Of the sisters,
               one married Mr Severn (a clergyman) and two remained unmarried. In the mid 1790s,
               Southey was on good terms with most – if not all – of the siblings and corresponded
               with at least Edmund and one of the Seward sisters.</span></li>

               Oxford (matric. 1789, BA 1793). Seward was one of Southey’s closest friends at Oxford,
               and an important influence on him. An early enthusiast for Pantisocracy, Seward later
               withdrew from the scheme and felt himself partly to blame for what he described as
               ‘having contrived to bring [Southey] ... into ... a calamitous &amp; ruinous ... adventure,
               from which I might at first perhaps have diverted him’. Southey was deeply shocked
               by Seward’s death from a ‘fever’, and later addressed his elegy ‘To the Dead Friend’
               to him. In a letter to James Montgomery, 6 May 1811, Southey recalled him as ‘an admirable
               man in all things, whose only fault was that he was too humble ... In his company
               my religious instincts were strengthened ... Sick of the college-chapel &amp; of the church,
               we tried the meeting house, – &amp; there we were disgusted too. Seward left College,
               meaning to take orders; – I who had the same destination, became a Deist after he

               and Sharp took over his grandfather’s hat-making business, later moving into the West

               MP for Castle Rising 1806-1812 and Portarlington 1816-1819. Sharp’s only major publication
               was the anonymous <em>Letters and Essays in Poetry and Prose</em> (1834), but he was a friend and adviser to many literary men. He encouraged Southey

               interests. He was born in Cirencester, and later owned estates at Bownham House, near
               Minchinhampton , Gloucestshire and at Easton Grey, near Malmesbury, Wiltshire. He
               trained as a barrister but a speech impediment meant that he never practiced. He was
               known as the ‘Macenas of his neighbourhood’ for his patronage of men of letters and
               his philanthropy. He had a wide circle of friends in public life, including the economist
               David Ricardo (1772-1823; <em>DNB</em>) and John Whishaw (c. 1764-1840), ‘the Pope of Holland House’. Smith was married
               to Elizabeth Chandler, a fellow Unitarian. She was a noted collector of autographs
               and books. They had at least one child, a daughter, who was painted by James Northcote
               (1746-1831; <em>DNB</em>) in 1803. Southey was on very good terms with the Smiths, whom he probably knew through
               Charles Danvers. Southey visited them at Bownham in 1803, where he made use of their
               extensive library. He also sought out new items for Elizabeth Smith’s autograph collection.
               These included a MS of Coleridge’s then unpublished ‘Kubla Khan’, now BL Add MS 50847,
               sent by Southey in February 1804. In turn, Thomas Smith subscribed to the Southey-Cottle
               edition of Thomas Chatterton (1752-1770; <em>DNB</em>) and lent Southey books.</span></li>

               Southey and Edith met as children in Bristol. They married in secret on 14 November
               1795 at St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol. As her sister Sarah later explained, Southey ‘left
               ... [Edith] at the Church door’ and the following day departed for Spain and Portugal.
               Edith spent the early days of her marriage living with the Cottle sisters and using
               her maiden name, only reverting to ‘Southey’ when the secret became public in early
               1796. Recent biographers of Southey have questioned the state of his marriage, particularly
               given his lively – even flirtatious – friendships with Mary Barker and Caroline Bowles,
               who became his second wife in 1839. Compared to these other women, or to her sister
               Sarah, Edith is a relatively shadowy figure, plagued by physical and mental illness.
               The deaths of four of her eight children, in particular that of her daughter Isabel
               in 1826, hastened her decline. She suffered a complete collapse in 1834 and was taken
               to The Retreat, the pioneering, Quaker-run asylum in York, where she was diagnosed
               as of ‘unsound mind’ and treated with ‘purgatives, remedies, [and] leeches’. She was
               released in 1835 ‘as admitted’ – that is, uncured and incurable. Edith spent her final
               years at her home, Greta Hall, where she was cared for by Southey and her daughters
               Bertha and Kate. Southey described her death as a release from ‘a pitiable state of

               to send him to St Paul’s School did not work out. It is not certain where he was educated.
               Southey despaired, noting ‘I never saw a lad with a better capacity or with habits
               more compleatly bad’. Edward was to lead an increasingly rackety, disreputable life,
               trying his hand at being a sailor, soldier and, eventually, a provincial actor.</span></li>

               Robert Southey Senior, thus ensuring the latter’s imprisonment for debt in 1792, or
               his nephews, to whom he left nothing in his Will. Southey visited his uncle in 1802,
               describing his miserly existence to John May. In 1806, he recorded that his uncle

               After the bankruptcy and death of her husband in 1792, Margaret moved to Bath, running
               a boarding house in Westgate Buildings. Her continued financial difficulties – possibly
               exacerbated by the extravagance of her half-sister – caused Southey great anxiety.

               closest. Tom entered the navy as a midshipman at the age of 12, saw action in several
               major battles of the French revolutionary wars (including Cape St Vincent and Copenhagen),
               was captured on one occasion, wounded on several others, and was made a lieutenant
               as reward for his bravery in the fight between <span class="ital">Mars</span> and <span class="ital">L’Hercule</span> on 21 April 1798. He made Captain in 1811, but never commanded a ship. After he retired
               from the navy, he tried his hand at farming and as a customs officer. His last posting
               was at Demerara, British Guiana, and he died on shipboard on the return voyage to
               England. He married Sarah Castle in 1810 and produced a large family. Tom’s lack of
               financial stability meant that some of the burden of supporting him fell on his brothers
               Robert and Henry Herbert Southey. Tom’s knowledge of the navy and seafaring, and his
               observations of foreign climes, provided important information for many of Southey’s
               writings, including his poetry and <em>The Life of Nelson</em> (1813). Tom’s only publication was <em>A Chronological History of the West Indies</em> (1828), written with his brother Robert’s encouragement.</span></li>

               venture. Though he sold the <em>Morning Post</em> in 1803, he retained an interest in the <em>Courier</em>, which he acquired in 1800-1801, though it is disputed how much influence he had
               over the newspaper’s contents. Stuart employed Southey to write poems for the <em>Morning Post</em> at a guinea a week in 1798-1799, and again in 1801-1803. This ‘laureateship’ was

               into school rules and rituals) at Westminster School. During their schooldays, Strachey
               (perhaps in response to the scandal surrounding <em>The Flagellant</em>) was one of many acquaintances who treated Southey ‘like a scabby sheep’, dropping
               him. They were later only partially reconciled, but enough for Southey to commemorate
               Strachey’s departure for India in 1798 with a sonnet (‘Fair be thy fortunes in the
               distant land’) published in the <em>Morning Post</em>. Southey attempted to maintain their correspondence, but it had lapsed by April 1805
               when he confessed that as Strachey had not replied to his letters, he would ‘not ...
               write to him again, nor in any way force myself upon him.’</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e1654"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="TaylorWilliam">Taylor, William (1765–1836; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">reviewer and translator. Born in Norwich, the only child of William and Sarah Taylor.
               Taylor’s interest in German culture culminated in his <em>Historic Survey of German Poetry</em> (1828–1830). He was also a prolific contributor to the <em>Annual Review, The Athenaeum, Monthly Magazine</em>, and <em>Monthly Review</em>. Southey and Taylor met in 1798, whilst the former was on a visit to Great Yarmouth,
               where his brother Henry Herbert Southey was being tutored by George Burnett. Taylor
               introduced Southey to his great friend Frank Sayers (1763–1817; <em>DNB</em>) – whose 1792 collection <em>Poems</em> had influenced Southey’s early work – and also to radical and dissenting circles
               in Norwich. Taylor gave Southey the idea for the <em>Annual Anthology</em> and was an acute, if frequently blunt, critic of his work. From 1803–1804, he edited
               the Norwich newspaper <em>The Iris</em>, to which Southey contributed poetry. Southey described Taylor as ‘one of the three
               great men of my acquaintance ... the more I know him and the longer I know him, the
               more do I admire his knowledge and love his moral character.’</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e1681"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas, William Bowyer (d. 1802):</span> <span class="gloss">a native of Hereford, Thomas was the business agent for Herbert Hill, Southey’s uncle.
               His job also involved him in the tangled finances of Elizabeth Tyler, Hill’s half-sister
               and Southey’s aunt. Thomas met Southey during the latter’s 1795–1796 visit to Portugal.
               Southey stayed with him in Hereford in 1798 and through Thomas gained access to the
               cathedral library. In 1800 Thomas married a cousin, a woman Southey greatly admired.
               Thomas died suddenly in 1802.</span></li>

               of Herbert Hill’s business affairs.</span></li>
         <li class="item" id="d31e1699"><br/><span style="font-weight:bold" id="TylerElizabeth">Tyler, Elizabeth (1739–1821):</span> <span class="gloss">the older, unmarried half-sister of Southey’s mother. She had spent her early life
               looking after an elderly relative and on his death received an inheritance which she
               then spent on living the high life. Her extravagance was a source of great concern
               to her relatives, in particular her half-brother Herbert Hill. Elizabeth Tyler was
               painted by Joshua Reynolds and moved in cultural circles in Bath and Bristol, counting
               amongst her friends the Palmers, owners of the Theatre Royal, Bath. Southey was largely
               brought up in her household, an experience he later described in a series of autobiographical
               letters to John May. Southey quarrelled with his aunt over his relationship with Edith
               Fricker and involvement in Pantisocracy, and on a wet night in 1794 she threw him
               out. They never saw or spoke to one another again. Southey later speculated that Elizabeth
               Tyler, whose grandmother had died ‘in confinement’, suffered from a form of insanity,
               noting that ‘her habitual violence of temper is now increased by long indulgence absolutely
               to a state of derangement’.</span></li>

               former post on his marriage and the latter on his conversion to Unitarianism. Thereafter
               he was a teacher (at Warrington Dissenting Academy 1779-1783) and a professional writer,
               mainly on classical, religious and political topics. He was one of the Pitt government’s
               fiercest critics and was imprisoned for two years in Dorchester gaol for his <em>A Reply to Some Parts of the Bishop of Landaff’s Address</em> (1798). Southey visited him in prison.</span></li>

               of Woman’ (published in his <em>Poems</em> (1797)) to her. They met in London in 1797, where they moved in the same radical
               circles. Southey mourned her death in his 1797 poem ‘To A. S. Cottle’.</span></li>

               wife Charlotte Grenville. He was educated at home by a tutor, the Rev. Robert Nares,
               and later at Westminster (adm. 1784) and Christ Church, Oxford (matric. 1791, BA 1795,
