                     and lecturer on chemistry and mineralogy and from 1803-1808 the editor of the <em>Annual Review</em>, the journal for which Southey wrote before he became a regular contributor to the
                     <em>Quarterly Review</em>.</span></li>

                     and Aikin moved in the same circles in London. Aikin was a regular contributor to
                     periodicals and his review of <em>Joan of Arc</em> appeared in the <em>Analytical Review</em> in 1796. In 1797 Aikin and his son, Arthur Aikin, translated the first volume of
                     Necker’s <em>On the French Revolution</em>. Southey translated the second. In the mid-1790s, Southey (using a variety of pseudonyms)
                     corresponded with Aikin in the latter’s capacity as literary editor of the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e322"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="AllenRobert">Allen, Robert (1772–1805):</span> <span class="gloss">surgeon and journalist. Educated at Christ’s Hospital (where he was a contemporary
                     of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Lamb) and University College, Oxford (BA 1796,
                     MA 1803, MB and MD 1803). He first met Southey, who was flirting with a career in
                     medicine, at the Anatomy School in Oxford in early 1794. They became firm friends,
                     Southey later describing how in 1794 Allen had been his ‘bosom-companion’ and had
                     ‘rendered many hours delightful which would otherwise have passed in the destructive
                     daydreams of solitude’. Allen wrote poetry and, in Oxford in June 1794, introduced
                     Southey to Coleridge. In 1794–1795, Allen was possibly a convert to Pantisocracy.
                     In 1796, he enrolled at the Westminster Hospital and married a wealthy widow, Catherine,
                     daughter of Nathaniel Forster (1726–1790; <em>DNB</em>). She died within a year. In 1797, with the encouragement of Anthony Carlisle, he
                     became deputy surgeon with England’s Second Royals, then stationed in Portugal. He
                     was back in Britain by 1802 and from 1803 until his death worked as a journalist,
                     writing for (according to Charles Lamb) the London newspapers the <em>Oracle</em>, <em>True Briton</em>, <em>Star</em> and <em>Traveller</em>.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e346"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BarbauldAnnaLetitia">Barbauld, Anna Letitia (née Aikin; 1743-1825; DNB):</span> <span class="gloss">poet, essayist and children’s author, sister of John Aikin and aunt of Arthur Aikin,
                     Southey’s editor at the <em>Annual Review</em>. She married the Revd Rochemont Barbauld (1749-1808) on 26 May 1774. Barbauld and
                     Southey met in 1797 and had many acquaintances in common, including George Dyer, William
                     Godwin and Joseph Johnson. Barbauld was publicly linked with the literary and scientific
                     experimentalism of Southey’s circle, and featured in the <em>Anti-Jacobin</em> satire ‘The Pneumatic Revellers’ (1800). She and Southey both contributed to the
                     <em>Monthly Magazine</em> and the <em>Annual Review</em> and occasionally socialised, in particular during Southey’s time in London in 1801-1802.
                     However, his attitude to her was ambivalent. He agreed with her advice to Coleridge
                     (whom Barbauld admired and promoted) not to lose himself in ‘the maze of metaphysic
                     lore’, but condemned the verses in which she articulated this as ‘trite’. He also
                     punned on her surname, calling her ‘Bare-bald’ because he attributed to her a hostile
                     review of Charles Lamb’s play <em>John Woodvil; a Tragedy</em> (1802) in the <em>Annual Review for 1802</em>, 1 (1803), 688-692.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e368"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BarkerMary">Barker, Mary (c. 1780-1853):</span> <span class="gloss">author, painter and close friend of Robert Southey. Born in Congreve, Staffordshire,
                     daughter of Thomas Barker, an ironmaster, and Mary Homfray. Author of <em>A Welsh Story</em> (1798), she moved in literary circles. She met Southey in Portugal in 1800 and subsequently
                     visited the Southeys frequently in Bristol, London and Keswick. Godmother of Southey’s
                     first child, Margaret (d. 1803). Southey had a high opinion of Mary Barker’s talents
                     and proposed that she should illustrate <em>Madoc</em> (1805). She appears as the ‘Bhow Begum’ in <em>The Doctor</em> (1834-1847). Mary Barker lived at Greta Lodge in Keswick, next to Greta Hall, between
                     1812 and 1817, becoming a close friend of the Coleridges and Wordsworths, as well
                     as the Southeys, and teaching music to the girls of the families. Financial difficulties
                     forced her to move to Boulogne in 1819 and she never returned to England. Southey
                     met her for the last time on his trip to France in 1825. In 1830 she married a Mr
                     Slade, who was much younger than her and thought to be a ‘mere adventurer’ by her
                     Keswick friends.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e384"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BarnesFrederick">Barnes, Frederick ‘Ginger’ (1771–1859):</span> <span class="gloss">clergyman. A friend of Southey’s during his time at Westminster School and Oxford.
                     In later life, Barnes held several livings in Devonshire.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e393"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BeaumontSirGeorge">Beaumont, Sir George Howland, 7th Baronet (1753-1827; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">art patron, landscape painter, coal mine owner. He was a friend and patron of Wordsworth,
                     Coleridge, Southey, Constable and Scott, inviting them to his estate at Coleorton,
                     Leicestershire. Sir George was an enthusiastic amateur painter and owner of many Italian
                     landscapes. Southey first met Beaumont in the Lakes in 1803 and corresponded with
                     him and his wife.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e404"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BeaumontLadyMary">Beaumont, Margaret, Lady (née Willes; 1756-1829):</span> <span class="gloss">married Sir George Beaumont on 6 May 1778 and accompanied him on his tours of Europe,
                     England and Wales. She was on friendly terms with Southey and her husband’s other

               <li class="item" id="d31e413"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BeddoesThomas">Beddoes, Thomas (1760–1808; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">chemist and physician. Born at Shifnal, Shropshire, son of Richard Beddoes and Ann
                     Whitehall. Educated at Bridgnorth Grammar School, by private tutor, and at Pembroke
                     College, Oxford (matric. 1776, BA 1779, MB and MD 1786), and Edinburgh. Reader in
                     Chemistry at Oxford from 1788. In the early 1790s, a growing reputation as a radical
                     led to his surveillance by Home Office spies and failure to gain the Regius Chair
                     in Chemistry. He left Oxford for Bristol in 1793 and married Anna Edgeworth (1772–1824),
                     sister of the novelist Maria (1768–1849; <em>DNB</em>), in the following year. Beddoes was involved in the political protest movements
                     of the mid-1790s and possibly first met Southey in 1795, during the latter’s immersion
                     in Bristol politics. In 1799, Beddoes opened the Pneumatic Institute (from 1802 the
                     Preventive Medical Institution for the Sick and Drooping Poor) in Hotwells, Bristol.
                     Southey participated in the experiments with gases carried out by Beddoes and Humphry
                     Davy, and recorded in <em>Notice of Some Observations Made at the Medical Pneumatic Institution</em> (1799). Beddoes was a prolific writer on medical, political and educational reform.
                     He was also a poet: author of <em>Alexander’s Expedition</em> (1792) and a contributor to Southey’s <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799). Southey respected Beddoes’s medical judgment, consulting him on more than
                     one occasion. In 1809 he recorded that ‘From Beddoes I hoped for more good to the
                     human race than from any other individual’. However, disagreements about poetry ensured
                     that their personal relationship was not warm. Southey dismissed Beddoes as a ‘hypercritic
                     of the Darwin school’ and was furious when his ‘Domiciliary Verses’ (a parody of Samuel
                     Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth and Southey) found its way into the first volume
                     of the <em>Annual Anthology</em>. Joseph Cottle, who was responsible for the poem’s inclusion, was ordered by Southey
                     not to solicit any further contributions from Beddoes.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e435"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="Bedfordfamily">Bedford family:</span> <span class="gloss">the Bedford family lived at Westminster and Brixton. The household consisted of the
                     parents, Charles (c. 1742-1814) and Mary Bedford, three sons (Grosvenor, Horace and
                     Harry) and a cousin, Mary Page. Southey was on good terms with the entire family.
                     He made use of the library in their Westminster home and wrote the first draft of
                     <em>Joan of Arc</em> during an extended stay at their house in Brixton in summer 1793. Southey corresponded
                     with Grosvenor and Horace.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e447"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford, Grosvenor Charles (1773–1839):</span> <span class="gloss">civil servant and miscellaneous writer. The son of Charles Bedford (Deputy Usher of
                     the Exchequer, as Horace Walpole’s substitute). Educated at Westminster School (adm.
                     1784), but did not attend university. Assistant clerk in the Exchequer Office, 1792–1803;
                     clerk of the cash book, 1803–1806; clerk of the registers and issues, 1806–1822; chief
                     clerk in the auditor’s office, 1822–1834. Admitted to Gray’s Inn, 26 January 1797.
                     Bedford did not marry, despite regularly seeking Southey’s advice on his love affairs.
                     Bedford and Southey met at Westminster School and their friendship endured for the
                     remainder of their lives. Bedford had literary inclinations. He was involved in the
                     ill-fated <em>Flagellant</em> (1792), contributed poems to the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (1797) and the first volume of the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799), and privately published his translation of Musaeus, <em>The Loves of Hero and Leander</em> (1797). He worked with Southey on <em>Specimens of the Later English Poets</em> (1807) and contributed an unsigned notice of Southey’s <em>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</em> (1814) to the <em>Quarterly Review</em>. His other publications included <em>A Letter to the Right Hon. William Pitt on his Political Experiments</em> (1804, anonymous) and a <em>Memoir</em> of Barré Charles Roberts (1814).</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e475"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BedfordHenry">Bedford, Henry (‘Harry’) (dates unknown):</span> <span class="gloss">the younger brother of Grosvenor and Horace Bedford.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e484"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BedfordHoraceWalpole">Bedford, Horace Walpole (c. 1776–1807):</span> <span class="gloss">civil servant and miscellaneous writer. The younger brother of Grosvenor Charles Bedford
                     and named after his father’s patron. He was educated at Westminster School (adm. 1784),
                     where his nickname was ‘the Doctor’ or ‘Dr. Johnson’. He did not attend university
                     and later held a post at the British Museum. Like his older brother, he did not marry.
                     Southey’s friendship with Horace began at school and their correspondence (though
                     occasionally intermittent) lasted until at least 1797. Southey’s relationship with
                     Horace was slightly different from that with Grosvenor Charles Bedford. He treated
                     Horace as a younger brother: encouraging him and worrying about his tendency to laziness.
                     He also fostered the younger man’s literary ambitions. Horace’s poems appeared in
                     the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (1797) and the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799).</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e497"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BiddlecombeCharles">Biddlecombe, Charles (dates unknown):</span> <span class="gloss">neighbour and friend. Biddlecombe met Southey in summer 1797 when the latter moved
                     to the village of Burton in Hampshire. Southey described him as ‘rich enough to buy
                     books, and very friendly, all that a neighbour should be’. Biddlecombe married in
                     1798, but his wife died in childbirth in March 1799, leaving him with an infant daughter.
                     During Southey’s numerous absences, Biddlecombe appears to have looked after the cottage
                     at Burton and when it was finally given up in 1802 arranged for a sale of part of
                     the furniture and stored some of Southey’s possessions, including books, for a number
                     of years. During his 1817 visit to France, Southey ran into Biddlecombe, whom he had
                     not seen for several years, and his invalid daughter, describing the latter as ‘short
                     and plethoric, with a countenance of prepossessing good nature’.</span></li>

                     Coleridge, Estlin and Southey, for congeries of publishers in London and the South-West
                     of England. In the mid-late 1790s, he entered into a business partnership with Joseph
                     Cottle, printing the Bristol edition of Coleridge and Wordsworth’s <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798), and the revised editions of 1800 and 1802.</span></li>

                     Thomas Chatterton (1752-1770; <em>DNB</em>).</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e532"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BunburyCharlesJohn">Bunbury, Charles John (1772–1798):</span> <span class="gloss">soldier. Educated at Westminster School, where he was a friend of Southey’s, and Trinity
                     College, Cambridge. In 1789, Bunbury presented Southey with a copy of Thomas Warton’s
                     <em>Poems</em> (3rd edn, 1779). Their friendship did not last. In 1793, Bunbury tried to avoid Southey
                     when the latter was visiting Cambridge. Southey, in turn, claimed that Bunbury’s ‘debauchery’
                     was the direct result of his public school education. Bunbury joined the army and
                     died at the Cape of Good Hope. Bunbury’s father, the artist Henry William Bunbury
                     (1750–1811; <em>DNB</em>), and his younger brother, Sir Henry Edward Bunbury (1778–1860; <em>DNB</em>), later became close friends of Southey’s and members of his circle in Keswick.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e547"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BurnettGeorge">Burnett, George (c. 1776–1811; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">writer. The son of John Burnett, a farmer, of Huntspill, Somerset. Educated at Balliol
                     College, Oxford (matric. 1793). His varied career included time spent as a student
                     at a dissenting academy in Manchester, pastor to a Unitarian congregation in Great
                     Yarmouth, medical student at the University of Edinburgh, assistant to John Rickman,
                     domestic tutor to the sons of Lord Stanhope, assistant surgeon to a militia regiment
                     and (in Poland) tutor to the family of Count Zamoyski. Burnett was also a professional
                     writer, whose works included <em>View of the Present State of Poland</em> (1807; from essays originally published in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>), <em>Specimens of English Prose Writers</em> (1807; a companion to George Ellis’s <em>Specimens of the Early English Poets</em>) and <em>Extracts from the Prose Works of Milton</em> (1809).</span> <span class="gloss">Southey met Burnett at Balliol and the two became friends. Burnett was one of the
                     originators of Pantisocracy and in true Pantisocratic spirit proposed to Martha Fricker,
                     who turned him down. In 1795, he shared lodgings with Southey and Coleridge in Bristol.
                     From 1797–1798, he was minister to a Unitarian congregation in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk,
                     where he also tutored Henry Herbert Southey. Burnett moved in metropolitan literary
                     circles and was friendly with Charles Lamb and John Rickman. His relationship with
                     Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge became deeply ambivalent — by 1803 he was accusing

In 1772 he sailed in the <span class="ital">Resolution</span> on James Cook’s (1728-1779; <em>DNB</em>) second voyage to the South Seas and on his return home in 1774 acted as an interpreter
                     for Omai, the first Tahitean to visit Britain. Burney sailed on Cook’s third voyage
                     and witnessed the latter’s death in 1779. He rose to the rank of Captain, but a reputation
                     for insubordination brought his active naval career to an end in 1784. In the 1790s,
                     Burney embarked on a second career as a writer, publishing an edition of William Bligh’s
                     (1754-1817; <em>DNB</em>) <em>A Voyage to the South Sea in HMS Bounty</em> (1792). His magnum opus was <em>A Chronological History of the Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean</em> (1803-1817). Southey and Burney shared an interest in travel writing and maritime
                     history. The two became good friends and corresponded over several years, socialising

                     and on his critical posterity. It began in Oxford in summer 1794 when Robert Allen
                     introduced Southey to a visitor from Cambridge — Coleridge. It was a fateful meeting,
                     leading to the failed scheme of Pantisocracy, literary collaboration, and — eventually
                     — mutual disenchantment. As Southey later recorded: ‘that meeting fixed the future
                     fortunes of us both ... Coleridge had at that time thought little of politics, in
                     morals he was as loose ... as men at a university usually are, but he was a Unitarian.
                     my morals were of the sternest Stoicism ... that same feeling which made me a poet

                     Married Jane Forman, by whom he had one son. Died c. 1806. Collins’s biography is
                     difficult to reconstruct as <em>Records of Old Westminsters</em> and <em>Alumni Oxoniensis</em> both confuse him with his son, also named Charles Collins, and give a later date
                     of death. A note, now in the Huntington Library, written by an eponymous descendant
                     confirms that he died young. In 1815, Southey referred to Collins’s widow and in 1828
                     described him as long dead. Southey met Collins at Westminster and later described
                     him as ‘one of my most intimate school and college friends’. However, by early 1794
                     their friendship had cooled and they seem to have had no contact with one another

                     fought a duel with the opposition MP, Henry Grattan (1746-1820; <em>DNB</em>), in 1800. He supported the British government’s policies of Union between Britain
                     and Ireland and Catholic Emancipation, but was still dismissed by the prime minister,
                     William Pitt (1759-1806; <em>DNB</em>) in 1804. Rickman secured Southey the post of Corry’s secretary in 1801-1802.</span></li>

                     1795, his wife Edith lived with the Cottle sisters for some of the time Southey was

                     (matric. 1795, BA 1799). He then embarked on a legal training. He spent the final

                     and died in his chambers at Clifford’s Inn. Author of <em>Icelandic Poetry, or, The Edda of Saemund, Translated into English verse</em> (1797; published by Joseph Cottle and with dedicatory poem by Southey). Several of
                     his other poems were collected posthumously in the fourth edition of Joseph Cottle,
                     <em>Malvern Hills, With Minor Poems and Essays</em> (1829). Southey probably met Amos Cottle through his younger brother Joseph. The
                     two shared an interest in Scandinavian literature and mythology and it was Southey
                     who encouraged Amos to produce a verse, rather than prose, translation of the <em>Edda</em> and who reviewed it in the <em>Critical Review</em>.</span></li>

                     in Felix Farley’s newspaper’, Joseph was in fact the second child of Robert and Sarah
                     Cottle. He was educated at the school run by Richard Henderson (1736/7–1792) at Hanham,
                     near Bristol. In 1791 he opened a shop as a printseller, stationer, binder and bookseller
                     in Bristol. Cottle abandoned bookselling in 1798 but continued publishing. Between
                     1791 and 1800, he sold, printed or published 114 works, in congeries with Joseph Johnson,
                     Benjamin Flower, H. D. Symons and others. In 1800 he began to sell his copyrights
                     to the London firm of Longman. A poet and prose writer, his works included: <em>Poems</em> (1795), <em>Malvern Hills</em> (1798; with a prefatory poem by Southey), <em>Alfred</em> (1800), <em>The Fall of Cambria</em> (1808), <em>Early Recollections, Chiefly Relating to the Late Samuel Taylor Coleridge, During
                        his Long Residence in Bristol</em> (1837) and <em>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</em> (1847).</span> <span class="gloss">Cottle and Southey were introduced by Robert Lovell in 1794. Although not wealthy,
                     Cottle provided generous financial help to Southey throughout the 1790s, even lending
                     him money for his wedding ring. He published <em>Joan of Arc</em> and the majority of Southey’s earliest works, including <em>Poems</em> (1797) and <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</em> (1797). His professional collaboration with Southey also included contributing poems
                     to the <em>Annual Anthology</em> and co-editing the works of their fellow Bristolian Thomas Chatterton (1752–1770;
                     <em>DNB</em>). What Cottle did not know, was that Southey viewed his poetry with a merriment that
                     verged on contempt. The two men met less frequently after Southey’s move to Keswick
                     in 1803, but maintained their correspondence. Southey’s final tour of the West Country
                     in 1836–1837 included a visit to Cottle in Bristol. After Southey’s death, Cottle
                     was a central figure in the successful campaign to erect a monument to his memory
                     in Bristol cathedral. He recorded his association with Southey for posterity in his
                     controversial <em>Reminiscences</em> (1847), itself a reworking of the equally contentious <em>Early Recollections</em> (1837).</span></li>

                     accompany the title. He practised as a barrister in London in the late 1770s, and
                     gained some reputation as a miscellaneous writer. Perennially short of money, Croft
                     changed direction and graduated from University College, Oxford in 1785 and was appointed
                     Vicar of Prittlewell in Essex and chaplain of the British garrison in Quebec. Most
                     of his time in the late 1780s and early 1790s was devoted to a new dictionary, but,
                     despite amassing 11,000 entries, he could not find enough subscribers to publish the
                     book and the project was abandoned in 1793. In 1795 Croft was arrested for debt and
                     fled to Hamburg, only returning to England in 1800-1802, after which he lived in France,
                     dying in Paris. In 1780 Croft had published <em>Love and Madness</em>, the story of James Hackman (c. 1752-1779; <em>DNB</em>), who had shot Martha Ray (1742?-1779; <em>DNB</em>), the lover of the Earl of Sandwich (1718-1792; <em>DNB</em>). The book contained a lengthy digression into the life of the Bristol poet Thomas
                     Chatterton (1752-1770; <em>DNB</em>). Southey published a letter in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> for November 1799, accusing Croft of obtaining some of Chatterton’s letters by deception
                     from the poet’s mother and sister, and refusing to pay them any share of his profits
                     from <em>Love and Madness</em>. Croft’s defence, to say the least, was evasive. In 1803 Southey and Joseph Cottle
                     published a new version of Chatterton’s works for the benefit of his sister and niece.</span></li>

                     related to the regicides Sir John Danvers (1584/5–1655; <em>DNB</em>) and General Thomas Harrison (c. 1616–60; <em>DNB</em>) and to the diarist Celia Fiennes (1662–1741; <em>DNB</em>). (Southey possessed a manuscript of Fiennes diary which he had been given by the
                     Danvers family and included unacknowledged excerpts from it in his and Coleridge’s
                     <em>Omniana</em> (1812)). Danvers’ father had ‘been a person of some property’, though the family’s
                     fortunes had since declined. Danvers seems to have had two brothers and two sisters.
                     He never married. A dissenter, he died in London ‘during a short tarriance there’
                     and was buried in Asplands Burial Ground, Hackney.</span> <span class="gloss">Danvers knew Southey from childhood. In 1797, their friendship flourished when Southey
                     and his wife lodged in a house in Kingsdown, next door to Danvers and his mother.
                     In 1799, Southey finished the fifteen book version of <em>Madoc</em> in Mrs Danvers’ ‘parlour on her little table’. When Southey went to Portugal in 1800–1,
                     he left a copy of his poetic magnum opus with Danvers and also delegated the task
                     of collecting materials for the third <em>Annual Anthology</em> to him and Davy. This volume did not appear. Danvers visited Southey at Keswick in
                     summer 1805 and kept a journal of his tour, now in the British Library, Add MS 30929.
                     Extracts from this were published in Kenneth Curry, ‘A note on Wordsworth’s “Fidelity”’,
                     <em>Philological Quarterly</em>, 32 (1953), 212–214.</span></li>

                     her death in the influenza epidemic of 1803, Southey described her as someone ‘whom

                     grammar schools and apprenticed to an apothecary-surgeon in Truro. Davy had wide interests
                     as a young man, writing poetry as well as conducting chemical experiments on the nature
                     of heat, light and acidity. In October 1798 he went to Bristol to work for Thomas
                     Beddoes at his Pneumatic Institution, which opened in March 1799. Davy soon became
                     friendly with Southey and Coleridge, and they both participated in his experiments
                     with nitrous oxide, or ‘laughing gas’. Southey published some of Davy’s early poems
                     in the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799) and (1800) and suggested Davy should write a poem on Mango Capac, the first
                     Inca, after Southey had failed in his plan to identify Madoc with the Inca ruler.
                     In January 1801 Davy moved to London to work at the Royal Institution, where he became
                     a Professor in 1802. After this time Southey saw much less of Davy. However, his work
                     on electricity was regarded as a brilliant contribution to Britain’s scientific reputation
                     and he was elected President of the Royal Society in 1820.</span></li>

                     entered Middle Temple 1810; graduated LLB Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1814. His publications
                     included: <em>A Brief Account of the Subversion of the Papal Government in 1798</em> (1799), <em>A Selection of Twelve Heads from the Last Judgment of Michael Angelo</em> (1801), <em>Memoirs of a Literary and Political Character</em> (1803), and <em>The Life and Literary Works of Michael Angelo Buonarotti, with His Poetry and Letters</em> (1806).

                     circle, he was at one time engaged to Mary Page, the cousin of Grosvenor Charles and
                     Horace Walpole Bedford. In the 1790s, Southey sought Duppa’s advice about projected
                     illustrated editions of his poems. Later, Duppa provided the material on art in Southey’s

                     London. Educated at Christ’s Hospital and Emmanuel College, Cambridge (BA 1778). From
                     the late 1780s to mid 1790s he was active in reformist causes, a member of the Constitutional
                     Society and author of <em>An Inquiry into the Nature of Subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles</em> (1789, 2nd revised edn 1792), <em>Complaints of the Poor People of England</em> (1793) and <em>A Dissertation on the Theory and Practice of Benevolence</em> (1795). After 1795, he abandoned active politics, turning instead to scholarship
                     and literature. He was a prolific poet whose works included, <em>Poems, Consisting of Odes and Elegies</em> (1792), <em>The Poet’s Fate</em> (1797), and <em>Poetics</em> (1812).</span> <span class="gloss">Dyer met Southey in c. 1794–1795, probably through Coleridge. He was enthusiastic
                     about Pantisocracy and encouraged the publication of <em>The Fall of Robespierre</em> (1794). He seems to have corresponded with Southey from the mid 1790s, but none of
                     these early letters survive, making it difficult to judge the actual extent of their
                     friendship. It is, however, fair to say, that this has probably been underestimated.
                     A handful of letters written by Southey to Dyer from later periods do exist. Dyer’s
                     close connections with Southey’s literary circle are evidenced in a letter sent to
                     him by Joseph Cottle, 22 April 1797 now in the Houghton Library (Autograph File: Cottle,

                     Vincent, the Head Master of Westminster School, the Egertons revealed that Southey
                     was its author. Southey was expelled and the Egertons’ involvement with <em>The Flagellant</em> ceased. The remaining four issues, 5–26 April 1792, were printed by the Pall-Mall

                     to hold the living until 1816. He made a brief move to Edinburgh, where he met the
                     founders of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, to which he became a contributor. He returned to London and in 1807 moved to Kent,
                     where he lived with his mother until 1816. During this time he produced editions of
                     Aristophanes, Sophocles and Euripides and a number of learned papers on classical
                     subjects, published in the <em>Quarterly Review</em> and other periodicals. He travelled at length in Europe c. 1816–1818 and settled
                     in Oxford in 1818. In 1823 (having been unsuccessfully proposed for the Regius Chair

                     Southey and Edith met as children in Bristol. They married in secret on 14 November
                     1795 at St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol. As her sister Sarah later explained, Southey ‘left
                     ... [Edith] at the Church door’ and the following day departed for Spain and Portugal.
                     Edith spent the early days of her marriage living with the Cottle sisters and using

                     1796. Recent biographers of Southey have questioned the state of his marriage, particularly
                     given his lively — even flirtatious — friendships with Mary Barker and Caroline Bowles,
                     who became his second wife in 1839. Compared to these other women, or to her sister
                     Sarah, Edith is a relatively shadowy figure, plagued by physical and mental illness.
                     The deaths of four of her eight children, in particular that of her daughter Isabel
                     in 1826, hastened her decline. She suffered a complete collapse in 1834 and was taken
                     to The Retreat, the pioneering, Quaker-run asylum in York, where she was diagnosed
                     as of ‘unsound mind’ and treated with ‘purgatives, remedies, [and] leeches’. She was
                     released in 1835 ‘as admitted’ — that is, uncured and incurable. Edith spent her final
                     years at her home, Greta Hall, where she was cared for by Southey and her daughters

                     The family home was sold, Mrs Fricker moved into lodgings in Bristol and opened a
                     dame school, and her three eldest daughters became seamstresses, whose clients included
                     Southey’s mother and aunt, Elizabeth Tyler. Southey knew the Frickers from childhood
                     and was ‘partly educated’ with the three eldest girls. The similarity between their
                     situation and his own (Southey’s father was also a bankrupt) was perhaps an important
                     factor in what was to be a lifelong relationship.</span></li>

                     in 1804. Though Southey respected George’s good qualities, he was frustrated by his

                     She married Robert Lovell in January 1794, in spite of the disapproval of his family.
                     Their son, also called Robert, was born in 1795. After Lovell’s death in 1796, Southey
                     tried to persuade his family to provide for his widow and child. He was only partially
                     successful. The Lovells gave Robert Lovell Junior the occasional gift (for example,
                     £20 in 1802) and made some contribution to the boy’s early education, but they did
                     not provide consistent, long-term support. As a result, Mary and her son were dependent
                     upon Southey. They lived with or near to the Southeys for the rest of the 1790s and
                     early 1800s and in 1803 accompanied them to their new home, Greta Hall. Mary remained
                     with the Southeys after her son’s apprenticeship to a London printer. She finally
                     moved out when the house was given up after Southey’s death in 1843. She spent her
                     final years living with Kate, Southey’s unmarried daughter, and died on 10 August
                     1862. She was buried in the Southey grave in Crosthwaite churchyard, on the outskirts
                     of Keswick.</span></li>

                     1795. Her relationship with Southey, who provided her with advice and support during
                     her later marital difficulties, was affectionate, and at times jokey and rumbustious.
                     Indeed, Sarah’s daughter and namesake recorded that Southey had been romantically

                     to be a contributor. Gifford continued as editor until 1824, frequently the target
                     of Southey’s ire over the cuts and interpolations he made to Southey’s contributions.
                     In earlier life a shoemaker, Gifford was the author of two powerful verse satires,

                     mental collapse and was placed in an asylum run by Richard Henderson (1736/7–1792)
                     at Hanham near Bristol. (In an earlier career as a schoolmaster, Henderson had numbered
                     Joseph Cottle among his pupils.) Gilbert was released after a year and went to London,
                     where he worked as an astrologer and maker of magic talismans. In 1795 he went to
                     Bristol, where he became friends with Southey and Coleridge. In 1796 he published
                     <em>The Hurricane: a Theosophical and Western Eclogue</em>. He disappeared in 1798. It was thought he had left Bristol in search of the ‘Gilberti’,
                     an African tribe with whom he believed he had a spiritual affinity. Southey made enquiries
                     after him, but to no effect. Although by 1820 Southey spoke of Gilbert as long dead,
                     he was in fact probably still alive, dying c. 1825.</span></li>

This propelled her into the circle of radicals around the publisher Joseph
                     Johnson (1738-1809; <em>DNB</em>). Hays’s <em>Memoirs of Emma Courtney</em> (1796) gained her some notoriety, as it was a thinly-disguised version of her relationship
                     with the radical William Frend (1757-1841; <em>DNB</em>). She was caricatured in, among other places, Charles Lloyd’s <em>Edmund Oliver</em> (1798), but her main claim to posthumous fame has been her feminist writings, especially
                     <em>An Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in Behalf of Women</em> (1798). Southey met Hays in London in 1797 and corresponded with her in the early

                     relationship was, though, to be conducted largely in the public sphere, via the medium
                     of newspapers and reviews. The catalyst for so public a relationship was undoubtedly
                     Southey’s appointment as Poet Laureate in September 1813. Over the next decade or
                     so Hazlitt produced a series of reviews and essays devoted to Southey and his works.
                     His observations on the new Poet Laureate appeared in the <em>Morning Chronicle</em> on 18 and 20 September 1813, followed by his appraisal of the Laureate’s first ‘official’
                     publication (the ode <em>Carmen Triumphale</em>) in the pages of the same newspaper on 8 January 1814. His critique was continued
                     in the review of <em>The Lay of the Laureate</em>, gained new ferocity in pages of the <em>Examiner</em> during the 1817 controversy over the illicit publication of Southey’s <em>Wat Tyler</em>, continued in the <em>Lectures on the English Poets</em> (1818-19) and culminated in the pen-portrait of Southey in <em>The Spirit of the Age</em> (1825).</span></li>

                     his main interest was his book collection, which finally totalled over 100,000 volumes
                     housed in eight different locations. Though he concentrated on early English poetry
                     and drama his library included classical works and a wide selection of European and
                     Latin American literature. Heber was exceptionally generous in lending his books,
                     and let Southey use his copy of <em>Amadis of Gaul</em>. Heber was MP for Oxford University 1821-1825, but resigned and spent several years
                     on the continent after rumours of a homosexual relationship began to circulate. However,

                     it was in his power’) and on extremely bad terms with his older half-brother. Hill
                     was educated at Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1772, MA 1774). From 1792–1807, he was chaplain
                     to the British factory at Lisbon. On his return to England, Hill took up a living
                     at Staunton-Upon-Wye, remaining there until 1810 when the Duke of Bedford presented
                     him to a living in Streatham. In 1808 Hill married a woman twenty-five years his junior,
                     Catherine Bigg (b. c. 1775), a friend of Jane Austen (1775–1817; <em>DNB</em>). The marriage produced six surviving children, all of whom were on good terms with
                     Southey and his family. Hill’s son and namesake, Herbert Hill Junior (1810–1892),
                     married Southey’s daughter Bertha in 1839.</span> <span class="gloss">Hill took a paternal interest in his nephews, and helped finance Southey’s education.
                     Hill’s concern about Southey’s refusal to take the path mapped out for him (a path
                     leading to ordination), his relationship with Edith Fricker, and his politics, led
                     him to visit England in 1795. He returned to Portugal with Southey in tow. Oblivious
                     to the fact that his nephew had married Edith the day before their departure, Hill
                     used every opportunity to introduce Southey to more suitable women. Nevertheless,
                     the time Southey spent with his uncle in 1795–1796 greatly strengthened their relationship,
                     which remained close until Hill’s death in 1828. Hill encouraged his nephew’s interests
                     in Spanish and Portuguese history and literature, and later bought books and manuscripts
                     on his behalf. Southey dedicated his <em>Colloquies</em> (1829) to his uncle.</span></li>

                     incurred Southey’s wrath, as appears in the notes to <em>Carmen Triumphale</em> (1814), in which Southey enjoys demonstrating how the <em>Edinburgh</em>’s predictions of defeat were erroneous as well as morale-sapping. The two men met
                     in Edinburgh in October 1805, and Southey ever after consoled himself for the printed
                     criticisms by remembering Jeffrey’s diminutive stature.</span></li>

                     his wife Elizabeth Fear. Educated locally and at North Petherton School. Apprenticed
                     to a Bristol apothecary in 1786. He contributed poems to the <em>European Magazine</em> and in 1794 published <em>The Times</em>, a satire. Jennings moved to London shortly after his marriage to Charlotte Sawier,
                     probably the only daughter of Southey’s landlady Mary Sawier, in 1795. He returned
                     to work in his family’s shop in 1801 and remained in Huntspill until the mid-1810s,
                     when economic depression led to the failure of the business. He continued with his
                     literary pursuits, contributing to the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (from 1807) and publishing <em>Poems, Consisting of the Mysteries of Mendip, the Magic Ball</em> (1810). He returned to London in 1817 and worked as a professional writer, with some
                     support from Sir William Paxton, a wealthy banker. His works included the <em>Family Cyclopaedia</em> (1821), <em>Observations on Some of the Dialects of the West of England</em> (1825) and <em>Ornithologia</em> (1828). He founded the short-lived Metropolitan Literary Institution in 1823 and
                     was editor of the <em>Metropolitan Literary Journal</em> (1824).</span> <span class="gloss">Jennings met Southey (and Coleridge) in Bristol in c. 1794. Although they were not
                     close friends, he and Southey corresponded (the correspondence has not survived) and
                     remained in contact until c. 1828. Jennings was a great admirer of Southey’s writing,
                     but the admiration was not reciprocated. Southey nicknamed him ‘poor Trauma’ and ‘the
                     traumatic poet’, though he admired Jennings’s ‘moral character’. Jennings shared Southey’s
                     interest in educational methods, and in 1813, in collaboration with the local rector
                     at Huntspill, established a school conducted on Lancaster and Bell’s monitorial system.
                     Jennings included anecdotes of Southey and Coleridge’s early careers in the <em>Metropolitan Literary Journal</em> (1824).</span></li>

                     — paid Southey an unexpected visit. Southey and Lamb shared an interest in Francis
                     Quarles (1592–1644; <em>DNB</em>). They quarrelled briefly — and publicly — in 1823, but were reconciled. Although

                     Educated at Westminster (adm. 1788); Edinburgh University (1792) and Christ Church,
                     Oxford (matric. Dec 1793). Lamb’s family were wealthy, politically influential and
                     well-connected. His father was the government manager at Rye, Sussex. Lamb’s career
                     benefited from the patronage of Lord Liverpool (1727–1808; <em>DNB</em>) and his eldest son, Lord Hawkesbury (1770–1828; <em>DNB</em>), a future Prime Minister. Lamb was private secretary to Hawkesbury, then Secretary
                     of State for Foreign Affairs, 1801–1802, and in 1802 was offered but rejected the
                     consulship at Lisbon, a post worth between £2000–2500 per year. He sat as an M.P.
                     for Rye from 1802–1806, though he seems never to have spoken in the House of Commons.
                     He vacated his seat when appointed to the post of Law Clerk at the Home Office by
                     the Ministry of ‘Talents’. Following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father,
                     he was Mayor of Rye from 1803–1804, 1809–1810 and 1816–1817. He never married.</span> <span class="gloss">Southey described Lamb as ‘one of my oldest — &amp; once one of my most intimate friends’.
                     The two met whilst pupils at Westminster and Southey stayed with Lamb’s family in
                     Rye on more than one occasion. They drifted apart (though, Southey later noted, ‘without
                     dissention’) during Southey’s time at Oxford. Lamb seems to have made an effort to
                     renew their acquaintance, seeking Southey out in London in 1802. In later years, however,
                     Southey’s opinion of him soured. He described him as one who had ‘discarded decency’
                     and on reading of Lamb’s death in a newspaper admitted that he had: ‘ ... thought
                     more of him, poor fellow, in consequence, than I had done for the last four-and-twenty
                     years ... [He] had become a mere idle heir of fortune, and not having his estates
                     to manage while his father lived, had not even that occupation to keep him from frivolities.
                     He was an old man at thirty, and that too being of a family in which it is degeneracy
                     to die at an age short of fourscore.’</span></li>

                     had become the dominant force on Rye corporation and wielded great political influence
                     in the borough. Lamb was the government agent in Rye and sat as an M.P. for the town
                     1812–1816 and 1819, though (like his son) he is not known to have spoken in the House
                     of Commons. He was Mayor of Rye some 18 times between 1775–1817. Southey twice visited
                     the Lambs home in Rye in 1791 and 1792 and was on excellent terms with Thomas Phillipps
                     Lamb, perhaps seeing him as a surrogate father-figure. Their correspondence lapsed
                     during Southey’s time at Oxford and was briefly renewed in 1798.</span></li>

                     contained ‘some of the most exquisite poetry in the language’. Landor inherited wealth
                     in 1805 and in 1808 met Southey at Bristol, offering to pay for the publication of
                     future poems that Southey might write. Thus encouraged, Southey completed <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> (1810), sending drafts to Landor, and <em>Roderick the Last of the Goths</em> (1814). In 1812 Landor himself published a poem on Spain, <em>Count Julian</em>, with Southey’s help. In 1808, to Southey’s admiration, Landor enlisted as a volunteer
                     in the Spanish army fighting Napoleon in the Peninsula. Returning in 1809, he lived
                     at Llanthony Abbey in Wales, where Southey visited him in 1811. Landor left England
                     to live in France and Italy in 1814. He received Southey’s advice on his <em>Imaginary Conversations</em> (1824-46), visited Southey in Keswick in 1832, returned to England in 1836 and met
                     Southey for the last time in Bristol in 1837. In 1843 Landor published a tribute after
                     Southey’s death in <em>The Examiner</em>; he also sought advancement for Charles Cuthbert, Southey’s son, in the church. Admired
                     by Dickens, Browning, Swinburne and Trollope, Landor spent his final years in Italy
                     and died in Florence.</span></li>

                     Pemberton in 1799 and they moved to Ambleside in 1800. His works included: contributions
                     to Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s <em>Poems</em> (1797), <em>Blank Verse</em> (1798) (co-authored with Charles Lamb), the controversial roman-à-clef <em>Edmund Oliver</em> (1798), <em>Nugae Canorae</em> (1819), <em>Desultory Thoughts in London</em> (1821), <em>Poetical Essays on the Character of Pope</em> (1821), and <em>The Duke d’Ormond</em> (1822). Lloyd’s later life was clouded by mental illness. He was briefly confined
                     in the Quaker-run asylum The Retreat, York and died in a sanatorium near Versailles.</span> <span class="gloss">Lloyd met Southey at Burton in August 1797, when he and Charles Lamb unexpectedly
                     turned up on Southey’s doorstep. Lloyd remained with Southey and his family for several
                     months. Southey recognised in him a fellow man of strong emotions, a kindred — yet
                     also unlike — spirit, and worried that Lloyd’s ‘feelings ... are not so blunt as we
                     could wish them — or as they should be for his own happiness’. Indeed Lloyd’s continued
                     presence was increasingly unwelcome and in 1798 his tale-telling led to a major quarrel
                     between Southey and Coleridge which was not healed until 1799. After Southey moved
                     to Keswick in 1803, Lloyd was on the fringes of his circle. In his edition of Cowper
                     (1836–1837), Southey made his final public observations on Lloyd’s tragic history:
                     ‘[his] intellectual powers were of a very high order ... when in company with persons
                     who were not informed of his condition, no one could descry in him the slightest appearance

He married Cecilia Baldwin in February 1798 and moved permanently to Newcastle

                     father was reluctant to provide regular financial support for Mary Lovell and her
                     child, and both became part of Southey’s extended household.</span> <span class="gloss">Lovell and Southey were introduced by Sarah Fricker in Bristol in late 1793. Lovell
                     was also a poet, his <em>Bristol: A Satire</em> appeared in 1794, and he and Southey embarked on a period of collaboration: planning
                     two co-authored collections, only one of which was published under the pseudonyms
                     ‘Bion’ [Southey] and ‘Moschus’ [Lovell] in late 1794. Lovell was also involved in
                     the 1794 revisions to Southey’s <em>Joan of Arc</em>. The advent of Coleridge in summer–autumn 1794 seems to have led (at least temporarily)
                     to a reorientation of literary relationships. Lovell was pushed to the margins. His
                     contribution to <em>The Fall of Robespierre</em> was dropped and Coleridge was openly critical of his poetry. Lovell was, however,
                     involved in Pantisocracy and it was through him that Southey and Coleridge were introduced
                     to Joseph Cottle. After Lovell’s death, Southey tried — and failed — to produce a
                     subscription edition of his poems, to raise money for his widow and child. However,
                     Lovell’s writings were included in the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799 and 1800) and <em>Specimens of the Later English poets</em> (1807). In a notice published in <em>Literary Memoirs of Living Authors of Great Britain</em> (1798), David Rivers described Lovell’s poetry as being ‘entitled to considerable
                     distinction’. Southey described receiving the news of Lovell’s death as ‘the most
                     sudden check I ever experienced’. The full extent of their relationship is difficult
                     to gauge because of the survival of only two letters from what must have been an extensive
                     correspondence.</span></li>

                     (significantly less than those of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s children, whose paternal
                     relations were capable of greater generosity). In 1803 the money paid by the Lovell
                     family for his education ceased. Southey and John May tried to get Robert Lovell Junior
                     into Christ’s Hospital. They failed. The boy was apprenticed to a London printer and
                     effectively separated from his mother, who lived with the Southeys in Keswick. The
                     impact of this on his character seems to have been profound. In 1836 his first cousin
                     Sara Coleridge described his lack of social skills: ‘From nine years old he has had
                     to shift and scramble a good deal for himself, to bear up against a hard world which
                     would have crushed &lt;or injured&gt; the frame it did not render to a certain degree tough
                     &amp; unyielding ... [he] never had the opportunity of acquiring a taste for domestic,
                     scarcely even for social enjoyment: we ought not to wonder that he is deficient in
                     many qualities which can only be fostered thereby.’ Robert Lovell Junior predeceased
                     his mother. He disappeared whilst on a European walking tour in 1836.</span></li>

                     He was a foundation member of the Unitarian Society in 1791 and in 1792 was elected
                     evening preacher at the chapel at Hackney in which Joseph Priestly preached in the

                     They had ten children, of whom the fifth was the theologian Frederick Denison Maurice
                     (1805–1872; <em>DNB</em>). Maurice was distantly connected by marriage to William Taylor. The latter was involved

                     friends. May went to Lisbon in 1793, in order to learn the family trade, returning
                     to England in 1796. May married Susannah Frances Livius in 1799. The marriage produced
                     four children. May and Southey met in Portugal in 1796. Their friendship was to last
                     until the latter’s death. May acted as a financial adviser and agent to Southey, lending
                     him money — including sums to finance Henry Herbert Southey’s education — and purchasing
                     goods on his behalf. Southey reciprocated when May experienced a severe financial
                     crisis in 1821 by lending him his life savings of £620. May visited the Southeys on
                     several occasions and acted as godfather to Southey’s two eldest children — Margaret
                     Edith (1802–1803) and Edith May (1803–1871), the latter named in his honour. <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</em> (1816) was dedicated to him ‘in testimony of the highest esteem and affection’.</span></li>

                     at Guildford Grammar School (1781–1785) and Oxford (matric. Magdalen Hall, 1788, and
                     migrated to Lincoln College, BA 1792). After graduation he joined his father, who
                     had retired to live in Christchurch, Hampshire. Rickman worked as a private tutor
                     and read widely in economics. He edited the <em>Commercial, Agricultural and Manufacturer’s Magazine</em> (until 1801). In 1796 he wrote a private paper in which he argued for the benefits
                     to the nation of a census. George Rose, MP for Christchurch, showed this to the politician
                     Charles Abbot (1757-1829; <em>DNB</em>) and in March 1801 the latter steered the census bill into law. Rickman was responsible
                     for the first four censuses (1801, 1811, 1821 and 1831) and paved the way for the
                     fifth (1841). In 1801 he became Abbot’s personal secretary whilst the latter was Chief
                     Secretary for Ireland. On Abbot’s election to the post of Speaker of the House of
                     Commons, Rickman became the Speaker’s secretary. In 1820 he became Clerk Assistant
                     to the Commons with a salary of £2500 per year. He married Susannah Postlethwaite
                     (d. 1836) in 1805. Rickman's friendship with Southey began at Burton in 1797 and endured
                     for the rest of their lives. Shortly after their first meeting, Southey described
                     him as ‘rough, coarse, well informed on all subjects, believing nothing, jacobinical’.
                     Later in life Rickman became high tory, anti-Malthusian and anti-semitic. He regularly
                     provided ideas and information (especially statistics) for Southey’s articles in the
                     <em>Quarterly Review</em> and authored the majority of Southey’s April 1818 <em>Quarterly</em> essay on the Poor Laws. Southey and Rickman planned to collaborate on a sequel to
                     the <em>Colloquies</em> (1829) but this was prevented by John Murray’s (1778–1843) financial problems.</span></li>

                     <em>DNB</em>). Her writings included <em>Poems on Subjects Chiefly Devotional</em> (1760), <em>Elegy on Captain Cook</em> (1780), <em>Monody on Major Andre</em> (1781) and <em>Louisa: A Poetic Novel</em> (1784). Walter Scott edited her <em>Poetical Works</em> for Ballantyne in 1810; her voluminous correspondence was published in 1811. Seward
                     was quick to recognise Southey as a poet to be watched: her 1797 ‘Philippic on a Modern
                     Epic’ condemned the ‘Baneful’ politics of his <em>Joan of Arc</em>, but simultaneously heralded it as the work of ‘sun-born Genius’. She continued to
                     follow Southey’s career with some interest. In 1802 she wrote to the <em>Poetical Register</em>, lauding him as a ‘genuine Poet’, though cautioning the reader against adopting ‘his
                     capricious systems’. She read <em>Madoc</em> shortly after its 1805 publication and published a lengthy defence of it in the <em>Gentleman’s Magazine</em> in 1808. When Southey got wind (via a letter sent by Seward to Charles Lloyd) of
                     her high opinion, he wrote to her. This initiated a correspondence that lasted until
                     Seward’s death and that led to their one meeting in Lichfield in summer 1808. Late
                     in life, Southey provided a comic account of the ‘jubilant but appalling solemnity’
                     of this encounter. However, his attitude to Seward was more ambivalent than this suggests.
                     He was keenly aware of – and attentive to - her place in literary history, noting
                     that she ‘was not so much over-rated at one time, as she has been since unduly depreciated’
                     (<em>Poetical Works</em>, 10 vols (London, 1837- 1838), V, pp. xv-xviii).</span></li>

                     Oxford (matric. 1789, BA 1793). Seward was one of Southey’s closest friends at Oxford,
                     and an important influence on him. An early enthusiast for Pantisocracy, Seward later
                     withdrew from the scheme and felt himself partly to blame for what he described as
                     ‘having contrived to bring [Southey] ... into ... a calamitous &amp; ruinous ... adventure,
                     from which I might at first perhaps have diverted him’. Southey was deeply shocked
                     by Seward’s death from a ‘fever’, and later addressed his elegy ‘To the Dead Friend’
                     to him. In a letter to James Montgomery, 6 May 1811, Southey recalled him as ‘an admirable
                     man in all things, whose only fault was that he was too humble ... In his company
                     my religious instincts were strengthened ... Sick of the college-chapel &amp; of the church,
                     we tried the meeting house, — &amp; there we were disgusted too. Seward left College,
                     meaning to take orders; — I who had the same destination, became a Deist after he

                     infirmary) in December 1797. Some time afterwards, the eldest brother, William (a
                     lawyer, based in Ledbury, Herefordshire) shot himself. A fourth brother, whose name
                     Southey does not record, was a ‘mere farmer’ of a ‘methodistical turn’. Of the sisters,
                     one married Mr Severn (a clergyman) and two remained unmarried. In the mid 1790s,
                     Southey was on good terms with most — if not all — of the siblings and corresponded

                     trained as a barrister but a speech impediment meant that he never practiced. He was
                     known as the ‘Macenas of his neighbourhood’ for his patronage of men of letters and
                     his philanthropy. He had a wide circle of friends in public life, including the economist
                     David Ricardo (1772-1823; <em>DNB</em>) and John Whishaw (c. 1764-1840), ‘the Pope of Holland House’. Smith was married
                     to Elizabeth Chandler, a fellow Unitarian. She was a noted collector of autographs
                     and books. They had at least one child, a daughter, who was painted by James Northcote
                     (1746-1831; <em>DNB</em>) in 1803. Southey was on very good terms with the Smiths, whom he probably knew through
                     Charles Danvers. Southey visited them at Bownham in 1803, where he made use of their
                     extensive library. He also sought out new items for Elizabeth Smith’s autograph collection.
                     These included a MS of Coleridge’s then unpublished ‘Kubla Khan’, now BL Add MS 50847,
                     sent by Southey in February 1804. In turn, Thomas Smith subscribed to the Southey-Cottle

                     closest. Tom entered the navy as a midshipman at the age of 12, saw action in several
                     major battles of the French revolutionary wars (including Cape St Vincent and Copenhagen),
                     was captured on one occasion, wounded on several others, and was made a lieutenant
                     as reward for his bravery in the fight between <span class="ital">Mars</span> and <span class="ital">L’Hercule</span> on 21 April 1798. He made Captain in 1811, but never commanded a ship. After he retired
                     from the navy, he tried his hand at farming and as a customs officer. His last posting
                     was at Demerara, British Guiana, and he died on shipboard on the return voyage to
                     England. He married Sarah Castle in 1810 and produced a large family. Tom’s lack of
                     financial stability meant that some of the burden of supporting him fell on his brothers
                     Robert and Henry Herbert Southey. Tom’s knowledge of the navy and seafaring, and his
                     observations of foreign climes, provided important information for many of Southey’s
                     writings, including his poetry and <em>The Life of Nelson</em> (1813). Tom’s only publication was <em>A Chronological History of the West Indies</em> (1827), written with his brother Robert’s encouragement.</span></li>

                     and wealthy Thomas Southey was on distant terms with his brother Robert’s sons. Thomas
                     Southey’s Will held no surprises — it cut his nephews off without a penny, ‘his last

                     Assistant in the Military, Secret and Political Department, 1798; Joint Assay Master,
                     1807; Private Secretary to the Governor, 1808; Judge and Magistrate of the Zillah
                     of Cuddapah, 1809; Junior Secretary to Government, 1812; Chief Secretary, 1813; retired
                     1824. Strachey was Southey’s ‘substance’ (an older boy assigned to induct a new pupil
                     into school rules and rituals) at Westminster School. During their schooldays, Strachey
                     (perhaps in response to the scandal surrounding <em>The Flagellant</em>) was one of many acquaintances who treated Southey ‘like a scabby sheep’, dropping
                     him. They were later only partially reconciled, but enough for Southey to commemorate
                     Strachey’s departure for India in 1798 with a sonnet (‘Fair be thy fortunes in the
                     distant land’) published in the <em>Morning Post</em>. Southey attempted to maintain their correspondence, but it had lapsed by April 1805
                     when he confessed that as Strachey had not replied to his letters, he would ‘not ...
                     write to him again, nor in any way force myself upon him.’</span></li>

Originally a printer, he bought the <em>Morning Post</em> in 1795 and turned it into the leading anti-government newspaper and a very profitable
                     venture. Though he sold the <em>Morning Post</em> in 1803, he retained an interest in the <em>Courier</em>, which he acquired in 1800-1801, though it is disputed how much influence he had
                     over the newspaper’s contents. Stuart employed Southey to write poems for the <em>Morning Post</em> at a guinea a week in 1798-1799, and again in 1801-1803. This ‘laureateship’ was
                     crucial to Southey’s finances.</span></li>

                     Taylor’s interest in German culture culminated in his <em>Historic Survey of German Poetry</em> (1828–1830). He was also a prolific contributor to the <em>Annual Review, The Athenaeum, Monthly Magazine</em>, and <em>Monthly Review</em>. Southey and Taylor met in 1798, whilst the former was on a visit to Great Yarmouth,
                     where his brother Henry Herbert Southey was being tutored by George Burnett. Taylor
                     introduced Southey to his great friend Frank Sayers (1763–1817; <em>DNB</em>) — whose 1792 collection <em>Poems</em> had influenced Southey’s early work — and also to radical and dissenting circles
                     in Norwich. Taylor gave Southey the idea for the <em>Annual Anthology</em> and was an acute, if frequently blunt, critic of his work. From 1803–1804, he edited
                     the Norwich newspaper <em>The Iris</em>, to which Southey contributed poetry. Southey described Taylor as ‘one of the three
                     great men of my acquaintance ... the more I know him and the longer I know him, the
                     more do I admire his knowledge and love his moral character.’</span></li>

                     and Southey’s aunt. Thomas met Southey during the latter’s 1795–1796 visit to Portugal.
                     Southey stayed with him in Hereford in 1798 and through Thomas gained access to the
                     cathedral library. In 1800 Thomas married a cousin, a woman Southey greatly admired.

                     Humphry Davy and participated in the nitrous oxide experiments at Thomas Beddoes’s
                     Pneumatic Institution. A prospective Pantisocrat, Tobin later contributed five poems
                     to the second volume of Southey’s <em>Annual Anthology</em> and urged Southey to produce a third. A political radical and, in the mid-1790s,
                     a follower of William Godwin, Tobin began to lose his eyesight when in America and
                     Nevis in 1793-94. In 1804 Tobin was bereaved of his brother and companion John (1770-1804),
                     and fell out with Coleridge, who resented his advice on money and health matters.
                     In 1807 he married and from 1809 till his death lived on Nevis, campaigning against
                     cruelty to slaves.</span></li>

                     looking after an elderly relative and on his death received an inheritance which she
                     then spent on living the high life. Her extravagance was a source of great concern
                     to her relatives, in particular her half-brother Herbert Hill. Elizabeth Tyler was
                     painted by Joshua Reynolds and moved in cultural circles in Bath and Bristol, counting
                     amongst her friends the Palmers, owners of the Theatre Royal, Bath. Southey was largely
                     brought up in her household, an experience he later described in a series of autobiographical
                     letters to John May. Southey quarrelled with his aunt over his relationship with Edith
                     Fricker and involvement in Pantisocracy, and on a wet night in 1794 she threw him
                     out. They never saw or spoke to one another again. Southey later speculated that Elizabeth
                     Tyler, whose grandmother had died ‘in confinement’, suffered from a form of insanity,
                     noting that ‘her habitual violence of temper is now increased by long indulgence absolutely

                     was a Fellow of the College 1776-1779 and a deacon 1778-1779. But he resigned the
                     former post on his marriage and the latter on his conversion to Unitarianism. Thereafter
                     he was a teacher (at Warrington Dissenting Academy 1779-1783) and a professional writer,
                     mainly on classical, religious and political topics. He was one of the Pitt government’s
                     fiercest critics and was imprisoned for two years in Dorchester gaol for his <em>A Reply to Some Parts of the Bishop of Landaff’s Address</em> (1798). Southey visited him in prison.</span></li>
