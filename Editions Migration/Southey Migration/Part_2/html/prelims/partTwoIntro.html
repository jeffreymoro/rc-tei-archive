            <p class="indent1"><em>Part Two</em> is the first-ever collected edition of the surviving letters written by Southey between
               1798 and 1803. The letters published here begin with Southey writing to the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> in January 1798 about Spanish and Portuguese poetry, a subject of lifelong interest;
               and end on New Year’s Eve 1803 with him anticipating a return to <em>Madoc</em>, his intended transatlantic poetic magnum opus. <em>Part Two</em> follows the editorial conventions described in About this Edition and publishes newly
               transcribed, fully annotated texts, bringing together in one place correspondence
               scattered between 37 archives in North America and the United Kingdom. It comprises
               596 letters, of which 199 are published for the first time, and 107 are published
               in full for the first time. In addition, 5 letters that appeared pseudonymously in
               the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> are here newly attributed to Southey.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The letters in <em>Part Two</em> were sent to some 40 very diverse individuals: including friends from childhood and
               school (Charles Danvers, Grosvenor Bedford and Charles Wynn), from university (Nicholas
               Lightfoot), from radical youth (Samuel Taylor Coleridge and George Dyer) and from
               professional life (Joseph Cottle and Daniel Stuart). The years 1798-1803 saw the emergence
               of important new Southeyan relationships and correspondences, notably with the statistician
               John Rickman, the translator William Taylor, the scientist and poet Humphry Davy,
               and the writer Mary Barker. Whilst some of Southey’s epistolary interactions, notably
               those with Bedford, Cottle and Wynn, were to be of lifelong duration, others in this
               period were the product of temporary expediency. For example, a letter sent in 1798
               to the Liverpudlian man of letters and social campaigner William Roscoe in a vain
               attempt to track down the maverick, poet William Gilbert (Letter 339); and one in
               1803 to the bibliographer and antiquary Joseph Haslewood on a matter connected to
               Southey and Joseph Cottle’s three-volume edition of Chatterton (Letter 694). Although
               nearly 600 letters survive, letter-fragments and references within surviving letters
               to ones now lost remind us of the fragile, selective nature of what has come down
               to us. It is clear from this edition, that some important correspondences now exist
               only in part, notably with Coleridge, George Dyer, Stuart and Cottle.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The six years covered by <em>Part Two</em> were a turbulent and crucial time for Southey. They are also a period of his career
               that has been relatively neglected, when he was neither the incendiary radical of
               his youth or the combustible Tory of his middle and old age. In 1798 Southey was a
               restless creature. Unsettled personally and professionally, he moved between a series
               of rented houses in the South West of England and London, and was torn between the
               conflicting options of a legal or a literary career. By the end of 1803 his life was
               beginning to assume, outwardly at least, a more settled appearance. He had opted decisively
               for a literary career and in September of that year taken up residence at Greta Hall,
               Keswick. His relocation, reluctant and temporary at first, proved permanent and additionally
               set him on the road to being a ‘Lake’ poet, a label Southey loathed.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The letters published here allow for a more accurate, detailed, and nuanced mapping
               of Southey’s life, works and interactions with and impact upon his contemporaries
               during these years than has previously been possible. The events they encompass include
               his reconciliation with Coleridge in 1799; his public and private responses to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798); his reaction to the rise of Napoleon and the continuing conflict between
               Britain and revolutionary France; his second and final visit to Portugal in 1800-1801,
               and the resultant hardening of his anti-Catholicism; his unhappy stint as a secretary
               to the Irish Chancellor Isaac Corry in 1801-1802; his reaction to the execution of
               the United Irishman Robert Emmett in 1803; and his emotional bludgeoning by the deaths
               in relentless succession between 1801-1803 of three Margarets, his cousin, mother
               and first child. His correspondence also records the increasing emergence of Southey
               as a literary professional. Between 1798 and 1803, he wrote for the <em>Morning Post</em>, <em>Critical Review</em>, and <em>Monthly Magazine</em>. His major book publications included the annotated Islamic romance <em>Thalaba the Destroyer</em> (1801), a new volume of <em>Poems</em> (1799), two volumes of the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799 and 1800), and revised versions of his 1797 verse collection, <em>Joan of Arc</em> and <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</em>. He edited the works of his fellow Bristolian Thomas Chatterton and translated the
               romance <em>Amadis of Gaul</em>. In addition, he completed a fifteen-book version of the revisionist transatlantic
               epic <em>Madoc</em>, produced early drafts of what became <em>The Curse of Kehama</em>, and embarked on a planned prose magnum opus, a ‘History of Portugal’. This rather
               terrifying list does not include projected but unexecuted projects such as an epic
               on the flood, a literary history of Portugal, a hexametrical epic on Mohammed (to
               be co-written with Coleridge) and numerous shorter poems sketched out in his correspondence
               and in his <em>Common-Place Books</em>. The letters published in <em>Part Two</em> provide crucial new information about all these projects, including early drafts
               of <em>Thalaba</em>, <em>Madoc</em>, gothic ballads, revisionist ‘English Eclogues’ and numerous other shorter poems.
               In so doing <em>Part Two</em> supplies fresh evidence for how Southey the ‘entire man of letters’ and one of the
               most prolific authors of his age came into being.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We hope that by making annotated, scholarly texts of the letters from 1798-1803 available
               for the first time, this edition will contribute to a richer, more complex, understanding
               of this crucial period for Southey and for British Romanticism as a whole.</p>
