            <p>My dear Wynn</p>
            <p class="indent1">Your letter reached me yesterday, only 13 days after its date. it may be worth while
               to tell you that the Lisbon mail leaves London every Tuesday. a days delay in writing
               therefore loses that mail &amp; probably that packet.</p>

               <p>I am troubled in spirit about a Xmas ballad. I have conned &amp; reconned all my stock-stories,
                  &amp; cannot catch fire. there are plenty of seeds but the soil is not prepared for them.
                  my head is full of history &amp; my very dreams made up of chronicles &amp; records. poetry
                  written out of season is as vapid as forced fruits. my best pieces have ever been
                  written most rapidly, three or four during the same heat. If I had stiled the books
                  of Thalaba Fits this old word would have been strictly applicable. – however I am
                  straining a costive brain – to what purport I know not. There was a Bishop of Bremen <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> &lt;seen&gt; once in a ship full sail <span class="ital">against</span> the wind – going to old Beelzebub in Mount Hecla.

               jealous of his wifes attachment to one who held the same rank in the same regiment.
               this man was in his manners &amp; conduct remarkably good for his situation – the woman
               a modest &amp; interesting woman. That she was improperly attached is evident from the
               sequel – but it is not believed that she was otherwise guilty than in admitting this
               feeling of preference. Her husband however beat her. the other man was so wretched
               at being the cause of this quarrel that he said he would shoot himself. one night
               accordingly, after the hour when he ought to have been in the barracks – he went into
               a little wine-house – a taberna – shot himself &amp; died instantly. At the tidings She
               came in – in a state of frenzy. she gathered up the blood with both her hands – mingled
               with the dust – &amp; devoured it greedily, by handfuls. her husband attempted to force
               her away. she called the Centinel – commanded him to take him into custody for being
               out at that hour, &amp; threatened to report him to the Colonel unless he did his duty.
               the fool was afraid – &amp; did so. immediately she ran to a large deep well &amp; threw herself
               in. a weeks confinement &amp; bread &amp; water were necessary to tame the husband &amp; prevent
               him from compleating the catastrophe. They did not bring them to Lisbon for Xtian
               burial – neither did they practise the old brutality of our custom. at low water they
               dug a grave in the sands – one grave – &amp; the Tagus flows over it.</p>
