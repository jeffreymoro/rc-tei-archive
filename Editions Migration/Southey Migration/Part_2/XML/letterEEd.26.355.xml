                        leading Bristol Methodist and printer of the <title>Bristol Gazette</title>,

                    in a cowhouse &amp; held a conversation with him of which the exact substance is

        <p rend="indent1"> Now Tom about yourself. This day fortnight I go to London to keep
                    a term. my stay cannot exceed a fortnight, then I will enquire your time for you
                    at the Admirality, so when you write next let me know exactly what I am to ask.
                    Now it will be just as well for you to visit us here as if we were in London,
                    &amp; if you can get leave I should think you might spend your Christmas better
                    at <ref target="places.html#MartinHall">Martin hall</ref> than in dock. As your
                    time is so limited at home always, I do not wish you there till I am returned
                    from London. but the earlier you can meet me after my return the better &#8211; only
                    you should contrive to be here at Xmas. It will not do to keep this house longer
                    than the twelvemonths, but it is so comfortable a place that I should be sorry
                    if you did not see it. you will like to remember it, even in the nakedness of
                    winter.</p>
