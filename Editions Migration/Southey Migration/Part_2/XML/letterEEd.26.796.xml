        <p rend="indent1"> Why Grosvenor that is an idle squeamishness
                    of yours, that asking a previous leave to speak. Where my
                    conscience becomes second to your challenge, the <del rend="strikethrough">final</del> &lt;offence&gt; shall
                    be amended &#8211; where we differ mine is the voice potential.
                    But in truth I will tell you that I am out of humour with

            <title>The

                        Book 3 by this date.</note> for half a hundred reasons.
                    historical composition is a source of greater &amp; quieter
                    &amp; more continuous pleasure &amp; that poem sometimes
                    comes into my head with a &#8211; shall I sit down to it, &amp;
                    this is so easily turned out again &#8211; that the want of
                    inclination would make me suspect a growing want of power,
                    if some rhymes &amp; poemets did not now &amp; then come out
                    &amp; convince me to the contrary. That second book is good
                    for nothing, it has good parts &amp; pictures &#8211; but in tota
                    it is bad; I have some guess how to improve it by managing
                    the weather, &amp; by a piece of natural history which is
                    somewhat of a lie. Abuse away ad libitum.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Latin translates as &#8216;As
