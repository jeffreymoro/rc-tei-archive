        <p rend="indent1"> Where are you my dear Edith? with people whom I know not and in a
                    place I know not, but wherever you are Edith you think of me, and wish for me I
                    am sure. Half the time of my town residence is thank God just over. Another
                    fortnight and we shall meet at <ref target="places.html#Westbury">Westbury</ref>. I forgot to say I had seen Betsy Thomas<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> &#8211; she was almost as shy as the first
                    minute she saw us, and looks as thin as if she had been at the ashes and
                    tobacco-pipes again. Yesterday I called at Opie&#8217;s.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The portrait and history painter John Opie (1761&#8211;1807;

                    Carlisles, which will allow me to make evening visits.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Monday. When <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> came from town this morning I lookd for a letter and felt
                    disappointed at receiving none. It is not that you and I expect news from each
                    other, but the mere sight of the handwriting creates a more substantial
                    communication than mere thought. I am writing tho with nothing to communicate
                    you see. There is such a sameness in my days work that one days history suffices
                    for the whole. Here I have to versify for <ref target="people.html#StuartDaniel">Stuart</ref>, to review, and books to read &#8211; and the standing employment to
                    write to you &#8211; an employment Edith which I heartily wish I had done with &#8211; now
                    if you are frowning at that remember why I say it and smile into good humour.
                    When I go to town my time is fully employed in morning visits and hunting the
                    book-stalls. Oh if I were behind Time how I would kick the lazy old loiterer!
                    However Edith this day fortnight shall I be in the coach.</p>

                    talk with him upon a scheme which I may tell you but which you will not speak of
                    till it be made public, lest any thing prevent it. It is a plan he has for
                    knocking up the rascally exorbitance of physicians, surgeons and apothecaries &#8211;
                    by combining with a physician of known skill to receive small fees, and a
                    druggist to administer prescriptions pure and at a just price. His stay will of
                    course be very short, and <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref>
                    and <ref target="people.html#WedgwoodThomas">Mr Wedgewood</ref> will I suppose

        <p rend="indent1"> Edith I am determined that no cursed moneysaving scheme shall
                    ever again keep me a month from you. I save five guineas &#8211; and lose three weeks
                    comfort &#8211; a vile bargain and I will make no more of them.</p>
