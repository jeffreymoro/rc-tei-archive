        <p rend="indent1"> We have of late been very uneasy respecting
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref> in
                    the Mars. The gazette relieved us by making honourable
                    mention of him, &amp; luckily we knew nothing of his wounds,
                    till his own letter informed us last night.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Southey had been
                        wounded in an action between the <hi rend="ital">Mars</hi> and the French ship <hi rend="ital">L&#8217;Hercule</hi> on 21 April 1798.</note> His escape
                    has been almost miraculous &#8211; he was by the <ref target="people.html#HoodAlexanderCaptain">Captain</ref>
                    when the Boatswain<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note>came to ask if they should board
                    the enemy forwards &#8211; by all means was the reply. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> caught up a
                    pike &amp; ran to that part of the ship. he found them all
                    in confusion, &amp; as he imagined only wanting a leader. he
                    cried out will you follow me? they answered yes by G&#8211; Sir to
                    Hell! <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref>
                    got upon the anchor &amp; from thence on board the Hercules
                    &#8211; he had just made his landing good whence he received a
                    thrust from a pike in his right thigh, &amp; immediately a
                    second, which made him loose his hold &amp; he fell <del rend="strikethrough">beneat</del> between the two ships.
                    as he was falling they made a third thrust at his back. the
                    pike glanced from his shoulder blade so as to pass twice
                    thro <del rend="strikethrough">all</del> his cloaths &amp;
                    take out a small piece of flesh. providentially as he fell
                    he caught hold of a rope hanging from the anchor, hung by it
                    &amp; got upon his own deck. he then clapt his hand to the
                    wounds on his thigh, &amp; felt them bleeding profusely, the
                        blood<del rend="strikethrough">y</del> running down his
                    leg. he was fearful lest he should faint with loss of blood
                    &amp; be thrown overboard, &amp; so made his way to the cock
                    pit. his letter is written in high spirits &#8211; but the
                    horrible scene he witnessed, particularly in the cock pit &#8211;
                    has strongly impressed him. we expect him home. <ref target="people.html#HoodAlexanderViscount">Ld
                        Bridport</ref> sent him word that he would not forget
                    him. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have always I trust been sensible of the
                    folly &amp; wickedness of these war systems &#8211; &amp; yet
                    methinks I feel it somewhat more strongly now. here are
                    ninety men killed &amp; wounded in the Mars (&amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> says this
                    number is he fears rather too little than too much) &amp;
                    350 Frenchmen. What an aggregate of wretchedness when we
                    consider the branchings of their connections! </p>
