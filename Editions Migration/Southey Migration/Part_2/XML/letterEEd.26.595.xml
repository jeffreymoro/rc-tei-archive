          <salute>Dear William Taylor</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter in spite of Norfolk frosts &amp;
                    Norfolk flats would have excited in me some half desire to
                    diet for life upon Norfolk puddings &amp; turnips &amp;
                    turkies &#8211; if destiny did not invite me to a better country.
                    I have the hope &amp; prospect of visiting Italy in a
                    prudent way &#8211; as Secretary to some legation there &#8211; an
                    office of little trouble, with the prospect of
                        advancement.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                        proposal by Wynn that Southey should become Secretary to
                        Sir William Drummond (c. 1770-1828; <title>DNB</title>),
                        classical scholar, poet and diplomat; Charge d&#8217;Affaires
                        in Denmark 1800-1801, Minister-Plenipotentiary in Naples
                        1801-1803 and 1807-1808, and Ambassador to the Ottoman
                        Empire in 1803.</note> you will not wonder that I
                    joyfully look <del rend="strikethrough">for</del> to a
                    residence in that country, &amp; the prospect of a permanent
                    income, without that eternal anxiety about ways &amp; means
                    which have so long harrassed me. This is for your own eye
                    only. my destination will probably be Palermo &#8211; if peace
                    comes, as likely to any of the other states &#8211; &amp; as
                    willingly. Ultimately I look to Lisbon &#8211; &amp; certainly to
                    a long absence from England &#8211; to me less an object of regret
                    than it would be to most persons, not merely from my state
                    of health, but from my peculiar circumstances. I have never
                    been settled in England &#8211; never had a home there &#8211; my
                    friends are scattered &#8211; nowhere two in a place. from my
                    family (excepting <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henrys</ref>
                    prospects) I receive no comfort, &amp; can communicate none
                    to them. thus without anchor or cable it is but to hoist
                    sail &amp; away! &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> To the other part of your letter &#8211; a visit to
                    Norwich would promise much pleasure. but look at the map. &#8211;
                    &amp; there is a wretched distance between. besides my time
                    is otherwise allotted. I am going to <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, to pass the
                    Autumn with <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &#8211; to work like a negro &#8211; &amp; to
                    arrange his future plans with my own. he is miserably ill,
                    &amp; must quit England for a warmer climate or perish. I
                    found letters announcing his determination to ship himself
                    &amp; family for the Azores, the only spot his finances
                    could reach. this I have stopt; &amp; the probability is
                    that he will accompany me abroad. thus <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> will have
                        <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">one sister</ref>
                    with her to reconcile her to an abandonment of the rest &#8211;
                    &amp; I shall have with me the man, to whom, in all the ups
                    &amp; downs of six years, my heart has clung with most
                    affection, despite even of its own efforts.</p>
