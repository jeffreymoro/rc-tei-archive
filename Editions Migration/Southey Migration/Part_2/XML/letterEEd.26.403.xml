                    scarce light enough to guide a bad pen that I cannot see to
                    mend &#8211; begin to converse with you &#8211; my head aches &#8211; every
                    limb is fatigued. I want rest &#8211; I want to be at home &#8211; I
                    want to be with you. this accursed London! I cannot walk a
                    street without wanting to wash my hands &#8211; the air is so
                    thick that my very lungs feel dirty. nothing but noise &amp;
                    nastiness. even the sight of my friends is fatiguing &#8211; after
                    absence there is so much to say that I hear &amp; talk till
                    my head throbs with the unremitting exertion. one never
                    enjoys <del rend="strikethrough">till</del> the company of a
                    friend till we have been long enough together to be
                    silent.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> To the history of yesterday I have little to
                    add. after sealing my letter I left the Coffee house, &amp;
                    at the door met <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">Wm Taylor</ref>, I
                    engaged them to tea, left <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> to dine with

                    repaired to my lodgings. after tea, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>, ever
                    restless, went with <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> to see Bluebeard<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">George Colman (1762&#8211;1836;

                            Curiosity! A Dramatick Romance</title> (1798),
                        performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, on 2
                        May 1799.</note> which disappointed them both. I sat
                    comfortably conversing with <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</ref>
                    till he left me at nine &amp; then went to bed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This morning they breakfasted here. I went
                    after to <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</ref>
                    where I staid till one. he shewed me Barkers drawing.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Barker
                        (1767&#8211;1847; <title>DNB</title>), who was working on a
                        painting based on Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Mary&#8217; (1797).</note> it is
                    Mary sitting when mad &#8211; the ruin &amp; the gibbet in sight.
                    I do not think that it struck me with so much pleasure as it
                    ought to have done, but it pleased me more, the more it was
                    seen. the face is well done, beauty would be out of
                    character, &amp; it has the composure of settled distress.
                    We called on <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</ref> who seems well &#8211; on both the Cottles<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    then we seperated &amp; I again dined at that blackguard
                    Inn. I expect <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">Wm
                        Taylor</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> to eat
                    some bread &amp; cheese here. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> is with them,
                    but <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> is
                    somewhat out of his element &#8211; he says <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">Wm Taylor</ref> does
                    not look like a gentleman &amp; that I have a queer set of
                    acquaintance. he looks too much at the outside. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> growls
                    admirably at London &amp; its filth. he passes tomorrow
                    &amp; will probably hurry away. <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">Wm T.</ref> goes
                    Friday, <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> on Saturday to Bristol. I shall
                    immediately then go to <ref target="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</ref>, finish Madoc, take down a Dutch grammar
                    with me &amp; read the poetry of Jacob Cats.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Dutch statesman and

                    comfort to me to get there, to enjoy quiet, rest &amp;
                    regularity. the air is not quite disoxygenated there. I may
                    have the library to myself &amp; be as comfortable as I can
                    be anywhere from home. this is a cursed place &#8211; it always
                    disgusted; but now it disorders me. Oh for a draught of good
                    Westbury air &#8211; &amp; you have wind to spare sometimes &#8211; one
                    gale from the Welch mountains were luxury! &#8211; </p>

        <p>Friday morning. I write from a coffee house in the Hay Market
                    &#8211; for in this runabout life it is my only resting place. as
                    I was writing Wednesday evening <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> came in with
                    his dinner party <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">Wm

                    but <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Toms</ref> passing
                    prevented him from going there. I went first to <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</ref> &amp; we
                    saw the Exhibition at eight o clock, in order to see the
                    pictures without being incommoded by the company.
                    breakfasted at his rooms on ginger tea which he always
                    drinks. we then set out to see Barkers picture, but on the
                    way called on Matthew Lewis, the Monk or rather the Monkey
                        Lewis.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Matthew

                    did not hesitate at giving him mine because a superb quarto
                    never can hurt the sale of my pocket modesty. Barkers
                    picture is very fine indeed. I have again seen it this
                    morning with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>
                    &amp; it grows upon me. the scene is wintry &#8211; covered with
                    snow, the abbey a back ground caught from Tintern<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The ruined Cistercian abbey

        <p rend="indent1"> You can hardly tell how perfectly
                    disagreeable it is to write in this hasty hurried scrawling
                    way. it destroys all the comfort of writing &#8211; it is not
                    possible to think of what I am about &#8211; noise &#8211; noise &#8211; hurry
                    &#8211; bustle filth &amp; fatigue &#8211; this is all I am sensible of.

                    &#8211; I shall have leisure, the library, every comfort that I

                    Edith you have spoilt me. I could once be contented
                    anywhere, &amp; now you have made <del rend="strikethrough">xx xxxx</del> my own way of life as dear to me as any

                    would know how I am the best answer I can have &#8211; is that I
