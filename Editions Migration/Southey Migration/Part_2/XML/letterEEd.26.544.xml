        <p>My dear Harry</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter (dated July 3) has reached me only this morning &#8211; I
                    am ashamed of not having written before &#8211; &amp; therefore answer it immediately.
                    your account of your progress is highly satisfactory, &amp; the manner of your
                    letter evinces as much improvement as the matter. &#8211; On my return to England in
                    the next spring I shall take a house, in or near, London, where you shall live
                    with me, &amp; study anatomy at the Westminster Hospital under <ref target="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</ref>, whom you know to be a
                    man of genius, &amp; my friend. by the time you have acquired enough previous
                    knowledge, I trust some of my eggs will have hatched, so that you may graduate
                    either at Edinburgh or <del rend="strikethrough">at</del> in Germany, as shall
                    appear best. Till my return you will remain where you are: you are well
                    employed, &amp; evidently improving rapidly, nor is there any home to which you
                    possibly could remove! On my return you will have one, &amp; I trust more
                    comfortable than any you have ever yet had. We are rising in the world; it is
                    our turn; &amp; will be our own faults if we do not, all of us <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx xxt</del> &lt;attain&gt; that station to which our
                    intellectual rank entitles us. Attend to prose particularly, excellence in that
                    is acquirable, you know the value of literature &amp; may perhaps one day find
                    it, as I have done, a resource as well as a delight. In your course of history
                        Gibbon<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Gibbon (1737&#8211;1794;
                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of the Decline and Fall of the
                            Roman Empire</title> (1776&#8211;1788).</note> must be read; it is the link
                    that connects ancient with modern history. for the History of Portugal<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s unfinished &#8216;History of
                        Portugal&#8217;.</note> you must wait &#8211; there is none but that in the Universal
                        History.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey may have been
                        referring to a number of works. One of the most likely candidates is
                            <title>The Modern Part of the Universal History</title>
                        (1759&#8211;1765).</note> it is a fine subject &amp; you will see on my return a
                    skeleton &#8211; I hope half-muscled.</p>

                        romance <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> has taken up too
                    much of my time, &amp; I am eager to send it off &amp; wash my hands of all that
                    could have been written in England. it is finished &amp; half ready for the
                    Press. I am polishing &amp; polishing, &amp; hewing it to pieces with surgeon
                    severity. yesterday I drew the pen across six hundred lines &#8211; &amp; am now
                    writing to you instead of supplying their place. it goes over for publication
                    very shortly &#8211; I trust in three weeks. <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> is my agent &amp; supervisor of the Press. I am sorry you
                    have not yet known <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>. I esteem
                    him among the first men of my knowledge.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have acquired much miscellaneous information about this
                    country, certainly enough to draw a faithful &amp; striking likeness. I shall
                    have the materials for its Literary History<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s planned &#8216;literary history&#8217; of Spain and Portugal.
                        This was never completed.</note> &#8211; my papers on that head are already
                    numerous. my time is well employed &amp; I shall thus return rich to England.
