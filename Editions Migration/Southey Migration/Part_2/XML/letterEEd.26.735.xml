          <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> From the day of my last letter, I have been
                    in a comfortless state of compulsory idleness, occasioned by
                    a complaint in my eyes. A whole confederacy of evils
                    attacked me immediately: swelled face &#8211; to that I applied
                    leeches; toothache &#8211; that was cured radically; symptoms of
                    fever &#8211; which were driven out at every sally-port. I have
                    got rid of all, except the eye-weakness, and that is very
                    materially amended. Lancing the lower lids was the effectual
                    remedy; still they are weak. I am beginning to read and
                    write, but inconveniently, and with caution.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A residence in Wales will not place me so
                    much out of your reach as you imagine, if I succeed in
                    obtaining <ref target="places.html#MaesGywn">Maes
                    Gwyn</ref>, for so the house is called. I want to take it
                    furnished, to avoid the first cost of furniture, and the
                    encumbrance, if, by good fortune, I should be enabled to
                    remove to a more congenial climate. 20<hi rend="ital">l.</hi> is the unfurnished rent; for the use of the
                    goods from 10<hi rend="ital">l.</hi> to 15<hi rend="ital">l.</hi> more may be demanded, if the landlord will let
                    them. It is a lovely spot, in a vale among the mountains,
                    eight miles from Neath, with canal carriage within 100 yards
                    of the door. From Bristol to Neath is a distance of eighty
                    miles. A friend who should leave Bristol by the mail, at one
                    in the mid-day, might reach me at breakfast-hour the next
                    morning. I will tell you more about it, and all its
                    desirableness, if the business end as I wish.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have just received a most valuable book
                    from Lisbon, the unpublished Chronicle of Fernando, by
                    Fernam Lopes,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Fernao
                        Lopes (c. 1385-after 1459), <title>Cronica de el Rei Dom
                            Fernando O Noveno Rei de Portugal</title>, no. 3829
                        in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. The
                        Chronicle covered the reign of Fernando (1345-1383, King
                        of Portugal 1367-1383).</note> a MSS., by its appearance
                    almost as old as the original work &#8211; from 250 to 300 years
                    old. I am obliged to keep Lent with this feast before me,
                    for my eyes are by no means equal to the task of unravelling
                    its characters. Only one chronicle is now wanting to
                    complete my Portuguese series.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You ask about Chatterton.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey and Joseph Cottle,
                            <title>The Works of Thomas Chatterton</title>
                        (1803).</note> The delay has been more owing to the
                    quantity of new matter discovered than to any other cause. I
                    daily expect to see it advertised. It makes three large
                    volumes, instead of two, at a guinea and a half: thus, you
                    see, Mrs. Newton,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Newton (1749-1804), the sister of Thomas
                        Chatterton (1752-1770; <title>DNB</title>). She and her
                        daughter were the beneficiaries of the Southey-Cottle
                        edition.</note> for 350 copies, will receive what, for
                    her, is a very large sum. I have taken no notice of <ref target="people.html#CroftHerbert">Croft</ref>. You will

                    indeed, it be not a waking dream &#8211; akin in imagination and
                    authenticity to Rowley&#8217;s Poems. She dreamt that her brother
                    had a monument in Redcliff church, the stones whereof were
                    cementing with a hot substance, that perpetually grew hotter
                    and hotter, till at last it flamed out; &#8211; that, being about
                    to dress her dinner, she had no fire, &#8211; she remembered these
                    flames, and went to them, and warmed her food upon her
                    brother&#8217;s monument. &#8220;Now,&#8221; says she, &#8220;my
                    dream is out.&#8221; Surely this is too well put together to
                    be a dream.</p>
