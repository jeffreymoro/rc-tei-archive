                    tolerating, &amp; earnest to save Walter. even to hastening
                    his marriage, that the union with a woman of such known
                    sentiments might divert suspicion. Gilbert is a sincere &#8211;
                    but bigotted man: one of the old reformers ready to suffer
                    death for his opinions, or to inflict it. Stephen so violent
                    in his hate of heresy, as half to be ignorant of his own
                    interested motives in seeking Walters death. but it is from
                    delineating the progress of Walters mind that I expect

                    dreading the sacrifices which his principles require. the
                    danger of his friend &amp; his death excite an increasing
                    enthusiasm. the kindness of the Priest &amp; Marys love
                    overcome him &#8211; he consents to temporize &#8211; &amp; is arrested.
                    then he settles into the suffering &amp; steady courage of a
                    Xtian. to this I feel equal &amp; long to be about it. I
                    expect a good effect from the evening hymn to be sung by
                    Mary. &amp; from the death of Gilbert. from the great window
                    Mary &amp; the Confessor see the procession to the stake
                    &amp; hear the Te Deum. they turn away when the fire is
                    kindled &amp; kneel together to pray for his soul. the light
                    of the fire appears thro the window &#8211; &amp; Walter is
                    describing as performing the last offices of kindness to is
                    martyred friend.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will perceive that such a story can only
                    excite good feelings. its main tendency will be to occasion
                    charity towards each others opinions. the story has the
                    advantage of novelty. the only martyrdom plays I know are
                    mixed with much nonsense. the best is Corneilles
                        Polyeucte.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Pierre
