                        of Reserve. It was common practice for men thus balloted to pay for a

                    has hung so long upon my hands &amp; during so many ups &amp; downs of life that
                    I had almost become superstitious about it &amp; could hurry thro it with a sort
                    of fear. projected in 1789 &amp; begun in prose at that time &#8211; then it slept
                    till 1794 when I wrote a book &amp; half &#8211; another interval till 97 when it was
                    corrected &amp; carried on to the beginning of the fourth book &#8211; &amp; then a
                    gap again until the autumn of 1798 &#8211; from which time it went fairly on till it
                    was finished in your <ref target="people.html#DanversMrs">poor mothers</ref>

                    this was done in July 99 &#8211; four years! &#8211; I will not trust it longer least more
                    changes befall &amp; I should learn to dislike it as a melancholy memento.</p>
