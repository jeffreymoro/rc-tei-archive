                    true story &#8212; &amp; like the Humourous Lieutenant.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">John Fletcher (1579&#8211;1625; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The
                            Humourous Lieutenant</title> (c. 1619), a tragicomedy attributed at this
                        time to Fletcher and Francis Beaumont (1584/5&#8211;1616; <title>DNB</title>). In
                        &#8216;The Ring&#8217;, a magic ring makes Charlemagne fall in love with an Archbishop.
                        In <title>The Humorous Lieutenant</title> a love potion makes the title
                        character fall in love with Antigonus, King of Syria.</note> It is not good
                    for much &amp; yet one or two stanzas may amuse you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I write this from Bath &#8212; where I was summoned in consequence of
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mothers</ref> state of health.
                    she is very ill &#8212; &amp; I hope to remove her to Lisbon speedily &#8212; the climate
                    would I am certain restore her &#8212; tho I fear nothing else can.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You call me lazy for not writing. is it not the same with you? do
                    you feel the same inclination for filling a folio sheet now, as when in 90 &amp;
                    91 we wrote to each other so fully &amp; so frequently? the inclination is gone
                    from me. I have nothing to communicate &#8212; no new feelings &#8212; no new opinions. we
                    move no longer in the same circles, &amp; no longer see things in the same point
                    of view. I never now write a long letter. to those who think with me, it is
                    useless to express what they also feel; &amp; as for reasoning with those who
                    differ from me, I have never seen any good result from argument. I write not in
                    the best of spirits. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mothers</ref>
                    state of health depresses me &#8212; the more so as I have to make her chearful. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is likewise very unwell &#8212;
                    indeed so declining as to make me somewhat apprehensive for the future. A few
                    months will determine all these uncertainties &#8212; &amp; perhaps change my views in
                    life &#8212; or rather destroy them. this is the first time that I have expressed the
                    feelings that often will rise. take no notice of them when you write.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> God bless you. if nothing intervene I shall see you in May &#8212; I
                    wish indeed that month<del rend="strikethrough">s</del> were over. few men have
                    ever more subdued their feelings than myself &#8212; &amp; yet have I more left than
                    are consistent with happiness.</p>
