                        200&#8211;210.</note> with the beginning I have often been pleased, &amp; the
                    remainder pleases me not less. Some lines will not scan &#8211; Men who against Kings
                    &amp;c &#8211; is a foot short. Surely the dome of the Invalides &#8211; a foot too long,
                    &amp;, We poor Jews when it went, in the same fault. I have scannd these lines
                    so often as to be satisfied the error is not in my toning. In Hexameters of a
                    loftier tone I should object to <del rend="strikethrough">such</del> the placing
                    a verb like &#8220;batter&#8221; at the end of one line &amp; the &#8220;down&#8221; at the beginning of
                    the next &#8211; as it is almost splitting a word: but in this place the effect is
                    rather good than otherwise. I think you estimate rightly the powers of this
                    metre. perhaps no other is so well adapted for the sort of domestic poetry, if
                    the term be understandable, in which I believe Voss has written his Luise.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Johann Heinrich Voss (1751&#8211;1826),

                        with Caroline Bowles (1786&#8211;1854; <title>DNB</title>). It was never finished;
                        a fragment was published in 1847 by Bowles, by then Southey&#8217;s widow.</note>

                    should contract habits of expensiveness, &lt;of&gt; which it will be difficult
                    to divest himself, &amp; which if indulged must be subversive of independance
                    &amp; perhaps integrity. my attempts to correct this are rather by example, than
                    by precept. you have considerable influence &lt;over him,&gt; &amp; I say this

                    independance his pride, &amp; he will do well. you will perhaps smile to hear
                    that the first book that ever seriously influenced my opinions &amp; my conduct

                    makes it perceptible, &amp; then it is equally offensive in any of the four
                    first feet. I recollect but one instance in the fragment of Mohammed &#8211; Disturbs
                    him &#8211; so deep his attention. the pause, breaks the dactyl into a trochee. you
                    are right I think in recommending the long syllable-ending to precede the
                    superfluous beginning one of the next line, &amp; this liberty seems inevitable.

                    that they are the apprencticeship-verses. it is evident that their perceptible
                    harmony is obtained by no forced accent or unnatural construction of language.
                    they would very soon become as easy to me &amp; as wieldable as blank verse.
                    &amp; when Thalaba is finished I shall certainly give them the trial of a long
                    and important poem. Whether Mohammed be a hero likely to blast a poem in a
                    Christian country is doubtful. my Mohammed will be, what I believe the Arabian
                    was in the beginning of his career, sincere in enthusiasm &#8211; &amp; it would
                    puzzle a casuist to distinguish between the belief of inspiration &amp; the
