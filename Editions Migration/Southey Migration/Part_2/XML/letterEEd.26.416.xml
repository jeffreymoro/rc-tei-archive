                    destination after Midsummer certainly enough to communicate
                    it. but this is still unsettled. the day after I last saw
                    you a letter from <ref target="people.html#BiddlecombeCharles">Biddlecombe</ref> reached me at <ref target="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</ref>. it stated
                    that there was a place at <ref target="places.html#Burton">Burton</ref> which he thought would suit us &#8211; it had
                    been divided into two tenements, both which with a little
                    garden we might have for not more than eight pounds a year.
                    I immediately wrote that this would do if there were the
                    required number of bed-rooms &#8211; that is &#8211; rooms for myself &#8211;

                    this I have daily &amp; vainly expected an answer. it will
                    probably bring intelligence that the place is ours &#8211; but
                    time presses &amp; I now wait with some impatience. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This house, or rather tenement to speak with

                    first on a Sunday night, because they carry no letters &amp;
                    there is of course time for an accident. so I was endangered
