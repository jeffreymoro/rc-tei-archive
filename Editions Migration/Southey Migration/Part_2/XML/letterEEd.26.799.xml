                    &amp; after that a fortnight at an Inn at Kington waiting for money to return
                    for which after all he was obliged to apply to <ref target="people.html#ThomasDr">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas</ref>. Zounds I
                    could swear for pure anger &amp; vexation. &#8211; damnation &#8211; but to the point &#8211; can

                    will find no difficulty. Poor boy I am always angry with him, &amp; then angry
                    with myself for feeling so &#8211; &amp; yet it is enough to anger me to see such a

                    West Indies are become part of the necessaries of life throughout Europe. if
                    they shut their ports against us &#8211; we close them against all other commerce &#8211;
