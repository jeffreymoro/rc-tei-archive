        <p rend="indent1"> I care not so much what you are about &#8211; as
                    that you should be about something &#8211; some classical business
                    probably of more self-amusement than use. that sort of
                    literature is like the ring in Hyde Park<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">A part of Hyde Park, London,
                        much used by horses and carriages and a popular
                        recreation place for the fashionable.</note> &#8211; I would
                    ride thro it once &#8211; &amp; no more. there is nothing to glean
                    there.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You guess right. I do most villainously
                    miscall <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">young Margaret</ref>. her usual name is the Doctor. for

                    like manner did she enter &#8211; all alive &amp; kicking. the
                    Doddity of her motion discovers itself when she is being
                    washed &amp; dressed, to most advantage. She can make as
                    much noise as I can almost &#8211; I sing to her till she cries &#8211;
                    N.B. this <del>was</del> &lt;is&gt; a philosophical

                    must be as nice as her own. What a change in a house &amp;
