        <p rend="indent1"> Nay Grosvenor &#8211; you could not suppose my silence proceeded from
                    any childish pique. I had much to do &amp; nothing to say. I have no new
                    incident to recount, no new feeling &amp; as for observations &#8211; those alone that
                    I am anxious to make can little interest you. Would it please you to hear that I
                    have seen a few gnats buzzing in the lanes at [MS illegible] that the beech
                    trees keep their leaves &#8211; that the yew tree looks beautifull in the wood? &amp;
                    yet these are the remarks I have made &#8211; . my intercourse with men teaches me
                    nothing worth learning &#8211; an evening walk gives me some new images for poetry. In
                    the country I have no feeling but what delights me &#8211; fills me, &#8211; makes me
                    better. I should be very religious Grosvenor had I a home in the country, where
                    I could always see the sun set, when I could lie down &amp; watch the running
                    water, or sun myself on a primerose bank. I cannot tell you how I feel when
                    every object around reminds me of something so powerful &#8211; so beneficent as
                    creative intelligence. In town where are these feelings gone! I am another
                    being. my soul seems annihilated. I have no enjoyment of life there &#8211; it is
                    existence &#8211; like a Jew brokers existence; &amp; not quite so quiet as a toads in
                    a block of marble. Meliora novi proboque deteriora sequor<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A paraphrase of Ovid (43 BC&#8211;AD 17),
