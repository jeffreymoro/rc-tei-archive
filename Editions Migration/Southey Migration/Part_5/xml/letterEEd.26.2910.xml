        <p rend="indent1"> I have a letter from Dublin to this effect. Government has granted to a Society for promoting the Education of the
                  Poor,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in Ireland, founded in 1811
                  (usually known as the Kildare Place Society, from the location of its headquarters). It promoted non-denominational primary schools,
                  teacher training and school text-books, but its requirement that the Bible be read in its schools without interpretation was
                  unacceptable to Catholics. From 1815 it received an annual government grant. </note> &#8220;a sum sufficiently ample to print &amp;
               circulate useful, improving &amp; amusing books among the lower order, at such price as considerably to undersell the destructive
               popular publications of the day&#8221;. In this way they expect in the course of two months to have a dozen works in editions of from 5 to
               10,000 copies each, selling at the price of five pence each at the highest, &#8211; the largest being about 200 pages 18mo. The letter comes
               with a request for permission to print an abridgement of Nelson<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Life of
                     Nelson</title> (1813), published by Murray.</note> in this manner &amp; for this purpose. &#8211; The matter of course rests with you,
               &#8211; as to the good or the injury which it might do the sale I can have no opinion, &#8211; nor have I any wish upon the subject; &#8211; the
               application comes from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MasonHJMonck">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H J Monck Mason</ref>, a very useful
               &amp; excellent man, &#8211; the least like an Irishman of any person I ever saw from that country, &#8211; <del>&amp; I know not what better can
                  be said for</del> which is saying much in his praise. But if there the slightest objection to granting the permission which he asks,
               you should perfectly understand that <del>I can</del> there will not be the least awkwardness in my witholding it in your name.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Monck Mason&#8217;s proposal for an abridgement of Southey&#8217;s <title>Life of Nelson</title> (1813) does
                  not seem to have been taken up. </note> Did you know that the Life of Wellington<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s

                  (July 1815), 448&#8211;526. The Irish books based on these reviews to which Southey refers are <title>A Summary of the Life of Arthur Duke
                     of Wellington: from the Period of his First Achievements in India, to his Invasion of France, and the Decisive Battle of

               as yet seen the book. Two things are complained of in it, &#8211; the first is <hi rend="ital">not</hi> remediable, being in the very texture
               of the book, but it might well to notice it: &#8211; <del>that</del> it produces a very unfair impression of the Scotch Covenantors, an
               equally unfair one of a very detestable monster (for such Claverhouse<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Graham of
                  Claverhouse, 7th Laird of Claverhouse and 1st Viscount Dundee (1648&#8211;1689; <title>DNB</title>), nicknamed &#8216;bluidy clavers&#8217; because of
                  his persecution of the Presbyterians who resisted the Established Church in South West Scotland in 1679&#8211;1680. These events were the
                  background to Walter Scott&#8217;s <title>Old Mortality</title>, one of the two <title>Tales of My Landlord</title> (1816).</note> was)
               &amp; tends to lessen the horror which ought always to be felt at persecution &amp; cruelty. <ref type="m" target="people.html#GrahameJames">James Grahame</ref> had the right feeling upon this subject, &amp; his poems &amp; his notes might
               be referred to with good effect.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Grahame had denounced Claverhouse in a note to his poem,

        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The other objection is remediable, &amp; it is of importance to the sale of the book that it should be remedied in
               after editions. It is complained that whole passages of scripture are frequently introduced in <del>such</del> a manner <del>that
