        <p rend="indent1"> Have you read Mariners book which so delights the <ref type="m" target="people.html#BurneyJames">Capitaneus</ref>?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William Mariner (1791&#8211;1853) lived in the Tonga
                  islands from 1806 to 1810 after the local people attacked his ship and killed his
                  crewmates. His narrative was published by Murray in 1817, having been prepared for
                  the press by the meteorologist John Martin (1789&#8211;1869; <title>DNB</title>),
                     <title>An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands, in the South Pacific
                     Ocean, with an Original Grammar and Vocabulary of their Language</title>
                  (1817). Southey reviewed the book in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 17 (April
                  1817), 1&#8211;39. </note> I saw it in Manuscript, &#8211; &amp; only wish Mariner had written
               it himself. It is absurd to suppose that any people should within the memory of man
               have begun to make war, &#8211; for the first time since they were a people, &#8211; in imitation
               of their neighbour. &#8211; I suspect also the poem Vol 1. p. 307.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;Song&#8217; transcribed in <title>An Account of the
                     Natives</title>, 2 vols (London, 1817), I, pp. 307&#8211;308, was supposed to be an
                  authentic Tongan song.</note> But in the main the book is &amp; must be true,
               &amp; an admirable picture of savage man, &#8211; the animal being {of} a fine sort.</p>

                  Excise 1809&#8211;1819. He had sent Southey the papers of his brother, Thomas Sydenham
                  (1780&#8211;1816), who had served in Spain 1811&#8211;1812 before becoming Minister
                  Plenipotentiary at Lisbon 1814&#8211;1816. Sydenham&#8217;s papers were to assist Southey in
                  writing his <title>History of the Peninsular War </title>(1823&#8211;1832).</note> &#8211;
               Among other highly curious facts I learn from them that we sent arms &amp; stores to
               Prussia as early as the autumn of 1811.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">This story appeared in Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular
