        <p rend="indent1"> As soon as your Returns arrived last night I fell to work upon them, &amp; dispatched that portion forthwith; the
               second part having been pruned of what was extraneous, &amp; received its addenda, is now on the table before me, packed &amp;
               directed, wanting only its seal, &amp; will be at the Admiralty (the channel thro which it reaches <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>) some few minutes before you receive this.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Rickman had returned drafts of his and Southey&#8217;s joint article &#8216;On the Poor Laws&#8217; (published in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18
                  (January 1818), 259&#8211;308) which Southey was now sending to press via Bedford.</note> There is a note to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">G.C.B.</ref> under the same inclosure, properly worded, &amp; in all likelihood on
               Monday or Tuesday he will transmit the proofs to you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am finishing the paper which was laid aside to make room for this.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                  article &#8216;On the Means of Improving the People&#8217; appeared in<title> Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818), 79&#8211;118.</note> It
               relates to the means of improving the lower class, calling for vigilance in the magistrates &amp; parish officers with respect to ale
               houses, &#8211; &amp; speaking a good word in recommendation of the stocks.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;On the Means of Improving
                  the People&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818), 82&#8211;84, called for a reduction in the number of ale houses; Southey
                  also lamented that the stocks were no longer used (82), suggesting they might be a suitable punishment for public gambling on
                  Sundays (101).</note> Upon the subject of education there is no choice in this stage of society: &#8211; it is a ground which if you do
               not occupy the enemy will; &#8211; if you do not sow wheat, he will sow tares: &#8211; Scotland was, a hundred &amp; fifty years ago what Ireland
               is at present, &amp; education has made the difference. You can no longer have contented, unoffending &amp; submissive ignorance; &#8211; let
               us therefore take the people in childhood &amp; teach them what to believe.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Education was the
                  main focus of &#8216;On the Means of Improving the People&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818); Southey declared &#8216;Give us an
                  educated population &#8230; taught to fear God and honour the king, to know their duty toward their fellow-creatures and their Creator &#8230;&#8217;
                  (97).</note> I proceed to the prisons, to enforce your doctrine there, &amp; expose the folly &amp; mischief of suffering known
               criminals to escape punishment by the quirks quibbles &amp; informalities which Lawyers hold sacred.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;On the Means of Improving the People&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818), 113&#8211;116, dealt with prison
                  reform; 116&#8211;117 condemned legal loopholes that allowed criminals to escape justice.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This I shall follow by a third paper upon the middle class, to point out where the real overplus of population exists,
               &amp; the great change which has been effected in the constitution of society by this redundance of educated &amp; half-educated
                  persons.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey made this point in &#8216;British Monachism&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 22
                  (July 1819), 59&#8211;102 (at 91), but did not make it the subject of an article.</note> Here again I shall preach upon the necessary of
               colonization, &#8211; which is as necessary to the security of the state, as bleeding to an apoplectic subject: &amp; then, passing to the
               condition of women, I shall look at your old papers upon that subject, which I think we have now the means of bringing forward to
                  advantage.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;British Monachism&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 22 (July 1819), 59&#8211;102 (at

                  was already clear, though, that there would be a contest in Westmorland, which was dominated by the Lowther family, who were
                  supporters of the government &#8211; the two sitting MPs were the brothers Henry Lowther (1790&#8211;1867), MP for Westmorland 1812&#8211;1867 and
                  William, Viscount Lowther (1787&#8211;1872), later 2nd Earl of Lonsdale and MP for Cockermouth 1808&#8211;1813, MP for Westmorland 1813&#8211;1831 and
                  1832&#8211;1841. However, in January 1818, a committee of Whigs and smaller landowners had brought forward Henry Brougham to challenge the
                  Lowthers &#8211; Brougham&#8217;s family home was Brougham Hall near Penrith and he could plausibly be presented as a local candidate.</note> He

                  extra-marital affairs were commonplace in the Lake District, but the real cause of his financial difficulties were increasing costs
                  and declining profits in his collieries. His liabilities at his death exceeded &#163;100,000.</note> Lord Thanet<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Sackville Tufton, 9th Earl of Thanet (1769&#8211;1825; <title>DNB</title>), the largest landowner in Westmorland to support

                  205: &#8216;Mr. Hansard has perused and reperused with much pleasure Mr. Southey&#8217;s classical and biographic sketch of Robert Lovell; a
                  sketch equally honourable to the gentleman by whom it is drawn, as it is creditable to the gentleman who is the subject of it. So
                  far as can at present be observed of Robert Lovell&#8217;s progress in the printing-office, Mr. Southey&#8217;s interesting trait is not
                  overdrawn; and if the young man perseveres in the variety of trying scenes ever attendant upon a parliamentary business late and
                  early, chiefly early hours, some cramfull to overflowing, then standing still (but yet in awaiting) and then to another overflowing
                  of diversities, still waiting and giving instant attention Mr. Hansard will then have fair opportunities even though Lovell be but a
                  young man and a new hand but just come into camp Mr. Hansard will have fair opportunities, which he shall gladly seek for and as
                  gladly embrace, of coming up to Mr. Southey&#8217;s and Mr. Rickman&#8217;s kind and solicitous wishes.&#8217; For Lovell&#8217;s reluctance to take the
