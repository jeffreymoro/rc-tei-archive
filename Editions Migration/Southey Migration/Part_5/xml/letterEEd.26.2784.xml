        <p rend="indent1"> I wish you to make an apology for me to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bell.
               At the end of the volume I made on the last proof my acknowledgements both to him

               insertion of some importance have been prevented from appearing.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to
                     Waterloo</title> (1816) was published with seven engravings of drawings of the
                  battlefield by Nash and one by Charles Bell (1774&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>). The
                  acknowledgement of Bell&#8217;s and Nash&#8217;s contributions had been omitted because
                  Bedford, whom Southey had deputed to see the volume through the press, and Pople,
                  the printer, had not waited for the final proof correction.</note> Why it was
               delayed till then you will easily explain<del>xx</del>, &#8211; when the notes were sent to
               the printer I put together such as were ready, &#8211; not being in a state of mind to do
               any thing more<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s son <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> had died on 17 April 1816.</note> &#8211; there

               parts of the text. Pray excuse me to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bell, &#8211; the omission
               shall be supplied whenever the book is reprinted, &#8211; if ever that be. But it is a

            <title>The Poet&#8217;s
                     Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (London, 1816) sold out rapidly and a second
                  edition of 1000 copies was printed in the summer of 1816. The second edition (p.
                  232) included the acknowledgement missed out in the first edition: &#8216;I must not
                  conclude this volume without expressing my obligations to one of my fellow
                  travellers for seven of the views which illustrate it; and to Mr. Charles Bell for
                  the eighth.&#8217;</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am better in health, but worse in spirits. &#8211; Yet I think less of
               leaving this place, &amp; more of the difficulties &amp; mental effort in removing.
               Both for body &amp; mind I have tried exercise &amp; tonics &amp; diet; &#8211; both will
               be the better for <del>it</del> this, &#8211; but both stand in need of it. Few men have
               more of that philosophy which serves for every day use; &#8211; it would stand me in little
               stead <del>xx</del> {now} were there not something better to assist it, &amp; supply
               its defects. He who attempts to destroy or weaken our belief in a future {state}
               commits the greatest of all offences against society. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As yet I have not left home, nor would it be wise at present. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Senhouse</ref> wishes us to make
               him a visit &amp; bring the children, perhaps before the summer is over <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> may be prevailed upon to do this. </p>

        <p rend="indent1"> Whenever poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Bedford</ref> dies, &#8211; an event which in the
               common course of nature time would soon bring about without any intervention of
               disease, &#8211; I shall persuade <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> to go abroad
               for a few weeks, &amp; mean to accompany him. This is the only change which would be
               likely to recruit my own spirits. I should like after a very short stay at Paris to
               make for Switzerland, descend the Rhine, go thro Holland, come <del>back</del> up to
               Brussels &amp; return home by way of Lisle &amp; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Omer. Six
               weeks would suffice for this, &#8211; &amp; 20/<hi rend="sup">s</hi> a day cover the
               expenses per head. The summer will probably not pass over without the
                  <del>contingency</del> occurrence of the contingency which this plan
                  contemplates.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey made a journey
                  very similar to the one described here in May&#8211;August 1817, accompanied by Senhouse
