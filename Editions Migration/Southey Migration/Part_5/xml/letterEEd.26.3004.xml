               &amp; obliging guide.&#8217; The following curious note had been added by some unknown hand. &#8216;The obliging guide Peter Balmat Sen<hi rend="sup">r</hi> says that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SharpRichard">R. Sharp</ref>, tho he cant speak any language, is the
               most accomplished humbug he ever met with in all his walks.&#8217; I bought here an inkstand &amp; a lamp of a green stone which is found on
               Mont Blanc, &amp; called <hi rend="ital">pierre ollaire</hi>, for the <ref type="m" target="people.html#BarkerMary">Senhoras </ref>
          <ref type="m" target="places.html#RosthwaitePlace">house in Borrodale</ref> &#8211; things of no great beauty &amp; little cost but
               interest-ing for the place from whence they came: the lamp has a wick of amianthus,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">An old word
                  for asbestos.</note> which is to last for ever &amp; burn without being consumed. &#8211; Had Saturday been a fine day we should have gone
               from Martigny to the pass of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Bernards &amp; slept at the Convent, but the mountains were covered; as some amends
               for this disappointment we saw the waterfall known by <del>xx</del> the name, more characteristic than it is either poetical or
               decorous of the Pissevache<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Pissing cow&#8217;.</note> in the greatest perfection. As we saw it,
               which was under very peculiar circumstances, it was the grandest <hi rend="ital">single</hi> object that I ever beheld; &#8211; &amp; in this
               opinion we all agreed. I envy the Alps nothing but their waterfalls. Saturday morning was half spent in hoping for a change of weather.
               we got to Vevey that night, dined the next day at Lausanne, &amp; came here in the afternoon, where we were most hospitably
               received.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Monday I wrote to <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> &amp; to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>, desiring Tom in case your letter should not travel by the same post to tell you that we
               were thus far on our way home, safe &amp; sound. I wanted to receive yours <del>xxxxxx</del> before I wrote &amp; the messenger whom we
               dispatched to Geneva brought your letters &amp; Miss Woods<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Anne Wood (1782&#8211;1860),
                  Senhouse&#8217;s cousin.</note> yesterday evening. Tomorrow we depart at six o clock after three days rest: a shorter halt we could not
               make. Indeed it is <hi rend="ital">scarcely</hi> civil to have made so short a one. We get to Berne on Friday, &amp; from thence send
               the carriage to Zurich while we once more <hi rend="ital">enfonce</hi>,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Dig in&#8217;.</note> as
               the phrase is among the mountains, to the Lake of Thun &amp; across the country to that of Lucerne. Six days I hope will bring us to
               the carriage, after which our way is plain without any deviation to Schaffhausen, &amp; by whatever route may be then deemed best to
               Frankfort &amp; Brussels.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have given you the hasty sketch of our movements. We have travelled fast as well as far, &amp; it has required no
               small exertion &amp; resolution to keep our journals. The journey has been remarkably fortunate, &#8211; but both <ref type="m" target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">S</ref> &amp; myself are looking more eagerly toward England than <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> N.</ref> who has no such ties to call him there. He enjoys himself greatly,
               &amp; if good social spirits were a criterion of happiness (which they are not) I believe that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">S</ref> &amp; I might be set down for two of the happiest men in Xtendom: for we jest, &amp;
               we eat &amp; we drink, &amp; take things quietly &amp; extract amusement or enjoyment from every thing. But we sleep in the same room
               upon our travels, &amp; I frequently hear him sigh deeply before he falls asleep.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall ask <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> whether the regular use of port wine may
               not counteract in <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> that relaxed habit which renders her so liable to sore
               throats. There was no letter from him at Geneva. I am very glad you mentioned therefore all that I wanted to know. &#8211; We heard of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> from an Englishman who saw him at Naples. He made six attempts to ascend
               Vesuvius, but with all imaginable help of guides it was impossible to get the man mountain up the cinder mountain. If he had reached
               the crater, &amp; fallen in, &#8211; think what a blaze there would have been! Why have you said nothing of yourself? &#8211; Three weeks at the
               farthest will carry us to Brussels, &amp; we must be very unlucky about the packets &amp; the passage if less than another week does
               not bring us to London. I will write to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BrowneWade">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Browne</ref> on my
               arrival; you advise me well upon that subject. Did I not tell you that Lady Olivia<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Olivia
                  Sparrow (c. 1778&#8211;1863) was the widow of Robert Sparrow (1773&#8211;1805), who had bullied Southey at Westminster School. She had visited
                  Southey in 1814. Her son, Robert Acheson Bernard St John Sparrow (c. 1800&#8211;1818), died during their continental tour.</note> is in
               Italy, with her son who had broken a blood-vessel? &#8211; But I have a great deal to tell you when we meet.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At Milan I bought some books, &amp; sent home by the same conveyance some views in outline of the Italian lakes, &amp;
               also a few Swiss views of <del>xx xxx</del> little merit, but which it is pleasant to possess. &#8211; The harvest (which in Italy is begun
               by this time) will be excellent in all these countries. Our warm weather began here on the first of June. You complain of cold &amp; of
               storms ten days later. The climate both here &amp; in the North of Italy we have found as variable as in England. I say nothing about
                  <ref type="m" target="places.html#GretaHall">the House</ref>
          <note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Greta Hall, the Southeys&#8217; home,
                  which Southey was planning to purchase after its owner was jailed for debt.</note> &#8211; What indeed can I say at this distance? &#8211; but
               that whether I purchase it myself, or any body else, in either case we shall find reasons for being satisfied with whatever is to be. &#8211;
               Let me find a letter at the Dover post office. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Here is a dinner company today, &amp; every moment I expect to be summoned. You would like this family,<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">The family were John Awdry (1766&#8211;1844), solicitor in Reybridge and his wife Jane, n&#233;e Bigg-Wither
                  (1770&#8211;1845), sister of Herbert Hill&#8217;s wife, Catherine. A third, unmarried, sister, Alethea Bigg (1777&#8211;1847), was staying with them.
                  Southey visited them at Echichens on 1&#8211;3 June and 29 June&#8211;3 July.</note> &amp; will like them, for I think the <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">General</ref> will get them down to the Island<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Derwent
                  Island, on Derwentwater, near Keswick, Peachy&#8217;s summer residence.</note> perhaps with more facility now we are become acquainted. In
               that case I shall bespeak Alethea<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Alethea Sophia Awdry (1806&#8211;1882), daughter of John and Jane
                  Awdry.</note> for <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Ediths</ref> visitor. She is nearly the same age, (a little
               younger) &amp; they would make the best companions in the world. Here is a sweet boy<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter
                  Herbert Awdry (1812&#8211;1875), in later life a schoolmaster, clergyman and friend of Anthony Trollope (1815&#8211;1882;
                  <title>DNB</title>).</note> of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabels</ref> age who has taken to me by instinct,
               &amp; is very much surprized to find that one of his Aunts should be <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillCatherine">my Aunt</ref>
               also. The <ref type="m" target="people.html#AwdryJohn">eldest son</ref> is here, &amp; his cousin Blackstone, for whom <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> holds the Hampshire living <hi rend="ital">in commendam</hi>.<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">The cousin was Frederick Charles Blackstone (1795&#8211;1862), whose mother was Margaret Bigg-Wither
                  (1768&#8211;1842), another sister of Catherine Hill and Jane Awdry. Still at Oxford in 1817, Blackstone was preferred to the living of
                  Worting, Hampshire in 1819, Southey&#8217;s uncle Herbert Hill having held this living from 1815 to 1819 (i.e. deputising as parish priest
                  until such time as Blackstone was ready to take up his duties). Hill, however, who lived in Streatham, did so <title>in absentia
                  </title>and his duties were performed by curates. Blackstone did not, as Southey predicted, marry one of the Awdry
                  daughters.</note> They are both fine young men, &#8211; &amp; unless I am much mistaken are in a fair way of being one day more nearly
               connected than they are already by family ties. &#8211; I heard the Pernambucan news<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">News of a failed
                  insurrection against Portuguese rule in Pernambuco March-May 1817; Southey&#8217;s friend, Henry Koster, was an eye witness.</note> at

                  expertise on procedural matters had led him to be nominated as a candidate to be Speaker of the House of Commons. He did not win the

               the <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Dockstor</ref>. My complection is of the finest &amp; deepest tan, &amp; my

               Savoyards. I have learnt also that when young pease are boiled in the shell, the shells are as good as the pease; this good practise I
               shall endeavour to introduce at home.</p>

               extravagant enough to purchase a watch, which by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Awdrys means has been obtained at a price that will surprize
               you, certainly for one third of what it would have cost in England. And now my dear Edith God bless you. My next will be from Brussels,
               unless we should halt a day at any city in Germany, which I think will not be the case. <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref> has written from hence to <ref type="m" target="people.html#VardonMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Vardon</ref>, &amp; I
