        <p rend="indent1"> In the case of the Appeal,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The involved case of Abraham Thornton (d. c. 1860). On 8 August 1817 he was
                  found &#8216;not guilty&#8217; by a jury at Warwick Assizes of the rape and murder of Mary
                  Ashford on 27 May 1817. Her brother, William Ashford (d. 1867), launched a
                  &#8216;criminal appeal&#8217; (a medieval form of private prosecution) against Thornton, which
                  was heard in London at the Court of King&#8217;s Bench on 17 November. Thornton pleaded
                  &#8216;not &#8216;guilty&#8217; again and challenged his accuser, William Ashford, to trial by
                  combat. A lengthy legal argument followed, but the Court found that the case
                  against Thornton was not so overwhelming that he could be denied the right to
                  trial by combat. As Ashford declined to fight him, Thornton was finally acquitted
                  on 20 April 1818. The case led to the abolition in 1819 of both trial by combat
                  and criminal appeals.</note> &#8211; to what a reductio ad Absurdum would our Laws have
               been reduced if the brother had been a stout fellow! It is bad enough as it is, &#8211; but
               a real judicial combat would have been a truly portentous extravagance.</p>
