                  &#163;100 per annum and a tierce (42 gallons) of Canary wine. These payments are often
                  seen as making him the first de facto Poet Laureate. Southey&#8217;s predecessor, Henry
                  James Pye (1745&#8211;1813; <title>DNB</title>) arranged for the wine to be commuted

               mention <del>his</del> that he declined the office &amp; used his influence to have
               it offered to me, &#8211; because there were reports that a jealousy had existed between

                  motivated by the desire for money and office. The magazine also reprinted Leigh
