                  in etching. She was tutored by John Crome (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>) and later by John Sell Cotman (1782&#8211;1842;
                     <title>DNB</title>). </note> has paid me, as gratified by the manner in which you notice the recent loss of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">my son</ref>, <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Herbert Southey had died on 17 April
                  1816.</note> You who have experienced the nature of such an affliction<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Three of the Turners&#8217;
                  eleven children had died in infancy.</note> (&amp; none can tell what it is but those who have experienced it) know also that under
               all afflictions there is but one source of consolation. The loss which, in its kind, is common to all parents has been, in its degree,
               peculiarly severe, because the boy was in every thing what my heart desired: so entirely so, that I had often gazed upon him with the
               ominous feelings that he was fitter for a better world than this. In that world we shall meet; &amp; as this dispensation contributes
               to fix my heart &amp; hopes more fervently upon a future state, I feel &amp; acknowledge its use.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will oblige <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Southey</ref> &amp; myself if,
               when an opportunity offers, you will have the goodness to send a few impressions of the etching<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Dawson Turner&#8217;s etching of Southey (1815). It was based on the portrait by Thomas Phillips (1770&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>) and
                  is in the National Portrait Gallery.</note> to my brother <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Southey</ref>, 15, <ref type="m" target="places.html#QueenAnneSt">Queen Ann S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, Cavendish
                  Square</ref>. The observations which my family make upon it are that the eye is too small, &amp; that the eyebrows &amp; forehead
               are both unlike: my forehead having no depression, &amp; my eyebrows being remarkable regular. Every person here is struck with its
               resemblance to Bellingham,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">John Bellingham (1770&#8211;1812; <title>DNB</title>), who had assassinated
                  Spencer Perceval in the lobby of the House of Commons in 11 May 1812. He was executed on 18 May 1812.</note> of whom we possess a
               likeness etched by Dawe:<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">George Dawe (1781&#8211;1829; <title>DNB</title>). Dawe had stayed at Greta
                  Hall in autumn 1812 whilst he worked on the 9 foot by 8 foot canvas &#8216;Mother Rescuing her Child from an Eagle&#8217;s Nest&#8217;. The portrait
                  owned by the Southeys was possibly Dawe&#8217;s pencil sketch &#8216;Study of John Bellingham&#8217;. </note> it was noticed at the time of the
               unhappy man&#8217;s appearance of the public, that he was singularly like <ref type="m" target="people.html#Burdett">Sir Francis
                  Burdett</ref>; &amp; there is that sort of likeness between Sir Francis Burdett &amp; myself, that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</ref> once purchased a caricature of Sir Francis supposing it had been designed
               for me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Should any circumstances bring you &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Turner to the Land of Lakes, I trust you will do me
               the favor of comparing the original to the portrait. Should I ever visit the Eastern counties again, I will not fail to avail myself of
               your kind invitations.</p>
