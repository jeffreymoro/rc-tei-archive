                  – &amp; this lasted so short a time &amp; was so little serious while it lasted that it can
                  scarcely be called such. At Milan I purchased some books <span class="strikethrough">but xx</span> {but} this was not the place for executing your commission. Thence to Como where I
                  found <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</a> &amp; we remained three days. Bellaggio, twenty miles from Como upon the fork of the Lake,
                  is the finest single spot that I have ever seen, commanding three distant lake views,
                  each of the grandest character. Lugano was our next stage, &amp; somewhere here it is
                  that if climate &amp; scenery alone were to be consulted I should like to pitch my tent,
                  – perhaps at Laveno upon the Lago Maggiore. The Isola Bella upon that Lake is of all
                  extravagant follies the most absurd.

                           is much in evidence.</span></div>

                  is foolish to compare things which are in so many respects essentially different.
                  In the Maurienne &amp; indeed when you begin to descend into Piedmont the world seems
                  tumbling to pieces about your ears, of such perishable materials are the mountains
                  made. In the Simplon you have generally rocks of granite. A glorious Alpine descent
                  brought us into the Valais, – which even more than the Maurienne is the land of goitres
                  &amp; cretins, – both more numerous &amp; more shocking to behold than I could have believed
                  possible. At Martigny we halted &amp; crost to Chamounix by the Tete Noir.
