               <p>I am very much obliged to you for your information concerning the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Duke of Wellingtons</a> correspondence with General Dumouriez,

                           who defected to Austria in 1793 and lived in Britain from 1804. Dumouriez corresponded
                           with Wellington during the Peninsular War, advising him on the topography and geography
                           of Portugal – advice Wellington found largely inaccurate. As Southey was planning
                           his History of the Peninsular War (1823–1832) this correspondence might have contained

                  curiosity, &amp; for the sake of leaving nothing undone, than in the expectation of finding
                  much that would be either new or serviceable. For I believe I am in possession of
                  the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Dukes</a> views &amp; opinions during every part of the struggle, &amp; Dumouriez has published all
                  that he knew concerning Portugal, – &amp; also his own notions as to the method of defending
                  it. He was very desirous of obtaining employment there in the Portugueze army. Yet
                  if at any time you can procure me a sight of this correspondence, or inform me thro
                  what channel it may be procured, – you will confer upon me an additional obligation.</p>
