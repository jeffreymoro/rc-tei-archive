            <p class="indent1">During the month of November I expected to have seen you at Ludlow &amp; from day to day
               hoped I should be able to inform you on what day <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<sup>rs</sup> S.</a> myself &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</a> should set off from London in that direction. We were engaged to halt at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Wynnstay">Wynnstay</a>, &amp; at Liverpool on the after part of our journey. But the state of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith’s</a> health which seemed to grow worse instead of better in London made us very anxious
               to reach home, especially when winter was so close at hand; she herself seemed to
               pine for her native air, &amp; we were compelled to take the straightest road on that
               account, leaving all our friends unvisited. This was a great mortification.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We had been a long journey. A proposition of my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henrys</a> who was going with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyLouisa">his bride</a> to Brussels, induced me to determine upon a visit to Waterloo:

                  </div> &amp; the scheme ended in my taking the two Ediths with me, missing the family party which

               it in verse, – it is enough to have done that in prose, – but I describe the ground
               minutely such as it was when we saw it, &amp; thus accompanied as it will be with views
               of all the most memorable points of the action will give a certain kind of interest

                  at the arrangements which had been made, &amp; – especially in Liege, a sense of the injustice
