               <p>Here are some stanzas to be inserted between Stanzas 3 &amp; 4 of the Epilogue. They go
                  to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PopleWilliam">Pople</a> by this post &amp; I must see a revise of the proof, so that you have time (if no time
                  be lost) to find fault with them. I wrote them to supply the defect of personal good
                  wishes whereof you properly enough complained, – &amp; in this certainly I have not succeeded,
                  – my nature I suppose is not gracious enough. Take them however such as they are.
                  They require a change in the preceding couplet – <span class="ital">his</span> song instead of <span class="ital">the</span> &amp; <span class="ital">who</span> for <span class="ital">which</span>.
