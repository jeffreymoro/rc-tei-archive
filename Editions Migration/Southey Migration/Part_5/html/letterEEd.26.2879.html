            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Without preface or apology, let me tell my story. Some little time ago I received
                  a letter requesting me to peruse a manuscript poem, &amp; allow <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KnowlesHerbert">the writer</a> to dedicate it to me, if I thought it worthy of publication,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The Three Tabernacles’. Knowles was hoping to publish it and had written to Southey
                           asking permission to dedicate it to him. Following Knowles’s early death, Southey
                           himself published the poem as ‘Lines Written in the Churchyard of Richmond, Yorkshire’
                           in his article ‘Cemeteries and Catacombs of Paris’, Quarterly Review, 21 (April 1819),
                           359–398 (396–398).</span></div>
                  </div> – the writer stated himself to be very young, &amp; that his reason for publishing was
                  necessity. – I received the poem, it was brimfull of genius, with more of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</a> in it than of any other writer, – but no more than showed a proper &amp; discriminating
                  sense of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Byron">Lord Byrons</a> powers. It was crude, exuberant, &amp; ill-planned, – had it not been so I should have
                  thought it far less hopeful. Enquiring into the circumstances of the author I find
                  that his name is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KnowlesHerbert">Herbert Knowles</a>, that he is an orphan, taken from a very low situation &amp; placed at an excellent school
                  at Richmond in Yorkshire

                  when he was fit for college to place him upon this allowance as a sizar at S<sup>t</sup> Johns.

                  </div> These times have pressed heavily upon his relations, &amp; they could not fulfil their
                  promise; so that his hopes were struck down at once, &amp; he was advised to go as usher
                  to some school. In abhorrence of such a situation he thought of authorship. Of course
                  I pointed out the impracticability of this scheme. I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TateJames">his Master</a>,

                  thought was how to supply the thirty pounds annually for the next four years, – <span class="strikethrough">as</span> it will be one year before he is ready for Cambridge. Ten I will give myself, I think
                  you will not be displeased with me for having thought of you. And if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</a> had been in England I would have asked you to apply to him – amid all that storm &amp;
                  tumult of unhappy passions &amp; more unhappy opinions there must be good &amp; generous feelings,
                  – it is wholesome for him that they should be exercised, &amp; proud as he is it might
                  gratify him to have them acknowledged &amp; appealed to by one who condemns &amp; pities him
                  as I do.</p>
