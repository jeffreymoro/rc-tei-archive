               <p>I must not conclude without reverting to the unpleasant nature of our last letters,
                  – but it is only to say that on my mind it will leave no uncomfortable impression.
                  And as to the affair of the Correspondent, I had not the most distant suspicion that
                  it could in the slightest degree hurt you, or interfere with the Review. Stoddart
                  communicated his plan to me when I was last in town, – I promised him something then
                  for his first number, &amp; mentioning two or three subjects left him to chuse. – You
                  offer very liberally, &amp; more than I can avail myself of. For two or perhaps three
                  numbers in the year I may supply two articles each, – but hardly I think more than
                  six in the year: – indeed the first month that I can fairly command I must give to
                  the H. of the War,

               the <em>Quarterly Review</em>. In <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 15 (July 1816), 537–574, Southey reviewed a series of volumes by travellers in England,
               under the title ‘Works on England’. His review of ‘Ali Bey’ Domingo Badia y Leblich
               (1766–1818), <em>Travels of Ali Bey in Morocco, Tripoli, Cyprus, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, and Turkey,
                  Between the Years 1803 and 1807</em> (1816) also appeared in the<em>Quarterly Review</em>, 15 (July 1816), 299–345. Southey expected to receive £100 for each article, but
               Murray only agreed to £150 for the two. The <em>Courier</em>, 14 November 1816, had commended ‘Works on England’ calling it ‘a masterly consideration
               of the present state of the country’ and suggested it should be published as a pamphlet.
               This did not happen.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

                  Eminent Writers in France and England; and designed by presenting to each Nation a

                  a Mutual Good Understanding between them, and render Peace the Source of a Common
                  Prosperity</em>. Southey contributed a sketch of the life of John Wesley (1703–1791; <em>DNB</em>) to the first two numbers (1 (1817), 26–48; and 2 (1817), 157–176). However, the
