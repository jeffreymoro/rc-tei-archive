            <p>MS: Berg Collection, New York Public Library. ALS; 3p. <br> Previously published: Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), <em>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</em>, 6 vols (London, 1849–1850), IV, pp. 252–255 [misdated 17 March 1817].<br> Note on MS: The letter survives as an early draft, which is reproduced here. Southey
               made a fair copy, which appears not to have survived, and he this sent as an enclosure
               to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn on 19 March [1817], Letter 2948. Wynn’s absence from
               home meant there was a delay in his receiving it. By the time he did so the debate
               had moved on and so Southey decided to incorporate this letter into his pamphlet <em>A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M.P.</em> (1817).</p>
