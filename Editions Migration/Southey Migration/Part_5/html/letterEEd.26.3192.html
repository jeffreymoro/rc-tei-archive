            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>By yesterdays post a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ClarksonCatherine">M<sup>rs</sup> Clarkson</a> brought an answer to your enquiries concerning the school at Bury.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Spedding was seeking a school for his sons: John (1806–1839); James (1808–1881; DNB),
                           future literary editor, biographer and member of the Cambridge Apostles; and Edward
                           (1811–1832). He was clearly pleased with the results of his enquiry and John, James
                           and Edward were sent to the Grammar School at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.</span></div>
                  </div> I transcribe her words.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>“–to reply to your enquiries after Bury School, I think it is, if possible, increasing
                  in reputation, &amp; I am sure that D<sup>r</sup> Malkin

                           to 1828 he was headmaster of the Grammar School at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. The school’s
                           curriculum placed unusual, for the time, emphasis on the study of English literature
                           and on essay writing.</span></div>
                  </div> gives unremitting attention to it, &amp; takes an interest in his scholars far beyond
                  the generality of Masters. As a school for the education of the sons of gentlemen,
                  &amp; particularly of gentlemen who reside in Bury &amp; have their sons under their own eyes,
                  I should think there is scarcely one equal to it in the kingdom. The town is a good
                  one, &amp; there are schools &amp; masters of all descriptions. – We shall always feel ourselves
                  under the greatest obligation to D<sup>r</sup> Malkin for the patient attention which he paid to our boy
