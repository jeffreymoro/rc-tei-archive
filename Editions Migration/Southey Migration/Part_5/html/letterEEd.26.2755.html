               <p>All must very soon be over. I have seen him for the last time, – unless <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">he</a> should call for me.

                  </div> I am more composed than you would imagine, – but were it not for the assured hope
                  of recovering him in another state of existence I do not think I could support the
                  blow.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">My lease may be given up in twelvemonths. If I can possibly raise the means for so
               expensive a removal I will quit this country; where every object in which I have been
               accustomed to find enjoyment must continually keep open a wound, of itself little
               likely to close. There is no wisdom in fostering sorrows of this kind – God knows
               they need it not! It is best to seek for new circumstances, &amp; struggle against sorrow
               as we may. Were I certain that I could command the money necessary I would not hesitate,
               – but it can only come from my own exertions, &amp; Heaven only knows whether I can <span class="strikethrough">come</span> answer for them, – or how far my hand may be palsied by the blow which has reached
               my heart.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Talk with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> about <span class="strikethrough">this</span> the choice of situation, supposing the removal be possible. Somewhere within an easy
               distance of London – the nearer to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</a> the better</p>
            <p class="indent1">Often has the apprehension of this bereavement brought tears into my eyes at moments
               when otherwise I have been most happy: I hope I am resigned to it, &amp; that when I say
               Gods will be done the words come from the heart as well as the lips. But my best happiness
               my best hope is <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> cut up by the root, – it can spring no more in this world &amp; it is only in fixing
               my thoughts &amp; desires upon the next that I can find consolation.</p>
