            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have two matters of business to propose for your consideration. I believe I mentioned
                  to you, in town, the death of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DusautoyJames">a young Cantabrigian</a>, in whom I had taken much interest.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Dusautoy had first written to Southey at the beginning of 1813, enclosing some of
                           his poems and asking advice about publishing them. Southey replied (the letter does
                           not survive) and Dusautoy in turn wrote back. For the reply to this second letter
                           see Robert Southey to James Dusautoy, 12 February 1813, The Collected Letters of Robert
                           Southey. Part Four, Letter 2220. Southey had encouraged Dusautoy to study at Cambridge,
                           using his contacts to ease his path. Dusautoy had succumbed to an epidemic ravaging
                           the University city.</span></div>
                  </div> His papers (poems) are in my hands, and, in my judgment, a selection from them will
                  do honour to his memory. They will not have the religious interest of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke White’s</a> “Remains,”

                  </div> neither do they display so much correctness; but certainly there is as much power
                  and as much promise. In the way of memoir, I do not know that there will be much to
                  say. He was the eldest of a very large family; the father a half-pay officer, in very
                  straitened circumstances.

                  </div> Of course, the publication is with his approbation; but it remains to be seen what
                  circumstances of his son’s short life he would choose to have stated. Be that as it
                  may, there will be enough of general matter bearing upon the particular subject to
                  make an introduction. He was highly respected in his college, and known enough at
                  Cambridge to have excited some interest there; with this, and with my name, there
                  can, I think, be little risk in venturing one volume, the size of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">K. White’s</a>; the title, “The Remains of James Dusautoy, late of Emmanuel College, Cambridge;
                  with an Introduction, by R. S.,” &amp;c. My own judgment of these papers is sanctioned
                  by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>. Should you be willing to undertake the publication, upon our usual terms, I should
                  wish you to communicate your assent to Captain James Dusautoy, Totness, Devonshire,
                  and account with him for the eventual profits.

                           proved to be fruitless as Southey eventually abandoned the proposed edition.</span></div>
                  </div> I may hint to you, that it is desirable the letter should be franked.

               <p>The second point of business relates to a volume of “Travels in Brazil,” by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterHenry">Henry Koster</a>, a friend of mine who resided six years in that country, and went to it with the
                  advantage of speaking Portuguese as his own tongue, being an English-Lisboner by birth.
                  The line of his travels was from Pernambuco to Ceara, besides occasional excursions,
                  and a voyage to Maranham. The manner of his narration is plain and unaffected; and
                  the picture which it gives of the state of society in that country is highly curious.
                  In quantity, I should suppose it would make such a volume as Mawe’s;
