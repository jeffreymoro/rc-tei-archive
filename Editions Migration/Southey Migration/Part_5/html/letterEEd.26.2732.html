               <p>I had the honour of receiving your former communications. Addressed as they were to
                  the Writer of a paper in the Quarterly Review, I did not feel myself called upon to
                  reply to them, &amp; therefore avoided a task which could not but be painful.

                           215–275, especially at 242–243, Southey had criticised the conduct of Dalrymple when,
                           arriving in Portugal as commanding officer, he had, at the Convention of Cintra, signed
                           30 August 1808, allowed a defeated French army free passage out of the country with
                           its weapons and supplies intact. Dalrymple responded by writing to the Quarterly Review
                           and then sending Southey papers giving his version of events.</span></div>
                  </div> On no occasion have I ever felt myself more painfully embarrassed than in replying
                  now to this personal address. There is in it a tone of wounded feeling, expressed
                  in a manner so manly &amp; so devoid of all irritation, <span class="strikethrough">that</span> as to command my sincere respect, but my opinion of the Convention of Cintra remains
                  unaltered.

                           Inquiry was appointed and sat 14 November–27 December 1808, but it failed to punish
                           its authors, Dalrymple and Sir Harry Burrard (1755–1813; DNB). They were, however,
                           never afterwards given command and Southey fully endorsed the dim view that the Inquiry
                           took of Dalrymple and Burrard’s conduct.</span></div>

                  form without the O. the possible mistake did not occur to me, as it ought to have
                  done, until the absurdity of the erroneous statement was considered.

                           at anchor in Lisbon and while Russia was an ally of France, it was not at war with
                           Portugal. Admiral Dmitri Senyavin (1763–1831) insisted he would resist an attempt
