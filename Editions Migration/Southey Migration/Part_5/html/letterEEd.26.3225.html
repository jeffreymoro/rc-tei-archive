               <p>I was truly glad to be assured by your last letter of what I had before suspected,
                  that John had been more sinned against than sinning.

                           on 3–4 November 1818.</span></div>
                  </div> Indeed by what I have since learnt it appears that the Master

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>John Keate (1773–1852), clergyman and headmaster of Eton 1809–1834. One of the causes
                           of the rebellion was his insistence that boys should be in their boarding houses one
                           hour earlier, at 5pm. </span></div>
                  </div> acted at the beginning with great imprudence. If, as has been stated, he ordered the
                  boys to be locked up an hour earlier than usual, because some of them employed their
                  time improperly, it was assuredly an act of injustice towards all the others; &amp; any
                  person who knows what boys at a public school are, might have anticipated the consequences.
                  In reality one of the best things belonging to public schools is that they generate
                  that kind of spirit, which is liable to explode upon such occasions, but which gives
                  a master who knows how to direct it, the best hold upon his boys. In my time at Westminster
                  if any offence had been committed by some unknown person <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> {whom} it was thought necessary to discover &amp; punish nothing more was necessary than
                  to send one of the Monitors round to the different forms, &amp; ask who had done the thing,
                  – &amp; immediately the offender stood up &amp; avowed himself. The Master behaved injudiciously
                  at first, &amp; his conduct towards John has been abominably unjust. How easily might
                  it have happened that such a punishment might ruin a boys fairest prospects; – for
                  instance if instead of having a good &amp; affectionate father his fortune depended upon
                  the will of some relation who without enquiring into the merits of the case <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> might think it {a} sufficient reason for discarding him, because he had been expelled
                  from school. Public expulsion is {for this reason} too severe a punishment for any
                  thing except some heinous moral offence, – But boys are so tractable when they are
                  treated justly, &amp; generously &amp; kindly, that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BellAndrew">D<sup>r</sup> Bell</a> says it is almost always the Masters fault if they <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> require punishment at all.</p>

                           Tutor at Merton College, Oxford was felt by Southey to have provided Hartley Coleridge
                           with little help in his studies.</span></div>
                  </div> it is almost as honourable for him to have taken <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> a second class as for one who has been regularly bred to obtain the first place. About

                  he has the same subtlety in finding reasons to justify his own habits &amp; inclinations,
                  – &amp; a perverse love of paradox which never brings forth good fruits. – If his prospects
                  at Oxford should altogether fail, I believe it would be in my power to send him out
                  as Chaplain to Pernambuco, – (a house, &amp; 400£ a year) an appointment every way desirable

                           in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, was a book of which he was especially
                           fond. Derwent made little headway with the translation and so Sara Coleridge completed
                           it, and her Account of the Abipones, an Equestrian People of Paraguay was published
                           by Murray in 1822. Southey reviewed it positively in the Quarterly Review, 26 (January
                           1822), 277–323. Southey’s A Tale of Paraguay (1825) was based on Dobrizhoffer’s narrative.</span></div>

                  The book is a delightful one, tho it will lose something in translation, – for there
                  is a liveliness &amp; originality in the old Jesuits Latin which cannot be transfused.
