               <p>A natural but melancholy association reminds me of you. Between three and four years
                  ago, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DusautoyJames">a youth</a>, as ardent in the study of poetry as yourself, but under less favourable circumstances
                  of fortune, sent me some specimens of his poems, and consulted me concerning the course
                  of life which he should pursue.

                  </div> He wished to go to London, and study the law, and support himself while studying it
                  by his pen. I pointed out to him the certain misery and ruin in which such an event
                  would involve him, and recommended him to go to Cambridge, where, with his talents
                  and acquirements, he could not fail of making his way, unless he was imprudent. I
                  interested myself for him at Cambridge; he was placed at Emmanuel, won the good-will
                  of his college, and was in the sure road both to independence and fame, when the fever
                  of last year cut him off. I do not think there ever lived a youth of higher promise.
                  His name was <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DusautoyJames">James Dusautoy</a>. This evening I have been looking over his papers, with a view of arranging a selection
                  of them for the press. In seeking to serve him, I have been the means of sending him
                  prematurely to the grave. I will at least endeavour to preserve his memory.
