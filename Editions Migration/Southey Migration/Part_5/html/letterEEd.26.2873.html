                           Tower of London. A horizontal tricolour flag of red, white and green, an adaptation
                           of the French revolutionary tricolour, was displayed at Spa Fields and much commented

                  will be great reason to rejoice that the crisis has been thus accelerated. If they
                  do not act thus, instead of proving critical, it will be only a symptom of a more
                  general &amp; violent eruption. It is more than four years since I distinctly pointed
                  out the danger in the Quarterly Review (N<sup>o</sup> 16) – &amp; in the Edinburgh Register, – &amp; I have touched more than once upon the same
                  momentous topic during your absence.

                  folly was ever greater than the cry for retrenchment. The main evil arises directly

                  wished to have kept in arms. What is the consequence? there was already a want of
                  employment for the numerous hands whom peace inevitably threw out of work, &amp; here
