               <p>I have been chewing the cud upon your letter. The variety of my employments is such
                  that it enables me at any time to throw aside any train of uncomfortable thoughts
                  arising from the τα ούκ έφ ήμιν.

                           for the Westmorland election on 30 June 1818. Southey was dissuaded from publishing
                           his retort to Brougham, which he modelled on his pamphlet A Letter to William Smith,
                           Esq., M. P. (1817) and termed the ‘Tender Epistle’. The sections that were completed
                           were published (without naming Brougham) as a ‘Postscript’ to the second edition of
                           Carmen Triumphale (London, 1821), pp. 45–53.</span></div>
                  </div> I dare say you may long ere this have perceived in me a promptness to act with decision
                  – which <span class="strikethrough">may</span> sometimes amounts to temerity &amp; often to imprudence, – &amp; on the other hand a good
                  portion of docility in submitting to the advice of those whom I esteem &amp; love. I may
                  probably send up another portion of the intended letter, – but very likely it will
                  not go beyond your hands &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedfords</a>.</p>

               <p>On the other hand if I thought that any real good were to be done by a full representation
                  of the state of things, – I would gird up my loins to the task. How may this best
                  be done – in an anonymous volume, – the secret of which should rest between you &amp;
                  me to the exclusion of all other persons, – or in the character of Espriella,
