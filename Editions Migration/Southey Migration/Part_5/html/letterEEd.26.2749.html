                  to whom I feel so much inclined to converse with as with you.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I have touched in the latter part of my poem upon the general course of human events,
               &amp; the prospects of society. But perhaps I have not explained myself as fully &amp; as
               clearly as if I had been writing in prose. The preponderance of good &amp; the progressiveness
               of truth <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> knowledge &amp; general well-being, I clearly perceive, – but I have delivered an opinion
               that this tendency to good is not an overruling necessity, &amp; that that which is, is
               not necessarily the best that might have been, – for this in my judgement would interfere
               with that free agency upon which all our virtues &amp; indeed the great scheme of revelation
               {itself} is founded.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Time, my own heart, &amp; more than all other causes, the sorrows <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> with which it has been visited (in the course of a life that on the whole has been
                  happy in a degree vouchsafed to few even among the happiest) have made me fully sensible
                  that the highest happiness exists <span class="strikethrough">when</span> {as} the only consolation is to be found, in a deep &amp; habitual feeling of devotion.
                  Long ere this would I have preached what I feel upon this subject, – if the door had
                  been open to me.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s attendance at Balliol College, Oxford in 1792–1794 was financed by his uncle,
                           Herbert Hill, in the expectation that he would become a clergyman in the Church of
                           England. But Southey refused this career path as it would require him to subscribe
                           to the Church’s Thirty-Nine Articles.</span></div>
                  </div> But it is one thing to conform to the Church, preserving that freedom of mind which
                  in religion more than in all other things is especially valuable, – &amp; another to subscribe
                  solemnly to its articles. Christianity exists nowhere in so pure a form as in our
                  own Church, but even there it is mingled with much alloy, – from which I know not
                  how it will be purified. I have an instinctive abhorrence of bigotry, when dissenters
                  talk of the Establishment, they make me feel like a high Churchman, – &amp; when I get
                  among high churchmen, I am ready to take shelter in dissent.</p>

               <p>You have thrown a new light upon the York &amp; Lancaster age of our history by showing

                           DNB), by John of Gaunt (1340–1399; DNB) of the House of Lancaster.</span></div>
                  </div> I wish we had reformed the monastic institutions instead of destroying them. Mischievous
                  as they are in Catholic countries they have yet this good about them that <span class="strikethrough">they</span> they hold up something besides worldly distinction to the respect &amp; admiration of
                  the people, &amp; fix the standard of virtue higher than we do in protestant countries.
                  Would that we had an Order of Beguines in England.

                  </div> There are few subjects which have so unfairly discussed as the monastic institutions,
                  the protestant condemns them in the lump, – &amp; the Romanist crams his legends down
                  your throat. The truth is that they began in a natural &amp; good feeling, tho somewhat
                  exaggerated, – that they produced the greatest public good in their season, – that
                  they were abominably perverted, &amp; that the good which they now do, wherever they exist,
                  is much less than the evil. – Yet if you had seen, as I once did, a Franciscan of
                  fourscore, with a venerable head &amp; beard, standing in the cloister of his convent
                  where his brothers lay buried beneath his feet, &amp; telling his beads, with a countenance
                  expressive of the most perfect &amp; peaceful piety, – you would have felt with me how
                  desirable it was that there should be such institutions for minds so constituted.

                  poisoned: – almost the last words which she uttered were, that this was a blasted
