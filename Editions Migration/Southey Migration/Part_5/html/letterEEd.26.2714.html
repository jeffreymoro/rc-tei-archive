               the wedding, <em>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</em> (1816), ‘The Dream’, stanzas 19–21. Southey was particularly concerned about the
               Prince’s arms because he wanted to reuse sections of the poem he had initially drafted
               in 1814 for the Princess’s engagement to William, Hereditary Prince of Orange (1792–1849;
               King of the Netherlands 1840–1849). Comparing the published text with the draft in
               Keswick Museum and Art Gallery, Box B/414, shows that Southey was fortunately able
               to change Prince William’s ‘Belgic’ lion into Prince Leopold’s ‘Saxon’ lion (stanza
               19, line 2), as the arms of the royal houses of the Netherlands and Saxe-Coburg both
               contained lions as their supporters.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
