                           in the ‘Ministry of All the Talents’ in 1806–1807; but they fundamentally disagreed
                           with the Whig opposition on a number of points and were in many ways closer to the
                           position held by the government, e.g. on supporting the war with France in 1803–1815
                           and opposition to parliamentary reform. The Grenvillites finally decided to separate
                           from the Whigs in July 1817 to form a ‘third party’ and joined the government in 1822.</span></div>

               of All the Talents’ in 1806–1807; but they fundamentally disagreed with the Whig opposition
               on a number of points and were in many ways closer to the position held by the government,
               e.g. on supporting the war with France in 1803–1815 and opposition to parliamentary
               reform. The Grenvillites finally decided to separate from the Whigs in July 1817 to
               form a ‘third party’ and joined the government in 1822.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9.. </span><span class="noteBody">British newspapers had recently carried a number of extracts from Hamburg papers,
               e.g. <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, 8 December 1817. One of the extracts reported that in the Kamchatka peninsula ‘in
               the course of last winter an incredible number of bears have left the woods, frequently
               entered the houses of the Kamtschdales; in many places have attacked and devoured
               the inhabitants; nay traces have even been found of their having killed and devoured
               each other; at the end of the winter many bears were found who had perished of hunger.
               In several settlements they have killed from two to three hundred bears, the oldest
               Kamtschadales do not remember ever to have seen so many bears so savage and blood-thirsty.
               The cause of this savageness and of their hunger is, that for these two years past
               there has been an entire want of fish in the Kamschatka sea, and fish, as is well
               known, are the chief food of the bears, which being usually so abundant in those waters,
               they easily contrive to catch. A couple of shocks of an earthquake have been lately
               felt in the Peninsula.’</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               bounty to explore the area. Two Royal Navy expeditions were made. In April 1818 one
               commanded by David Buchan (1780–1838; <em>DNB</em>) and John Franklin (1786–1847; <em>DNB</em>) explored the Arctic sea around Spitsbergen; another commanded by John Ross (1777–1856;
