            <p class="indent1">The chest of oranges occasioned a great deal of speculation in this family, there
               was no indication whence it came, farther than that Liverpool was the place, but to
               whose good works it was to be set down we could not devise. I wish <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<sup>rs</sup> R.</a> had seen the children when it arrived; – I was expecting a box of books from Milan,
               they called me down with news that it was come, which to them was a great joy, but
               their astonishment when they discovered the contents would have made no bad subject
               for a picture. The oranges were very good, &amp; part of them are still existing in the
               form of marmalade, the first specimen of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughter Ediths</a> manufactory in this kind.</p>
