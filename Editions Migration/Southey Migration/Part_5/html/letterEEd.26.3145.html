                  </div> should not be treated with that respect which is always due to a work of laborious
                  research. And I assure you it is by no act or concurrence of mine that any unnecessary
                  severity ever finds its way into the Quarterly Review. The principle which I have
                  more than once declared is that whatever author comes before the public with the result
                  either of his observations as a traveller, or his researches in history, antiquities
                  &amp;c, is so far as he <span class="strikethrough">communicates</span> {adds} any new information to the existing stock of knowledge, a public benefactor,
                  to be thanked for what he had done, to be encouraged &amp; advised (if it be needful)
                  for what farther he may intend to do, but in no case to be treated with severity,
                  unless there be any mischievous opinions uppermost in his mind. For this is the only
                  fault which can either require or justify that tone of criticism at present, unhappily,
                  &amp; to the disgrace &amp; injury of literature, so prevalent. If a book be merely good for
                  nothing – <span class="ital">mole ruit suâ</span>,

                  perfectly ignorant into whose hands your brothers work will be consigned. – It has
                  more than once happened that papers in the Quarterly have been imputed to me by the
                  offended parties, when I have expressed to the publisher, in private, &amp; in the strongest

                  day, I say more barbarous, because you could not at that time have found any where
                  in Scotland men who in mind &amp; manners were entirely upon a par with the gentlemen
                  of England, as you find them now every where in Ireland. Education has been the great
                  instrument of the change, – a good deal also was owing to the military roads &amp; the
                  good use which was made of the military after the two rebellions.
