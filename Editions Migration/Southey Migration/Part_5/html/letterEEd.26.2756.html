                  </div> &amp; no equal affliction can ever again befall me for here was the very heart &amp; life
                  of <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> my happiness &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> my hopes. Do not however imagine that I shall give way to grief or that I am unmindful
                  of or unthankful for the blessings which I still possess.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">As the best proof that I <span class="strikethrough">do not indulge</span> mean to struggle against all dreadful recollections I am determined to leave Cumberland,
               if I can command the money necessary for such a removal. My furniture here is little
               in quantity, &amp; scarcely of any value. It will require 200£ to move ourselves &amp; the
               books, &amp; 400 more to sit down in another house, tho of course I shall go to the least
               possible expence in furnishing it. My lease expires in twelvemonths, – whether by
               that time I can raise 600 £ is doubtful. I cannot answer for my own exertions that
               is I know not {how} far my body will bear up, nor what farther trials may be in store,
               if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> health should give way under a blow which she is less able to bear than I am. At
               present she bears it well – but the stupor of grief is upon her.</p>

                  not venture, measured as my expenses of living will necessarily be <span class="strikethrough">xx</span>. If I cannot, where shall I house myself? – I should like to be on the sea coast
                  if I cannot be near my friends, – near Hastings for instance or possibly Bath, – of
                  all places the most abounding with conveniences for persons of limited means. But
                  certainly it would be best to be near London, where I might be near <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> &amp; you, &amp; the friends whom I love best. <span class="strikethrough">For life</span> <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx xx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxx xxxx xxxxx</span>.
