                           a Spanish galleon off the Bermuda Banks. Acting on advice provided by an ‘old Spaniard’
                           he searched ‘a few leagues to the northwards of Puerta de la Plata’. Another attempt
                           in 1687 succeeded in locating the wreck on a ‘shoal called The Boilers’, near Puerta
                           de la Plata. Phips received a knighthood and £11,000 (his share of the £250,000 salvaged

               Banks. Acting on advice provided by an ‘old Spaniard’ he searched ‘a few leagues to
               the northwards of Puerta de la Plata’. Another attempt in 1687 succeeded in locating
               the wreck on a ‘shoal called The Boilers’, near Puerta de la Plata. Phips received
               a knighthood and £11,000 (his share of the £250,000 salvaged cargo). The story was

               at Summerhill, near Ulverston 1817–1819. Robert Gregge Hopwood (1773–1854) had married
               in 1805 Cecilia Elizabeth Byng (1770–1854), daughter of John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington
               (1743–1813). However she was a first cousin, rather than a sister, of Georgiana Byng
               (1768–1801), first wife of Lord John Russell, later the 6th Duke of Bedford (1766–1839;
               <em>DNB</em>). Lady Russell had lived in Lisbon for two years for her health and was known to
               Herbert Hill and, possibly, John May. Derwent Coleridge was tutor to the Hopwoods’
               sons: Edward (1807–1891); Frank (1810–1890); and Hervey (1811–1881).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note27_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
