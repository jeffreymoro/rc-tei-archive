                  leisure which I could find has been given to its attentive perusal. This lapse of
                  time is not to be regretted, because it will have <span class="strikethrough">abated</span> blunted the edge of your resentment, &amp; I doubt not by this time you regard the criticism
                  of the Monthly Review just as it deserves. Such things are utterly unworthy of notice.
                  The easiest &amp; wisest course is to despise them; – recollect the abuse which I have
                  endured for so many years, &amp; you will <span class="strikethrough">kn</span> perceive that I practise what I preach.

                           by the Monthly Review, 82 (March 1817), 323–324, as ‘such a farrago as no human imagination
