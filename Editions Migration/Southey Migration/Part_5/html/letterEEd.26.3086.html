            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is not till this evening that I have been able to acknowledge your obliging letter
                  of Jan<sup>y</sup>. 2<sup>d</sup>. by thanking you for enriching my library with your works.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           of Southey’s library, is noted as ‘Presentation Copy, with an autograph note from
                           the author’.</span></div>
                  </div> They arrived only an hour ago in a box which I had long been expecting from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Mess<sup>rs</sup> Longmans</a>. I look with great pleasure to a careful perusal of them.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You have indeed Sir written in a spirit of true Catholic charity, in the true acceptation
               of the word. And did the question of a reunion depend upon such minds as yours, that
               most desirable of all objects would easily be effected. As yet, according to human
               judgement, it is far distant, – yet sooner or later we shall be one fold, under one
               Shepherd, – &amp; the increasing toleration of your Church is an advance toward it. I
               shall be much interested in your history of the English Catholics. Some of your martyrs
               (for I allow &amp; respect the name) were men every way excellent. I wonder that a collection
               of Southwells works is not published. He holds no mean rank among the Elizabethan
               poets, &amp; as a prose writer, he has rarely been excelled.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>His “Epistle of Comfort, to the Reverend Priests &amp; to the Honorable, Worshipful &amp;
                  other of the Lay sort restrained in durance for the Catholic faith” is a most beautiful
                  composition of its kind.

                           persecution. Southey owned an undated edition published in Paris, no. 2712 in the
                           sale catalogue of his library.</span></div>

               <p>I am still busy with the Jesuits in South America; – their establishments in the centre
                  of that continent among the Chiquitos &amp; the Moxos are less known than those in Paraguay,
                  – but not less interesting; &amp; had they not been placed in a most unhealthy region,
                  they would soon have outstripped them in prosperity.
