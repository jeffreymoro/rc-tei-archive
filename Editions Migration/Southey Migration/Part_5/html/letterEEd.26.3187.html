                           Lonsdale, had spoken at the hustings at Appleby on 30 June, attacking both Southey
                           and Wordsworth. Southey was dissuaded from publishing the retort that he discusses
                           here. Part of it finally appeared as a ‘Postscript’ to the second edition of Carmen

               As the <em>Courier</em> reported on 4 July, Brougham, campaigning for the parliamentary seat of Westmorland
               against the candidates favoured by Wordsworth’s patron the Earl of Lonsdale, had spoken
               at the hustings at Appleby on 30 June, attacking both Southey and Wordsworth. Southey
               was dissuaded from publishing the retort that he discusses here. Part of it finally
               appeared as a ‘Postscript’ to the second edition of <em>Carmen Triumphale</em> (London, 1821), pp. 45–53.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
