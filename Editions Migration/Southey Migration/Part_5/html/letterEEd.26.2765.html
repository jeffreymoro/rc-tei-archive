                  </div> As yet I do not perceive that I have gained strength, but I am certainly losing none.
                  I walk daily as much as is good for me, &amp; not more. And I never was more capable of
                  mental exertion, nor more disposed to it. Be assured that my mind will never be suffered
                  to prey upon itself.</p>

                  for it.
