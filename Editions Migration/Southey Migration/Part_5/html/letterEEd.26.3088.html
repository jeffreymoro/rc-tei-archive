                           When he reintroduced it in 1818 it was defeated in the House of Commons on 2 March
                           by 51 votes to 44. One reason for its defeat was opposition from some Whigs, who usually
                           supported electoral reforms, but were annoyed that the Grenvillite group, headed by
                           Wynn in the Commons, had formally separated from their Whig allies. Southey presumably
                           did not know that one of the Bill’s keenest supporters was Brougham, who hoped that

                  to be effected, if you persevere in bringing it forward. Our neighbours in Westmorland

                           which was dominated by the Lowther family, who were supporters of the government –
