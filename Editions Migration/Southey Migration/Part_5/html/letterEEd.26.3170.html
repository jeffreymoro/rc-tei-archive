                  – with the amiable intention I believe of setting my neighbours upon stoning me, –
                  this being the fashion with the rabble of his party.

                           to have attacked Southey and Wordsworth from the hustings. Southey did not finish
                           his response, which he termed his ‘Tender Epistle’, but parts of it saw print, without
                           mention of Brougham’s name, in a postscript to the second edition of Carmen Triumphale
