            <p class="indent1">Your health Grosvenor! in a glass of gin at eleven o clock in the morning. Now &amp; then
               this body of mine gets strangely out of order, – the pulse flags so that it is scarcely
               perceptible, &amp; I am led to discover it by a general feeling of languor, &amp; the excessive
               activity of the kidneys. The remedy is a <span class="ital">glass of ghosts</span> as the Dutch call it. The cause is beyond my knowledge. But for several years I have
               been used to this occasional ailment, &amp; it <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> brings with it little inconvenience &amp; no anxiety. I am very thankful that the circumstances
               of my life were not such as <span class="strikethrough">encouraged</span> would have encouraged me to foster a nervous disposition, which would probably have
               been the case had I been born to affluence, or if my moral nature first at the critical
               point of time had <span class="strikethrough">been</span> not been well braced with a true tonic philosophy. Otherwise I might have been as
               pitiable an object as poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a>, – who has been in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> this fortnight &amp; luxuriates in detailing to me the whole rise, progress &amp; symptoms
               of his insanity, – which I cannot but suspect exists almost as much in a diseased
               will as in a disordered imagination. It is very distressing to be with him sometimes,
               &amp; very wearying at others; – a great expence of time &amp; of spirits, neither of which
               I can well afford, – &amp; yet I would gladly afford him more of both, if there were a
               reasonable prospect of affording him any thing more than <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> temporary amusement rather than benefit.</p>

                  has been truly genial, – the finest that old people can remember, with just rain enough,
                  &amp; not more. Now indeed the weather is unsettled &amp; Monday was a soaking days rain.
                  I look sadly forward to the consequences of the dearth which must ensue in London,
