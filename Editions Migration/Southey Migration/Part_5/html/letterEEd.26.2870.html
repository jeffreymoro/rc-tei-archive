                  </div> Two classes of men are agreed upon this point, – the Liberales who conduct journals

                  </div> &amp; the priests whose influence extends over every body else. One great obstacle is
                  the pride of the Portugueze. As we {are} the least national of any people under heaven,
                  (for an English party, if it suited any party purpose would take up the cause of the
                  Devil himself against their own country) – the Portugueze are the most so, &amp; whatever
                  may be their principles, they unite instantly to resent the very shadow of a national
                  offence. Hence it is that they who desire the abolition cannot brook the suspicion
                  that it should be forced upon them, or demanded from their weakness. I wish you read
                  their journals, – it is scarcely credible to what an excess this national sensibility
                  is carried by them. – Pride &amp; weakness naturally produce suspicion, &amp; they have the
                  vice of supposing that in all our efforts for the suppression of the abominable traffic
                  there is some interested motive at the bottom. The two things needful are to undeceive
                  them upon this point, which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterHenry">Koster</a> will make his chief object, – &amp; to treat them with as much respect as possible; –
                  &amp; indeed much respect is due to them; they have been a great people, &amp; a great people
                  they must again become, for the finest part of the new world is their indefeasible
                  portion. Instead of reproaching them directly for not following the example of England
