            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I inclose for your perusal a letter which has this day come to my hands from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Peacockunknown">M<sup>r</sup> Peacock</a>, the person in whose house I lodged at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#ProspectPlaceLondon">Newington</a> twenty years ago. He is now confined in a private mad-house, according to his own
               account most unjustly. Most persons in a similar situation probably think the same.
               – but I very much doubt whether the circumstances in his case were ever such as to
               justify the treatment which he has received. Let me first state what I know of the
               circumstances, &amp; then, after seeing his letter you will be able to advise with me
               whether any thing can be done for his deliverance.</p>

                  </div> lived unhappily together, – &amp; I believe she hated her husband. He happened to be at
                  Yarmouth when the fleet anchored there after Duncans victory,

                           had won a decisive victory over the Dutch at Camperdown on 11 October 1797. As many
                           as a thousand British sailors may have been killed or wounded before the fleet started
                           to arrive back in Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on 17 October 1797.</span></div>
                  </div> &amp; went on board immediately, – before the wounded were taken out, &amp; while marks of
                  the carnage were every where apparent. The sight affected him so powerfully as certainly
                  to derange him for a time: – &amp; on his return home he wrote letters to the King
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  hand that she might dispatch them. The next morning he asked if she had sent them,
                  &amp; upon her replying in the negative, he observed that perhaps it was as well not.
                  She herself told me this, – but I suspect that the strongest proof of insanity <span class="strikethrough">which was to</span> {ever} produced against <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> him were these letters, which she preserved for that purpose.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Another instance (&amp; it is all that ever came to my knowledge) was his taking upon
                  himself in 1798 to make an opposition dinner at the Crown &amp; Anchor,

                           of the Whig opposition joined forces with the radical London Corresponding Society.
                           Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk (1746–1815; DNB) delivered a toast to ‘Our Sovereign’s
                           Health, the Majesty of the People’, which led to his being stripped of his public

                  </div> &amp; I believe <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Fox</a>, to meet the City Reformers. The madness here lay in making himself responsible for
                  the entertainment, &amp; it was put a stop to by his wife.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Farther than this I know nothing except that I received a letter from him in 1808
               from a place of confinement, &amp; replied to it according to the address which he then
               gave me. I received no farther communications from that time, – he says he has repeatedly

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I write with some degree of agitation, – partly from a sense of having left this poor
