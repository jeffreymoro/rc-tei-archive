                           1756, only returning to his native city in 1804. He was a Quaker who became immensely
                           wealthy through his ownership of the Coalbrookdale ironworks, but gave much of his
                           money to good causes, including, in Bristol, the Samaritan Society, an orphan asylum,

                           elders to decide for him that he should not marry Sophia Hopkey (b. 1708), the niece
                           of Thomas Causton (c. 1692–1746) of Savannah, Georgia. Wesley’s conduct in dropping

                  of his mind with great care throughout his writings, – he outgrew all his extravagancies,
