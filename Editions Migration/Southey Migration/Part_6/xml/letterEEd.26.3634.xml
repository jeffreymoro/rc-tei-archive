        <p rend="indent1"> I am not sorry to see that the Queens Lawyers are attacking the
                  Press,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The attempt to dissolve the
                  marriage of George IV and Queen Caroline (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>) had
                  failed when a Bill of Pains and Penalties was withdrawn on 10 November 1820, but
                  the controversy continued. On 9 February 1821 the Queen&#8217;s lawyers had successfully
                  persuaded a Middlesex Grand Jury to issue bills of indictment against the
                     <title>Courier</title> and <title>Morning Post</title> for libelling Queen
                  Caroline.</note> &#8211; ministry will hardly be such geese as not to prepare the same
               sauce for the gander; &#8211; &amp; with regard to that sort of license for which one of
               the new weekly papers is prosecuted, on whatever side it is used, it ought to meet
               with no mercy.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;new weekly paper&#8217; that
                  was being prosecuted was the pro-government Sunday paper, <title>John Bull</title>
                  (1820&#8211;1892), for its claim on 15 January 1821 that various aristocratic Whig
                  ladies had only visited Queen Caroline because their relative, Lady Caroline
                  Wrottesley (d. 1818), had previously had an affair with a servant. The libel
                  action had started in the Court of King&#8217;s Bench on 3 February 1821.</note> &#8211; The
               Courier I think will make a good fight of it, &amp; <del>spare no</del> omit no means
               in its own defence.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> By what I can learn from one of the Portugueze Journals printed in
                  London<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <hi rend="sup" />
            <title>Correio Braziliense</title> (1808&#8211;1822), a Portuguese journal published in
                  London, no. 3203 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> (which have
               been main causes of the revolution in Portugal) there are two revolutionary parties
               in that country of the most opposite views; one for an union with Spain, upon the
               scheme (I doubt not) of a federal commonwealth; &#8211; the other for raising the Duke de
                  Cadaval<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">An army revolt in Porto on 24
                  August 1820 had established a junta to run the country. It declared its intention
                  of organising elections to a Cortes, which were held in December 1820, and
                  demanded John VI (1767&#8211;1826; King of Portugal 1816&#8211;1826) return from Brazil, where
                  the Portuguese court had fled in 1807&#8211;1808. The Dukedom of Cadaval had been
                  created in 1645 for a junior branch of the Portuguese royal family, the House of
                  Braganza, and its incumbent at this time was Nuno Caetano Alvares Pereira de Melo,
                  6th Duke of Cadaval (1799&#8211;1837). His mother was Marie Madelaine Charlotte
                  Henriette Emile (1778&#8211;1833), youngest child of Anne-Charles-Sigismond de
                  Montmorency-Luxembourg, 10th Duke of Piney-Luxembourg (1737&#8211;1803), a distant
                  relative of the French royal family, the House of Bourbon. It was at least
                  rumoured at this time that the Duke of Cadaval was seeking the Portuguese
                  throne.</note> (a younger branch of the royal family to the throne, <hi rend="ital">his</hi> mother was a daughter of the Duke de Luxembourg, &#8211; of Bourbon
               blood, &#8211; but I think they cannot count upon the support of France in this ground. The
               majority probably wish only for an amendment in this old form of government; but
               nothing that is aimed at can bring back the commercial prosperity which Lisbon
               enjoyed before the late war, &#8211; that is inevitably lost, &amp; for ever.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is a good thing that Morillo<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Pablo Morillo y Morillo, Count of Cartagena and Marquess of La
                  Puerta (1775&#8211;1837), Spanish General. He had been sent to Venezuela in 1814 to
                  re-conquer the country for Spain. Following the liberal revolution of 1820 he
                  negotiated a year-long truce with the revolutionaries and returned to
                  Spain.</note> has found a fair opportunity of leaving the Venezuelans to quarrel
               among themselves; &#8211; they will soon begin to cut each others throats as lovingly as
               the people of Buenos Ayres, where they have sometimes two revolutions in a week.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata,
                  with its capital at Buenos Aires, had effectively been independent from Spain
                  since 1810. At this time it was riven by conflicts between those who advocated a
                  federalist and a unitary constitution.</note> If there were a settled Government
               in Spain, these miserable people in a short time would be sending over deputies to
               request that the Mother Country would put an end to their miseries by reassuming her
               former dominion over them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Next week I hope you will receive my hexameters,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title>
                  (1821).</note> &#8211; the last proofs were returned yesterday. It is a fair experiment,
               &amp; will find some partizans as well as plenty of assailants. But whatever comments
               &amp; criticisms it may call forth I have done with it, &amp; am thinking of other
               things.</p>
