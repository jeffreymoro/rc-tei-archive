                     by the Russian government to report on affairs in Germany and was a constant
                     critic of German liberals. Southey probably disapproved of the over-emotional
                     tone of Kotzebue&#8217;s plays, but in the 1790s, at least, they were also suspected
                     of political radicalism.</note>
