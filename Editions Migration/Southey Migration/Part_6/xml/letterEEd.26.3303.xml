        <p rend="indent1"> I am happy to hear that <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Peachy</ref> derives benefit from a place
               which will always be interesting to me as the spot where I first acquired
                  <del>that</del> &lt;a&gt; love for <del>the</del> grand scenery <del>of nature</del>, &#8211;
               the place where I first learnt to scramble among rocks, &amp; where when a boy I
               treasured up stores of imagery, &amp; enriched my mind with sights &amp; sounds &amp;
               feelings not to be obtained anywhere but in the school of nature. Those rocks &amp;
               woods were my best teachers, &#8211; &amp; never did any creature enjoy them with more
               delight than I did when I returned from Westminster at the Whitsun, &amp;
               Bartholomewtide holydays.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey attended
                  Westminster School 1788&#8211;1792. The boys received three weeks&#8217; holiday at Whitsun
                  and one month at &#8216;Bartholomewtide&#8217; &#8211; in effect the summer holiday, named after St
                  Bartholomew&#8217;s Day on 24 August.</note> &#8211; Our house is becoming more chearful, <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>

                  on 24 February 1819.</note> to move-about again, tho by no means well; &#8211; the rest
               of the family are going on well.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The worst news I have to tell you is that the Lake is at this time in
               the same condition as the funds, &#8211; falling, falling, falling; &#8211; &amp; like the funds,
               not from the natural course of things, but from the interference of persons who when
               things were well would not be content to leave them as they were.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The House of Commons was debating legislation to
                  recommence the convertibility of paper currency to gold, which had been suspended
                  since 1797. The legislation passed on 2 July 1819 and convertibility was restored
                  on 1 May 1821, but the period 1819&#8211;1821 witnessed a fall in commodity prices and
                  rising unemployment.</note> You will perceive from this that upon the financial
               question, I agree with Sir Robert Peel &#8211; not with <ref type="m" target="people.html#Peel">his son</ref>; with the late Earl Stanhope,
               &#8211; not with <ref type="m" target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Lord
               Grenville</ref>, &#8211; &amp; with the London Merchants, not with the
               Finance Committee.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Peel had chaired the
                  House of Commons Select Committee that had recommended the restoration of
                  convertibility in 1819; his father, Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet (1750&#8211;1830;
                     <title>DNB</title>), textile manufacturer and MP for Tamworth 1790&#8211;1820,
                  disagreed with him and presented a petition to the House of Commons on 24 May 1819
                  against the resumption of cash payments. Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope
                  (1753&#8211;1816; <title>DNB</title>), the radical peer, had declared in a speech in the
                  House of Lords on 16 July 1811: &#8216;To believe gold necessary to a circulating medium
                  was an idea only fit for Hottentots&#8217;; Lord Grenville had spoken in the House of
                  Lords on 21 May 1819 in favour of restoring convertibility. The petition presented
                  by Sir Robert Peel on 24 May was from a group of &#8216;London Merchants&#8217;, in opposition
                  to the conclusions of the &#8216;Finance Committee&#8217; chaired by his son.</note> All will
               no doubt be well hereafter both with the funds &amp; the lake, &#8211; but it is very
               certain that a great deal of immediate inconvenience is occasioned by the experiments
               which are going on with both, &#8211; &amp; in the affairs of the Lake you are intimately
                  concerned.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Derwentwater Estate was
                  undertaking a large-scale drainage project to improve the quality of its land
                  around Derwentwater. The Estate was managed on behalf of Greenwich Hospital
                  (founded 1694 to support retired sailors).</note> At this moment every pier is
               dry, &#8211; &amp; they are not yet contented, but mean to lower the water a foot &amp;
               half more. The object is to convert what is now unsightly &amp; useless marsh-land,
               into good <del>pa</del> meadow, &amp; so far the object is good &amp; the appearance
               of the Lake at its head &amp; its foot will <del>admittedly</del> be greatly
               improved, &#8211; unless (which <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calvert</ref> apprehends) they should uncover as much marsh as they
               gain. The shores which are left dry will be some time in acquiring any covering for
               their nakedness: &#8211; there is a vile belt around your island;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Derwent Isle, an island in Derwentwater, which Peachy had
                  purchased in 1796. He also rented some land from the Derwentwater Estate on the
                  shore opposite the island.</note> however you will do with it whatever can be
               done, &amp; in the course of a few years, what is now an eye-sore will add some thing
               to the value as well as the extent of the place. I am afraid your <del>xx</del> usual
               landing place on the island will be useless, &amp; that a new one must be
                  <del>found</del> made more to the N.W. where the water deepens.</p>

                  of a Nottinghamshire banker, had bought Derwent Isle (then known as Vicar&#8217;s
                  Island) and built a house, fort and &#8216;Druid&#8217; stone circle on the land, before
                  selling it to Peachy in 1796. On the lake-shore he built Barrow House, overlooking
                  a waterfall which he diverted and enlarged &#8211; the Pocklingtons retained the
                  ownership of Barrow House. Joseph Pocklington had left this house to his
                  great-nephew, Joseph (1804&#8211;1874). As he was a minor, the latter&#8217;s affairs were
                  managed by his father, Major Roger Pocklington (1775&#8211;1847).</note> fourteen in
               number, including servants. They came in fine weather, in the very sweetest season of
               the year, when a week is worth a month of any other season; &amp; they have been in
               consequence so much delighted with the place, that Major Pocklington, I hear, has
               written to Ponsonby, saying he is sorry that he ever agreed to let the house, &amp;
               intimating a wish that Ponsonby would release him from the agreement.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Lieutenant John Ponsonby of the Royal Navy and his
                  wife (name and dates unknown) had signed an agreement to rent Barrow House.</note>
               This is placing him in a most unpleasant situation, after he has made all his
               arrangements with a view to residing there: &amp; I believe he is not disposed to
               accede to the Majors wishes.</p>

                  his undue depreciation by Bowles, in particular the charge that Pope drew his
                  images &#8216;from art more than from nature&#8217; (I, p. 262). Bowles responded with
