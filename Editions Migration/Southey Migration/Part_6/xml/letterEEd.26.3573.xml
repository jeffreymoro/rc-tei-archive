        <p rend="indent1"> Your <del>pamphlett</del> &lt;little parcel&gt; has duly reached me. I am much obliged to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Fry<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Fry (1780&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), Quaker, prison reformer and philanthropist. When
                  she discovered Southey was planning to write the life of George Fox (1624&#8211;1691; <title>DNB</title>), founder of Quakerism, she had
                  visited Southey, hoping to dissuade him, but eventually agreed to help in the project; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 27
                  October 1820, Letter 3544.</note> for the &lt;pamphlett&gt; to you for the trouble you have taken in forwarding it. I am obliged to you
               also for your letter, as it becomes me to be to any one who in the spirit of good will endeavours to set me right, where he thinks me
               to be wrong.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is <del>exceedingly</del> &lt;very&gt; probable that the passage quoted from Cotton Mather is as you represent it, a
               collection of <del>choice</del> expressions culled from one or more of Fishers works, &amp; not a simple extract, which I
                  <del>certainly</del> &lt;had&gt; <del>considered</del> &lt;supposed&gt; it to be; &#8211; a mistake which I <del>am very</del> read<del>y</del>ily
                  <del>to</del> admit, was made for want of due consideration.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

                     the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), I, p. 429, in which Southey quoted Cotton Mather (1663&#8211;1728;
                     <title>DNB</title>), <title>Magnalia Christi Americana, or the Ecclesiastical History of New England from 1620 to 1698</title>
                  (London, 1702), Book 7, p. 26; no. 1904 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. This recorded the denunciation by an early
                  Quaker, Samuel Fisher (1605&#8211;1665; <title>DNB</title>), of John Owen (1616&#8211;1683; <title>DNB</title>), Nonconformist preacher and
                  theologian.</note> The passage appeared to me a curiosity, &amp; as such I inserted it, in connection with John Owens name, with as
               little reference to the existing Society of &#8220;Quakers&#8221; as if no such Society had been in existence. Nothing indeed could be farther from
               my intention than that of offering any offence to a community of Christians, which as a community I respect, &amp; among whose members
               there are some for whom I <del>entertain</del> &lt;feel&gt; great individual &amp; personal respect &amp; regard.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <del>With regard to</del> the opinion expressed &lt;in that note&gt; concerning the railing language of the Quakers in their
               first age, I believe <del>it</del> to be well founded.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  freely, and exceeded all other sectarians.&#8217;</note> You have <del>xxxxx</del> &lt;adduced&gt; some strong instances from Cotton Mather, &#8211;
               but neither in Cotton Mather, nor in any other author, Churchman or Sectarian, with whose writings I am acquainted, could you find page
               after page of pure railing, such as is found in some of the books of the early Quakers, &#8211; Edward Burroughs<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Burrough (1634&#8211;1663), early Quaker and polemicist.</note> for example. I can however admire what

               man, no greater injury can be done to him than that of concealing his faults &amp; errors, for the sake of representing him as perfect.
               For a judicious reader &lt;in perusing a panegyric&gt; is always likely to abate more &lt;of his admiration&gt; <del>from an undeservin xxxx
