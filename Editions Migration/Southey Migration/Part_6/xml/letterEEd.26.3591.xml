        <p rend="indent1"> The mystery concerning the Peninsular War is explained at last.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                     <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832). Southey had wished it to be printed by William Nicol (d. c. 1855),
                  but Murray insisted on using his regular collaborator, Thomas Davison (1766&#8211;1831).</note> Yesterday I received four sheets of it,
               with a note from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>. He says &#8220;I hope you will not think me very inconsistent if
               I entreat you not to press me about the printer. Both <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> &amp; myself have
               formed connections in this line who are occasionally most importantly serviceable to us in our business, &amp; therefore feel
               exceedingly hurt when a work so important as yours in every respect is taken from them. &#8211; Have the goodness to say that I had long ago
               promised the work to another printer, &amp; had forgotten it, &#8211; it has been so long in preparation.&#8221;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> He says more to the same purport which need not be transcribed. The matter is now plain, &#8211; he has been ashamed to
                  <del>xxy</del> say that he did not mean to keep his promise, knowing in how uncomfortable a situation it would place me, &#8211; &amp; so
               delayed it till it could be delayed no longer. &#8211; I can do no more, &amp; am very sorry that the matter ends thus, &amp; that your
               wishes &amp; mine should thus be thwarted. Tell W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Nicol this. &#8211; Who is printing it I do not yet know, &#8211; the proofs
               came under an Admiralty frank, &amp; for want of any other direction I must send them back thro the same channel.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If it had not been for the vexation which thus accompanied it, the arrival of these first proofs would have been the
               most chearing event of this Christmas. When I am <hi rend="ital">in</hi> so far in printers ink, the stimulus to go on is never
               wanting; &#8211; &amp; the prospect of three volumes in which I am now fairly embarked <del>has also the</del> &lt;has upon me&gt; an encouraging
               &amp; exhilarating effect.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The same post which brought the historical proofs, brought also the last &amp; larger portion of the paper concerning
               the S.S.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of <title>The Works of the Reverend William Huntington, S. S. Minister
                     of the Gospel, at Providence Chapel, Gray&#8217;s Inn Lane, Completed to the Close of the Year 1806</title> (1811) appeared in
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 24 (January 1821), 462&#8211;510.</note> I have written to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> requesting him to send me a set of the proofs, telling him that I know he will put
               this production into his <hi rend="ital">boot</hi>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">In other words, Southey objected to Gifford
                  editing the article; he was an ex-shoemaker, hence the pun.</note> &amp; that I wish to have a copy of it in its entire state. It is
               a paper which will interest the <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Master of the Rolls</ref>, &amp; which pleases me much
               better than some others have done that have taken far better with the public than this is likely to do.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My next proof will probably be of the Vision,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of
                     Judgement</title> (1821).</note> which I shall like much to see in types. &#8211; I have the preface to write, &#8211; &amp; I have called to
               mind in time that I have omitted to mention one of the greatest men of the last reign &#8211; Hogarth.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">William Hogarth (1697&#8211;1764; <title>DNB</title>), English painter. He was added to the list of &#8216;The Worthies of the Georgian Age&#8217; in
                     <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), Canto 10, lines 11&#8211;12.</note> Offence I doubt not will be given to some persons by
               the omission of Pitt;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">William Pitt (1759&#8211;1806; <title>DNB</title>), Prime Minister 1783&#8211;1801,
                  1804&#8211;1806, and creator of the Act of Union (1800) between Great Britain and Ireland.</note> &#8211; I acknowledge his English spirit, I
               like the Union, I admire his courage, &amp; for that quality wish he were alive again, &#8211; but I never can think him a statesman, &amp;
               therefore cannot place his name among those which will stand high in the estimation of after ages.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> God bless you. The mountains will probably be perrywigged when I rise tomorrow, for it is just now as cold as
               de-Kiggle, as windy as de-Wiggle, &amp; as cloudy as de-Cliggle. &#8211; I have had a letter from the Czar.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander I (1777&#8211;1825; Tsar of Russia 1801&#8211;1825).</note> And I have sent you the reprint of the Carmen &amp;c &#8211;
               where you will find a postscript to the Notes, tolerably well-seasoned.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">A combined second
                  edition of <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (1814) and <title>Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, His
                     Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia, and His Majesty the King of Prussia</title> (1814), published as <title>Carmen
                     Triumphale, for the Commencement of the Year 1814: Carmen Aulica. Written in 1814, on the Arrival of the Allied Sovereigns in
                     England</title> (1821). In <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (London, 1821), pp. 45&#8211;53, there was a &#8216;Postscript&#8217;, which had
                  originally been written in 1818 as a response to Brougham&#8217;s reported attack on Southey from the hustings on 30 June 1818, during the
                  General Election contest in Westmorland.</note> This is intended to form a volume with the Carmen Nuptiale,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>Lay of the Laureate</title> (1816).</note> &#8211; but in binding it must be placed first.</p>
