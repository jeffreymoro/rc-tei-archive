						(1784&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), Scottish journalist, was fatally wounded in a duel on 16 February 1821 and died
						eleven days later. His opponent was Jonathan Henry Christie (1792&#8211;1876), the London representative of
							<title>Blackwood&#8217;s Edinburgh Magazine</title> (1817&#8211;1980), with which Scott was engaged in a bitter quarrel. In
						particular, Scott objected to <title>Blackwood&#8217;s</title> personal attacks on authors, and responded by making
						personal attacks on those associated with <title>Blackwood&#8217;s</title>. </note> &#8211; at <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthChristopher">Wordsworths</ref> one morning when I was last in town, &amp;

Its
						publisher, Robert Baldwin, sold it to John Taylor (1781&#8211;1864; <title>DNB</title>), and James Augustus Hessey
						(1785&#8211;1870) and Taylor became editor 1821&#8211;1825.</note> &#8211; but he himself was in the right way to make it

					journalist, &amp; go the whole lengths of that rascally faction, with which his only sympathy was that of a dislike
					to the institutions of the country. &#8211; I am sorry for his fate; he certainly provoked it, &#8211; but tho wrong in the
					quarrel, he was right in the feeling which led to it. &#8211; Some good however will arise, if this catastrophe of a
