          <salute rend="indent0"> My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> The original error in this unpleasant business can I think only be
               explained by supposing an error in writing 3 or <hi rend="ital">5</hi>00 &#8211; instead of
               3 or <hi rend="ital">4</hi>: &#8211; in reply you advised the <hi rend="ital">larger
                  sum</hi>, &amp; most unluckily M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> WR in her letter to me
               specified no sum when she said her &#8220;debt&#8221; was lying in the bankers hands at my
                  disposal.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The letter deals with an
                  embarrassing, and potentially very damaging, situation relating to the refusal by
                  a bank in London to pay a bill of exchange presented on Southey&#8217;s behalf because
                  an incorrect (and higher) sum had been entered on the bill. It therefore looked as
                  if Southey had deliberately, and fraudulently, overcharged for his services. The
                  money Southey was owed was payment for writing an &#8216;account&#8217; of David Pike Watts
                  (1754&#8211;1816), a fabulously rich wine merchant and philanthropist, who had been an
                  important supporter of Andrew Bell&#8217;s educational schemes and owned the Storrs Hall
                  estate on Windermere. He was also the uncle of the painter John Constable
                  (1776&#8211;1837; <title>DNB</title>). The work had been commissioned by Watts&#8217;s
                  daughter and heiress, Mary Watts-Russell (1792&#8211;1840), who had married, in 1811,
                  another heir to a business fortune, Jesse Watts-Russell (1786&#8211;1875), MP for Gatton
                  1820&#8211;1826. They lived at Ilam Hall in Staffordshire and had eight children.
               </note> &#8211; I desired <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> to <hi rend="ital">go</hi> with the draft, &#8211; not
               entering into any farther explanation with him, than that of telling him (as a friend
               to whom I tell every thing which concerns me) how I became entitled to such a
                  sum.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">For his instructions, see Southey
                  to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 27 October 1820, Letter 3544.</note> His reply, upon
               the receipt of which I wrote to you, said &#8220;yesterday I carried your draft for
               acceptance, &amp; when it is due will take care that it shall be received. If I
               should go to the next world in the mean time, you must enquire for it of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dickie, the Chief Clerk in Coutts&#8217;s House,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Andrew Dickie (d. 1834), confidential clerk in
                  Coutts&#8217;s Bank and a partner from 1827.</note> who has kindly undertaken to do what
               is necessary in the business.&#8221; &#8211; Certainly I understood by this that he had carried
               it to Sir W Poles<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The banking firm of Sir
                  Peter Pole, 2nd Baronet (1770&#8211;1850), MP for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight 1819&#8211;1826, who
                  were the bankers of Mary Watts-Russell.</note> &amp; that it had been accepted. &#8211;
                  <del>His</del> This letter was dated Nov 4. Nov. 7 He writes the letter &lt;of&gt; which
               I sent you a copy, &amp; upon re examining that letter <del>x</del> it appears to me
               that my first opinion was right, &#8211; &#8216;the house of Pole &amp; Co refuse to accept the
               Bill <hi rend="ital">which I presented to them</hi> &amp;c. The inference seems to be
               that they accepted it at first conditionally, &#8211; as it was drawn (&#8220;as you have been or
                  <hi rend="ital">may be</hi> advised) &#8211; that they wrote concerning it to Ilam,
               &amp; received the advice which led to its rejection. This seems to be the natural
               inference, &amp; yet I can hardly think it possible. For if I had drawn beyond the
               intended amount M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> WR would surely have concluded there was a
               mistake somewhere, not that I could have committed <del>an action</del> a fraudulent
               &amp; scandalous action. But however that may be, my character is brought into
               question at the Bankers.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> For the first time in my life I am utterly at a loss how to act. <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> is at this time too closely engaged at the
               Exchequer, &amp; also too much an invalid to go to the Bankers, &#8211; &amp; indeed to
               enter into explanation with them, &amp; ask their permission to draw for the smaller
               sum, would be <del>to xxxx</del> &lt;like&gt; putting myself on my defence, &amp;
               expressing a doubt whether that permission might be granted. With the business of
               protesting it I had, as you know, nothing to do, &#8211; except to feel the whole
               impropriety &amp; the whole inconvenience. The bill is in <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedfords</ref>
               hands, I can desire him to burn it &amp; to pay the costs incurred, &amp; I am
               inclined to think that the best &#8211; &amp; only course I can pursue is to do this, &amp;
               let the matter rest, till you have an opportunity of explaining it. The money would
               have come seasonably, &#8211; but come when it may now, it will be dearly earned, this
               vexation being taken into the account.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Bell&#8217;s reply advised Southey to notify the bank that the bill was withdrawn
                  and to defer asking Mary Watts-Russell for any payment for his services until
                  after the memoir was completed. Bell also offered a loan to help Southey over any
                  short-term financial problems created by this. See Southey to Grosvenor Charles

               questions concerning the Aldgate school, &#8211; a topic of no small importance in such a

                  England to do so. See <title>Some Account of the Late David Pike Watts, Esq.: with
