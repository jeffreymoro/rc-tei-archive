        <p rend="indent1"> The Dean of Worcester<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">John Banks Jenkinson (1781&#8211;1840; <title>DNB</title>), Dean of Worcester,
                  1817&#8211;1825. He was not known to Southey, but he was the first cousin of the Prime
                  Minister, Lord Liverpool, whom Southey had met in 1820.</note> (with whom I have
               no acquaintance) has lately sent me the copy of a fragment of a letter, which he says
               was one of those taken from Wesleys bureau by his wife, when she finally left
                  him.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Wesley (1709/10&#8211;1781). She
                  was a widow at the time of her marriage to John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791;
                     <title>DNB</title>) in 1751. The relationship was troubled, and on 23 January
                  1771 Mary left her husband, taking with her some of his correspondence. </note> He
               vouches for its authenticity, &amp; refers me for proofs to a quarter where I am now
               making farther enquiry.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to
                  [Glocester Wilson], 29 December 1820, Letter 3596.</note> The letter is from one
               of his female correspondents, &#8211; a Miss Briggs,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Briggs (1751&#8211;1822), whose family were devout
                  Methodists and close friends of John Wesley.</note> remonstrating with him upon
               the improper liberties which he had taken with her, &#8211; it is in a strain of the
               warmest affection, &amp; the most unbounded reverence; &amp; yet at the same time
               shows that she was a virtuous woman, &amp; was alarmed at his conduct. He must then
               have been about sixty five years of age. The internal evidence of the letter is in
               favour of its authenticity. If authentic, it would prove that Wesley had fallen into
               a temptation incident to the sort of Confessor-like situation in which he had placed
               himself, &#8211; &amp; trusting probably to his age, had indulged it as far as he wished.
               The fact, if fact it be, would not affect the opinion which should be formed
               concerning all the former part of his life, nor concerning the general tenour of his
               conduct. But it would show, like many cases in Catholick history, how easily
               spiritual &amp; carnal affections may be blended, &#8211; which needs no additional proof.
               On the whole I shall be sorry to find it genuine, because the publication of such a
               fact will certainly do more harm than good, &#8211; &amp; yet having written the life of
               Wesley, I do not see how I can, consistently with that perfect fairness in which the
               task has been performed, conceal <del>such</del> it, after it has come to my
                  knowledge.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Wilson&#8217;s reply made it
                  clear that his mother had been given a copy of the letter, not the original.
                  Southey, unconvinced by the reliability of such a copy and concerned that it had
                  been part of Mary Wesley&#8217;s campaign to ruin her husband&#8217;s reputation, decided
                  against publishing it; see Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 7 February 1821,
                  Letter 3628.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> You will find me a good deal altered, &#8211; for I feel the effect of Time
               in more ways than one, &#8211; physically in an infirmity which will probably (&amp; God
               knows how soon) incapacitate me for walking, if it does not do more;<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was suffering from a rectal prolapse; see

                  <del>xx</del> morally, in nothing so much, as in certain anxious thoughts, to
               which in younger days I was a stranger, concerning my ways &amp; means, as I grow
               older, &amp; a decay of power is to be apprehended, or any of those accidents which
               flesh is heir to. It is only now that I have first a prospect of accumulating any
               property during my life, &amp; that slowly. Ten years would probably make me master
               of as many thousand pounds, &#8211; but who can calculate upon ten years! certainly not I.
               These thoughts however do not recur very frequently, neither do they leave any deep
               impression, &#8211; but I know that ten years ago I was a stranger to them, &amp; that they
               belong to the decline of life. Decline of mental power I am not sensible of in any
               other way, than that I continue now to be a poet rather by profession than by
               choice.</p>

               The rhythm to my ear is good, &amp; well suited to the subject on which it is
