          <salute rend="indent0"> My dear Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You are a happy man who can enjoy the business as well as the leisure
               of life, &amp; carry with you temper &amp; talents as well suited to the House of
               Commons, as to the retirement of Llangedwin. To one at a distance from the political
               Cockpit the times <del>are more in</del> &amp; the measures of Government are more
               interesting than the debates. For &lt;the&gt; days are past when the speeches of Opposition
               might be read with pleasure &amp; advantage by those who differed from the speakers
               in opinion &amp; disapproved their conduct. Nothing is now left but the gall &amp;
               bitterness of faction: instead of logic &amp; eloquence you have personalities &amp;
               calumny, &amp; the place of argument is supplied by the hardihood which advances
               again &amp; again the same shameless misrepresentations. We shall not appear a very
               wise people in the eyes of posterity. For what absurdity can be greater than that of
               sacrificing the very end &amp; purpose of law to the formalities of law! The case of
                  Sherwin<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">William Sherwin (dates
                  unknown), a radical printer and publisher, shielded himself from prosecution by
                  using others to run his bookshop and periodical, <title>Sherwin&#8217;s Weekly Political
                     Register</title> (1817&#8211;1819).</note> is a pregnant instance &#8211; here is a fellow
               publishing the most direct excitations <del>of</del> to assassination &amp;
               rebellion, openly, week after week, &amp; with his name to every paper: &amp; yet we
               are told it is impossible to bring the crime home to him! There are fifty instances
               of the same kind, wherein the guilt of the offender is notorious &amp; is not even
               attempted to be denied, &amp; yet he entrenches himself in quibbles &amp;
               technicalities &amp; bids defiance to justice. If this be not <hi rend="ital">propter
                  legem, legis perdere causas</hi>
          <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;To
                  lose legal cases on account of the law&#8217;.</note> I know not what is.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am satisfied with the measures of government as far as they
                  go,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The government had introduced the
                  &#8216;Six Acts&#8217; to suppress radical agitation, including a new Criminal Libel Act.
                  Habeas corpus was the legal principle that prevented imprisonment without trial;
                  it had been suspended in 1817&#8211;1818.</note> &amp; think the Ministry right in not
               suspending the H. Corpus, &#8211; that would only have put off a crisis which will become
               dangerous the longer it is delayed. The restrictions upon the press indeed are not
               worth much; but we may judge from the <del>clamour</del> opposition which is made to
               them, what a clamour would have been raised against more efficient acts.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have a good deal to say upon the prospects of society. Whether the
               present ferment may subside without an explosion, or not, there are great &amp;
               increasing difficulties before us, to the extent &amp; magnitude of which I cannot
               shut my eyes. A strong government, a wise administration &amp; a flourishing trade
               might enable us to overcome them, to attain a state of prosperity, &amp; place things
               in such a train as might promise to render that prosperity durable. But we have
               neither of these, nor any hope, nor any chance <del>at present</del> of obtaining
               them. These are uncomfortable thoughts. &#8211; Enough of them therefore for the
               present.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have not heard immediately from <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> concerning my contingencies
               upon Ld Somervilles death;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Cannon
                  Southey&#8217;s (d. 1768) fantastically complex will gave Southey some hope of
                  inheriting property at Fitzhead in Somerset, following the death of Southey&#8217;s
                  third cousin, and John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir, John Southey Somerville, 15th Lord
                  Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#8211; but from other quarters I
               gather that his Lordship did all he could to defeat them, &amp; as of course he had
               good legal advice for what he was doing, it is most likely that he has been
               succesful. If it should prove so, the chance has never entered enough into my
               thoughts, for me to feel it as a disappointment: nor indeed would I, as far as myself
               am concerned, <del>xx</del> consent to purchase the whole property, at the cost of
               anxiety which a chancery suit would induce.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At this time of year I am left altogether without any interruption
               from without. There is no chance of seeing even a stray visitor, &amp; I am as busy
               &amp; as comfortable, as a silkworm who is working upon his cone &amp; has just shut
               himself in from the external world. I am reviewing <ref type="m" target="people.html#CoxeWilliam">Coxes</ref> Marlborough,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of William Coxe, <title>Memoirs
