                  Scot who was employed on a number of delicate diplomatic missions and may well
                  have been a government spy. In 1815 he was appointed one of the Commissioners of
                  Liquidation, Arbitration and Deposit, who adjudicated on claims by British
                  citizens for loss of property against the French government. Southey dined with
                  him in Paris on 17 May and 19 May 1817, and Mackenzie offered to provide some
                  details of his wartime activities. Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War,
                  </title>3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, pp. 657&#8211;659, dealt with Mackenzie&#8217;s role in
                  the evacuation of the Spanish Division of the North from northern Europe in August
                  1808.</note> note which proves beyond all possibility of doubt that there are as

                  1682&#8211;1685.</note> this morning, for the first time, it amused me very much to find
               that nothing ever made him so angry, as a report raised by his enemies that he had
               ridden a rhinoceros.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Roger North

               not much regard a calumny of this kind. But it seems it was thought a very unfit
               thing for a Lord Keeper. I should like to know Lord Eldons opinion: it would probably
               be a more unbiased one than he gave in the case of Wat Tyler.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon (1751&#8211;1838; <title>DNB</title>),
                  Lord Chancellor 1801&#8211;1806, 1807&#8211;1827, had delivered the judgement in March 1817
                  that denied Southey an injunction against the publication of <title>Wat
                     Tyler</title> (1817). The office of Lord Keeper of the Great Seal had been
                  merged with that of Lord Chancellor since 1761.</note>
