        <p rend="indent1"> I have letters both from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt</ref> &amp; the
					Vicar of Wellington.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Jarratt (1766&#8211;1843), Vicar of Wellington
						1791&#8211;1843. Southey was dealing with the consequences of John Cannon Southey&#8217;s (d. 1768) fantastically complex
						will, which gave Southey some hope of inheriting property at Fitzhead after the death of his third cousin, and
						John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir, John Southey Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>). Aunt
						Mary had intended to search the parish registers at Wellington, Somerset, to prove that Southey was John Cannon
						Southey&#8217;s heir at law, i.e. the person entitled to inherit his real property if he died intestate.</note> The
					register of that parish goes back only to the year 1683, &#8211; &amp; therefore <del>continues</del> extends no further
					than to the birth our grandfather Thomas,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Southey (1696&#8211;1777), a
						farmer at Holford Farm, Lydeard St Lawrence in Somerset. He was the eldest of eight children, his younger siblings
						being Mary (b. 1698), John (b. 1700), Ann (b. 1701), Robert (b. 1703), Mary (b. 1704), Hannah (b. 1706) and
						William (b. 1708).</note> who appears to have been the eldest of eight children. Beyond his birth written evidence
					is not to be procured: &#8211; &amp; if we were to lose <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt</ref>,
					there might be some difficulty in finding personal evidence to supply it. Will you call on <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>, &amp; ask him what is to be done. And as I have (from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunts</ref> positive testimony no doubt as to the fact of my being
					heir at law (John &amp; Robert<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Southey (1666&#8211;1728) was John Cannon
						Southey&#8217;s father and a lawyer; Robert Southey (1670&#8211;1726) was John Southey&#8217;s younger brother, the father of Thomas
						Southey (1696&#8211;1777) and Robert Southey&#8217;s great-grandfather.</note> (our <del>Gd.</del> G. Grandfather) being the
					only two brothers who married) &#8211; he had better take an opinion upon the case without farther delay. I would write
					to himself, but for two reasons, &#8211; first that I do not like to send him a mere letter of business, &#8211; &amp; secondly
					that being doubtful whether Parliament is dissolved or not, I cannot frank up the letter in the usual way.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The House of Commons was dissolved on 29 February 1820 and a general election
						was called. This event suspended the power of Rickman, who was an official of the Commons, to frank mail until the
						new parliament met.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I write in haste, unwilling to lose time, because I am in hopes that I shall bury Wesley this
						night.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of
							Methodism</title> (1820).</note> This new Guy Faux business, &amp; the murder of the Duc de Berry, coming so
					close upon each other, will do much towards strengthening the Governments of Europe.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The Cato Street Conspiracy to assassinate the Cabinet was broken up on 23 February 1820; Southey
						compares it to the plot in 1605 by Catholic conspirators to blow up parliament, in which Guy Fawkes (1570&#8211;1606;
							<title>DNB</title>) was a leading figure. Charles Ferdinand d&#8217;Artoise, Duc de Berri (1778&#8211;1820), a nephew of
						Louis XVIII (1755&#8211;1824; King of France 1814&#8211;1824), had been mortally wounded at the Paris Opera on 13 February
						1820 by Louis Pierre Louvel (1783&#8211;1820), a Bonapartist.</note> I have long expected some murderous act or attempt
					in this country</p>

          <p rend="indent1">Wellington has swarmed with Southeys who must have branched off at an earlier time. The Vicar
						tells me of Peter &amp; Margaret, &#8211; George &amp; Faith, Thomas &amp; Mellinah, (I never saw this name before &#8211; ) &#8211;
						John &amp; Elizabeth, John &amp; Hester, Hugh &amp; Sarah, Edward &amp; Grace.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">All of these Southeys were distant relations of Southey from the late seventeenth century and
							early eighteenth century whose names appeared in the parish register as married couples and who had baptised
							children at St John&#8217;s Church, Wellington: Peter Southey (1634&#8211;1717), a serge maker, married Margaret Burd (d.
							1702) in 1680; George Southey (d. 1736) married Faith Marsh (d. 1730) in 1687; Thomas Southey was married to
							Melliah Southey (dates unknown); John Southey (1685&#8211;1770) married Elizabeth Payne (dates unknown) in 1708; John
							Southey was married to Hester Southey (dates unknown); Hugh Southey, a farmer, (d. 1725) married Sarah Fursland
							(dates unknown) in 1694; Edward Southey (d. 1705), a labourer, was married to Grace Southey (dates
