        <p rend="indent0"> Warburtons letters will compleat your set of his works. I sent for it with that view some years ago, but it was not to
               be had. The other two are curious books: the Gwedir History especially contains a most barbarous representation of Welsh manners two
               centuries ago.</p>

               research, &#8211; because he strung together in the most unmethodical &amp; inconvenient manner possible a heap of extracts with little or no
               discrimination, &amp; in the worst spirit of his cast. &#8211; My paper upon Cromwells life<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
