        <p rend="indent1"> I have a long letter from good <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt
                  Mary</ref> who expects that Lord Somervilles death<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Cannon Southey&#8217;s (d. 1768) fantastically
                  complex will gave Southey some hope of inheriting property at Fitzhead after the
                  death of his third cousin, and John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir, John Southey
                  Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>).</note> has
               opened the way for me to a comfortable inheritance, longs to show me the different
               farms, &amp; hopes that I shall have occasion to summon her to London &#8211; as the person
               best acquainted with the circumstances of Cannon Southeys will. My own persuasion is
               that what I am entitled to is so little as hardly to be worth contending for. The
               whole property she estimates at about 1000 &#163; a year: &#8211; I believe the remainder of one
                  <del>xxxxx</del> estate, held for 99 years is all that was entailed upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</ref>. It was the most perplexed
               will that ever came before the lawyers. However I wish you would go to Doctors
                  Commons,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The society of lawyers dealing
                  with aspects of the civil law, including wills and inheritances.</note> see the
               will, &amp; obtain a copy of the whole, if necessary, or of such parts of it as
               concern the property devised to Lord Somerville &amp; entailed, in default of his
               issue, upon the Southeys. Perhaps you had better call upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> on the way, &amp; consult with him, &#8211; as <del>xx xxxxxx
               </del>if there &lt;are&gt; to be any law-proceedings I shall commit myself with perfect
               confidence to his directions. Lord S. I know sold the whole of his Somersetshire
               property, &#8211; some of it certainly with a bad title. But I will inclose <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunts</ref> letter, that you may see what she says,
               &amp; then you will know &lt;almost&gt; as much of the matter as I do.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt</ref> sends the deed
               of trust for her money &#8211; for our signatures, do you give it to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>, &amp; desire him if he cannot obtain an

                  do.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">On Thomas Southey&#8217;s death in 1811,
                  he left no property to his family. However, his sister, Mary Southey, successfully
                  claimed some cottages held under copyright tenure, on the grounds that the
                  &#8216;custom&#8217; of the local Manor of Tanton Deane made her Thomas Southey&#8217;s heir at law.
                  Further complexities had arisen on her sale of these properties and Southey and
                  Henry Herbert Southey were holding the capital in trust.</note>

                     Letter to the Freeholders of the County of Durham on the Proceedings of the
                     County Meeting holden on Thursday, 21st October 1819 &#8211; and Particularly on the
                     Speech of J. G. Lambton, Esq., M. P.</title> (1819).</note> It is very well
               written. Lambton seems to be doing all he can to earn for himself the character of
               the most intemperate man in the H. of Commons.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">John George Lambton (1792&#8211;1840; <title>DNB</title>), MP for Durham 1813&#8211;1828,
                  1st Earl of Durham. Lambton was both a fantastically rich owner of land and
                  collieries in Durham and an outspoken Whig. He was the prime mover behind, and
                  speaker at, the County Meeting at Durham on 21 October 1819, which denounced the
                  local authorities over their responsibility for the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; Massacre in August
                  1819. Southey particularly disliked Lambton because he had helped Brougham in his
                  contest in Westmorland in 1818.</note> As the Opposition used to wish for just so
               much national misfortune &amp; disgrace as would bring them into office, so I could
               find in my heart to wish for just as much Radical Reform as would reach the roots of
               his property, &#8211; if the mischief could affect none but him &amp; such as him.
               Concerning the immediate danger I have as few fears as any man. Government will have
               the active support of the Grenvilles,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  small group in the House of Commons and House of Lords that owed allegiance to
                  Lord Grenville; they had split from the Whigs in 1817 but did not join the
                  government until 1822.</note> &amp; the acquiescence of those whigs who are not
               beyond the reach of hellebore.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">In
                  classical mythology, hellebore was a cure for madness.</note>
          <del>That xxx</del> If there be an insurrection, which is likely enough, it will I
               think be presently quelled. What measures are intended by Ministers I do not know, I
               dare say they will be strong enough to excite great uproar, &amp; not strong enough
               to be of any permanent advantage. For if they suffer the press to be employed against
               all our institutions, as it has been for some years, no Government &amp; no
               institutions can possibly stand against it. Without some efficient restrictions upon
               this engine of all evil, all other measures must be nugatory. The evil will &lt;seem to&gt;
               be suspended &#8211; just as long as the H. Corpus,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The Habeas Corpus Act (1673) prevented detention without trial. It had been
                  suspended in 1817&#8211;1818.</note> &#8211; &amp; no longer. Humanly speaking the prognosis
               is as unfavourable as it well can be, tho there is no immediate danger of political
               dissolution. But I have a comfortable reliance upon the Order of Providence, &amp;
                  <del>in xxx</del> notwithstanding all appearances believe that we shall be saved
               in spite of ourselves.</p>

                  Southey&#8217;s grandmother (and Southey&#8217;s great-grandmother) was Anne Locke (b. 1675),
                  who married Robert Southey (1670&#8211;1726). She was believed by Southey&#8217;s Aunt Mary to
                  be a relative of the philosopher, John Locke (1632&#8211;1704; <title>DNB</title>),
