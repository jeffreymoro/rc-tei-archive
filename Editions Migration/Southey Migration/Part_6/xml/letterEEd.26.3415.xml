        <p rend="indent1"> I am much beholden to Lord Bathurst for this intended &amp; unsolicited kindness<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst (1762&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), Secretary of State
						for War and the Colonies 1812&#8211;1827. Under the impression that the Poet Laureate had a son who was nearing
						adulthood, Bathurst offered Southey the role of &#8216;writer&#8217; &#8211; a junior administrator in the East India Company. The only way to gain such a
						post was through patronage &#8211; usually nomination by one of the company&#8217;s directors.</note> to a perfect stranger.
					Express to him my sense of the favour when you have an opportunity. It is better that my thanks should be conveyed
					by you, than that I should write upon the occasion, which would seem as if I were desirous of introducing
					myself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Guardian goes on well.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Guardian</title>
						(1819&#8211;1824) was a pro-government Sunday newspaper, promoted by Croker.</note> I enclose some stanzas for it, which
						<ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> has sent me, to be inserted or cast aside,
					he cares not which.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth&#8217;s &#8216;Hints from the Mountains for Certain
						Political Aspirants&#8217;, published anonymously in the <title>Guardian</title>, 16 January 1820.</note> The thought is
					good, striking &amp; original; but the movement of the verse is to my ear unpleasant &amp; the expression is
					sometimes forced &amp; awkward. Such as it is, however, I send it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Government has done well,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The government had managed to
						carry its &#8216;Six Acts&#8217; to suppress radical agitation, in November&#8211;December 1819.</note> except in conceding any
					thing to an Opposition which was never more compleatly opposed to the general feeling of the whole property of the
					country. Concessions should never be made to such opponents. They assume a consequence from them, which if it were
					not thus given <del>xxxx</del> they would not know where to look for. The Seditious Meeting Bill<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Seditious Meetings Act (1819) required organisers of most meetings of over 50
						people to obtain a licence from a magistrate. It was due to run out after five years.</note> must be made
					perpetual at last, &amp; you will have the whole trouble of debating it again. Instead of substituting banishment
					for transportation, it would have been better to have given a discretionary power of sentencing to either;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The Criminal Libel Act (1819) made banishment the punishment for a second
						offence and anyone breaching the sentence was to be transported for 14 years. The original version of the Bill had
						made transportation for seven years the punishment for a second offence and death the punishment of last
						resort.</note>
          <del>accxx</del> &#8211; Hobhouse for instance is a fit subject for banishment; Carlile for
						transportation.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Cam Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton (1786&#8211;1869;
							<title>DNB</title>), radical MP for Westminster 1820&#8211;1833, Nottingham 1834&#8211;1847, Harwich 1848&#8211;1851, at this time
						briefly imprisoned for a breach of parliamentary privilege in his pamphlet, <title>A Trifling Mistake in Lord
							Erskine&#8217;s Recent Preface</title> (1819); and Richard Carlile (1790&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>), radical journalist
						and editor of <title>The Republican</title>, sentenced to three years&#8217; imprisonment in October 1819 for blasphemy
						and seditious libel.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The danger, I doubt not, is for a while averted. But <del>it will</del> the disease continues in
					the system, &amp; will break out from time to time, till alteration measures are adopted &amp; begin to take
					effect. A good beginning is made by the Saving Banks<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The first Savings Bank,
						paying interest on small cash deposits, was founded in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, in 1810 and the movement spread
						readily.</note> &amp; the encouragement to colonization;<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">There were six
						different small-scale state subsidies to emigration 1816&#8211;1827, including &#163;50,000 voted in 1818 to send 3,700
						settlers to South Africa.</note> &amp; I am inclined to hope for extensive benefit from the Dartmoor scheme.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Schemes to open up the granite industry on Dartmoor by constructing the Haytor
						track. This made it possible to transport the stone from the quarries on Dartmoor to the Stover Canal (opened in
						1820).</note> If the principle were established that children who are brought up at the public expence belong to
					the public, means might easily be devised of disposing in the best way of the surplus population as it rises. I am
					putting together speculations of this kind; such of them as are good, will sooner or later have their effect.
						Owen<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Owen (1771&#8211;1858; <title>DNB</title>), manager and owner of the
						New Lanark mills in Scotland 1799&#8211;1825. Southey had warned him not to publicise his deist views, which would drain
						support from his schemes for settling the unemployed on the land.</note> has wrecked himself upon the shallows
					where I told him he would strike, &amp; endeavoured vainly to direct him in a safer course. His Lanark experiment
					(I was there in the Autumn)<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey visited New Lanark on 28 September
						1819, <title>Journal of a Tour in Scotland</title>, ed. Charles Harold Herford (London, 1929), pp. 258&#8211;266.</note>
					proves nothing but that children are very happy &amp; very docile under the most indulgent treatment, &amp; that
					the kindest treatment is the best. He is wrong in all his principles except one, but that one is of main
					importance, &#8211; it is this, that the national character <del>may be exactly what</del> will always be what the
					institutions of the country make it, &amp; that men are as clay in the hands of their legislators. At present
					indeed we have a great stock of coarse crockery on hand, made in the very worst pattern &amp; applied to the vilest
					purposes. With this nothing can be done; &#8211; but we must learn to model better for the future.</p>
