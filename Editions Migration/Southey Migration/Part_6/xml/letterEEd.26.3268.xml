        <p rend="indent0"> I wrote to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> on the sixth of last month
					to enquire the fate of your poem,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bowles&#8217;s &#8216;Ellen Fitzarthur&#8217;, which Southey
						had drawn to Murray&#8217;s attention for possible publication; see Southey to John Murray, 9 June 1818, <title>The Collected Letters
							of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 3149. Murray had expressed a cautious interest, and
						Bowles had then sent her manuscript to him; see Southey to John Murray, 6 February 1819, Letter 3241. </note> &#8211;
					&amp; this day I have received an apology for not answering my letter &lt;till now&gt; stating (which no doubt is
					the truth) that not having answered it by return of post it went out of his head. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I feared what his reply would be, &#8211; &amp; from this long silence you will have expected it. These
					are his words &#8211; &#8220;The MSS poem is such as to do its author very great credit. But the fact is that no poetry except
					your own &amp; that of some four or five others, has the least chance of sale at present, &amp; I am obliged to
					refrain.&#8221; &#8211; There is but too much truth in this. Poets who would &lt;have&gt; obtained universal applause thirty
					years ago, cannot now obtain a hearing, &#8211; however <del>xxx</del> great the promise which their works may contain, &#8211;
					&amp; the vilest trash will be received from one who, by fair means or by foul, has obtained a reputation. As for
					the incivility of <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref> long delay, you must remember that a
					great bookseller is a much greater man than the Prime Minister. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry for this, &amp; perhaps more disappointed than you will be. A local poem, &#8211; such as I
					suggested in my last letter, &#8211; would have a better chance than one of any other kind, &#8211; because it carries with it
					a local interest. The New Forest<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s advice was to write a poem about
						the area (Hampshire) in which Bowles had been born and brought up. Bowles replied on 12 May 1819, rejecting the
						idea of a poem on the New Forest, but promising to send the manuscript of a blank verse poem, a draft of &#8216;The
						Birth-Day&#8217;, Edward Dowden (ed.), <title>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</title> (Dublin
						and London, 1881), p. 15.</note> is both in its history &amp; scenery a rich subject &#8211; &amp; with the help of
					prints a <del>poem</del> book might be made which would be bought by idlers at Lymington Southampton &amp;c; &#8211;
					booksellers must look to the <hi rend="ital">sale</hi> of what they publish, &amp; this is a kind of sale on which
					they can in some degree calculate. &#8211; The Isle of Wight is not so extensive a subject but it would have the same
					advantage. The Forest however affords more scope, &amp; would supply matter for a very interesting poem, especially
					to one who has so many feelings connected with it as you needs must have. &#8211; Have you ever accustomed yourself to
					write blank verse? &#8211; for that would be the most suitable metre. Think of this, &#8211; of the Convents &amp; Castles
					within its <del>xxx</del> &lt;ancient&gt; precincts, &#8211; of Winchester, &#8211; of William the Conqueror &amp; William
						Rufus,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William I, &#8216;the Conqueror&#8217; (1027/8&#8211;1087; King of England 1066&#8211;1087;
							<title>DNB</title>), who turned the New Forest into a royal hunting park, and his son William II, &#8216;Rufus&#8217; (c.
						1060&#8211;1100; King of England 1087&#8211;1100; <title>DNB</title>), who died as the result of an accident there. Local
						legend claimed that William II&#8217;s death was to atone for the destruction wreaked by his father in appropriating the
						forest for the crown and inflicting harsh punishments on those who broke its laws.</note> &#8211; of its natural history
					&#8211; both as relating to vegetable &amp; animal life, &#8211; of what you have seen, &amp; what you have felt there. Think
					of these things, &amp; tell me what you think of them. </p>
