        <p rend="indent1"> I inclose the seventh letter of reminiscencies.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to John May, 2 September&#8211;13 November
                  1821, Letter 3724.</note> This is making progress, slow indeed, but I hope, sure,
               &#8211; &amp; I feel an increasing interest in the task.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your last gave me I know not whether most concern or satisfaction, &#8211;
               if that may be called satisfaction which is felt when we see ill fortune admirably
               sustained. The affairs of the world are in better hands than ours; &amp; were your
               property saved from the wreck, I should regard the impending evils of Brazil, without
               anxiety, tho not without sorrow.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">An army
                  revolt in Porto in August 1820 led to the election of a Cortes in December 1820
                  and demands that the monarchy return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807&#8211;1808,
                  following the French invasion. John VI (1767&#8211;1826; King of Portugal 1816&#8211;1826)
                  arrived back in Lisbon on 3 July 1821 and eventually agreed to a new liberal
                  Constitution. John VI appointed his son, Pedro (1798&#8211;1834; Emperor of Brazil
                  1822&#8211;1831), as Regent in Brazil, and Pedro summoned an elected advisory council to
                  represent the different Brazilian provinces. These events eventually led to the
                  separation of Portugal and Brazil on 7 September 1822, but Brazil did not become a
                  republic or disintegrate.</note> The tendency there is to disunion, &amp; if the
               separate republics into which it is likely to split do not commence hostilities
               against each other, the deserts which separate them will be the only cause; &amp;
               intestine commotions will <del>be</del> give each enough to do at home, &#8211; especially
               when we recollect the fearful proportion of the <del>xx</del> black population! The
               separation of the two countries being now, I think, inevitable (it is the natural
               &amp; direct consequence of the Revolution at home) the best thing which can be
               wished for Brazil, is the speedy formation of a federal government, &amp; a Congress.
               But if this was so difficult in English-America that it could hardly have been
               effected by any other man than Washington,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">George Washington (1732&#8211;1799; President of the United States
                  1789&#8211;1797).</note> aided too by friends worthy of such a man, &#8211; what must it be
               among the Brazilians!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Since my last letter was written, I spent a week at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Lowtherestate">Lowther</ref>, &amp; having lamed
               myself the first day by a quarrel between my foot &amp; my boot, in which skin gave
               way to leather, past all my mornings (&amp; the morning there reached far into the
               evening) among the books, at hard work. I found there a most extensive collection of
               old pamphlets, from James 1<hi rend="sup">st </hi>

               They added much to my knowledge of Cromwells time, made me fully acquainted with some
               points of which I had never before been able to obtain satisfactory information,
               &amp; confirmed, I think in <hi rend="ital">every</hi> instance, the view I had taken
               of that age. It will be <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murraylemagnes</ref> fault if I do not enlarge the life of Cromwell
               as was done with that of Nelson.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s

                  (July 1821), 279&#8211;347. He was hoping to make it into a separate work as he had
                  previously done with his <title>Life of Nelson</title> (1813), an expansion of his
                  article in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 3 (February 1810), 218&#8211;262. This did
