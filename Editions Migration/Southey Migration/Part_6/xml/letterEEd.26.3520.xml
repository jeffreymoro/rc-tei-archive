               His name I think was Welling,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> or something like it. He made full use of his
               privilege in the cellar, &amp; drank more cyder than the servants would draw for him. They endeavoured<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">endeavoured: closing &#8216;ed&#8217; written over &#8216;ing&#8217;.</note> once to frighten him, by placing a fellow in a white sheet, with
               a ghostly face, behind the cask, to rise up when he approached. Welling started at the apparition, but presently collecting himself, he
               went coolly &amp; cautiously to the <del>cask</del> &lt;barrel&gt;, filled his cup, &amp; looking the figure in the face said to it, Be&#8217;est

               left no issue. I have heard hardly any thing of him except that on his wedding day he sung a song after dinner which was not very

               to have a commission in the marines. He was a fine handsome man, of considerable talents, &amp; of a convivial temper. I have heard him
               spoken of with admiration by some who were intimate with him in their youth. He could make verses too, &#8211; after the fashion of that age.
               I have somewhere a poem of his, in his own writing, which came to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</ref>
               after her mothers death. &amp; in like manner descended into my possession: it is not therefore without a mournful feeling that I
               recall to mind the time when it was first shown me, &amp; <del>my</del> the amusement which it then afforded me. It was a love poem
               addressed to my grandmother during the days of courtship; it intimated a jealousy of a rival who was called Strephon,<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">Strephon was a traditional name for the male lover in pastoral poetry.</note> &amp; there was a note to
               this poetical appellation, explaining it to mean &#8220;the young Justice.&#8221;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am afraid my grandfather behaved ill to his wifes children, &amp; not very well to his own, &#8211; of whom by this second

               to subsist on but his half pay. This too he sold to get rid <del>xx</del> &lt;of&gt; some ale house embarrasments. I remember him at
               Bedminster, where his occasional visits gave no pleasure to his mother, or to any one else: a short time after her death he married a
               farmers daughter in Herefordshire,<note n="24" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> a woman with a lame arm, &#8211; for what

               parents. The poor father came to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my fathers</ref> to enquire about him, &amp; I who

                  (1742&#8211;1789).</note> the next brother was a more remarkable person. Owing to some defect in his faculties, so anomalous in its kind
               that I never heard of a similar case, he could <del>not</del> never <del>learn</del> &lt;be taught&gt; to read, &#8211; the letters he could tell
               separately, but was utterly incapable of combining them, &amp; taking in their meaning by the eye. He could write, &amp; copy in a fair
               hand any thing that was set before him, whether in writing or in print; but it was done letter by letter without understanding a single
               word. <del>He was quite</del> As to self-government he was entirely incompetent, so much so that I think he could hardly be considered
               responsible as a moral being for his actions; yet he had an excellent memory, an observing eye, &amp; a sort of half-saved shrewdness
               which would have qualified him, had he been born two centuries earlier, to have worn motley, &amp; figured with a cap &amp; bells
               &lt;&amp; a bauble&gt; in some Barons hall. Never did I meet with any man so stored with old <del>sayings</del> &lt;saws&gt; &amp; anecdotes
               gathered up in the <del>little</del> narrow sphere wherein he moved. I still remember many of them: <del>xx</del> the motto to

               rightly understood will show, is one of my uncle Williams sayings. &#8211; When it was found impossible to make any thing of him by
               education, he was left to himself, &amp; past more time in the kitchen than in the parlour, because he stood in fear of his
                  step-father.<note n="29" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Hill (1705&#8211;1765).</note> There he learnt to chew tobacco &amp; to
               drink.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Strange creature <del>x xx</del> as he was, I think of him very often, often speak of him &amp; quote some of his odd
               apt sayings, &amp; have that sort of feeling for his memory, that he is one of those persons whom I should wish to meet in the world to
               come.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The man of whom he learnt the use, or rather the abuse of tobacco, was a sottish servant, as ignorant as a savage of
               every thing which he ought to have known, &#8211; that is to say of everything which ought to have been taught him. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My mother</ref> when a very little girl once reproved him for swearing. For shame

               words! for shame. Say your prayers Thomas. No Missey, said the poor wretch, I shant. I shant say my prayers. I never said my prayers in
               all my life, &amp; I shant begin now.&#8221; &#8211; My Uncle William (the Squire he was called in the family) provoked him dangerously once. He
               was dozing before the fire <del>xxx</del> with his hat on which as &lt;is&gt; still common with the peasantry, he always wore in the house.
               You perhaps are not enough acquainted with the mode of chewing tobacco to know that in vulgar life a quid commonly goes thro two
               editions; &amp; that after it has been half done with, it is taken out of the mouth &amp; reserved for a second <del>indulgence</del>
               &lt;regale&gt;. In its intermediate state my Uncle William, who had faithfully learnt the whole process from Thomas, used to call it an old
                  soldier.*<note n="31" place="foot" resp="editors">* a sailor deposits it <del>in</del>, or if there be such a word,
                     <title>re</title>posits it in his tobacco-box. I have heard <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother Tom</ref>
                  say, that this practice occasioned a great dislike in the navy to the one &amp; two pound bills: for when the men were paid in
                  paper, the tobacco-box served them for purse or pocket-book in lack of any thing better, &amp; <del>xx</del> bills were often
                  rendered illegible by the deep stain of a wet quid. [Southey&#8217;s note.]</note> Thomas&#8217;s place for an old soldier &lt;between two
               campaigns&gt;, while he was napping &amp; enjoying the narcotic effects of the first mastication, was the brim of his hat; from whence the
               Squire on this occasion stole the veteran quid, &amp; substituted in its <del>pl</del> stead a dead mouse from <del>the</del> &lt;a&gt; trap.
               The sleeper, half-wakening, without <del>opening</del> &lt;unclosing&gt; his eyes, &amp; half stupefied put up his hand, &amp; taking the
               mouse <del>xxxxxxx</del> with a finger &amp; thumb <del>of</del> &lt;in&gt; which the discriminating sense of touch <del>had never been
                  instead of xxxxx called forth</del> had been blunted by coarse work &amp; unclean habits, opened his mouth to receive it, &amp; with
               a slow sleepy tongue endeavoured to accommodate it to its usual station, between the double teeth &amp; the cheek: happening to put it
               in head foremost, the hind legs &amp; the tail hung out &amp; some minute or more was spent in vain endeavours to lick these appendages
               in, before he perceived in the substance, consistence &amp; taste something altogether unlike tobacco. Roused at the same time by
                  <del>the</del> &lt;a&gt; laugh which <del>the Squire</del> could no longer &lt;be&gt; suppressed, &amp; discovering the trick which had been
               played, he started up in a furious rage, &amp; seizing the poker would have demolished <del>my Uncle William</del> &lt;the Squire&gt; for
               this practical jest, if he had not <del>prexxxxx</del> provided for his retreat by having the doors open, &amp; taking shelter where
               Thomas could not, or dared not follow him.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Enough of Uncle William for the present. Edward<note n="32" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Tyler
                  (1744&#8211;1786).</note> the remaining brother was a man who if he had been properly brought up, &amp; brought forward in a manner
               suitable to his birth &amp; connections, might have made a figure in life, &amp; have done honour to himself &amp; his family. He had a
               fine person, a good understanding, &amp; a sweet temper, which made him too easily contented with any situation &amp; any company into
               which he was thrown. My grandfather has much to answer for on his account. Except sending him to a common day school, kept by a very

               receiving the additional tithes during a certain number of years, &#8211; or of being remunerated out of them in proportion to the cost &amp;
               trouble of the adventure. The points were obstinately contested; but he carried them all, &#8211; &amp; died almost immediately afterwards,
               about the year 1764 &#8211; or 65.</p>
