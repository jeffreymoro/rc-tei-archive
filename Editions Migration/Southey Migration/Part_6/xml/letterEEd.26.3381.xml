          <salute rend="indent0"> SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have had your day at Wigton and at Kendal, and sufficiently elated you seem to have been at
					having had the field to yourself.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Following the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; Massacre of 16
						August 1819, Whigs in Cumberland organised a County Meeting at Wigton on 13 October 1819, addressed by Brougham,
						to protest at the local authorities&#8217; actions and send an Address to the Prince Regent. Southey drew up a
						conservative response &#8211; an Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals and calling for curbs on the
						press. This Address was circulated by Lord Lonsdale, the Lord Lieutenant for Cumberland, and a copy was leaked to
						the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 23 October 1819. However, the <title>Chronicle</title> correctly reported
						that &#8216;several of the most respectable of the LOWTHER party have refused to sign the Loyal Address, and cry out
						against it as <hi rend="ital">ultra</hi>&#8217;. The Address was not proceeded with, and government supporters in
						Cumberland produced a more moderate document. A further County Meeting for Westmorland was held at Kendal on 21
						October 1819 to protest against the authorities&#8217; actions at the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; meeting. Brougham was present, and read
						out and denounced the rival pro-government Loyal Address which Southey had written (though Brougham was unaware of
						its author). He remarked that the Address &#8216;is very long indeed, and extremely dull&#8217;, and described its authors as
						&#8216;fawning sycophants&#8217; who had produced a &#8216;slavish&#8217; document, <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 26 October 1819.
					</note> Wherever you obtain that fit audience which you lose no opportunity of seeking, it would not be easy for an
					opponent to gain a hearing; and certainly no person who regards his own character as a gentleman would expose
					himself to a personal altercation with one who cares so little in all his public conduct for the urbanities of
					life. There is one requisite of a demagogue, Mr. Brougham, which you possess in perfection: when you address the
					rabble you address yourself admirably to their humour, and cast aside every thing in feeling or manner by which
					they could possibly distinguish you from one of themselves. The press, however, is open to your antagonists, and in
					bringing you by this means before the tribunal of sober minds, they run no risqu&#233; of being silenced by the clamour
					of your friends, or the brickbats of your partizans.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have insisted that the Loyal Address of the County of Cumberland was privately prepared, and
					clandestinely circulated. Privately prepared any paper must be which is not got up at a public meeting; but how
					that which was circulated by the <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lieutenant</ref>, and lay
					publicly for signatures can be said to have been <hi rend="ital">clandestinely</hi> brought forward, it would be
					difficult to understand if we did not know that political orators sometimes indulge in bolder licences of speech
					than have ever been claimed by the poets.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Address you are pleased to say is <hi rend="ital">very long indeed and extremely dull</hi>.
					In a matter of taste, who shall presume to dispute the sentence of a Scotch Reviewer?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Brougham had written regularly for the <title>Edinburgh Review</title> (1802&#8211;1929), the main Whig
						quarterly journal.</note> but with regard to the length of the paper, that point may be determined by a six inch
					rule, and your own speech, which is precisely upon the same subject appears even in its abbreviated report to be
					more than thrice as lengthy. Let that pass. Whether the Address be long or short, ill-written or well, is of no
					moment: you are welcome to display your own skill in the niceties of composition by animadverting upon its style, &#8211;
					but you shall not misrepresent its meaning as you have done, without being called to an account.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is stated in the Loyal Address, that <hi rend="ital">men are now no longer disqualified for
						popular favor by notorious infamy</hi>, and that <hi rend="ital">it matters not how profligate they may be in the
						relations of private life, how base in their dealings, how bankrupt in character and fortune, nor how openly they
						may live in habitual violation of the laws both of God and Man</hi>. You have thought proper to comment upon the
					expressions as if they were applied to the &#8220;noble, honorable, and respectable personages who attended the county
					meeting at York:&#8221;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The York County Meeting on 14 October 1819, to denounce
						the local authorities&#8217; handling of events at St Peter&#8217;s Fields in Manchester on 16 August 1819, was attended by
						many Whig landowners, including William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam (1748&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>),
						Lord-Lieutenant for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk (1765&#8211;1842;
							<title>DNB</title>).</note> you have thought proper to say, that these personages are described in the Address as
						<hi rend="ital">having no stake in the country and nothing to lose</hi>. Mr. Brougham, this was not, and could not
					be misapprehension on your part. The writer of the Address is not a fool that he should throw out such senseless
					aspersions; nor could you, Sir, be so stupid as thus grossly to mistake the meaning of a plain and obvious allusion
					to the mob-heroes of the day. If it had been possible for a man of the bluntest understanding to make the mistake,
					the very next sentence in the paper would have shown him his blunder, where the Whigs who have attended the public
					meetings in question are distinctly alluded to as persons of rank and respectability. You did not misunderstand the
					passage, and I accuse you, Sir, of having deliberately and wilfully misrepresented it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But this, Sir, is not the only misrepresentation of which you were guilty, in your speech. You
					said &#8211; &#8220;What do you think of this paragraph, Gentlemen, that, admitting lives were lost at Manchester &#8211; yet <hi rend="ital">greater and far more extensive evils must arise, if the people are allowed to assemble</hi>; &#8211; the
					paragraph proceeds to say, <hi rend="ital">under such circumstances, in contempt of the constituted
						authorities</hi>, &#8211; but you cut off the last member of the sentence, make your full stop where it suits your
					purpose, and then proceed to argue and inveigh against the mutilated passage, as if you had given its whole
					meaning. You call it slavish, and base, and pitiful, and low, and cowardly, and then you ask if they are Englishmen
					who have said this? Truer Englishmen than yourself, Mr. Brougham, in birth, in breeding, in all their opinions,
					principles, and feelings.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Brougham had been born and educated in Edinburgh,
						and his mother, Eleanor Syme (1750&#8211;1839), was Scottish, so Southey may well have felt more &#8216;English&#8217; than his
						critic.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Radicals met at Manchester for the purpose of proclaiming once more their determination to
					effect a change in the Constitution of the British Government. They came in military order; they bore black flags
					and bloody daggers for their banners;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The banners at the St Peter&#8217;s Field
						meeting at Manchester on 16 August 1819 were much commented on by conservatives; here Southey paraphrases the
						Manchester magistrate, James Norris&#8217;s (c. 1774&#8211;1838), speech committing Henry &#8216;Orator&#8217; Hunt (1773&#8211;1835;
							<title>DNB</title>) to trial for conspiracy on 27 August 1819, which condemned &#8216;the <hi rend="ital">black
							flag</hi>, the <hi rend="ital">bloody dagger</hi>, the words equal representation, <hi rend="ital">or death</hi>&#8217;
						on the crowd&#8217;s banners.</note> they had been cautioned by the Magistrates not to meet at that place, on that day.
					&#8211; A short time before the meeting, they had attacked and nearly murdered two special constables, who went to look

						refers to two separate incidents. Firstly, on 15 August 1819, two special constables, James Murray and William
						Shawcross (dates unknown), had observed radicals drilling at White Moss, near Middleton, and had been attacked and
						beaten. Secondly, Joseph Harrison (1779&#8211;1848), one of the organisers of a radical meeting in Stockport on 28 June
						1819, was arrested in London and when he was being escorted back for trial in Cheshire, the constable, William
						Birch (b. 1792), accompanying him was shot and wounded on 23 July 1819.</note> There was nothing equivocal in the
					object of the meeting. The Radicals avowed their object, &#8211; it was <hi rend="ital">Liberty</hi>, according to their
					acceptation of the word, <hi rend="ital">or Death</hi>. It is notorious that pikes had been manufactured for their
					use, and that they had been regularly drilled and taught to perform military manoeuvres.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Pikes had certainly been collected by various radicals, but they were not in evidence at the

					all landed property also.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">William Cobbett was particularly associated with
						hostility to investors in the national debt; and the Society of Spencean Philanthropists, some of whom had
						instigated the attempted revolution at Spa Fields on 2 December 1816, wished to redistribute landed property. But
						neither Cobbett nor the Spenceans were connected to the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; meeting.</note> That they are unlawful as being

					authorities for the opinion. Nor is there any man of common sense who can doubt but that worse evils than those
					which resulted at Manchester would ensue, if the people are allowed to assemble under <hi rend="ital">such
						circumstances</hi> as these, and <hi rend="ital">in contempt</hi> as they then and there did, <hi rend="ital">of

        <p rend="indent1"> Is this fair dealing, Sir? is it honorable? is it consistent with the principles of a Gentleman,
					or of an honest man? if you are insensible to these considerations, I ask you whether it is good policy for the
					sake of a momentary triumph, to avail yourself of artifices so easily detected; and so sure to be exposed? By what
					unhappy obliquity of intellect is it that you should not perceive the extreme impudence of this dishonesty in
					public life? Have you lived so exclusively among Scotch critics and factious Englishmen as not to know that the
					Laws of Honor allow no benefit of Clergy for a breach of truth? And are you so utterly incorrigible that you still
					persist in bringing false accusations for personal or party purposes, convicted as you recently have been of such
					practices, and still &#8220;flagrant from the scourge&#8221; of the Quarterly Reviewer?<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander Pope (1688&#8211;1744; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Dunciad</title> (1728), Book 2, line 148. There had

						against people in public life, as it had been reported that Brougham had attacked Southey from the hustings during
						the Westmorland election, on 30 June 1818. Southey had drawn up a list of similar criticisms that Brougham had
						made, and which he intended to use in his planned (but uncompleted) published response to Brougham; see Southey to
