            <title>A
							Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> With regard to the illustrations of my larger poems, I am glad you think of them, because such
					things are now become so customary that the poet who goes without them might seem to hold but a low place in public
					opinion; a point which I care for only as it may affect the sale of my works. Would it not be worth while, as an
					experiment, to print one of my poems with or without the notes, in a small cheap form, like those little editions
					of Walker&#8217;s, Suttaby&#8217;s, &amp;c., which are found at every country bookseller&#8217;s, however small his stock?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was seeking to increase his sales and diversify his audience and thus
						suggested that Longman publish cheaper, pocket editions of his poems, like those of other authors published in the
						&#8216;Walkers British Classics&#8217; series (owned by Longman), and by William Suttaby (d. 1838), who was responsible for
						the &#8216;Cabinet Edition&#8217; and &#8216;Miniature Library&#8217; series. Although Longman did not act on this suggestion, such
						editions were being produced without Southey&#8217;s sanction on the continent. For example in 1820 a pocket edition of
						Southey&#8217;s <title>Poems</title> was printed in Zwickau, Saxony, for the Brothers Schumann, a firm run by August
						Schumann (1773&#8211;1826). </note> I do not think it would lessen the sale of the current editions, but that sufficient
					purchasers would be found to give 3<hi rend="ital">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="ital">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="ital">s</hi>. who
					would never give 14<hi rend="ital">s</hi>.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s longer poems were
						usually priced at this time at 16 shillings, for example, the fourth edition of <title>Roderick, the Last of the
							Goths</title> (1818).</note> I should like to try this experiment with &#8220;Thalaba,&#8221;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Islamic romance <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801). It was an interesting choice
						because, although it had been highly influential on contemporary writers such as Byron, Percy Shelley and Thomas
						Moore, <title>Thalaba</title> had not sold well, with a second edition appearing in 1809 and a third in
						1814.</note> that being of all my poems the most likely to become popular, if it were in a popular form. It would
					thus be placed within reach of a whole class of customers, who never buy books till they are lowered in price to
					their means; but this class is numerous, and always on the increase, and is plainly worth printing for, because so
					many books are printed for it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should expect that the third volume of &#8220;Brazil&#8221; will get up with the second as soon as it is
					reviewed, and thereby brought to the notice of persons who may not see or not regard the advertisements. But as to
					the first volume, many copies must, by the death of the first possessors or other chances, have fallen into the
					possession of persons who care nothing about books, or have got into the hands of booksellers as odd volumes, &#8211; a
					necessary evil arising from the lapse of time between the first and last publication.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819). Longman called for a second edition of the
						first volume only, and this was published in 1822. </note> I must not, however, regret that so long a time
					elapsed, because some of the most important materials for the last volume did not come to light till that volume
					was half through the press; so that, had the work appeared earlier, it must have been much more imperfect. Please
					to lay a set by for me while one is to be had, and I will choose a binding for it when I see you in March.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819), no. 2625 in the sale catalogue of
						Southey&#8217;s library, described as &#8216;<title>calf, extra, marbled leaves</title>&#8217;.</note> The only copy which I have is
					the one in which I am making corrections and additions from such documents as have come to my hands too late. It is
					a great satisfaction to me to find, from these later documents, that in no one instance, where I have obtained
					subsequent information, have I found myself erroneous in the views which I had taken or the opinion which I had
					formed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When the &#8220;History of Portugal&#8221; comes to be printed, I will take care that the volumes shall
					follow each other without delay.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s prose magnum opus, &#8216;The History
						of Portugal&#8217;, was neither completed nor published.</note> And for this reason I will not put it to press (though
					more than half the work is written in its first state) till the &#8220;History of the Peninsular War&#8221; is published.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note>
