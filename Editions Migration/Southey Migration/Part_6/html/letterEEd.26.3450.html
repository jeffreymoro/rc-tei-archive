            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have a long letter from the Paper-hanger, my poor namesake,

                           1794–1798 was at 35 Bedford Street, Covent Garden. He had gone bankrupt in 1809. It
                           is possible that he was from Somerset and a very distant relative of Southey’s. Southey
                           had sent him some money in 1817.</span></div>
                  </div> “humbly begging my mediation with M<sup>r</sup> Fisher to pay him his just demands, or necessity will oblige him to sue for it in

                  </div> as he has been advised to do.” There are rogues enough in the world, &amp; this poor man
                  may very possible be one, as you seem to think, but certainly he does not write like
                  one. He has filled two huge pages with his family history, – which is rather interesting
                  to me at this time, when I have been procuring the registers of my own, as far as
                  they can be traced, – unfortunately they do not extend so far back by one generation
                  as I <span class="strikethrough">want</span> require.

                           heir at law, Southey had instituted a search of the parish registers at Wellington
                           in Somerset, the home of his ancestors; see Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 28 February

               long continue to exist. – It is an aweful thing to have Death in ones house. Sixteen
               years had made her one of the family, – she had taken a full share in all its joys
               &amp; its sorrows, &amp; tho we have looked on to this it is <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx matter of</span> impossible not to feel much now that the hour is come. She has led an innocent, happy,
               humble life: always ready in kind offices, – never was there a more generous spirit,
               nor a more tender heart. She was never out of sight of these mountains, – scarcely
               ever out of this immediate circle. – I shall endeavour to say something about this
