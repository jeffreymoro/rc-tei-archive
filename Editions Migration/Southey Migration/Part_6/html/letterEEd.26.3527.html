                  </div> as a person of distinguished talents, high reputation, &amp; conversant with Indian affairs.
                  – tho there might be an objection to him as being possibly disposed to think with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">M<sup>r</sup> Fox</a> on that, as on other subjects. M<sup>rs</sup> Hastings however desired that enquiry might be made whether I would undertake it,
                  because she knew what her husbands opinion of me had been, &amp; that he would have preferred
                  me for such a task to any other person. Sir G. D. spoke to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a>, &amp; two or three days only before I left town <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> asked me the question. I saw at once <span class="strikethrough">that</span> the splendour of the subject, – the extent &amp; variety of matter which it included,
                  &amp; in what manner it might be arranged: &amp; having a vague knowledge of the leading facts
                  of Hastings life, but a great admiration of his talents, &amp; of all that I had heard
                  of him in his private character, &amp; believing <span class="strikethrough">that</span> moreover that he been vilely persecuted, I expressed a willingness to the business.
                  My place in the Mail was taken at this time, &amp; all my arrangements made accordingly.
                  On the morning of my departure <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> went with me to Sir G Dallas’s. There I learnt that the materials were as ample as
                  could be desired, – the most important being a journal <span class="strikethrough">which</span> kept by Hastings, I believe, from the time when he first went to India. Sir G. afterwards
                  called at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brothers</a> &amp; left word written on his card that M<sup>rs</sup> H. wished particularly to see me the next day – but this could not be – for I had
                  engagements at Birmingham, &amp; was to meet <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt Southey</a> there on her way from Taunton. So there the matter ended, – except that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> has sent me down a parcel of books for preliminary reading, &amp; that I hold myself engaged

                  </div> my best ground of hope indeed is not of the pleasantest kind, – it being simply this
