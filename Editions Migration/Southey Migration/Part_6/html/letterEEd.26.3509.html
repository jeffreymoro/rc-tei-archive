               <p>Thank you for the draft. I am now preparing for you with all proper dispatch both

               <p>An hour or two before I left London, I found a card from Sir George Dallas

                           do so.</span></div>
                  </div> to see me the next day at twelve. Had my departure regarded myself alone, I would
                  without hesitation have delayed it; – but a friend had taken his place with mine for
                  that evening to accompany me home, – &amp; I had also an engagement to meet <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">an old Lady</a> (a near relation from a distant part of the country) at Birmingham the next day, by
                  the mail. So that it was impossible. – From our conversation with Sir George Dallas
                  it appears to me that the proper plan will be to publish a selection from M<sup>r</sup> Hastings papers &amp; correspondence, accompanying it with his life. That life <span class="strikethrough">would</span> requires a compendious view of our Indian history down to the <span class="strikethrough">pres</span> time of his administration, &amp; in its progress it embraces the preservation of our
                  Indian Empire, &amp; the establishment of the <span class="strikethrough">presen</span> existing system. Something must be interwoven concerning the history of the native
                  powers, Moor <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span>, Mahratta, &amp;c &amp; their institutions, I see how all this is to be introduced, &amp; see
                  also that no subject can afford materials more important or more various. And what
                  a pleasure it will be to record the triumph of such a man as Hastings over the tremendous
                  combination of his persecutors at home! – I had a noble catastrophe in writing the
                  life of Nelson,
