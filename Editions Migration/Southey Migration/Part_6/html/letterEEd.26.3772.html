                           1799), an expert on astronomy, a subject on which he gave public lectures and took

                  might have past his life happily for himself &amp; perhaps honourably as well as usefully
                  for his country. His attainments &amp; talents, were I have no doubt, very considerable
                  in their kind, &amp; I am sure that his temper &amp; disposition were naturally <span class="strikethrough">very</span> good. I never saw so little punishment in any school. There was but one flogging during
                  my stay there, it was for running away, which was considered as the heaviest of all
                  offences; the exhibition was made as serious as possible; the instrument was not a
                  rod but a scourge of packthread; but tho punishments in private schools were at that
                  time I believe always much more severe than at public ones, I do not remember that
                  this was remarkable for severity. We stood in awe &amp; respect of him, rather than fear.
                  If there was nothing conciliating or indulgent about him, there was no rigour; but
                  his manner was what you might suppose in one who was habitually thoughtful, &amp; who
                  when <span class="strikethrough">he</span> not engaged in abstruse studies had reason enough for unhappiness in his domestic
                  circumstances. For his school was declining, he was about fifty years of age, &amp; having
                  lost his first wife, had <span class="strikethrough">lately</span> married one of his maids,

                  reminds me of an anecdote connected with the fashion of those days. Because I was
                  indulged with sugar in my bread &amp; milk at home, when I went to school I was provided
                  with a store, carefully tied up in paper. I had a cocked hat for Sundays, during the
                  rest of the week it lay in my box upon the top of my clothes, &amp; when the paper of
                  brown sugar was reduced in bulk, I deposited it in the cock of the hat. As you may
                  suppose, my fingers found their way there whenever I went to the box, &amp; the box was
                  sometimes opened for that purpose, <span class="strikethrough">x</span> thus the sugar was by little &amp; little strewn over the hat. It was in a sweet clammy
                  condition the first time I was sent for by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt &lt;Tyler&gt;</a> to visit her at Bath; &amp; as the cocked hat was then in the last stage of its fashion,
                  mine was dismissed to <span class="strikethrough">the hatter</span> be rounded by the hatter, &amp; I never wore one again till I was at Madrid, where round
                  hats were prohibited.

                  the best dinner in the week. Some of the boys would split their cake, lay their cheese
                  in thin layers between the two halves, &amp; then place it under the press, so as to compress
                  it into one mass. This rule of going without meat one day in the week was then, I
                  believe, general in country schools, – retained perhaps, for motives of frugality,
                  from Catholic times.

                  these were our property &amp; transferable by sale. We raised mustard &amp; cress, raddishes
                  &amp; lettuces. When autumn came we had no lack of apples, for it is a country of orchards.

                  our ablutions were performed; the trees on one side grew on a steepish declivity;
                  &amp; in stormy weather we constructed dams across the stream to stop the apples which
                  were brought down. Our master had an extensive orchard of his own, &amp; employed the
                  boys to gather in the apples; there was of course free license to eat on that day,

                  I was too little to bear a part in this, which required considerable strength, but
                  for many days afterward I had the gleaning among the leaves with which the ground
                  was covered, – &amp; the fragrance of those leaves in their incipient decay is one of
                  those odours which I can recall at will, &amp; which whenever it occurs, brings with it

               <p>One very odd amusement, which I never saw or heard of elsewhere, was greatly in vogue
                  at this school. It was performed with snail shells – by placing them against each
                  other, point to point, &amp; pressing till the weaker was broken in; that was called conquering,
                  &amp; the shell which remained unhurt acquired <span class="strikethrough">glory</span> esteem &amp; value in proportion to the number &lt;over&gt; which it had <span class="strikethrough">conquered</span> &lt;triumphed&gt;, an accurate account being kept. A great conqueror was prodigiously prized
                  &amp; coveted, &amp; two of this description would seldom have been brought to contest the
                  palm, if both possessors had not been goaded to it by reproaches &lt;&amp; taunts&gt;. The victor <span class="strikethrough">always added to his score</span> &lt;had the&gt; number <span class="strikethrough">that</span> of its opponents &lt;conquests added to its own&gt;, thus when one conqueror of fifty conquered
                  another &lt;which had been as often victorious,&gt; it became conqueror of an hundred &amp;
                  one. Yet even in this, fame was sometimes obtained upon false pretences. I found a

                  shells were still transparent, – <span class="strikethrough">in fact</span> a nest probably which had not been hatched more than two or three days, – &amp; he was
                  besmearing his fingers by crushing these poor creatures one after another against
                  his conqueror, counting away, with the greatest satisfaction at his work. He was a
                  good-natured boy, so that I (who had been bred up to have a sense of humanity,) ventured
                  to express some compassion for the snails, &amp; to suggest that he might as well count
                  them &amp; lay them aside unhurt. <span class="strikethrough">I should have prevailed if it had not been for a point of honour or of conscience:</span> – he hesitated &amp; seemd inclined to assent, till it struck him as a point of honour,
                  or of conscience, &amp; then he resolutely said no, that would not do, – for he could
                  not then fairly say he had conquered them. – There is a surprizing difference of strength
                  in these shells, which might be partly estimated by the appearance of their points,
                  or tops (I do not know what better term to use) – the strong ones were usually clear
                  &amp; glossy there, &amp; white, if the shell were of the large coarse mottled brown species.
                  The top was then said to be petrified, &amp; a good conqueror of this description would
                  triumph for weeks or months. I remember that one of the <span class="strikethrough">most succesful ones</span> &lt;greatest heroes&gt; bore evident marks of having once been conquered; it had then been
                  cast away in some lucky situation where the poor tenant had leisure to repair his
                  habitation, or rather where the restorative power of nature repaired it for him, &amp;
                  the wall was thus made <span class="strikethrough">x</span> stronger than it had been before the breach. But in general I should think the resisting
                  power of the shell depended upon the geometrical nicety of its form.</p>
