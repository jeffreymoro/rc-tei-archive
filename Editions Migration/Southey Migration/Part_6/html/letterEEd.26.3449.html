                           1820 that the Roads were made in the fourteenth century for a ‘hunting spectacle’.

                  for which these roads were made. It appears to me impossible that they should have

                           to obtain the Gaelic names, and translations of the names, of the surrounding hills

               ancient ice-dammed lake. They remained the subject of much speculation throughout
               the nineteenth century. Rickman suggested in his letter to Southey of 20 February
               1820 that the Roads were made in the fourteenth century for a ‘hunting spectacle’.
