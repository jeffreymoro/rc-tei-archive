               the revolutionaries in South America eventually led to Ferdinand VII agreeing, on
               10 March 1820, to restore the liberal Constitution of 1812. However, he never accepted
               this situation and royal absolutism was restored by a French invasion in 1823. It
               would not have helped to reconcile Spain’s political differences if Ferdinand had
               been replaced by either of his brothers, Charles, Count of Molina (1788–1855) or Francisco,
               Duke of Cadiz (1794–1865), as Charles was a determined reactionary and, while Francisco
               was more moderate, he always supported his brother, Ferdinand VII.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
