                  compass will serve its purpose well, – that of introducing the Braybrooks institution,

                  funds are never wanting.

                  </div> is a poet whose works will continue to increase in value as they grow older, – for
                  they belong to the moral &amp; domestic history of these times. Their merit is very great
                  in other respects, – but this gives them a peculiar value. Moreover they have the
