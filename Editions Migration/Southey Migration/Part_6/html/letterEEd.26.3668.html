               <p>I really wish you would send to N<sup>o</sup> 158 in the Strand for the Report of the Committee appointed at a Meeting of Journeymen
                  (chiefly Printers) to take into Consideration a system of social Arrangement. It has
                  reached me to day, &amp; my first impression is that they are taking up just so much of
                  Owens scheme as is practicable, <span class="strikethrough">meaning to form</span> not a Community of Goods, but an association in which each works for himself, &amp; the
                  object of associating is to increase comforts &amp; diminish expence.

                           Improvements in the Condition of the Working Classes, and of Society at Large (1821).
                           The Report was based on plans put forward by the journalist George Mudie (b. 1788)
                           to form a community exemplifying the principles of Robert Owen (1771–1858; DNB), manager
                           and owner of the mills and model community at New Lanark in Scotland 1799–1825. Such

                  </div> The Community of Goods which they propose being, they say, in the nature of Regimental
                  or Naval Messes. – If their scheme be feasible, I know of nothing from which such
                  great &amp; certain good effects might be looked for.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">One more <span class="ital">if</span>. If the scheme deserves encouragement, a more popular thing could not be done by
               men in power, than by assisting to set it forward, by taking a few shares. The capital
               they want to begin with is £12,000. ‘to erect the first dwelling for 250 families.”
               – But I hope you will find time to look at their Report.</p>
