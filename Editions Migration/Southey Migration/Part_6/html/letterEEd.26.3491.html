            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is a matter of surprise to me, as well as of concern, that the Moravians should
                  feel themselves aggrieved by any part of the history of Mr. Wesley’s life.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           from Saxony in the 1730s and were influential on John Wesley’s early career and thought;
                           see for example The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism, 2 vols
                           (London, 1820), I, pp. 77–81, 175–208, 338–360.</span></div>
                  </div> With that subject the history of the U. Brethren is intimately connected; to describe
                  them therefore, such as they were at that time, was a necessary part of the task which
                  I had undertaken. I spoke of the extravagances, into which they had run, and the dangers
                  from which they had escaped, not in malice, neither, as you seem to imply, from the
                  mere desire of amusing my readers by enlivening the subject, but as a matter of history,
                  which it was my business, in the strict line of duty, to notice, for example and instruction.
                  And whether this was done with an unfriendly or uncharitable spirit, I may leave,
                  sir, to your own decision. It is distinctly stated, that the early Moravians were
                  innocent of the crimes which were laid to their charge, that they saw the errors which
                  they had committed, and that they corrected them.

                  </div> It is said, in explicit condemnation of Mr. Wesley, that in no other incident of his
                  life did he act so disingenuously, as when he repeated and accredited the calumnies
                  against them, and it is directly affirmed, that, at this day, they enjoy the general
                  good opinion of every other religious community.

                           must be considered as the most disingenuous act of his life’.</span></div>
                  </div> As the biographer of Mr. Wesley, I expected to be assailed from many quarters, but
                  certainly not from the Moravians.

                           Part in which he treats of the Moravians (1820). Okely was the Minister at Fairfield

               <p>Nothing could be farther from my thoughts and intentions than to give offence to the
                  Moravians, or to impute to them any participation in the fanatical and perilous language
                  of their predecessors. But as the present body are no ways answerable for their errors,
                  so I must be allowed to maintain, that their meritorious conduct cannot be pleaded
                  as a reason, why in an historical account of the Society, all mention of such errors
                  should be suppressed. This would be surely as unreasonable, as it would be in a history
                  of the Church of England to omit the crimes of Henry 8th

                  it never could have been supposed that any injury was done, or intended to the existing
                  Society.
