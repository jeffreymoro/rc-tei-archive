               <p>Lying-in in out-of-the-way places is at this time so common in this country, that
                  I think we have a chance of hearing from you, almost as soon as of seeing <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Mr Edmondson</a>: &amp; therefore I write to say that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is crippled with a swoln leg; <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> it is pretty much at ease in bed or on the sofa, but she cannot walk except by dragging
                  the foot, &amp; that with much pain. About a week after the delivery she had great pain
                  in the left leg, – the effect of exertion during a ten hours severe labour, this went
                  off in three or four day, the affection then began in the other leg, &amp; has now taken
                  this oedematous form.

                  to stop for 36 it was then thought proper to give him some castor oil – which remained
                  in him 12 hours more – &amp; then produced two motions, – but without any appearance of
