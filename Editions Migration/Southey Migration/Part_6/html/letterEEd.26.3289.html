               <div class="indent0">My dear Grosvenor</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">At last I hope there appears to be an end to the anxiety in which one thing after
               another has kept me with little intermission for more than two months. I cannot say
               that either <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">child</a> or <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">mother</a> are well; but both are materially better. The little one has been very ill with a
               spasmodic cough, the probability of an abscess is over, for the tumour is diminishing,
               as soon as it began to appear, one of the breasts was affected, – &amp; that complaint
               also after some ten days fomentation seems to be going away. – All this tried my spirits
               severely, – &amp; they are now pretty much like my ways &amp; means, that is, they reach out
               with good husbandry, but are very unequal to any extraordinary demand upon them. –
               But of this you may always rest assured, that when I make most progress at my desk
               I am in best health both of body &amp; mind. Nothing exhilarates me so much as a good
               days work at those employments by which no passion is excited.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thank you for your stewardship. When you receive the next quarter send me the balance
                  – for I shall need it as soon as it can be had. It will be very inconvenient for me
                  if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> does not give place in his next number (that is the one after that which is now due)
                  to my sepulchral paper.

                  </div> I am overdrawing upon the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmen</a> at present, – which however I may very well do, &amp; feel no reluctance at doing. Wesley

                  turn the scale.

                  </div> But I can neither stir from home, nor do anything else (except by fits of relief)
                  till the Brazil is finished, – &amp; surely never did any task so grow under the workmans

                  </div> The reason of this is, that it was utterly impossible to estimate the extent <span class="strikethrough">of the work</span>, because there existed no previous work by which I could measure my scale, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">discover</span> &lt;see&gt; what lay before me. It was travelling in an undiscovered country. The historical
                  part is finished, &amp; I am half way thro the concluding chapter, – which gives a view
                  of Brazil as it was in 1808, – a tremendous chapter both in length &amp; labour.

                  there does not exist in this or in any other language, so full an account of any country
                  from the earliest times – of its rise, progress, <span class="strikethrough">state of its manners &amp; civilization</span>, geography, the manners of its aborigines, – <span class="strikethrough">th</span> &amp; its actual state at the point of time when the writer concludes, – as I <span class="strikethrough">have</span> shall have prepared of Brazil; – a country of which less was known than of any other
