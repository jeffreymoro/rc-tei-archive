               <p>Yesterday I received a note from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a>, with a proof of the first part of Marlboroughs Life.

                           (July 1819), 59–102, published 11 December 1819. He had not received £100, the sum
                           he expected.</span></div>
                  </div> he does it against the grain, &amp; tells me it was not a mistake as I had supposed, –
                  however he writes in a stile of dignified civility, &amp; as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">the Megistos</a> allows me to be <span class="strikethrough">the</span> Megisteros on this occasion, all is well. He took full time to deliberate, &amp; would
                  not be very well pleased if he knew how decidedly I should have acted, if he had come
                  to a different determination. It is best as it is, &amp; I am very glad that I asserted
                  my proper claims; – independent of what is due to myself, the sum of which he would
                  have cut me short will pay my butchers bill. – When it became evident from lapse of
                  time that he was deliberating how to act I laid Marlborough aside; – now I have resumed
                  it, &amp; must stick to it till it is done, which will be in a week or ten days.</p>

               <p>I have had a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a> which a good deal surprized me. Lord Bathurst supposing that I had a son growing up,
                  called upon him to offer me a writership.

                           The only way to gain such a post was through patronage – usually nomination by one

                  have known that the offer was in vain, &amp; moreover would hardly have made it thro that
                  channel. So I take the offer as it was meant, <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxx</span> to be an expression of good will towards me for having deserved well in literature.
