               young Irishman, and a mighty genius in his own estimation’ (I, p. 63). Mulock found
               ungodliness everywhere and in everyone. He attacked Byron in <em>The Answer Given by the Gospel to the Atheism of All Ages</em> (1819), pp. 43–44 n*; 99–100 n*; 101–102 n*. During his Paris lectures he informed
               his audience that France was ‘by her follies and her crimes, least and lowest in the
