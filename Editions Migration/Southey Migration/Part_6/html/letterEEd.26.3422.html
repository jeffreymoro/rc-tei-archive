                           The only way to gain such a post was through patronage – usually nomination by one

                  wrote me two anonymous letters soliciting me to accept this charge. I supposed him
                  from what he said to be in the last stage of some mortal disease, &amp; wrote to him under
                  that persuasion. And I rather imagined that the religious character of my second reply

                  were deposited by the Suicide himself the day before he executed his fatal purpose,
                  – to await my directions. – I have reason to believe that, with all proper respect
                  to the dead as well as to the living, a most melancholy but instructive lesson may
                  be deduced from them. – His letters are beautiful compositions, – &amp; he was a man of
