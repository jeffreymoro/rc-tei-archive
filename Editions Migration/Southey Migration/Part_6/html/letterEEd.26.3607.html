                  become so domesticated that the children almost regarded him as one of the family.
                  His death therefore has cast a deep shade over what were the sunniest recollections
                  of my latter years. Poor fellow, he bore his cross so meekly, that it was impossible
                  to know him well, without <span class="strikethrough">fee</span> becoming greatly attached to him, &amp; the more he was known the more highly he was valued.</p>
