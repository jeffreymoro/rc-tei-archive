               <p>It seems to me that the weight of taxation was not felt while the war lasted, except
                  by those persons who had no means of increasing their means, (annuitants &amp;c.) The
                  weight was not more than was required to keep the wheels of a vast machine in motion.
                  We were then in our economical relations – cut off from the rest of the world, When
                  peace came the mischief was in taking off too much of the weight, &amp; letting in disturbing
                  causes. As far as I understand the reasoning of the Agriculturalists at this time,
                  it seems to have been well founded. <span class="ital">Their</span> distress is owing to the effects of the war. That of the Manufacturers is not. It
