                  the course of events is tending, &amp; long since pointed out what would be the inevitable
                  effects if an unchained press were suffered to act upon a manufacturing population.
                  Our Messalina however is doing unintentional good by hastening a crisis, which would
                  be the more dangerous the longer it is delayed.

               had announced the Bill would be withdrawn. Southey, who was ferociously opposed to
               Caroline, here compares her to Messalina (c. AD 17/20–48), the infamously dissolute
               wife of Claudius (10 BC–AD 54; Emperor of Rome AD 41–54).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
