                           soon begin to think of Turkey as a good settled government.’ Following the conclusion
                           of peace with Russia in 1812, the Ottoman Empire had gradually re-established much
                           of its severely shaken authority in Anatolia and Syria. However, the Empire then had
                           to face a war with Persia (1821–1823) and an, ultimately successful, revolt in Greece,
                           which began in 1821.</span></div>

                  may defeat the Turkish armies, &amp; lay open the way to Constantinople, but they cannot
                  maintain their conquests in Turkey; &amp; Constantinople would sustain a siege like Zaragoza,
                  or prove as fatal to those who took possession of it, as Moscow did to the French.

                           1812, but little more than a month later they began to withdraw. Over 400,000 French

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1.. </span><span class="noteBody">See Southey to Wade Browne, 28 December 1820, Letter 3593, where he stated: ‘We shall
               soon begin to think of Turkey as a good settled government.’ Following the conclusion
               of peace with Russia in 1812, the Ottoman Empire had gradually re-established much
               of its severely shaken authority in Anatolia and Syria. However, the Empire then had
               to face a war with Persia (1821–1823) and an, ultimately successful, revolt in Greece,
               which began in 1821.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Monkton Farleigh in Somerset. He had graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in
               1819 and was travelling in the Near East.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3.. </span><span class="noteBody">Egypt was occupied by France 1798–1801, and French forces had invaded Palestine in
               1799. They were ultimately defeated by a British expedition in 1801.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4.. </span><span class="noteBody">It was widely believed that Russia would intervene to support the Greek revolt, both
               in order to help fellow Orthodox Christians and to expand the Russian Empire in the
               Balkans. Britain, France and Russia eventually did intervene and forced the Ottoman
               Empire to recognise Greek independence in 1832.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5.. </span><span class="noteBody">The city of Zaragoza was besieged by French forces in June–August 1808 and December
               1808–February 1809, during the Peninsular War of 1808–1813; Spanish forces successfully
               defeated the French in the first siege. French forces had occupied Moscow in September
               1812, but little more than a month later they began to withdraw. Over 400,000 French
               troops and their allies died in the long retreat from Russia.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6.. </span><span class="noteBody">There was a brief Russo-Turkish War in 1828–1829, which led to substantial Russian
               territorial gains on the west shore of the Black Sea and in Armenia.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7.. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey feared that the areas of the Rhineland incorporated into Prussia in 1815 might
               rebel against Prussian rule. The Rhenish elites were at this time fighting a long
               battle with the government in Berlin to defend their local government system and legal
               code. But there was no revolutionary outbreak until 1848.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8.. </span><span class="noteBody">The Bourbon dynasty had been restored to the French throne by the Allies in 1814,
               but lacked legitimacy in the eyes of many French people. Southey feared that any disturbances
               in the Rhineland would lead to the overthrow of the Bourbons or force them to attempt
               to recover Belgium, which the French revolutionaries had annexed in 1795.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10.. </span><span class="noteBody">The Prince Regent was crowned as George IV on 19 July 1821. Southey did not attend
               and also did not write an official poem for the occasion.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               for organising the coronation. Henry Herbert Southey acted as one of the Deputy Earl
               Marshal’s Officers at the ceremony – in effect he was an usher. His role was signified
               by the possession of a gold stick (as well as a blue and gold lace uniform, and a
               black hat with feathers). He had probably obtained this job through the influence
               of his friend, Sir William Knighton.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               5 May 1821. However, Spain and Portugal had both witnessed revolutions in 1820 and
               their political future was in doubt.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14.. </span><span class="noteBody">James Lynn (1776–1855), Perpetual Curate of Strood 1805–1814, Rector of Caldbeck 1814–1820,
               Vicar of Crosthwaite, Keswick 1820–1855; he had married Charlotte Alicia Goodenough
               (1782–1822) in 1805. Her father, Samuel Goodenough (1743–1827; <em>DNB</em>), was Bishop of Carlisle 1808–1827, which may well explain Lynn’s appointment to
               Crosthwaite.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15.. </span><span class="noteBody">When Thomas Gray (1716–1771; <em>DNB</em>) visited the garden of Crosthwaite vicarage on 4 October 1769, he described the view
               as seen through his glass when he stood next to the horsing-block: ‘From hence I got
               to the parsonage a little before sun-set, and saw in my glass a picture, that if I
               could transmit it to you, and fix it in all the softness of its living colours, would
               fairly sell for a thousand pounds. This is the sweetest scene I can yet discover in
               point of pastoral beauty; the rest are in a sublimer stile’, reported in Thomas West
               (1720?–1779; <em>DNB</em>), <em>A Guide to the Lakes: Dedicated to the Lovers of Landscape Studies, and to All who
                  have Visited, or Intend to Visit the Lakes in Cumberland</em> (London, 1778), p. 113. An edition of 1799 was no. 3024 in the sale catalogue of
               Southey’s library. This was Station VIII in the viewing points in Keswick and its
               environs singled out by West. By demolishing the horsing-block, Lynn had unwittingly
               deprived the tourist of an important marker.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
