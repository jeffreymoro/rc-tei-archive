               <p>Thank you for reminding me of my Xmas Task. I think of an Ode upon these ugly times,
                  resembling in structure that with which the second volume of my Minor Poems concludes.

                           was later published as ‘The Warning Voice. Ode I’ in The Englishman’s Library: Comprising
                           a Series of Historical, Biographical and National Information (London, 1824), pp.
                           381–383. Here Southey compares this poem with his ‘Ode, Written in December, 1814’,
                           published in Minor Poems, 2 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. 227–238. This poem had proved
                           too controversial to serve as the New Year’s Ode for which it was intended.</span></div>
