                  </div> The passage appeared to me a curiosity, &amp; as such I inserted it, in connection with

                  if no such Society had been in existence. Nothing indeed could be farther from my
                  intention than that of offering any offence to a community of Christians, which as
                  a community I respect, &amp; among whose members there are some for whom I <span class="strikethrough">entertain</span> &lt;feel&gt; great individual &amp; personal respect &amp; regard.</p>
