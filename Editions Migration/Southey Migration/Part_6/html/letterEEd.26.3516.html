               <p>It is very seldom that a whole month elapses without some interchange of letters between
                  you &amp; me. And for my part, on the present instance, I cannot plead any unusual press
                  of business, or any remarkable humour of industry. But then I can plead a great deal
                  of enjoyment. I have been staying in the house all day, a great happiness after the
                  hard service upon which my ten-trotters were continually kept in London. I have been
                  reading, – a great luxury for one who during eleven weeks had not half an hour for
                  looking thro a book. I have been playing with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</a>, giving him the Cries of London to the life, as the accompaniment of a series of
                  prints thereof,

               of <em>Laon and Cythna, or the Revolution of the Golden City</em> (1818; published late 1817) and <em>The Revolt of Islam. A Poem, in Twelve Cantos</em> (1818); see Edward Dowden (ed.), <em>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</em> (Dublin and London, 1881), pp. 358–359. This review had appeared in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 21 (April 1819), 460–471. It concluded with an ad hominem attack that suggested
               the reviewer knew a great deal about Shelley’s personal affairs: ‘if we might withdraw
               the veil of private life, and tell what we <span class="ital">now</span> know about him, it would be indeed a disgusting picture that we should exhibit, but
               it would be an unanswerable comment on our text; it is not easy for those who <span class="ital">read only</span>, to conceive how much low pride, how much cold selfishness, how much unmanly cruelty
               are consistent with the laws of this “universal” and “lawless love.” But we must only
               use our knowledge to check the groundless hopes which we were once prone to entertain
               of him’ (471). The article had, moreover, described Shelley as ‘an unsparing imitator’
               and <em>The Revolt</em>’s language and versification as a ‘copy’ of Southey’s, though ‘altogether more luxuriant
               and ornate than the original’ (461). Shelley was mistaken in attributing the review
               to Southey, who had a policy of not reviewing contemporary poetry. Its author was
               John Taylor Coleridge.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
