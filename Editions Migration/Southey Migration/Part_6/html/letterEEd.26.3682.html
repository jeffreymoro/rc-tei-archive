               <div class="indent0">My dear Chauncey,</div>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I received your parcel this afternoon, and thank you for the book, for the dedication,
                  and for the sonnet.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A copy of Townshend’s Poems (London, 1821), which was dedicated to Southey ‘IN TOKEN
                           OF GRATITUDE, AND AFFECTION’, and in which Townshend paid ‘public tribute’ to him
                           in a separate dedicatory sonnet (pp. iii–iv).</span></div>
                  </div> As yet I have only had time to recognise several pieces which pleased me formerly,
                  and to read a few others which please me now.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The stages of your life have passed regularly and happily, so that you have had leisure
               to mark them with precision, and to feel them, and reflect upon them. With me these
               transitions were of a very different character; they came abruptly, and, when I left
               the University, it was to cast myself upon the world, with a heart full of romance,
               and a head full of enthusiasm. No young man could have gone more widely astray, according
               to all human judgement; and yet the soundest judgement could not have led me into
               any other way of life in which I should have had such full cause to be contented and
               thankful.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The world is now before you; but you have neither difficulties to struggle with, nor
               dangers to apprehend. All that the heart of a wise man can desire is within your reach.
               And you are blest with a disposition which will keep you out of public life, in which
               my advice to those whom I loved would be, – never to engage.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Your Cambridge wit is excellent of its kind. I am not acquainted with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeHenryNelson">Coleridge of King’s</a>; but somewhat intimately so with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">one of his brothers</a>, now at the bar, and likely to rise very high in his profession. I know no man of
               whose judgement and principles I have a higher opinion. They are a remarkably gifted
               family, and may be expected to distinguish themselves in many ways.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The Wordsworths spoke of you with great pleasure upon their return from Cambridge.

                  in the same direction; for while I have been sketching a brief history of the English
                  Church, and the systems which it has subdued or struggled with, he has been pursuing
                  precisely the same subject in a series of sonnets, to which my volume will serve for
                  a commentary, as completely as if it had been written with that intent.

                  the other the Revolutionists are for destroying every thing. Spain is in a deplorable
