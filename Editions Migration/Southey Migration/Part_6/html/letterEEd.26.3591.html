            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The mystery concerning the Peninsular War is explained at last.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s History of the Peninsular War (1823–1832). Southey had wished it to be printed
                           by William Nicol (d. c. 1855), but Murray insisted on using his regular collaborator,
                           Thomas Davison (1766–1831).</span></div>
                  </div> Yesterday I received four sheets of it, with a note from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a>. He says “I hope you will not think me very inconsistent if I entreat you not to
                  press me about the printer. Both <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> &amp; myself have formed connections in this line who are occasionally most importantly
                  serviceable to us in our business, &amp; therefore feel exceedingly hurt when a work so
                  important as yours in every respect is taken from them. – Have the goodness to say
                  that I had long ago promised the work to another printer, &amp; had forgotten it, – it
                  has been so long in preparation.”</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">He says more to the same purport which need not be transcribed. The matter is now
               plain, – he has been ashamed to <span class="strikethrough">xxy</span> say that he did not mean to keep his promise, knowing in how uncomfortable a situation
               it would place me, – &amp; so delayed it till it could be delayed no longer. – I can do
               no more, &amp; am very sorry that the matter ends thus, &amp; that your wishes &amp; mine should
               thus be thwarted. Tell W<sup>m</sup> Nicol this. – Who is printing it I do not yet know, – the proofs came under an Admiralty
               frank, &amp; for want of any other direction I must send them back thro the same channel.</p>
            <p class="indent1">If it had not been for the vexation which thus accompanied it, the arrival of these
               first proofs would have been the most chearing event of this Christmas. When I am
               <span class="ital">in</span> so far in printers ink, the stimulus to go on is never wanting; – &amp; the prospect
               of three volumes in which I am now fairly embarked <span class="strikethrough">has also the</span> &lt;has upon me&gt; an encouraging &amp; exhilarating effect.</p>
