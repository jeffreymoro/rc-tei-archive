                  </div> if any thing could be got for him, I told him I did not know that any thing was to
                  be had except a grant of land, in which, probably, interest might be of some use as
                  far as regarded situation; – &amp; perhaps in the first instance employment to take charge
                  of some settlers, if more were sent out, which would enable him to look out for himself,
                  – this being what he proposed, to go &amp; make preparations, while <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheySarah">Sarah</a> could live upon her own means, &amp; upon Miss Wilbrahams payments.

                  </div> We talked about it, somewhat vaguely, but on my part so as to encourage him in the
                  only sensible plan he can adopt, &amp; the only way which is open to him for securing
                  an independence for himself &amp; his children; &amp; he desired me to make inquiry whether
                  there was any appointment which could be obtained for him there, or what he might
                  expect. – I will set <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> to feel the way, thro <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</a>, &amp; when we know what is to be done, then try what I can do with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a>. If you can learn any thing, of course you will. It is very well that he ventures
                  to look at his situation fairly, &amp; that this thought should have occurred to his own
                  mind, as it has long since done to yours &amp; mine.</p>
