                  </div> I think it must have been sent me in mistake &amp; have told him so. But if it should

                  books of his in my possession, &amp; break off the connection with the Review, whatever
                  may be the present inconvenience to myself. – It is even now sufficiently inconvenient,
                  for I calculated upon this money for my Christmas bills. – But I will say no more
                  upon this till I hear again from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a>, or from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> &amp; see how the matter stands.</p>

               <p>I have been obliged to complain to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> of the mutilations which he has made in this paper. Pray recover the MSS if you can,
                  – or what would be better, the set of proof sheets. – He has played <span class="strikethrough">with</span> the Devil with me, – as you will see by comparing the account of Dominic the Cuirassier

                  </div> It is very provoking to have an historical paper of that kind, which perhaps no person
                  in England but myself could have written, treated like a school boys theme. Vexed
                  however as I am, I have too much liking for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> to be angry with him, &amp; have written to him in a manner which will prove this.</p>
