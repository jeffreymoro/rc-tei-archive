                  ago that his prospects should not be injured by his brothers conduct. Not long since
                  the King asked him if he ever had any communication with his brother. The officer
                  replied that he had not, nor ever would have, because of his mischievous conduct.
                  “Write to him, said the King, &amp; tell him to speak the truth, for I like to hear it,
                  but tell him to speak nothing but the truth.” The King used to read the Correio, <span class="strikethrough">but</span> till he was disgusted with the violence &amp; falsehood which it not unfrequently contains.</p>
