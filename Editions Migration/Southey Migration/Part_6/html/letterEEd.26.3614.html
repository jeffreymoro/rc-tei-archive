                           was undoubtedly ‘political’, not only praising Britain’s victory in the war against
                           France, but stating: ‘The same perfect integrity has been manifested in the whole
                           administration of public affairs’ (vi); not a view the Whig opposition endorsed. However,
                           the earlier draft of the ‘Dedication’ in Huntington Library, San Marino, HM 2733,
                           shows Southey had intended to go much further and urge that ‘adequate remedy should
                           be applied to that intolerable licentiousness of the press … either by the vigorous
                           application…</span></div>
                  </div> With regard to the political part of it it refers to the poem &amp; therefore is not misplaced
                  – As for its provoking censure &amp; abuse so let it. These are not times for acting timidly.
                  &amp; you must remember th[MS torn] the cut-throat part of the press cannot hate me more
                  virulently than they do. – My only demur is whether there be an impropriety in there
                  appearing to offer advice to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</a>, – tho it is no more than is done in all the addresses. <span class="strikethrough">Xxxx</span> Upon this I should like you to consult <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</a>, as a safe opinion, – &amp; if you both agree that the dedication had better be suppressed,
