               <p>Now to a more important subject. You were duly apprized towards the end of the year
                  of Othello’s death. Since that lamented event this house was cat-less, till on Saturday
                  March 24<sup>th</sup> M<sup>rs</sup> Calvert,

                  </div> knowing how grievously we were annoyed by rats afforded me what she described as a
                  fine full &lt;grown&gt; black cat, who was moreover a Tom. She gave him an excellent character
                  in all points but one, which was that he was a most expert pigeon catcher; &amp; as they
                  had a pigeon house, this propensity rendered it necessary to pass sentence upon him
                  either of transportation or of death. Moved by compassion (his colour &amp; his Tomship
                  also being taken into consideration) I consented to give him an asylum, &amp; on the evening
                  of that day, here he came – in a sack.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You Grosvenor who are a philogatist &amp; therefore understand more of cat-nature than
                  has been ever attained by the most profound naturalists, know how difficult it is
                  to reconcile a cat to a <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> new domicile. When the sack was opened, the kitchen door <span class="strikethrough">which leads</span> into the passage was open also, – &amp; the cat disappeared; not indeed like a flash of
                  lightning, but as fast as one, – that is to say, for all purposes of a simily. There
                  was no chance of his making his way back to the Pigeon House; he might have done this
                  had he been carried thrice the distance in any other direction, – but in this, there
                  was either a river to cross, or a part of the town to pass, both of which were such
                  obstacles to his travels that we were quite sure all on this side of them was to him
                  terra incognita. Food therefore was placed where he would be likely to find it in
                  the night, &amp; at the unanimous desire of the children I took upon myself the charge
                  of providing him with a name, for it is not proper that a Cat should remain without
                  one. Taking into consideration his complection as well as his sex, <span class="strikethrough">I</span> my first thought was to call him Henrique Diaz,

                  to me that The Zombi
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                           (7)

                           fugitive slaves in Brazil.</span></div>
                  </div> would be an appellation equally appropriate &amp; more dignified. The Zombi therefore
                  he was named.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">It was soon ascertained that the Zombi had taken possession of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">poor Wilseys</a> cellar, which being filled with pea-sticks afforded him a secure hiding place, –
               the kitchen also of that part of the house being forsaken, he was in perfect quiet.
               Food was laid for him every day, &amp; the children waited impatiently for the time when
               the Zombi would become acquainted with the house, &amp; suffer them to bec&lt;ome&gt; acquainted
               with him. Once or twice in the evening he was seen out of doors, &amp; it was known that
               he reconnoitred the <span class="strikethrough">house</span> &lt;premises&gt; in the night, but in obstinate retirement he continued from Saturday till
               Saturday, seven days &amp; nights, notwithstanding all kind words were used to bring him
               out, – as if he had been <span class="strikethrough">resolved obstinately</span> determined to live &amp; die a hermit.</p>
            <p class="indent1">But <span class="strikethrough">before</span> between four &amp; five o clock on the Sunday morning, all who had ears to hear were
               awakened by such screams as if the Zombi had been caught in a rat-trap, or had met
               with some other excruciating accident. You M<sup>r</sup> Bedford understand cats, &amp; know very well that a Cat-solo is a very different thing
               from a duet: &amp; that no person versed in their <span class="strikethrough">own</span> tongue can mistake their expression of pain for any thing else. The creature seemed
               to be in agonies – a light was procured, that it might be relieved if that were possible,
               – upon searching the house the Zombi was seen at the top of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">Wilseys</a> stairs; from whence he disappeared retreating to his strong hold in the cellar nor
               could any traces be discovered of any hurt that could have befallen him; nor has it
               since appeared that he had received any, so that the cause of this nocturnal disturbance
               remains an impenetrable mystery.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Various have been our attempts to explain it. Some of the women who measure the power
               of Rats by their own fears, would have it that he was bitten by a Rat, or by an Association
               of Rats, but to this I indignantly replied that in that case the ground would have
               been strewn with their bodies, – &amp; that it would have been the Rats cry, not the Zombi’s
               that would have been heard. Dismissing therefore that impossible supposition I submit
               to your consideration in the form of queries the various possibilities which have
               occurred to me, – all unsatisfactory I confess, – requesting you to assist me in my
               endeavours to find out the mystery of this wonderful history, as it may truly be called.
               You will be pleased to bear in mind that the Zombi was the only Cat concerned in the
               transaction; – of that I am perfectly certain.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Now then Grosvenor, –</p>
