               <p>I hope you have not delayed sending the Preface for the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Patres Nostri</a>, in expectation of my answer &lt;with&gt; an amended dedication, for this may be returned

                           xvii–xxii. The ‘Dedication’ was controversial, not only praising Britain’s victory
                           in the war against France, but stating: ‘The same perfect integrity has been manifested
                           in the whole administration of public affairs’ (vi); not a view the Whig opposition
                           endorsed. However, the earlier draft of the ‘Dedication’, in Huntington Library, San
                           Marino, HM 2733, shows Southey had intended to go much further and urge that ‘adequate
                           remedy should be applied to that intolerable licentiousness of the press … either

                  </div> My present intention is to retain the first &amp; last sentences &amp; nothing more. A mere
                  dedication <span class="ital">sans phrase</span> would look as if I were afraid of giving <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</a> that praise <span class="strikethrough">th</span> which he deserves, but he certainly is a splendid patron of art, he has done for science
                  every thing that has been asked of him, &amp; has shown the same disposition towards literature.
                  I have lived long enough to know that praise is the best kind of excitement. – In
                  the other part of the Ded: I suspected an informality, but was willing to give it
                  a chance, knowing <span class="strikethrough">that then it would be</span> upon that point you &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</a> would decide without fear of error. I shall send a copy for him to your care, unless
                  in the mean time you give me a direction to him. – Did you read the Preface? The metre
                  I think is clearly explained to the unlearned &amp; the question of its adaptability stated
                  with the utmost fairness. The part about D Juan will make <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">a certain bookseller</a> feel “unpleasant as a gentleman”
