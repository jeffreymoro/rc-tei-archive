               <p>You may imagine with what pleasure I find myself once more at my desk by my own fire-side,
                  after so long an absence &amp; so fatiguing a course of life as that from which I have
                  escaped.

                  </div> I found all well, God be thanked. The children are perfectly recovered from the measles
                  &amp; all its consequences. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Your god-daughter</a> is looking as well as I could wish to see her. She thanks you for your present, &amp;
                  will wear it on high days &amp; holy days with more pleasure – for the donors sake. I
                  very much &lt;wish&gt; that you could see this girl, &amp; see enough of her to know her character.
                  You would be pleased with it in all points. She has a quickness of comprehension which
                  is quite delightful: – frankness, perfect simplicity, lively feelings all of the right
                  kind, &amp; a love of <span class="strikethrough">all</span> &lt;those&gt; useful womanly employments, which are perfectly compatible with <span class="strikethrough">the</span> every womanly accomplishment but are worth all the accomplishments in the world. I
                  could not have had a daughter more after my own heart. The other three, tho all as
                  different as sisters can well be from each other, promise excellently well, each after
                  her kind.

                  alone. A few minutes seemed to bring me to his recollection, – &amp; when the book was
                  produced &amp; I talked to him in the respective languages of Rhinoceros, the Hyena, the
                  Lynx the Eagle, the Cuckoo &amp; the Serpent, he became presently as fond of me as he
                  had been before my departure.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Our journey was remarkably fortunate, tho I was disappointed on not finding <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt</a> at Birmingham. She had reached Bristol but was deterred by the heat from attempting
                  to proceed. When <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</a> &amp; I embarked in the Mail at the Green Man &amp; Stile,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> the thermometers in the window of the Optician next door, were standing at 85, &amp; this
                  at eight o clock in the evening! Yet as soon as we were fairly out of town, there
                  was just breeze enough to refresh us, &amp; about one in the morning, I was wakened by
                  the rain coming in upon my face. A good thunder shower laid the dust &amp; compleatly
                  cooled the atmosphere. We slept the next night at Birmingham in the house of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharlesSnr">Charles Lloyds father</a>, &amp; on Friday morning proceeded in the Manchester Mail. When we reached Manchester
                  there was only room for one inside, &amp; one out, in the Kendal mail, &amp; that only as
                  far as Preston, where the chance of getting places for the remainder of the journey
                  depended upon the coach which was to join this mail, from Liverpool. To pass a night
                  however at a Manchester Inn is so great an evil, that putting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</a> in the inside, I mounted the roof at nine o clock at night. It was a threatening sky,
                  &amp; both my great coats (an old one &amp; a new) were quietly lying packed up for the waggon
                  in London. I cannot tell by what <span class="strikethrough">good</span> happy adaptation <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">Nash’s</a> great coat was found to fit me perfectly well in every thing, except in length, which
                  was of no consequence. The moon rose about eleven, &amp; to my great delight <span class="ital">comio poco a poco todas las nubes</span>,
