               <p>During the last year or year &amp; half that I was at Westminster one imposition served
                  me: – after it was given up &amp; laid on the table, it was regularly abstracted either
                  by myself or the Αναξ ανδρων,

                  </div> might have betrayed its history to an observant eye. Something like this I have now
                  good hope of effecting with my Official Odes. It was notified to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ShieldWilliam">Shield</a> that one would be required this year; &amp; one having been made ready (which to him is
                  really a serious labour, the mere transcribing the music being a weeks work for an
                  industrious copyist!) he is plainly mortified that it has not been called for. I on
                  the other hand, am exceedingly well pleased, meaning not to write any thing else upon
                  S<sup>t</sup> Georges Day, as long as this can be kept in reserve.

                           on St George’s Day (23 April), unless it fell on a Sunday, in which case it would
                           be celebrated on 24 April. For this occasion in 1821, Southey composed the ‘Ode for
                           St George’s Day’, unpublished until Poetical Works, 10 vols (London, 1837–1838), III,
                           pp. 258–262; it was not performed in 1821, or subsequently, and Southey never wrote
                           another Birthday Ode.</span></div>

               <p>I am very glad to hear that you are concerned with the Records, especially if it is

                           to publish collections of medieval records, as well as series like Statutes of the

                  to make use of it is a serious consideration. These things are best done by an efficient
                  Academy, where there are no monastic institutions, or none who maintain a character
                  for erudition. Such an Academy might render very great service to British literature,
                  – but the scheme which was lately talkd of was absurd enough to make the very name
                  ridiculous.
