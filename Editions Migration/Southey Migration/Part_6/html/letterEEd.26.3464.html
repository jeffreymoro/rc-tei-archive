                  &amp; to stay there two clear days. This will depend upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</a> movements for London. But I shall be in town either on Wednesday the 26<sup>th</sup> or Friday the 28<sup>th</sup>. And I will let you know on which day to expect me, as soon as that point can be

                  add something to it before my departure. But I think it will not do for publication
                  at this time; because <span class="strikethrough">th</span> such <span class="strikethrough">are</span> an event as the Kings death,

                  </div> while it is recent, is too affecting &amp; too solemn a reality (in the present case)
                  to be made the subject of a fiction. This you will say I ought to have considered
                  before I began to write. Very true, – but then I should not have written upon the
                  subject. For certain as it was that every body would be putting their wits in requisition,
                  I should not have chosen to send any thing into the world upon <span class="strikethrough">this</span> such an occasion unless it were altogether different from all other compositions that
                  were to be expected.</p>

               strikes any person to whom I shall show it, as it does myself I shall certainly lay
               it aside), <span class="strikethrough">x</span> it will not be thrown away. The metrical experiment which I have long been desirous
               of making, has here been fairly made, &amp; with compleat success. I have proved that
               hexameters may as well be written in English as in German; that they are in no respect
               dissuited to the genius of our language; &amp; that the measure is full, stately &amp; sonorous,
               capable of great variety, great sweetness &amp; great strength. I shall certainly finish
               the poem, that it may be ready for publication after such lapse of time as may remove
               the objection to its appearance. <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx x</span></p>

                  the perversity to me, or my fortunes, but a perversity in one or the other, or both,
                  there is. Twenty years ago when I would gladly have written poems as fast as the printer
                  could carry them thro the Press, – <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> I must have starved if I had done so, – &amp; during seven long years I wrote reviews
                  at seven pounds per sheet royal, because Thalaba &amp; Madoc were lying in the publishers
                  warehouse.

                  </div> Now, poetry would pay me better than any thing else, but the inclination for it is
                  gone; &amp; if it were not with a view to profit, I do not believe that I should ever
