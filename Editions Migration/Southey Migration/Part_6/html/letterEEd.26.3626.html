                  you will take some interest. About the time that your letter reached me, I received
                  from a most respectable quarter, a communication affecting M<sup>r</sup> Wesleys moral &amp; religious character more seriously than any direct charge which was
                  ever brought against him by his enemies &amp; calummiators.

               &amp; necessary, after satisfying myself concerning the source from which it came.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I wrote accordingly to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonGloster">Gentleman</a> in whose possession the original was said to be.

                  </div> He confirmed the statement in all its parts; tho it appears that what he possesses
                  is not the original letter, but a copy of it given by M<sup>rs</sup> Wesley to his mother. He is perfectly convinced that the letter is genuine, &amp; he tells
                  me that having once shown it to a person who had known Miss Briggs, that person pronounced
                  it to be such a letter as she was very likely to have written.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">And now my dear Sir, you will be anxious to know what my own thoughts upon this subject
               are, &amp; how I am disposed to act. I cannot tell you whether I was more grieved or surprized
               at the communication. From the letter itself I concluded it genuine; it has the true
               stamp of passion: very few persons would be capable of writing it, unless under the
               influence of the feelings which it so strongly &amp; naturally expresses. At the same
               time I felt the strongest reluctance to publish a fact which would fix so foul a stain
               upon the character of one to whose errors (as I conceive them to be) I am not blind,
               but for whose virtues I have as much veneration as can possibly be felt by the most
               devoted of his disciples. On the other hand, in the relation wherein I stand as M<sup>r</sup> Wesleys biographer, the suppression of such a fact would expose me to charges, against
               which I know not what defence could be opposed. For that the letter will get abroad
               sooner or later there can be no doubt; &amp; it is of main importance that the real character
               of such a man should be searched &amp; understood.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Had the original letter been in existence I would have spared neither cost nor pains
               to ascertain whether it was the writing of Miss Briggs; &amp; had that full evidence been
               obtained, I must have made the fact public. It happens however, that no such proof
               is possible: &amp; on an inferior degree of proof I may reasonably demur where any character,
               &amp; especially such a one as M<sup>r</sup> Wesley’s is at stake. Another consideration also weighs with me. The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonGloster">Gentleman</a> who vouches for the authenticity of the letter repeats on his mothers authority some
               things said by M<sup>rs</sup> Wesley concerning her husband which very much weaken the opinion that otherwise I
               should certainly have entertained. She said that she considered her life in danger
               from him. Now I think a woman who could say this of M<sup>r</sup> Wesley would not scruple at forging a letter for the purpose of blasting his reputation.
               These considerations incline me to let the matter rest till another edition of my
               work may be called for. By that time more circumstances may possibly come to light,
               &amp; enable me to form an opinion with less hesitation than I now feel. At present I
               suspect the charge is false: but then I wish to find it so, &amp; therefore must in some
               degree distrust my own judgement more than I should otherwise do.</p>
