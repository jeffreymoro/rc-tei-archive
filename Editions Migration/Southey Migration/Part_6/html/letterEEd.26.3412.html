            <p class="indent1">A happy new year to you. Mine has had but an inauspicious beginning. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</a> was seized with a bilious attack on the 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; it is but just now that we can pronounce him, I hope, to be recovering. The recovery
               however will be sadly impeded by an endemic catarrh &amp; cough, with which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">the mother</a> &amp; all the children are at this time affected, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> C.</a> to boot. As yet I have escaped, but I have suffered much from anxiety, &amp; was laid
               up the whole of yesterday by a sick headache. It gave me however the first opportunity
               of trying an experiment which I give myself credit for devising, – that of taking
               milk &amp; water, instead of warm water only, when vomiting is to be excited. I thought
               this would take off the edge of the acidity, &amp; preserve the throat from that excoriating
               sensation <span class="strikethrough">t</span> which this operation had always before produced. It succeeded perfectly. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry</a> who likes a physical fact will be pleased with this; &amp; reasoning from this, I think
               a draught of milk might very probably remove the heart-burn.</p>
