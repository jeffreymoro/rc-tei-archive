                           (1703–1788), who also acquired the Theatre Royal in Bristol. He was the father of
                           Miss Palmer. The same repertory company performed at both theatres.</span></div>
                  </div> The performers were stationed half the year in one city, half in the other. When they
                  played on Mondays, Wednesdays &amp; Fridays at Bristol, they went to Bath on the Saturday
                  in two immense coaches big as a caravan of wild beasts, &amp; returned after the play!
                  When the nights of performance at Bath were Tuesdays Thursdays &amp; Saturdays they went
                  to Bristol on the Monday. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</a>, thro her intimacy with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PalmerMiss">Miss Palmer</a> had the command<span class="strikethrough">s</span> of orders for free admission; she was exceedingly fond of theatrical representations,
                  &amp; there was no subject of which I heard so much, from my earliest childhood. &lt;It <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> &lt;&lt;brought upon&gt;&gt; me once a most severe reprehension for innocently applying to the
                  Church, a phrase which I then learnt to my cost belonged only to the Playhouse, –
                  &amp; saying one Sunday on our return from morning-service, that it had been a very <span class="ital">full House</span>.&gt; When I was taken to the theatre for the first time I perfectly well remember my
                  surprize at not finding the Pit literally a deep hole, into which I had often puzzled
                  myself to think how, or why, any people could possibly go. You may judge by this how
                  very young I must have been. I recollect nothing more of that first visit, except
                  that the play was the Fathers, a comedy of Fieldings, which was acted not more than
                  one season, &amp; the farce was Coxheath Camp: – this recollection however, by the help
                  of that useful book the Biographia Dramatica, fixes the date to 1778, – when I was
                  four years old.

                           Michael’s Hill, Bristol. General Baptists differed from Particular Baptists in believing
                           that all people possessed the free will to be saved, with God’s grace, and none were
                           predestined to damnation. At this time many General Baptists held unorthodox views
                           of the Trinity, and Southey suggests Foot was at least a follower of Arius (250–336
                           AD) in believing that Jesus was a divine being created by, and subordinate to, God.

                  if indeed he were not a Socinian. With this however I had nothing to do, nor did my
                  parents regard it. He was an <span class="strikethrough">very</span> old man, &amp; if the school had ever been a good one, it had woefully deteriorated. I
                  was one of the least boys there, – I believe the very least, &amp; certainly both as willing
                  &amp; as apt to learn, as any teacher could have desired: yet it was the only school where
                  I was ever treated with severity. <span class="strikethrough">The</span> Lessons in the grammar which I did not comprehend, &amp; yet would have learned well enough
                  by rote under gentle discipline, were frightened out of my head, &amp; then I was shut
                  up in a closet at the top of the stairs, with just light enough thro some bars to
                  see my lesson by. Once he caned me cruelly, – the only time that any master ever laid
                  his hand upon me: – &amp; I am sure he deserved a beating much more than I did. There
                  was a great deal of tyranny in the school, from the worst of which I was exempted
                  because I went home <span class="strikethrough">at</span> in the evening: but I stood in great fear of the big boys, &amp; saw much more of the
                  evil side of human nature than I should ever have learnt in the course of domestic
                  education.</p>

Unfortunately <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</a> (I know not for what reason) thought proper to remove me upon M<sup>r</sup> Foots death, &amp; placed me at a school nine miles from Bristol, in a village called
