            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>… … You form a just opinion of the character and tendency of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor’s</a> conversation. A most unfortunate perversion of mind has made him always desirous of
                  supporting strange and paradoxical opinions by ingenious arguments, and showing what
                  may be said on the wrong side of a question. He likes to be in a state of doubt upon
                  all subjects where doubt is possible, and has often said, ‘I begin to be too sure
                  of that, and must see what reasons I can find against it.’ But when this is applied
                  to great and momentous truths, the consequences are of the most fatal kind. I believe
                  no man ever carried Pyrrhonism

                           doubt on our ability to gain knowledge of the world and thus encouraged a spirit of
                           continuous enquiry and the suspension of judgement. </span></div>
                  </div> farther. But it has never led him into immoralities of any kind, nor prevented him
                  from discharging the duties of private life in the most exemplary manner. There never
                  lived a more dutiful son. I have seen his blind mother

                  limited by his means.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">What is more remarkable is, that this habitual and excessive scepticism has weakened
               none of the sectarian prejudices in which he was bought up. He sympathises as cordially
               with the Unitarians in their animosity to the Church and State, as if he agreed with
               them in belief, and finds as strong a bond of union in party-spirit as he could do
               in principle.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>With regard to his talents, they are very great. No man can exceed him in ingenuity,
                  nor in the readiness with which he adorns a subject by apt and lively illustrations.
                  His knowledge is extensive, but not deep. When first I saw him, three-and-twenty years
                  ago, I thought him the best informed man with whom I had ever conversed.

                  </div> When I visited him last, after a lapse of eight years, I discovered the limits of
                  his information, and that upon all subjects it was very incomplete.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Of his heart and disposition I cannot speak more highly than I think. It is my belief
               that no man every brought a kindlier nature into this world. His great talents have
               been sadly wasted; and, what is worse, they have sometimes been sadly misemployed.
               He has unsettled the faith of many, and he has prepared for his own old age a pillow
               of thorns. To all reasoning, the pride of reason has made him inaccessible; and when
               I think of him, as I often do, with affection and sorrowful foreboding, the only foundation
               of hope is, that God is merciful, beyond our expectations, as well as beyond our deserts.</p>

               <p>Thank you for the copy of Cromwell’s Letters. The transcriber has tasked his own eyes,
