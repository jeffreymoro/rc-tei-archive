            <p class="indent1">I did not mean them to be cold.</p>
            <p class="indent1">That’s a kind speech, &amp; therefore I’ll tell him what you say.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Tell him you’re a ridiculous creature yourself, – but I dare say he knows that already.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Lest however M<sup>r</sup> Bedford should not know it, I have thus <span class="strikethrough">faithfully</span> obeyed <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> Coleridges</a> instructions to the letter. Our dialogues frequently end in some such sort of <span class="strikethrough">x</span> compliment to my <span class="ital">creature</span>ship, &amp; would very well bear inkification <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> sometimes, if there were a faithful notary at hand, especially when your honour is

                           Here Southey severely criticised Henry Hervey Baber (1775–1869; DNB), Keeper of Printed
                           Books at the British Museum 1812–1837, for serving a writ on Murray because his firm
                           had been dilatory in sending copies of four books it had published to the British
                           Museum, as the Copyright Act (1814) required. Southey made use of a good deal of material
                           provided by Murray for this article, including Murray’s testimony to the House of
                           Commons Select Committee on the Copyright Act (1818).</span></div>

                  me, in full force, to the sore annoyance of eyes, nose &amp; mouth, three considerable
                  parts in a mans face. – Our weather is like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> C’s</a> compliments to your honour, in their first delivery, – dry &amp; cold. The potatoe tops
                  last night were blackened by the frost, &amp; a passing cloud has just powdered old <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaws</a> foretop.
