                  the means, – before he separated from the Moravians, &amp; called in the assistance of

               <p>You ask me concerning a purpose which I entertained two or three years ago of writing

                  </div> I meant to have prepared an historical sketch of those islands (which seem from the
                  hour of their discovery to have lain under a curse); for the purpose of enforcing
                  the necessity of registering the slaves, &amp; holding out the gradual emancipation of
                  the negroes, &amp; the ultimate amalgamation of all casts &amp; colours as the measures to
                  which we should look on, unless we prefer the continuance of enormous guilt, &amp; the
                  certainty, sooner or later, of the visitation which in its natural &amp; proper consequences,
                  it must draw on. But when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> understood upon what principle I meant to write, he entreated me to forbear. I know
                  not what mistaken notion was in his head, – nor to whom he had listened. Neither did
                  I care to enquire, for I had an opportunity in distant prospect of expressing myself
                  upon those subjects without restraint. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">One of my brothers</a> (a Sea-Captain) has occupied his leisure for many years upon a chronological history

                  to literary composition. He has made great progress, &amp; done his part elaborately.
                  And what I have to say will be <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> embodied in his annals, in the form of introductory chapters, &amp; general views &amp; reflections
                  – in their proper place. – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">My brother</a> has been in the West Indies, &amp; brought back with him as honest an abhorrence of slavery

                  – there it is the appropriate punishment, preventing a repetition of the offence,
                  &amp; curing the offender by change of climate. How many hundreds &amp; thousands whose minds
