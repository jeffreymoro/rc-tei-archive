               go where I should be expects to open my mouth &amp; roar.</p>
            <p class="indent1">There is another reason why I would not attend the Westminster Meeting. As I never

               so before. Whereas so far was I from harbouring any resentment toward <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VincentWilliam">Vincent</a>, or any unpleasant feeling of any kind, that I have long, &amp; with good reason, looked
               upon my expulsion from Westminster as having been in its consequences the luckiest
               event of my life. And for many years I should have been glad to have met the old man,
