                  of the community has any such designs; and this may be fairly presumed from the peace

                  men of firm minds, – is to be found in all the public journals. If, according to the

                           of the ‘Pentrich Revolution’ in Derbyshire on 9–10 June 1817, an armed insurrection
                           largely instigated by a government spy.</span></div>
                  </div> but it involves, also, a very dangerous delusion which might impose upon well-meaning
                  persons, and is, therefore, far more mischievous than a falsehood which the recollection

                  peace and order indicate a natural and healthy state of public feeling. But when multitudes,
                  whose numbers are estimated by tens of thousands, collect upon so extraordinary a
                  business as that of deliberating upon a change in the Constitution of the country,
                  nothing short of <span class="ital">Revolution</span>; when they come with black flags and bloody daggers for their banners, and with Universal

                           commented on by conservatives. Here Southey paraphrases the Manchester magistrate,
                           James Norris’s (c. 1774–1838), speech committing Hunt to trial for conspiracy on 27
                           August 1819, which condemned ‘the black flag, the bloody dagger, the words equal representation,
                           or death’ on the crowd’s banners.</span></div>
                  </div> armed with staves or bludgeons, advancing in rank and file, with military step, and
                  marching and wheeling at the word of command, with the precision of disciplined soldiers,
                  the peace and good order with which such meetings are conducted, while such purposes
                  and resolutions are proclaimed, are proofs not of peaceable and innocent intentions
                  but of the most desperate and perilous designs, of a planned and prepared Rebellion.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Secondly, The hand bill says it is not true that the multitude have ever been taught
               to believe that the administration of public affairs ought to be taken from persons
               who are qualified by their education and station in life, and whose stake in the country
               is a pledge for their good intentions, and transferred to the ignorant and needy,
               who are necessarily incompetent, and who have nothing to lose.” – In reply to this
               round denial, I affirm that the statement which it contradicts, is strictly and literally
               true. The <span class="ital">Radical Orators</span> have repeatedly declared, that the people of property of either party, have abused
               the legislative authority with which they have hitherto been entrusted, and therefore,
               that it must be taken from them. This is the <span class="ital">revolutionary doctrine</span>; and the <span class="ital">revolutionary practices</span> of all ages has been in strict conformity to it.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><span class="ital">Thirdly</span>. – the hand bill says “<span class="ital">it is a false, gratuitous, and libellous assertion, that County Meetings tend to encourage
                  wicked and desperate men in their rebellious purposes</span>.” What are the words of the Address? “We must express our sorrow that any persons
               of rank and respectability should be induced to take measures which obviously tend
               to encourage wicked and desperate men in their rebellious purposes.” He must be a
               very impudent man, who can assert that this sentence expresses or implies any condemnation
               of County meetings in general, and they must be very foolish ones who can believe
               him. But let any man of common honesty, and common sense, ask himself the question.
               Whether it is or is not encouraging the Radicals, if Resolutions are passed by persons
               of rank and respectability, which certainly imply, this they do not assert, that the
               Reformers at Manchester, when they assembled with sticks and staves, in military order,
               and with <span class="ital">black</span> flags, bearing a <span class="ital">bloody</span> dagger and the inscription of Universal Suffrage or Death, were at that time simply
               exercising the most invaluable and most unquestionable right of the people? Let him
               ask himself, whether the Radicals are or are not encouraged by seeing men of rank
               and respectability subscribe for the <span class="ital">Sufferers</span> at Manchester; as if these persons had suffered under some calamity which had fallen
               upon them unforeseen and inevitable, and as if they had not been forewarned by the
               Magistrates of the danger of assembling at that time and place. The very use of the
               word <span class="ital">sufferers</span>, in this case, prejudges the question; for it assumes the misconduct of the Magistrates
               and the innocence and legality of the meeting.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>“The people have a right to meet,” says the hand bill. Unquestionably they have, –
                  for all lawful purposes. This may be illustrated by an example from English History
                  which every school boy will understand. <span class="ital">Guy Faux</span>

                  a right to deposit any part of their property there; as many barrels, for instance
                  as they pleased, and to cover the barrels with faggots. Moreover, <span class="ital">Guy Faux</span> had an undoubted right to go out of his vault when he pleased – at any time or season,
                  whether the King and the Peers of the Realm were assembled in the Chamber above, or
                  not. And he had a right to carry a dark lanthorn into the aforesaid vault. – But the
                  Ministers of that day exercised the right of enquiring what those barrels contained,
                  and what use was to be made of the candle? – and they saved the <span class="ital">King and the Nobles</span> from the <span class="ital">Gunpowder Plot</span>.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>After all, the great question at issue is not whether the best means were resorted
                  to for carrying the warrant against Mr. Hunt into effect at Manchester and dissolving
                  that meeting; but whether the Laws, as they now exist, do not allow a discretionary
                  power to Magistrates for dissolving any numerous assembly, from which they may apprehend
                  danger to persons or property, before that assembly breaks out into open riot and
                  disorder; and whether meetings, constituted as the one at Manchester is by all parties
                  admitted to have been, can be allowed to take place wherever, and as often as the
                  parties themselves chuse, without endangering not the tranquillity and safety alone,
                  – but the very existence of the Country. This is the question at issue, – and the
                  course of investigation in which it is now placed will soon decide it.
