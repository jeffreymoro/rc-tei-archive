            <p class="indent1">my sonnet <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> speaks my resolution. blame it or applaud it as you will, but show it only to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a>. we go a good party. not less than six, some of whom you know; very probably more.
               it will be hardly possible to go before next summer, by that time I hope matters will
               be sufficiently arranged. when we meet you shall know our plan — &amp; you may perhaps
               think it too good to be practicable.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Joan of Arc as you may suppose, occupies much of my time. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a> will execute a vignette &amp; frontispiece for me. from what particular passage is not
               yet determined, but when this storm of rain is over, I shall visit <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</a> &amp; settle that point. the poem goes to the press when fifty copies are subscribed
               for. I have already fourteen in my pocket book.</p>

                  seeing all our aristocratic friends come flying over for shelter to America. then
                  will we kill the fatted calf &amp; make merry, for “they that were lost are found”.
