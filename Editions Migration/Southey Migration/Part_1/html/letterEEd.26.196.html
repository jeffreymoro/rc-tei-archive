               <div class="salute">SIR,</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">AS many exaggerated accounts have appeared of the cavern lately discovered at Burrington-Coome,
               in Somersetshire, an authentic description may, perhaps, be acceptable to your readers.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It was related in the newspapers, that thirty skeletons were discovered, perfect,
               and lying north and south, the bones cemented to the rock: but neither was there any
               perfect skeleton, or any apparent regularity in the mode of laying them. The entrance
               to the cavern is by a steep descent: from the irregular manner in which the skulls
               lie, it appears, that the bodies were thrown down carelessly; and I am confirmed in
               this opinion, by observing, that though the cavern extends one hundred and thirty
               feet, there are no bones farther in than a body thrown from the aperture would have
               fallen; none of the smaller bones remain. The skulls are incrusted with Stalactydes,
               and crumble away when an attempt is made to remove them.</p>
            <p class="indent1">A sepulchral vault was discovered, some few years back, near Nimlet, in the neighbourhood,
               but it has been destroyed, and the bones used in a lime-kiln near! Of this I could
               get no other information. In the parish of Budcome there is another, which I visited;
               it is shaped thus;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">[sketch of a cross]</p>
            <p>and extends about ten feet either way. Many bones were lying there, but as it is long
               since it was opened, I could learn nothing of the position in which they were found.
               The vault is very rudely constructed: it is on a level with the field, covered over
               with stones and rubbish, but so irregularly, as to present no appearance of a tumulus.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I shall be obliged to any of your readers who can inform me, at what period these
               modes of sepulture were common.</p>
