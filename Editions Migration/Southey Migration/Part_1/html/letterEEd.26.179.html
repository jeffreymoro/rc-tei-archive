               <p>GLOVER was on a visit at Stowe, when he wrote his celebrated ballad of Admiral Hosier’s

                  the night; he rose early, and went into the garden to compose. In the heat of composition,
                  he got into the tulip bed: unfortunately, he had a stick in his hand, and, with a
                  true poetical furor, hewed down the tulips. Lady Temple

                  around him, and suspected how his mind was occupied, asked him, at breakfast, how
                  he could think of destroying Lady Temple’s favourite flowers? The poet, perfectly
                  unconscious of what he had done, pleaded not guilty. There were, however, witnesses
                  enough to convict him. He acknowledged that he had been composing in the garden, and
                  excused himself by repeating the ballad.</p>
