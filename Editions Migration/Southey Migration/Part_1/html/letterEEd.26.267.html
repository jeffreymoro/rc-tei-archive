               is looking out for a congregation. a vacancy is expected at Shrewsbury — &amp; there application

                  </div> in the news-paper. — it surprized me. we are accustomed to think it dreadful for a
                  young man to die <span style="text-decoration: line-through">during</span> when his conduct is wrong. — perhaps tho a natural feeling this is a mistaken one.
                  two young men live in wickedness. the one dies unreclaimed in his youth. the other
                  grows old &amp; repents. so might the first, but for the accident of death. may we not
                  then expect the process of amendment to be carried on in the next state of existence?
                  else — can we expect the same work to be performed in a week or in a month? The full
                  belief of universal regeneration is become a feeling in me. now we can be happy without
                  believing in God — I know not — or in believing him &amp; immitigable in vengeance. —

                  an infatuation — I may say a drunkenness of devotion — which we must love. I feel
