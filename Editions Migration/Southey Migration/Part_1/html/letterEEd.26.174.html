                  </div> He has observed that many of the ballads of the gloomy German are translated with
                  improvements from English originals.− Perhaps the story of Leonora was suggested by
                  a ballad entitled, <em>“The Suffolk Miracle, or a relation of a Young Man, who a month after his death appeared
                     to his sweetheart, and carried her on horseback behind him for forty miles, in two
                     hours, and was never seen after but in his grave.”</em> It is in a collection of ballads, printed 1723.

               <p>As Bürger is well versed in this branch of English poetry, it is not improbable that
                  this rude but striking tale may have occasioned the sublime ballad of Leonora. However
                  this may be, it certainly contradicts a remark that has not unaptly been made upon
                  that Poem, that the difference between a German ghost and an English one is, that
                  the German rides on horseback, and the English one goes on foot.
