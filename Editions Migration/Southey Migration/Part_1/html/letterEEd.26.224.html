            <p class="indent1">* * * The main purport of my writing is, to tell you that we have found a house for
               the next half year. If I had a mind to affect the pastoral style, I might call it
               a cottage; but, in plain English, it is exactly what it expresses. We have got a sitting-room,
               and two bed-rooms, in a house which you may call a cottage if you like it, and that
               one of these bed-rooms is ready for you, and the sooner you take possession of it
               the better. You must let me know when you come that I may meet you.</p>
