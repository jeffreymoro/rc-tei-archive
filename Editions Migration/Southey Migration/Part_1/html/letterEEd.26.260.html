            <p class="indent1">I passed yesterday by a house which was once the uttermost boundary of my evening
               walks, when in early childhood I lived with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> at Bath, it is now whitened &amp; like a place where the towns people go to drink tea
               because it is rural. then it was a thatchd cottage, tenanted by an old man &amp; his wife.
               I had a pack of sentimental cards given me, the picture of the cottage there was like
               this old mans house &amp; I had strange associations of comfort &amp; retirement with the
               little <span style="text-decoration: line-through">house</span> &lt;dwelling&gt; in the orchard. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">But xx</span> beyond this place all was unknown — a terra incognito — a kind of infinity, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">beyond</span> &lt;into&gt; which I &lt;had&gt; never wandered — scarcely in imagination. After twenty years
               of restlessness &amp; experience, the feelings of childhood have become the principles
               of maturity, &amp; I would <span style="text-decoration: line-through">have giv</span> again most willingly &lt;continue&gt; my walks &amp; actions — aye even <span style="text-decoration: line-through">wil</span> my wishes within as small a boundary. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> action — even the thought of action — is irksome to me, quietness is all I wish,
               &amp; whatever intrudes upon that is unwishd &amp; unwelcome, I <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> am often silent in conversation lest ought argumentative should break in upon the
               tranquillity of the moment.</p>

                  liked going to school, replied “I dont care where I go — so I can have my own way”
                  — &amp; then my heart seemd coming up out my mouth — &amp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I gulpd</span> with a great gulp I checkd the rising tumult.</p>
