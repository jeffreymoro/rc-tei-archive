                  allow (said the curate) that there were three tragedies represented in Spain, a few
                  years ago, composed by a famous poet of these realms, which astonished, delighted,
                  and suspended all who heard them, simple as well as gentle, vulgar as well as learned,
                  and brought more money to the actors than thirty of the best plays which had been
                  written before them.” “Undoubtedly (replied the actor) you must speak of the Isabella,
                  Phillis, and Alexandra.” “I speak of them (replied the curate); see if they do not
                  observe the rules of art, and in consequence of observing them, please all the world.”

                  an idea of the state of the Spanish drama, in the golden age of their poetry.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The scene lies in Zaragoza, and the piece opens with a conversation between Alboacen,
               king of that city, and his minister Audalla. It appears, that Alboacen is on the point
               of going to war with Pedro, the Spanish monarch; this, however, alarms him not, his
               anxiety proceeds from an enemy within the walls of Zaragoza. By this enemy, Audalla
               understands the Christians, and the Moors are represented as intolerant in his speech;
               a right Catholic idea of the religion of Mohammed. Here too he relates the history
               of our Lady of the Pillar, and this relation must have secured the favour of a Zaragozan
               audience. — The king refuses to expel the Christians; he will favour them for Isabella’s
               sake, the cause of his anxiety, because the object of his fruitless love. This resolution
               of the king soon changes, when he learns, that Muley Albenzayde, his friend and favourite,
               is the favoured lover of Isabella, and her convert to Christianity. A soliloquy of
               Isabella follows, her fears and prayers are interrupted by the arrival of Muley, now
               returned from the Christian territories adjoining, where he has been baptized by the
               name of Lupercio. It is somewhat singular, that the author should have given his own
               name to the heroes of both his plays.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Isabella appears much distressed at the rumour that the Christians are to be expelled
               the city. Muley endeavours to quiet her apprehensions, and says, that as he is intimate
               with the king, he will make him delay this measure, under the pretext that it would
               inform Pedro prematurely of his hostile intentions; he will persuade Alboacen to promise
               tribute to Pedro, that he may have time to prepare for war. In the mean time, the
               Christians in Zaragoza may prepare themselves for resistance; and, when the king refuses
               tribute, he may be attacked or overpowered by foreign and domestic enemies. Satisfied
               that the end sanctifies the means, Muley departs with this intention.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In the following scene, Audalla informs himself and the audience, that he is desperately
               in love with Isabella; that it is very foolish, and very unfortunate, but he cannot
               help it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The servant of Muley tells Isabella that he has seen his master thrown into a dungeon
               among venomous serpents. Her sister enters, and tells her, that the house is surrounded
               by a crowd of Christians, that they know the king’s love for her, and that they come,
               led by her father, to intreat mercy from Isabella.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The second act opens with the supplications of the Christians to Isabella: her parents
               and her sister join them in intreating that she will supplicate the king for them.
               Isabella yields at last.</p>
            <p class="indent1">A scene follows between Adulce, the exiled king of Valencia, and Selin, his friend.
               He expresses his hope of being restored, by the aid of Alboacen, to his kingdom; but
               complains heavily of his love for that prince’s inexorable sister, Aja. He is now
               about to ride to see her, and Selin tells him his horse is ready:</p>

               of Muley, whose death Audalla demands. Isabella enters; in answer to her intreaties,
               Alboacen states, that he had applied to a holy man, to know the will of heaven, who
               had declared that the prophet could only be appeased by the sacrifice of that person
               whom the king loved best; that person is Isabella; but, willing to save her, he had
               banished the Christians that Isabella might depart with them, and chosen Muley for
               the victim. She attempts to convince him that he ought to sacrifice her, because this
               very attempt to save her, proves her to be the person he loves best. Provoked, at
               length, by jealousy, the king exclaims, that she shall have the death she desires,
               with the dog she loves.</p>

               of exciting an insurrection against his protector. She insists upon it, and leaves
               him to lament his fate in a long soliloquy, concluding the second act.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Audalla, finding that no means can subdue the virtue of Isabella, shows her the dead
               bodies of her father, mother, and sister, and sends her to execution. Aja is discovered
               upon the top of a tower, eagerly watching for Adulce, to save her beloved Muley. A
               messenger comes and informs her, that the Christians have lost two columns of their
               faith — but gained two martyrs. She listens to the long detail of their deaths, vows
               vengeance in a soliloquy, and departs to execute it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Azan and Zauzalla, two characters introduced only in this scene, now enter; and the
               one tells the other that he had overheard Audalla making love to Isabella, informed
               the king of it, and seen the old minister put to death.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Aja and Selin meet. Selin tells Aja that his master has killed himself, because he
               could not obey her injunctions. Aja tells him that she has killed Alboacen to revenge
               Muley, and then she kills herself. The tragedy is concluded by the ghost of Isabella,
               she says, that, like the phoenix, she rises from the funeral pile to heaven, and hopes,
               that whenever her history shall be represented on the stage, the audience will applaud
               it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The characters in this piece are fourteen, and ten of them are killed. The Alexandra
               has eleven characters, and nine of these are killed, without reckoning children. The
               editor has annexed some just and judicious remarks upon these tragedies, but they
               exceed my limits, and would not be new to an Englishman. Ill planned and ill executed
               as they are (the one which I have analysed is the best) they will reflect no disgrace
               on Lupercio Leonardo, when we recollect, that he could be but twenty years old when
               they were represented, and that they were superior to any his countrymen had then
               produced. The variety of metres in which they are written, though altogether improper
               for tragedy, advantageously display his powers in versification; and, if he had left
               no other works, there are passages brilliant enough in these, to entitle him to a
               high rank among the poets of Spain.</p>

                  </div> He lived to the age of fifty-six, deservedly respected, and the ease of a literary
                  and canonical life was only occasionally interrupted by the gout; a complaint which,
                  however painful it may be, is certainly an orthodox and gentleman-like one. The following
                  extract from an epistle, written by him in the latter years of his life, shall conclude
                  my account of Bartholome Leonardo; the ideas may not be new, but they are calm and
                  contemplative; they are lines which I often read with pleasure, and which make me
                  love the old rector of Villahermosa:</p>
