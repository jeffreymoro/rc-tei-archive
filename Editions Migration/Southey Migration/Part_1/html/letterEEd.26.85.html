            <p>Such are the melancholy effusions of a pensive evening hour. I had spent the afternoon
               with a much esteemd friend — &amp; our future stations in life became the topic of discourse—they
               drew on the remembrance of present calamity, the miseries of dependance, the bad state
               of society, &amp; the futility of Rectitude to insure happiness. You will not wonder if
               all this calld up an unpleasant train of ideas to my mind. I see that the nice susceptibility
               of Rectitude &amp; firm perseverance of Integrity, rather prevent enjoyment, than procure
               it. &amp; I feel that Vice &amp; Folly will carry a man thro this world more agreably, whilst
               the one arms his head &amp; the other his heart against those arrows that rankle most
               keenly in the sensible breast. surely the love of life must be very strong or the
               dread of Death very tremendous—for if there be not another world what wretch would
               remain in this? &amp; if there be who but would venture for a happier life in it? tis
               growing late &amp; the less is said on this subject the better. good night.</p>
