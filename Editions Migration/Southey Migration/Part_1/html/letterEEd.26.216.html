            </header>
            <p>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Joseph Cottle, <em>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</em> (London, 1847).<br>Previously published: Joseph Cottle, <em>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</em> (London, 1847), pp. 212–213 [in part, with omissions at beginning of the letter indicated].
               In editing the text for publication, Cottle pieced together extracts from at least
               two letters. The contents of the first paragraph suggest it was written [c. 8 May
               1797]. The second paragraph is taken from the letter sent by Southey to Joseph Cottle,
               2 May [1797] (Letter 214). The third paragraph may be from the letter of [c. 8 May
               1797] or from some other letter from the same period of which there is no other trace.<br>Dating note: The dating of this letter is from internal evidence, in particular the
               mention of Southey’s meeting with Dr Gregory (1754–1808; <em>DNB</em>), which took place on 7 May 1797 (Letter 215).</p>
