                  </div> do you recollect about six months back an advertisement stating that Joseph Stinton
                  had forcibly taken Mary Severne from her governess &amp; cautioning the clergy from marrying
                  them. the story is this. they eloped together from her fathers at Bromyard whose bailiff
                  he was. were married at Gretna Green in the presence of three witnesses &amp; returned.
                  the father would admit of no reconciliation unless they seperated. to this it was
                  impossible to consent. he appointed thief takers to sieze them in bed &amp; conveyed her
                  away whilst the husband was sent to Sewards brother in law the Uncle. the only intelligence
                  the &lt;father&gt; would give was that he had placed her in a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">conve</span> family abroad. to this story he adhered. Stinton still thought she was in London he
                  went &amp; carried music about the town in hopes of discovering — frequently telling his
                  story &amp; encouraged by every body. at last he gave up the search — his friends persuaded
                  him to stay one day more &amp; whilst he sat at dinner he glimpsed his wife in the street.
                  he ran out with his pocket full of silver giving to one &amp; another to follow &amp; watch
                  that Lady — he followed them on — the wife looked back &amp; he hid his face with his
                  hands. at length he housed them &amp; went to a coach makers opposite — is that house
                  to be let? I want one in this part of the town but should not chuse it unless it had
                  a back door. there is no back door to that the man replied — &amp; Stinton was satisfied.
                  he now kept a coach &amp; four at the end of the street &amp; waited for his wife <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> a coach was taken by the duenna to carry them to Greenwich &amp; thence abroad — so critical
