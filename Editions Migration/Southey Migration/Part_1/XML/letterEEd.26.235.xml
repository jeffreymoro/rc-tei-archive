        <p rend="indent1">	Your two letters, or rather letter &amp; a half give me enough to answer, enough to think upon, &amp; enough to be sorry for. for translating &#8212; I will let no opportunity slip of assisting you; that an opportunity may offer is possible, tho not to be expected as among probabilities, &amp; moreover if you had finished one job you assuredly would never undertake another. Who <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> but a hack horse would run a race with a London printer? needs must go when the Devil drives, dispatch is the condition, &amp; it requires the whole days labour. I should certainly be very glad to get such a months employment as Neckers<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey translated the second volume of <title level="m">On the French Revolution. By M. Necker</title> (1797).</note> nonsense proved every year, but I certainly would not undertake two of them; it is an employment from which neither pleasure or credit can be derived, nothing but mere money. If I ever get another book to translate, you shall have half as a sample; they are windfalls to me, I cannot ask for them, but will gladly accept for you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	Pro lege<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Latin translates as &#8216;For the law&#8217;.</note> &#8212; here I would gladly &amp; instantly close with your first hint, were I not so bridled &amp; curbed as to have no will of my own that way. <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> does what he likes with me, &amp; I am sure expects me to do great things, but he is much mistaken, I want only independance &#8212; I wish no more than I have at present &amp; when I have as much independantly, I will not waste a single moment longer upon a study where I find neither pleasure nor improvement. God Almighty never made me for a Lord Chief Justice &#8212; I have not enough of the Chuckle Head about me. Sir John Comyns<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Comyns (1667&#8211;1740; <title level="m">DNB</title>), judge and legal writer.</note>  was the man.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	You talk of being tantalized with scenes of matrimonial happiness. now <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> tho I replied not to this when you mentioned it in conversation, I heard it &amp; remembered it &amp; reflected upon it with considerable pain. you alledged it as a reason for not coming down. that such feelings will arise I have very often experienced but have always repressed them. Go <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> &amp; study Epictetus<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Stoic philosopher, Epictetus (c. AD 60&#8211;after 100), author of the <title level="m">Encheiridion</title>.</note> &#8212; he will teach you wisdom. &#8212; you are the slave of feelings diseasedly irritable &#8212; <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> unless you get the better of them they will <del rend="strikethrough">you</del> make you miserable &#8212; &amp; you will deserve to be so.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	Last year <ref cRef="people.html#DanversCharles">Charles Danvers</ref> was visiting his dearest friend at harvest time. this friend was David Jardine, <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">David Jardine (1766&#8211;1797), Minister at the Trim Street Unitarian Chapel, Bath, who died on 10 March 1797.</note> a man whose equal I have rarely known, married to an admirable woman, &amp; blest with three children the eldest<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">David Jardine (1794&#8211;1860; <title level="m">DNB</title>), who became a magistrate and legal historian.</note> not three years old &#8212; the loveliest most animated boy you ever saw. You perhaps know not what a harvest home is, or you would connect with it every idea of <del rend="strikethrough">ple</del> interesting toil &amp; merriment. Three months since David Jardine dropt in his own fields &amp; died instantly. this is the heaviest affliction <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> has ever endured, &amp; yet his whole life has been but a <del rend="strikethrough">series</del> &lt;series&gt; of disappointments. But I am now showing you his conduct. he means to go to the first harvest home, that he may subdue the feelings that agonize him whenever he sees a field of corn or a reaper.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	My good French Captain goes by the first cartel. this you will be glad of &#8212; God bless him wherever he goes. I have a letter from him this morning &#8212; he &amp; I are now mutually obliged to each other &amp; I have an acquaintance in Nantes or Brest if I should ever want one.</p>
