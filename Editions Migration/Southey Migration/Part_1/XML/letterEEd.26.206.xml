        <p rend="indent1"> I found your letter last night on my return from Vanbrughs Field,
                    where I had dined with Miles.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A friend of
                        the Bedfords, he lived at Vanbrugh Fields, Greenwich. His first name is not
                        recorded.</note> I like him much. there is a kindliness in his manners which
                    I must not libel by calling politeness; his countenance displays an evident wish
                    to please, &amp; any physiognomist would give it unlimited credit for
                    sincerity. Jolly<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> was
                    there &#8212; I know not whether you have seen him &#8212; a young man of good natured
                    imbecillity, with very white hair very whitely powdered, so that I know not
                    whether Nature or the Barber had most to do in giving him the character of
                    weakness. we staid till eight &#8212; the Bedfords<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor
                            Charles Bedford</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace Walpole Bedford</ref>.</note> were with me, &amp; a hackney
                    coach which we fortunately found at Deptford saved us a long &amp;
                    unpleasant walk.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> And now <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> I wish you
                    were at Portsmouth. I am in lodgings &#8212; comfortably settled, tho not likely long
                    to remain in these apartments, as they are too small for a man with a tolerable
                    collection of books. however now I have a home &#8212; &amp; the sooner you can
                    come, &amp; the longer you can stay &#8212; the better. I am entered at Grays Inn
                    &amp; <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> studying hard at Law. I do not find
                    the study unpleasant. in little more than two years I shall be able to do
                    business as a special pleader &#8212; I have friends able &amp; willing to push me
                    forwards &#8212; &amp; doubt not of success.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> this if things remain as they are. if they take a better turn &#8212; I
                    am only what I have been &#8212; an adventurer with a better chance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am not sufficiently acquainted with the subject of finance to
                    hazard &#8212; or indeed to form any opinion. certain however it is that the funding
                    system cannot endure for ever, whether this blow be the death-blow cannot be
                    asserted upon the same grounds. at any rate it must have one good effect, that
                    of putting an end to the war, for how can money possibly be raised for its
                    continuance? Lord Jervis&#8217;s victory<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John
                        Jervis, Earl St Vincent (1735&#8211;1823; <title level="m">DNB</title>), had
                        defeated the Spanish fleet at the battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February
                        1797.</note> happened very unfortunately, to cast a lustre upon an
                    unfortunate unjust &amp; now unpopular war. any successes that keep up the
                    spirit of the mob are sincerely to be deprecated. it is only loss after loss
                    that can awaken this infatuated people to a sense of their situation &#8212; perhaps
                    it is now too late.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You seem indeed to have made a very Quixote-like expedition. but
                    of all expeditions the French invasion in Wales<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Some 1400 French troops, under the command of the American
                        Colonel William Tate (dates unknown), landed near Fishguard on the night of
                        22&#8211;23 February 1797. They surrendered a few days later.</note> was the most
                    curious. it is now pretty well understood. fourteen hundred galley-slaves were
                    taken from Brest, put on board ship &#8212; &amp; landed in Wales. this answered a
                    double purpose. it transported fourteen hundred rogues from France &#8212; &amp;
                    it alarmed England &#8212; so much so indeed as to occasion the immediate run on the
                    Bank, which made it stop payment.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> the Bank of England notes in circulation amount to 13 millions.
                    their property to 17. so far well. but of that 17 millions 11 are due from
                    government &#8212; &amp; are in fact <del rend="strikehtrough">more</del> worth
                    nothing more than their annual interest. but where is cash to answer these
                    notes? because they had not cash to answer the notes already in circulation,
                    they issued these pound notes. this is remedying the evil for the present, but
                    certainly increasing it in the end. the quantity of species in the kingdom
                    amounts but to 20 millions. &amp; this has in all probability been of late

                    unusual thing in dining with Miles [MS torn] yesterday &#8212; but some civility on my
                    part was due to him. he talks of quitting Greenwich, &amp; going to reside
                    in the country at least an hundred miles from the metropolis. I shall be sorry
                    if he goes &#8212; tho I shall think him right in going. a man must be made of very
                    strange materials who would remain one hour longer in this accursed city than he
                    can possibly avoid. I hate it &amp; always hated it, with all my heart
