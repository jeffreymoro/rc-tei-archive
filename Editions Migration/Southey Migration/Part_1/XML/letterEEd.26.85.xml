        <p>Such are the melancholy effusions of a pensive evening hour. I had spent the
                    afternoon with a much esteemd friend &#8212; &amp; our future stations in life
                    became the topic of discourse&#8212;they drew on the remembrance of present calamity,
                    the miseries of dependance, the bad state of society, &amp; the futility of
                    Rectitude to insure happiness. You will not wonder if all this calld up an
                    unpleasant train of ideas to my mind. I see that the nice susceptibility of
                    Rectitude &amp; firm perseverance of Integrity, rather prevent enjoyment,
                    than procure it. &amp; I feel that Vice &amp; Folly will carry a man
                    thro this world more agreably, whilst the one arms his head &amp; the other
                    his heart against those arrows that rankle most keenly in the sensible breast.
                    surely the love of life must be very strong or the dread of Death very
                    tremendous&#8212;for if there be not another world what wretch would remain in this?
                    &amp; if there be who but would venture for a happier life in it? tis

        <p>The parting knell was instituted in the darker ages of superstition, from the
                    idea that the sound terrified the Devil from his prey.</p>

          <l rend="indent3"> The wizard priest enjoind the parting knell</l>

        <p rend="indent1"> You see I am commenced Sonnetteer. The Knell extends sixteen
                    lines in fact the subject is not that of a sonnet. but as I look on this species
                    of poetry as much resembling the Greek Epigrams which are of indefinite length.
                    I see no impropriety either in compressing an idea in less than fourteen lines
                    for simplicity or in lengthening it for perspicuity. Your Warton I much like.
                    tis a good subject well handled.<note n="26" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly a reference to a poem by Robert Lovell that has not
                        survived.</note>
