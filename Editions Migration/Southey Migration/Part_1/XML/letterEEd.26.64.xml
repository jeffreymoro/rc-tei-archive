                    since my return so you see Bristol does not make me idle. I may not form a taste
                    here but I can increase a stock of useful knowledge and you know the prettiest
                    nosegays are formed of various flowers. Oxford would have been very dull this

                    shall meet again in January &amp; college will have something like novelty
                    to recommend it. with my friends at Christ Church I could not have lived always
                    &#8212; they are but very few &amp; have numerous acquaintance so this term must
                    have past mostly in solitude. at Bristol I can be as well employed, at least in
                    my own opinion &amp; you know, to me, that is the most material. </p>
