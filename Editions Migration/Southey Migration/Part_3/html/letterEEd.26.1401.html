                  </div> &amp; you will express to him any thankful acceptance of his offer in the best terms you
                  can find. You have contrived to mingle something unpleasant with this by requesting
                  me to change the name intended: I have told <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</a> that should the child be a boy Danvers is to be his name, – &amp; assuredly Danvers his
                  name must be.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For this letter, see Southey to Charles Danvers, 28 July 1807, Letter 1347.</span></div>
                  </div> I have as great a respect for Sir Edward as is possible to have for any person with
                  whom I am well acquainted only by <span class="strikethrough">hearsay</span> report, &amp; have seen so seldom. But were I to name a child of mine after him, the immediate
                  question would be is he a particular friend of yours, – &amp; to this what reply could
                  be made? – It would be paying him a very mean compliment thus to set aside one of
                  my oldest &amp; dearest friends, a man whom I most entirely love, honour – &amp; esteem, &amp;
                  whose name, I verily believe, if there be anything good in the boy who bear it, will
                  operate as an incitement in him to every virtue. If I judge rightly of Sir Edward
                  Littleton he would think within himself ‘what am I to Southey that he should show
                  me this preference?’ – &amp; judge me to be one of a suppler spirit than it has pleased
                  God to make me. – When you have reflected a little upon this, you will feel that I
                  am right, – &amp; as for the <span class="ital">never-forgiving</span> of which you talk, it is I, Senhora, who have to forgive you the imprudence with which
                  you have subjected me to this risque of displeasing Sir Edward, &amp; appearing insensible
                  of the honour he has done me. Out of this you must bring me as you best can. I have
                  a sort of feeling about naming my children after my friends just as the Catholics
                  have for calling them after their favourite saints. Should I have a third son his
                  name would be <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Seward</a>, &amp; a fourth would have a good chance of being called <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a>. – On looking back one thing requires explanation – you may perhaps take it in your
                  head (are you liable Senhora to that female complaint which Doctors call the <span class="ital">pet</span>? – I think not.) – you may I say possibly think that if I will not call the boy Edward
                  Littleton, I may as well let <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</a> be his sponsor; – the fact is that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</a> is one of those dissenters who reject this ceremony altogether, &amp; look upon godfathership
                  as a relic of Popish superstition. I have a different feeling upon the subject, &amp;
                  think the more ties there are of good will to bind man &amp; man together, the better.</p>

               <p>If this unborn does not appear some time in January it will be very extraordinary,
                  – for as nature is as punctual as I am in all her operations he may certainly be expected
                  about that time. You may therefore look for me in less than six weeks. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> will accompany me as far as our roads lie together, which will probably be just to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</a> – then he strikes for Bristol &amp; I for Litchfield

I know no man who ever made a better
                  use of affluence, &amp; there is none who will bear up against adversity more like a man.
                  Whether my Uncles ‘great friends’ will do any thing for him remains to be seen. I
                  generally suspect that a mans great friends are so called on the old law of contrarieties,
                  because they are very little his friends. – As for the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Doctor</a> he gets into a scrape wherever he goes, – &amp; certain it is that the most prudent thing
                  he can do is to marry as soon as he can, – tho in any body else so circumscribed it
                  would be a great imprudence. But he never can get into practice till he has a wife
                  to make fathers &amp; mothers easy. Mary Sealy (do you remember her?) is the present object.

                  in life. – I think sometime of the cr[MS obscured] that fall from the rich man’s table
