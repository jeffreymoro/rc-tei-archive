                  in many places be enriched, &amp; the story perhaps sometimes be rendered more perspicuous.

                  There ought to be four flying squadrons of 5000 men each, ready to land wherever they
                  were wanted, – under Cochrane they would keep five times their number of French in

                  opinions pass current here in England &amp; the consequence is that never were a people
                  so cruelly &amp; basely calumniated, as this nation, which has done more against the force
                  of France, under every possible disadvantage than all the rest of Europe conjointly.
                  What a different story Sir Robert Wilson would tell who has kept the field with his
