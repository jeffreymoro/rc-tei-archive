                           Southey later recorded that pupils used to ‘stick his wig full of paper darts’. Hayes
                           was also a writer of poems and sermons, and co-author of a tragedy, Eugenia (1766).

                  of being no ones enemy but his own, is not admitted as a set-off on earth; but in

                  [MS torn] merely ornamental parts also are aided by it – as foil sets off paste. But
                  where there is either passion or power, the plainer &amp; more straight forward the language
                  can be made the better. Now you will suppose that upon this system I am writing Kehama.
                  My proceedings are not quite so systematical – but what with revising &amp; rerevising
                  over &amp; over again they will amount to something like it at last.</p>
