               <p>I should have noticed your letter sooner had I not been in a state of much uneasiness

                  there the matter rests.

                           1804, made an unsuccessful attempt to cut out the French privateer General Ernouf
                           (formerly the British sloop of war Lilly) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of
                           the 90 men sent on the mission, 65 were killed or wounded, and Southey suspected that
                           his brother was among the dead. The first lieutenant had been reported as dead, but
                           Thomas was absent from the raid because he had been placed under arrest. Charles Hayman

                           Southey saw him eat some Pine apple after Dinner in our garden dining-room, &amp; was
                           much amused – as well as with the other gentlemanly habitudes of Peter – so different
                           from common pigs, that I hoped to have preserved him during many years – But, after
                           an absence of some days – one of the first things I saw, in an inspection of my Father’s
                           House, was a Tub full of very very fat, fine, newly salted Bacon. Alas! it was, Peter!!!
                           My…</span></div>
                  </div> &amp; I have a dismal story to give you in return my Ass John – is a John Ass, &amp; he has
                  taken it in his head at present as Adam had before him in Paradise that it is not
                  good for him to be alone. So that being most heroically in love with some unknown
                  she Ass, like a Prince in the Persian Tales, – he set off today in search of her.
                  Now it fell out that when John was engaged in this search there came over the bridge
                  a man riding upon an Ass. John beheld him, gallopped after him in the middle of the
                  town, attacked the rider for the love of the Ass, &amp; fairly knocked him off into the
                  dirt.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">What is to be done in this case? had John been a Catholic Ass he might have been initiated
               in one of the monastic orders, like many of his bretheren, &amp; been saved by his vows.
               Or had he been an Italian, been taught to bray in treble – but being an English &amp;
               a Protestant Ass – what can I do for him?</p>
