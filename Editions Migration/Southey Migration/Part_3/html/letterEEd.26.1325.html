                  died after the race! – Among his letters there is a great deal of Methodism – if this
                  procures for the book, as it very likely may, a sale among the righteous over-much,
                  I shall rejoice for the sake of his family – for whom I am very much interested. I
                  have, however, in justice to myself, stated, in the shortest &amp; most decorous manner,
                  that my own views of religion differ widely from his.
