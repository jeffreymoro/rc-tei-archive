            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>After leaving you this day fortnight I went thro the form of a supper at Salisbury,
                  &amp; past that sort of unquiet night which a man never fails to have at an inn, when
                  he is to rise at five the next morning. Saturdays journey, except the first chilling
                  stage to Hinton, was pleasant enough, &amp; took me thro a part of Somersetshire which
                  was new to me. About half past eight I reached <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">M<sup>r</sup> Southeys</a> &amp; was received with as much cordiality as it is in his nature to show. My <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</a> advised me not to ask him in plain terms to assist <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a>, but rather to let Harry make the application himself, – for she thought he was hurt
                  that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> should address his letters to her instead of to him, &amp; that he liked to be made of
                  consequence. I yielded to this, &amp; contented myself with preparing the way for his
                  application by talking of his fair prospects, his present difficulties, &amp; the little
                  doubt there could be of his final success if those difficulties could be surmounted.
                  The weather played me a sad trick during this visit. My intention was to have paid
                  my Taunton visits on the Monday (his dinner hour rendering this impossible on the
                  Sunday) on Tuesday to have got over to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Stowey">Stowey</a> to see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PooleThomas">Poole</a>, return the next day, &amp; start for Bristol on Thursday, – but the rain set in with
                  such unabating violence that I was confined to the house from Monday morning till
                  Thursday, without any possibility of stirring out. Mine is a very accommodating disposition
                  in most cases. I read a pocket companion of excellent length &amp; dullness, expressly
                  provided for such occasions, &amp; better as a practical teacher of patience than the
                  best commentary on the book of Job: – I talked with him of old Bristol elections &amp;
                  old family affairs, subjects on which his knowledge was far greater than mine, &amp; in
                  which the interest I felt was equal to his own, – I told him stories &amp; heard from
                  him others in return <span class="strikethrough">which</span> some of which my friend Espriella will turn to good account,

                  </div> I drank his strong beer, got to bed early, &amp; in short got thro the time with some
                  satisfaction to him, &amp; as little dissatisfaction as could be to myself. It is plain
                  that he was well pleased, for he gave me 25 £, – for him a considerable gift to make,
                  &amp; by no means an unwelcome one for me to receive.</p>

                  for in spite of all dissuasion he would not stay behind me.

               <p>Three tea chests of books which had for the sake of security &amp; dispatch been sent

                  hours) are put in order, &amp; I am resuming my habitual occupations. I shall not be quite
                  easy till some tidings arrive of the 22 cases on shipboard, – they will occasion a
                  glorious confusion in the house, &amp; some contrivance to find room for them.
