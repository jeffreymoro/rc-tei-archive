               <div class="salute">Sir</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Yesterday I received your note inclosing the specimen of your poem. I have perused
               that specimen, but my advice cannot be comprized in a few words.</p>
            <p class="indent1">A Literary as well as a medical opinion Mr Elliott must needs be blindly given unless
               the age, &amp;c of the person who requires it is known. When I advised <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry White</a> to publish a second volume of poems, it was because he had fixed his heart upon a
               university education, &amp; this seemed to be a feasible method of raising funds for that
               end, – his particular circumstances rendering that prudent which would otherwise have
               been very much the reverse. For poetry is not a marketable article, unless there be
               something strange or peculiar to give it a fashion; &amp; in his case what money might
               properly have been raised would in almost every instance, have been considered rather
               as given to the author, than paid for his book. Your poem would not find purchasers,
               except in the circle of your own friends; out of that circle not twenty copies would
               be sold, – &lt;I believe&gt; <span class="strikethrough">probably</span> not half that number.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You are probably a young man Sir, – &amp; it is plain from this specimen that you possess
               more than one of those <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> powers which form the poet, &amp; &lt;those&gt; in a far more than ordinary degree. Whether
               your plans of life are such as to promise leisure for that attention (almost it might
               be said that devotement) without which no man can ever become a great poet, – you
               yourself must know. If they should, you will in a very few years have outgrown the
               poem, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">will</span> &lt;would&gt; then be sorry to see it in print, irrecoverably given to the public, because
               you would feel it to be an inadequate proof of your own talents. If on the other hand
               you consider poetry as merely an amusement or ornament of youth, to be laid aside
               in riper years for the ordinary pursuits of the world, with still less indulgence
               will you then <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> regard the printed volume, for you will reckon it among the follies of which you
               are ashamed. In either case it is best not to publish.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is very far from my wish to discourage or depress you. There is great promise in
                  this specimen, – it has all the faults which I should wish to see in the writings
                  of a young poet, as the surest indications that he has that in him which will enable
                  him to become a good one. But no young man can possibly write a good narrative poem,
                  tho I believe he cannot by any <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> &lt;other means&gt; so effectually improve himself as by making the attempt. I myself published
                  one at the age of six &amp; twenty,

                           ago’ suggests his first published narrative epic Joan of Arc (1796).</span></div>
                  </div> – it made a reputation for me, – not so much by its merits as because it was taken
                  up by one party, &amp; abused by another, almost independently of its merits or demerits,
                  at a time when party spirit was more violent than it is to be hoped it ever will be
                  again. What has been the consequence of this publication? that the poem from beginning
                  &lt;to end&gt; was full of incorrect language, &amp; errors of every kind, that all the weeding
                  of years could never weed it clean, – &amp; that &lt;many&gt; people at this day rate me not
                  according to the standard of my present intellect but by what it was fourteen years
                  ago. – Your subject also has the same disadvantage with mine, – that it is anti-national,
                  &amp; believe me this is a grievous one; for tho <span class="strikethrough">bo</span> we have both been right in our feelings, yet to feel against ones own country can
                  only be right upon great &amp; transitory occasions, – &amp; none but our contemporaries can
                  feel with us; – none but those who remember the struggle <span class="strikethrough">at the time</span> &amp; took their part in it. And you are more unfortunate than I was, – for America was
                  acting at this time unnaturally towards England, &amp; every reader will [MS torn] this,
                  &amp; his sense of what the Americans are now will make him fancy that you paint falsely
                  in describing them as they were then.

                           Yorkshire. Elliott would publish ‘Night, or, The Legend of Wharncliffe’ in 1818.</span></div>

                  or no you are gifted with armour of proof against them. Nor is it the effect that
                  malicious censure &amp; ridicule might produce upon your own feelings which is of &lt;so&gt;
                  much consequence as what <span class="strikethrough">they</span> would be produced upon your friends. They who are so only in name will derive a provoking
                  pleasure from seeing you laughed at &amp; abused; they who love you will feel more pain
                  than you yourself, because you will &amp; must have a higher confidence in yourself, &amp;
                  a stronger conviction of injustice than they can be supposed to possess.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The sum of my advice is, – do not publish this poem, – but if you can without grievous
               imprudence afford to write poetry continue so to do, because hereafter you will write
               it well. As yet you have only green fruit to offer – wait a season &amp; there will be
               a fair &amp; full gathering when it is ripe.</p>
