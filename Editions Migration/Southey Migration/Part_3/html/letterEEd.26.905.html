                  of taking that with me to London where I must travel in the course of the spring to
                  finish another book concerning which I cannot remember whether or not I have written

                  the publishers – so much for the reward of intellectual labour! It must however be
                  remembered that <span class="strikethrough">both</span> in literature as well as in trade a mans <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> name is good for nothing unless it be known that he has some capital. – I must draw
                  nearer London that is certain, for I can always there have as much silent money-getting
                  work as my necessities require, without those inconvenient delays, &amp; heavy expence
                  of carriage which make weighty objections to this situation, even if this suited me
                  better. As far as I can see before me my wisest plan will be to gallop on with history
                  as fast as possible &amp; then cross the seas. by the time of my return the profits of
                  these running works will surely be enough to furnish a house, &amp; then I will settle
                  within a mornings ride of town. My regular work is first &amp; foremost before all others
                  to write these pages of history – such pages as when printed will extend honestly
                  to five in quarto. a year at this rate will well nigh finish my materials.
