            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You will, I trust, excuse me for troubling you with a letter upon my own concerns,
                  because it may possibly be in your power to render me an essential service. Some little
                  time since I was informed by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</a> that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">Mr. Canning</a> had expressed a wish to serve me, and the result of some conversation which they held
                  upon the subject was that Scott should inquire of me in what manner it might most
                  conveniently be done. A few years ago I would gladly have gone to Portugal; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my uncle</a> has now left that country. One main inducement is thus removed, and if it were necessary
                  to enter into detail, it might be shown that I should act imprudently, in the worldly
                  sense of the word, by accepting anything that would be given me there. The immediate
                  emoluments would not support me, and for the prospects which might be held out hereafter,
                  I am neither young enough to enter upon, nor ambitious enough to desire them. To speak
                  more truly, my ambition is fixed upon better things. There is, however, a situation
                  which it would perfectly suit me to hold: it is the stewardship for the Derwentwater
                  estates, now held by a Mr. Walton,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Nicholas Walton (d. 1809).</span></div>
                  </div> and expected soon to be vacated by his death, as I am informed by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpRichard">Mr. Sharp</a>, who indeed advised me to apply for it. Accordingly I mentioned it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a>; his answer is that the thing seems feasible, but that it would be of great consequence
                  to obtain <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale’s</a> countenance, as his recommendation will probably command that and everything else
                  which falls in this country. These being the circumstances, may I ask you to apply
                  to Lord Lonsdale in my behalf? The situation is desirable, because it would suit my
                  place of abode, and give me the power of preserving the woods. My circumstances also
                  are such that I must not refuse any fair opportunity of improving them; and this opportunity
                  have been offered, I trust you will excuse me for taking the only means in my power.
