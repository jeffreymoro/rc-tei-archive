                  </div> On the latter work I laboured just eight days, from morning till night; unluckily
                  it was thought expedient to hurry it through two presses at once, with all possible
                  expedition; time, therefore, was not allowed for the proof sheets to travel here,
                  and I anticipate many vexatious blunders of the printer, which will stare me in the
                  face on cutting the leaves. The booksellers would have republished this book three
                  years ago if I had wished it. People asked me about it; the subject excited curiosity
                  just at this time. To destroy the 1250 copies which were abroad was impossible, for
                  alas! <span class="ital">Nescit vox missa reverti</span>;

                  </div> the best way therefore, which could be done was to reprint it in such a form that

                  easily to lay hand on, I have made the book more respectable than it was.</p>

                           whereby the French army commanded by Jean-Andoche Junot (1771–1813) and defeated by
                           Anglo-Portuguese forces under Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the 1st Duke of Wellington)
                           (1769–1852; DNB) at Vimeiro on 21 August, was allowed to retreat intact, with its
                           weapons, from Portugal. Wellesley, who did not sign the Convention, had been superseded
                           in command by two veteran generals, just arrived in Iberia, who were content to make
                           peace: Sir Harry Burrard (1755–1813; DNB) and Sir Hew Dalrymple (1750–1830;DNB). Public

                  </div> no public event ever distressed me so deeply. I could not sleep the whole night after
                  the news reached me; the whole business indicates such a total want of all honourable
                  and generous feeling on the part of our commander that it sickens me to think of it.
                  Thank God, the nation has redeemed itself, as far as words can redeem it. What the
                  Government will do remains to be seen; what they ought to have done they have not
                  done. Had I been minister I would have followed the Roman example in such cases –
                  annulled the treaty, and delivered up the generals who signed it to the French, with
                  ropes round their necks. It is nonsense to say that we were bound by the treaty, as
                  if any claims which the French could derive from the act and deed of a fool or a coward
                  could be paramount to those of such allies as the Spaniards, and such a cause as they
                  are engaged in. Surely we have men in England who would have humbled the French when
                  they had beaten them, and made Junot sign his capitulation in his own infamous name;
                  not by a title which is not, and cannot be his, if we have any grounds for going against
                  him.</p>

                  one’s own planting beginning to bear, however slender the first crop. The most apparent
                  alteration will be in the manner of printing. It went through the press while I was
                  last in Portugal, and I never saw a proof sheet of it. There is an unpleasant effect
                  by the manner of placing the notes; for many pages have only a line of text, and so
                  the eye runs faster than the fingers can turn them over. I shall now place the notes
