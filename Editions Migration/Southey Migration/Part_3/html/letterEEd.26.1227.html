            <p class="indent1">You will be glad to hear that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is safe in bed, &amp; also that she has a boy this time, a stout fellow with as loud
               a voice as he is entitled to on his fathers side. We shall call him <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a>. Yesterday a little after six in the morning he arrived, making good speed, as is
               the family custom.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</a> have been very cordially received – &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">their Uncle</a> <span class="strikethrough">has</span> very <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> handsomely <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> was going shopping furnished him with forty pounds. This is well; – but I think <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> will wish he had not taken your advice &amp; posted them in such haste. If he has to
               wait some time for a new appointment Taunton is a dull place, &amp; he already complains
               of finding it so. A few days on the way to Plymouth, or on a few weeks leave of absence
               from thence would have been enough.</p>
            <p class="indent1">He tells me that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> is turned strolling player. Years &amp; years ago I said it was what he would come to
               – tho lately indeed I had no such hope of him. It is the last thing he could do after
               having so irretrievably disgraced himself, &amp; the act of changing his name indicates
               more decency than I thought he possessed.</p>
