                  which would afflict her &amp; endanger her weak health. But the mother is of an affectionate

                  inequalities of birth, &amp; being herself unhappily married may probably set a higher
                  value upon the chances of happiness, than people in high rank are apt to admit into

                  &amp; honestly says he never will give her anything, but that that is of little consequence
                  – for he never should have done more – <span class="strikethrough">xxx then</span> than just to &lt;have&gt; rendered things pleasanter at first. When of age she has fifteen

               part. I wish it had not happened, but having happened would, as far as can be, render
               my own plans subservient to their well-doing; &amp; if they should marry, when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> sets up to practise, I shall not be unwilling to reside for some years wherever he

               this is, nor should I have communicated any speculations upon, or account of, an affair
               which may very likely end in nothing, but for a sense of something like duty, – at
