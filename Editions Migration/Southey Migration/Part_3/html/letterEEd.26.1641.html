            <p class="indent1">More than once have I been on the point of writing to you, and as often prevented
               by some disquieting or distressing circumstance. Within this week I have deposited
               in yonder churchyard, the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEmma">little girl</a> who was newly born when you saw me. I had not ceased to thank God for the preservation
               of my <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">only boy</a>, who had been saved from the croup, when this visitation befell us, and I do not
               cease to thank Him now. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> has happily an <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyBertha">infant</a> at the breast, a better comforter than I could be; still it will be long before she
               recovers from the stroke, which was as unexpected as it was severe.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I go on Thursday next to Durham, to visit <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</a>, who is just married.

                  </div> My absence from home will not exceed a fortnight. The sooner you arrive after my return
                  the better, for the delight of the country is in the long evenings at Midsummer, and
                  I shall be sorry if you miss them. The straight road from London is to Penrith, one
                  stage short of Carlisle, and eighteen miles from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>. From thence there is a stage which runs through this place Mondays, Wednesdays,
                  and Fridays. But if you reach Penrith early enough to come by chaise it is less wearisome
                  to proceed to a house where you will feel yourself at home than to pass a night at
                  an inn, for this stage leaves Penrith in the morning. If you come by way of Leeds
                  or Manchester there is no stage nearer than Kendal, which is thirty miles from hence.
                  It is a long journey, but if you start from London the least fatiguing plan is to
                  take the mail; remember, <span class="ital">not</span> that which goes by Manchester to Carlisle, for that takes in the unwary passengers
                  for some thirty additional miles, and for a spell of two hours in the dead of the
                  night at a Manchester inn, waiting to be turned over to another coach; but the Carlisle
                  mail, which goes by Newark and Doncaster. I enter into these particulars because some
                  of my friends have been deceived by book-keepers and sent the more circuitous route.

                  have thrown us far asunder, the more so perhaps because ever since we ceased to associate,
                  we must have grown more unlike each other. I used to shoot with him, fish with him,
                  and lay snares for rabbits. These things I could not do now. Were I, however, to meet
                  Dolignon (and I would turn fifty miles from my way for the sake of meeting him) my
                  first feeling would be like that of a brother – we should both shed tears at thinking
                  of his dear mother and of his sister, and when that sympathy was over I should begin
                  to feel a weight at my heart from perceiving how little other sympathy was left us.
                  I know what the feeling is by experience, and there are few feelings more painful.</p>
