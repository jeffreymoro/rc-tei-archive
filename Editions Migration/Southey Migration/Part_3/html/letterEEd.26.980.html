                  </div> three weeks will bring me to the notes. of the preface so much is written as relates
                  to the execution of the poem – I have related how slowly it was written, &amp; at what
                  distant intervals corrected or continued, for the purpose of thereby accounting for
                  its main defects. Send me – if you can – the legend round Iorwerths shield – or it
                  will be too late to have it cut – indeed as it is, I fear the printing must stop for
                  it. – Tell me too whether M.P. simply <span class="strikethrough">be to</span> should be affixed to your name, or any larger formula as Kt of the Shire &amp;c – for
                  I am inconveniently ignorant of these things. I have beblotted more paper than you
                  could imagine in endeavouring to shape what I would say in fitting terms, &amp; can find
                  nothing better than thus – To CWWW &amp;c this poem which he will peruse with a family
                  as well as a national interest is &amp;c – inscribed by his friend &amp; school fellow ––.
                  &amp; this is not well. family is completely colloquialized into an adjective – but to
                  say schoolfellow nakedly thus appears inaccurate. the word indeed may be spared perhaps
                  – as it occurs in the preface – And now I think of it it may be well to send you what
                  I design to say of the poem in general. All that is there said is very true – but
                  as what is true may not always be prudent if you advise me to suppress it – so be
                  it – Yet I am myself inclined to let it pass. Return it to me for there is no other
                  copy. An historical introduction to the poem is to precede it, as brief as it may
                  be, &amp; I think of <span class="strikethrough">addin</span> partnering it with an acknowledgement of the specific faults of the poem – if it be
                  tried by epic laws, to which I shall protest it is not amenable. One dreams much about
                  prefaces before they come to be written, &amp; then the shortest always seems the best.
                  At times I have dreamt of reviewing my own previous poems in this, but it is quite
                  unnecessary – &amp; therefore quite improper. &amp; even if it were not so I have had no time
                  for any supererogation of labour.</p>
