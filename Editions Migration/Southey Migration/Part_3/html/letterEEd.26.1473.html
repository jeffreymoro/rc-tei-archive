               <p>Your letter from Oxford gave me great pleasure. I had been anxiously expecting to

                  arise out of partial and transitory evil, is your faith as well as mine; and it is
                  by no means impossible that, in your own particular case, you may ultimately be the
                  richer for your hopes. There is no country in the world which is at this time so likely
                  to be prosperous as Brazil. It is out of the reach of France as long as England can
                  keep the seas; it has no pestilence to keep down its progress like North America,
                  and is in less danger of intestine commotions than the United States. I have no great
                  respect for the Braganzas, the first of the family was a villain, and, with the single
                  exception of Joam IV.,

                  believe, a conscientious desire to do the best he can. A more liberal system of policy
                  was gaining ground, and circumstances must now necessarily assist it. There will be
                  a great and increasing harvest for English enterprise. I hope you will have your full

               <p>Since the stirring day of the French Revolution I have never felt half so much excitement
                  in political events as the present state of Spain has given me. I had often said,
                  that if Europe was to be delivered in our days, in no country was its deliverance
                  so likely to begin as in Spain; and this opinion, if my recollections do not play
                  me false, you will find expressed in the reviewal of Semple’s ‘Travels’,

                  nothing could be done under such a Government, and now that obstacle is removed. The
                  dynasty is <span class="ital">felo-de-se</span>, and if the Spaniards would bury the crown and sceptre which they have left at four
                  cross roads, little as I like to move from home, I think I would gird up my loins
                  and go to assist at the ceremony as devoutly as ever pilgrim put cockle-shell in his
                  hat, and set off for Compostella. Spain is without a government; there never was a
                  country whose situation so plainly pointed out what Government would suit it best.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>On every account it is desirable that the whole peninsula should be united; on many
                  accounts it is equally desirable that, in their internal governments, the several
                  kingdoms should be kept distinct. A federal republic would accomplish both objects,
                  and would remove the main difficulty which stands in the way of a union with Portugal.

            <p class="indent1">The Spaniards have to deliver their country first. I hope and believe that they will
               deliver it. I never had any hope from the old confederacies of Austria, Russia, &amp;c.
               I never could have any from the old Governments of the continents; their hour is come,
               and we have only to regret that it did not come sooner. Nothing but a spirit of liberty
               and of patriotism can check the power of France. That spirit has arisen, and in a
               country where it cannot easily be checked or overpowered. Biscay, Asturias, and Galicia,
               have a population which contains above 400,000 men between the ages of sixteen and
               fifty, and there is, probably, not a peasant among them who is not a good marksman.
               The remembrance that they have once before recovered their country will assist them
               not a little in recovering it again; if the flame be not speedily put out, it must
               spread; and I heartily pray that the French who have made Lisbon the wretched place
               it is, may soon find their graves there. If once the tide turns against them, we shall
               witness such a vengeance as the world has never exhibited before.</p>

                  a little, and in the intervals of these interruptions, have got on considerably. My

                  is to begin this as soon as your letter is despatched. I am not certain whether or
                  not I told you in my last that I had adopted a system of earlier rising than usual,
                  and thus won a good hour before breakfast, which, being thus created for the purpose,
                  may allowably be given to poetry. In those hours, and those only, I have gone on with
                  my Hindoo poem,

                  is not all: it is my nature to do two things at a time better than one; or rather,
                  it is my belief that time is saved by doing it; because a train of thought may be
                  ready for use, when it would be necessary to wait for them before the other could
                  proceed. I am, therefore, planning another heroic poem, to be begun forthwith, and
                  prosecuted on those mornings when I am not ready with the immediate matter for Kehama.
