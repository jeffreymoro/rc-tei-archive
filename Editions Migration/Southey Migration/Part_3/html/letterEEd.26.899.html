               <p>If I were a single man and a Frenchman, I would go as a missionary to St. Domingo,
                  where a world of good might be done in that way: the climate may be defied by any
                  man in a high state of mental excitement. I know not whether I sent you some curious
                  facts respecting vivaciousness, but I have met with enough to lead to important physiological
                  conclusions, and in particular to explain the sufficiently common fact of sick persons
                  fixing the hour of their death, and living exactly to that time; the simple solution
                  is, that they would else have died <span class="ital">sooner</span>. In proceeding with my History,

                  </div> I continually find something that leads to interesting speculation: it would, perhaps,
                  be better if there were always some one at hand, to whom I could communicate these
                  discoveries, and who should help me to hunt down the game when started; not that I
                  feel any wish for such society, but still it would at times be useful. It is a very
                  odd, but a marked, characteristic of my mind, – the very nose in the face of my intellect,
                  – that it is either utterly idle, or uselessly active, without its tools. I never
                  enter into any regular train of thought unless the pen be in my hand; they then flow
                  as fast as did the water from the rock in Horeb,

                  </div> but without that wand the source is dry. At these times conversation would be useful.
                  However, I am going on well, never better. The old cerebrum was never in higher activity.
                  I find daily more and more reason to wonder at the miserable ignorance of English
                  historians, and to grieve with a sort of despondency, at seeing how much that has
                  been laid up among the stores of knowledge, has been neglected and utterly forgotten.</p>
