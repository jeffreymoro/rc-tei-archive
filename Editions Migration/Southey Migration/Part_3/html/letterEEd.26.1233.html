                  have had had he left me a rich man, wrote verse to his memory which most likely I
                  should never have done as his heir. Some evening when my conscience – both that which

                  one sometimes in the breeches pocket – when these two will let me feel that I can

                  the slow tongue of this soft Keswick-quill) perhaps go on &amp; make a set of family portraits.
                  in truth if I had leisure enough &amp; could call up heart to speak of the dead, this
