               Garnier (1722–1804), the long-standing chaplain to the French factory in Lisbon. A
               less likely possibility is Abbé Jean-Antoine Dubois (1765–1848), a French Catholic
               missionary in India, whose long sojourn in the southern districts brought him into
               contact with the legacy of Portuguese Catholic colonialism there. Dubois’s manuscript
               history of Indian religion was purchased by the East India Company and published in
               English as <em>Description of the Character, Manners and Customs of the People of India, and of their
                  Institutions, Religious and Civil</em> (1816).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
