                  in the best natured way in the world made him fully sensible that he was – but five

                  has wit &amp; readiness, but in taste &amp; learning so mere a child &amp; so utterly feeble in
                  intellect that I was actually astonished. Indeed the whole corps of Edinburgh reviewers
                  appear miserably puny to me who have been accustomed to live with strong men. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</a> came back in the stage with us, to visit the ladies, &amp; supt here, – so you see we
