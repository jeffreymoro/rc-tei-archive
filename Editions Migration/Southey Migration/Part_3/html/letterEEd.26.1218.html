                  I could no more write an epilogue than I could dance a minuet, or caper upon the slack
                  wire. It is utterly out of my power, – nor can the strong wish I feel to do <span class="strikethrough">any thing which</span> so slight a service for you, remove the feeling of inability.</p>
