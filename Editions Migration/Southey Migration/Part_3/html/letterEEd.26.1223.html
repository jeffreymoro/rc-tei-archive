               containing a compleat apparatus but not one line of directions how to use it, &amp; without
               such I might as well think of squaring the Circle. Into one of these the inclosed
               I suppose had slipt – perhaps in place of a letter designed for me –</p>

               <p>Is the way to use it thus – place the paper <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> under the black leaf, &amp; the glass under that? <span class="strikethrough">But what is to be done with</span> &lt;on the black leaf one of the oiled leaves in the book, or rest the hand on the little
