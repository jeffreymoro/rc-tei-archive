            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisles</a> Tortoise reminds me of one which I caught in Algarve &amp; meant to have brought to England,
               but it was forgotten in the hurry of embarkation. He was about the size of two females
               hands. We saw him in the bottom of a little pond or spring, where as soon as alarmed
               he concealed himself so well in the muddy bottom, that tho the pond was very small
               we were half an hour groping him out, with our arms naked to the shoulder. I meant
               to eat him for my supper, being in a land of starvation, – but he had such an odd
               look with him, when he put his head out of his own window &amp; <span class="strikethrough">dragged</span> &lt;trailed&gt; his ridiculous tail along the ground, that I resolved to bring him to England.
               By day he travelled in a brass pan of the muleteers, &amp; every night made efforts really
               surprising for such an animal, regularly getting out of the bason in which he was
               placed, &amp; down from the table. I cannot tell how, &amp; attempting to burrow in the corner
               of the room. I kept him about three months without food – as they are commonly kept
               at Lisbon, in the large water-jar of the house, – the people having a notion that
               they purify the water – a very Irish sort of <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> idea. Perhaps they <span class="strikethrough">live</span> eat the insects which may be there.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Mine was of a small breed. There are large ones in the river which divides Algarve
               from Alentejo on the coast-side, &amp; the people eat them. I confess that the physiognomy
               of my poor fellow did not excite any appetite <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> in me, he was just like a lizard without any beauty of colour, &amp; had a rank smell.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My turtle died at Cork during quarantine as did every one in the ship – so the captain
                  tells me. If turtles are to be made to perform quarantine it is time for the Court
                  of Aldermen to interfere. it savours of a popish scheme for making them keep Lent.
