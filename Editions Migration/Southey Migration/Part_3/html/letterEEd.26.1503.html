               <p>Had I been a single man I should long ere thus have found my way into Spain. I do
                  not perceive any possibility of my going now &amp; for this plain reason; my pension would
                  not support my family during my absence, – &amp; there is no reason to suppose that any
                  salary which might be allowed me would be more than sufficient for my expences abroad.
                  So much the better: for if it were otherwise &amp; the offer were made me, I believe I
                  ought to accept it, &amp; this could not be done without a great sacrifice. Three children
                  &amp; a fourth in prospect are not easily left, &amp; ought not to be left <span class="strikethrough">without</span> unless some important advantage were to be obtained <span class="strikethrough">from</span> &lt;by&gt; leaving them. I am obliged to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a>; – very much obliged to him; – it is likely that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</a>, from his knowledge of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>, would be disposed to listen to him, but that enough could be obtained to render
                  my acceptance of it prudent, or even practicable seems out of the question.
