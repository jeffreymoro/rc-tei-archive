            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have been grievously shocked this evening by the loss of the Abergavenny – of which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworths</a> brother was Captain.

                           went down with his ship on the Shambles rocks off Portland Bill, on 5 February 1805.</span></div>
                  </div> Of course the news came flying up to us from all quarters – it has disordered me from
                  head to foot: – <span class="strikethrough">At</span>In such <span class="strikethrough">occasions</span> &lt;circumstances&gt; I believe we feel as much for others as for ourselves – just as a
                  violent blow occasions the same pain as a wound, &amp; he who broke his shin feels as
                  acutely at the moment as the man whose leg is shot off. – In fact I am writing to
                  you merely because this dreadful shipwreck has left me utterly unable to do anything
                  else. It is the heaviest calamity <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> has ever experienced – &amp; in all probability I shall have to communicate it to him
                  as he will very likely be here before the tidings can reach him. – What renders any
                  near loss of this kind so peculiarly distressing is that the recollection is perpetually
                  freshened when any like <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxxxx</span> &lt;<span class="strikethrough">xx</span> event&gt; occurs – by the mere mention of shipwreck, or the sound of the wind. Of all
                  deaths it is the most dreadful from the circumstances of terror which accompany it.</p>

                  Fifteen years ago the more melancholy a tale was the better it pleased me – just as

         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11.. </span><span class="noteBody">Richard Hooker (1554–1600; <em>DNB</em>), wrote <em>Of the Lawes of Ecclesiastical Politie</em> (1593–1662), in which he argued that ‘The laws which have been hitherto mentioned,
               i.e. the laws of nature, do bind men absolutely, even as they are men, although they
               have never any settled fellowship, never any solemn agreement amongst themselves what
               to do, or not to do: but forasmuch as we are not by ourselves sufficient to furnish
               ourselves with competent store of things, needful for such a life as our nature doth
               desire, a life fit for the dignity of man; therefore to supply those defects and imperfections
               which are in us, as living single and solely by ourselves, we are naturally induced
               to seek communion and fellowship with others: this was the cause of men’s uniting
               themselves at first in politic societies. But I moreover affirm, that all men are
               naturally in that state, and remain so, till by their own consents they make themselves
               members of some politic society’ (Book I, section 10).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
