                  civility, whatever pert ones (a truer epithet than severe would be) to the habit which
                  he has acquired of taking it for granted that the Critic is, by virtue of his office,
                  superior to <span class="strikethrough">the</span> &lt;every&gt; writer <span class="strikethrough">who comes</span> &lt;whom he chuses to summon&gt; before him. The reviewals of Thalaba &amp; Madoc do in no degree

                  </div> Setting all personal feelings aside, the objections which weigh with me <span class="strikethrough">to</span> &lt;against&gt; bearing any part in this Journal are these. I have scarcely one opinion
                  in common with it upon any subject. Jeffray is for peace; &amp; is endeavouring to frighten
                  the people into it. I am for war as long as Bonaparte lives. He is for Catholick emancipation
                  – I believe that its immediate consequences would be to introduce an Irish Priest
                  into every ship in the navy. My feelings are still less in unison with him than my
                  opinions. On subjects of moral or political importance no man is more apt to speak
                  in the very gall of bitterness than I am, &amp; this habit is likely to go with me to
                  the grave; but that sort of <span class="strikethrough">severity</span> &lt;bitterness&gt; in which he indulges, which tends directly &amp; purposely to wound a man
                  in his feelings, &amp; injure him in his fame &amp; fortune (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontgomeryJames">Montgomery</a> is a case in point)

                  </div> appears to me utterly inexcusable. Now tho there would be no necessity that I should

                  the merit of all the others, &amp; in this way whatever of any merit I might insert there
                  would aid &amp; abet opinions hostile to my own, &amp; there make me art &amp; part in a system
