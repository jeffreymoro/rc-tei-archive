               <p>I am just now enabled to give you some intelligence concerning my self. In this topsey-turveying
                  of ministers <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> was very anxious as he says ‘to pick something out of the fire’ for me. The Registership

                  (the only one in his power) a pension of 200 £, – but before my answer

                  taking the latter. Fees &amp; taxes will reduce this to 160 £ – the precise sum for which
                  I have hitherto been indebted to him – so that I remain with just the same income
                  as before; – the different source from which it is derived is however as you may suppose
                  sufficiently grateful – for tho <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> could, till now, well afford this, &amp; I had no reluctance in accepting it from one
                  who is the oldest friend I have in the world (<span class="strikethrough">for</span> we have <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> been intimate for 19 years) – he has now nearly doubled his expenditure by marrying,
                  &amp; his wifes fortune could have been very little. This I suppose is asked for, &amp; granted
                  to me as a man of letters – in which character I feel myself fully &amp; fairly entitled
                  to receive it, – &amp; you know me too well to suppose that it can make me lose one jot
                  of that freedom both of opinion &amp; of speech, without which I should think myself unworthy
                  – not of this poor <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> earthly pittance alone – but of Gods air &amp; sunshine, &amp; my inheritance in heaven.</p>
