                  all those who are interested about him, is as inexplicable as the strange disease,
                  whether of body or mind, which actually incapacitates him from doing any thing, the
                  moment it becomes his duty to do it. I have lately had some serious talk, or rather
                  consultation with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>, respecting the hopeless way in which he is going on, &amp; the consequences to his family.

                  arrange some plan respecting the education of the boys .
