               &amp; the latter was left a week at Kendal, for the carriers convenience. – I would not
               write to thank you for them till both had made their appearance. The cheese is in

                  </div> &amp; the carnage which took place there, have never entertained a doubt of the eventual
                  success of the Spaniards, – the compleat deliverance of that peninsula is certain,
                  &amp; I am not without a lively hope that it may draw after it the deliverance of Europe.
                  French literature which carries plague &amp; poison rottenness &amp; ruin with it wherever
                  it goes, had infected Germany from one end to the other. Every state there had its
                  own politics, – its own vexations, its own tyrants, – they were Saxons, Hessians,
                  Bavarians &amp;c – any thing but Germans, – &amp; the Germanic body was a mazy limbed monster,
                  with one palsied head, &amp; without a heart. There was no common feeling then, difference
                  of religion produced animosities which were aggravated by their sameness of language,
                  &amp; we have had disastrous proofs that their army &amp; jealousy of each other were stronger
                  than their hatred of an invading enemy. Every thing is different in Spain: there &amp;
                  in Portugal the people have not degenerated, tho the Governments have been below contempt,
                  – &amp; such as the Governments were they, <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> excited pity &amp; regret in the subject, rather than <span class="strikethrough">hatred</span> &lt;resentment&gt;. The relaxation of criminal justice passed for lenity, – &amp; the people
                  even took a pride in the Despotism which had become inoffensive, – King Lion on a
                  velvet cushion, showing his teeth only when he yawn’d, &amp; his claws only when he stretched
                  himself, is of all objects of political devotion that which would most be admired
                  by a people who can bear with any King at all; – &amp; the constant tendency of all monarchies
                  towards despotism is because the people are ashamed of King Log.

                  a life &amp; ardour which it is impossible to contemplate without wonder, – I might almost
                  say without respect. Never was any idolatry so fitted to the wants of weaknesses &amp;
                  wishes of human nature, – never was any mythology so rivetted &amp; rooted in the hearts

                  sometimes supply the place of religion. honour sometimes supply the want of both,
                  – but the French have neither. They have never loved Bonaparte, &amp; when Fortune forsakes
