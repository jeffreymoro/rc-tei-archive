               <p>As for Sir Arthur &amp; Sir Hew, – for the first time in my life I was so irritated by
                  public news as to pass a sleepless night in consequence. There is a straight &amp; easy
                  way of proceeding in such a case – which is to break the convention, &amp; shoot those
                  who made it; or else, after the manner of the Romans, deliver these up to the enemy
                  with ropes about their necks. Sir Arthur ought to be shot for fighting when he did.
                  he was afraid of being superseded before he won a battle, &amp; for that reason fought
                  with only half his own force, – for fear if he had waited till the other half came
                  up Sir Hew should land &amp; take the command. Sir Hew – Lady Hew I ought rather to say
                  for the creature has long been known to be an old woman, – then suffered Junot to
                  fall back about thirty miles after the battle, &amp; during the negociations, – &amp; so between
                  them they have sacrificed the honour of England &amp; the interest of Spain.

                           Anglo-Portuguese forces under Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the 1st Duke of Wellington)

                  &amp; loudly expressed, – &amp; I hope &amp; trust an example will be made of the commander. My
                  own opinion is that no man could possibly consent to let Junot carry off his plunder,
                  unless he had been promised a share of it for so doing. This will be laughed at &amp;
                  generally scouted, – but the man who could subscribe such a convention is capable
                  of any degree of baseness; – &amp; there are but two possible motives for his conduct,
                  – cowardice or corruption. the former with a victorious &amp; superior army seems to be
