               <p>My Ass John is a John Ass, &amp; he hath taken it in his head as Adam did before him in
                  Paradise, that it is not good for him to be alone. So that being most heroically in
                  love with some unknown asinine fair one, he set off this morning in quest of her,
                  like a Prince in the Persian Tales. Now it fell out that at this unhappy time there
                  came a man over the bridge riding upon just such a beast as the adventurer was seeking.
                  John beheld her, galloped after into the middle of the town, &amp; there attacked the
                  rider, – Amor vincit omnia

                  arose, the beholders did not behave as by all the feelings &amp; laws of chivalry they
                  were bound to do; they were neither moved by the valour of John, nor by his generosity
                  for he scorned to tread upon the fallen, but they were prepared to take vengeance
                  for their fellow—when like Venus in the Iliad our Nanny came in time to save her charge
