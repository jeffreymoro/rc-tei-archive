            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your letter had nearly brought me the first intelligence of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> marriage, – for his which announced it arrived only by the same post.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s uncle Herbert Hill had recently married Catherine, daughter of Loveless
                           Bigg-Wither (1741–1813), a Hampshire landowner.</span></div>
                  </div> Some eight or nine weeks ago word to this effect had been written me by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyWilliam">Colonel Peachy</a>, my summer neighbour here, – but as he knows nothing of my Uncle, &amp; there are so
                  many Hills in the world, I rather wished his information to be true, than believed
                  it; – &amp; indeed so totally discredited the rumour as not to think it worthy of mention.
                  I perceive what opinion you are inclined to upon the subject; – mine, as far as it
                  can be formed in utter ignorance of the age &amp; character of her whom he has chosen,
                  is more favourable. Perhaps selfish considerations contribute to render it so, – I
                  was not satisfied to feel myself settled so far from my Uncle, <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> considering the lonely situation in which he was placed; &amp; the thought that his evening
                  of life would be passed in solitariness often came across me, &amp; lay heavy at my heart.
                  But setting that consideration aside, – one of the main objections to a late marriage,
                  is not applicable to him; – he has &lt;now&gt; no fixed habits of life which it would be
                  difficult to change or modify, – they have all been torn up by the roots, &amp; new ones
                  were necessarily to be acquired. One weighty drawback undoubtedly remains, – should
                  he have children he cannot hope to see them grow up. I trust he feels convinced that
                  in this case, should I survive <span class="strikethrough">them</span> &lt;him&gt;, I shall be to them, to the utmost of my power, what <span class="strikethrough">they have</span> he has been to me.</p>

               <p>Surprized however certainly I am, &amp; so surprized as hardly to have thought of any
                  thing else since. To have a new graft upon a family stock is always an important event,
                  &amp; it is especially strange to hear unexpectedly of one who stands in so near a relation,
                  &amp; to know no more of her or her family than of the woman in the moon &amp; hers, – a woman
                  you know there must be there because the man in the moon has horns. My Uncle tells
                  me her former name, &amp; that she is of the race of old George Wither the poet,
