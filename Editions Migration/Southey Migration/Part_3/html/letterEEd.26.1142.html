                  In such cases, the only proper mode of proceeding is to relate the plain state of
                  the matter. His verses are good for nothing; and not a single copy can possibly sell,
                  except what his acquaintance may purchase: but he has been labouring under mental
                  derangement, – the heaviest of all human calamities, – and the passion which he has
                  contracted for rhyming has changed the character of his malady, and made him from
                  a most miserable being, a very happy one. Under these circumstances you will not,
                  perhaps, object to gratifying him, and depositing copies of his book in your wareroom,
                  for the accommodation of the spiders.

                  hardly take: the poems are as inoffensive as they are worthless. I shall simply tell
                  him that I have made the application, without giving him any reason to expect its
                  success. You will, of course, use your own judgment, only I will beg you to signify
                  your assent or dissent to him himself.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.
