               <p>I had yesterday a visit from the Scotch Bookseller <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</a> , who in consequence of something which I said in a letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">W Scott</a> has formally proposed to me to undertake a Review of old Books – i.e of all except
                  contemporary ones, – to come forth quarterly in crown number, the Editorship 100 £
                  a year, the writing ten guineas per sheet.
