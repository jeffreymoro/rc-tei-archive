               <p>I return you your book, with many thanks for the gratification it has afforded me.
                  It is a valuable fragment of History, written under such circumstances, with such
                  ability &amp; in such a spirit, as must make every person regret that it should be only
                  a fragment. The extracts from the Authors letters place him in a very interesting
                  light, &amp; I wish more of them had been inserted.

               <p>All thoughts of the business whereon I spoke to you are at an end. My application
                  to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</a> was received in the handsomest manner, – but it &lt;since&gt; appears that a man practically
                  acquainted with mining &amp; agriculture is required, &amp; I who imagined all that was necessary
                  was to let the estates, watch over them, take care of the woods, &amp; collect the rents,
                  – am of course altogether unqualified.

                           of the incumbent. Southey asked several friends, including Humphrey Senhouse and George
                           Beaumont to interecede on his behalf, but in the end it was considered to be unsuitable
                           for him.</span></div>
