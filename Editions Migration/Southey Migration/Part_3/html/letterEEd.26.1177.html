                  that he hath extended the volume regularly to a size which cannot be afforded, exceeding
                  their estimated &amp; resolved number by full 200. Item that there is much matter which
                  is too dull, he the said Arthur seeming to have an inclination for dullness. Item
                  that he favoureth not sufficiently the publications of themselves, the said Fathers;
                  which they humbly conceive ought to be done by sending such articles into safe hands.
                  The sum total is that a great reduction will take place in medical &amp; philosophical
                  articles, &amp; that our Well beloved brother in the Review must curtail his theology.
