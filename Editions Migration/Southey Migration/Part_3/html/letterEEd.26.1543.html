               (1769–1852; <em>DNB</em>) at Vimeiro on 21 August, was allowed to retreat intact, with its weapons, from Portugal.
               Wellesley, who did not sign the Convention, had been superseded in command by two
               veteran generals, just arrived in Iberia, who were content to make peace: Sir Harry
               Burrard (1755–1813; <em>DNB</em>) and Sir Hew Dalrymple (1750–1830;<em>DNB</em>). Public outcry led to an inquiry, after which Burrard and Dalrymple never again
