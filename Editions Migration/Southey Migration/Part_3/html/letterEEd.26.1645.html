            <p class="indent1">My friends leave Bristol on Monday next, – on their way hither, – you thus perceive
               how impossible it is that I can now accompany you to Edinburgh, – as I should else

               <p>The latter part of your letter requires a confidential answer. – I once wished to
                  reside in Portugal, because <span class="strikethrough">my</span> the great object of my literary life related to that country. I loved the country,
                  &amp; had then <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">an Uncle</a> <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> settled there. Before <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Fox</a> came into power this was told him by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnSirWatkinWilliams">Williams Wynn</a>, &amp; when he was in power he was asked by Wynn to send me there.

                  were but two things in Portugal which I could hold, the Consulship, – or the Secretaryship
                  of Legation. The former was twice given away, – but that Fox said was too good a thing

The party got turned out, – &amp; <span class="strikethrough">the</span> one of the last things <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Ld Grenville</a> did was to give me a pension of 200. Till that time I had received one of 160 from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Charles W. Wynn</a> – my oldest surviving friend, – the exchange leaves me something the poorer, as the
                  Exchequer deducts above sixty pounds. This is all I have. Half my time I sell to the
                  Booksellers, – the other half is reserved for works which will never pay for the paper
                  on which they are written, but on which I rest my future fame. I am of course straitened
                  in circumstances, – a little more would make me easy. My chance of inheritance is
                  gone by, my <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">fathers elder brother</a> was worth 40,000, but he cut me off without the slightest cause of offence.</p>

               <p>You would see by this that I would willingly be served, – but it is not easy to serve
                  me. Lisbon is too insecure a place to remove to with a family, &amp; nothing could repay
                  me for going without them. I have neither the habits nor talents for an official situation,
                  nor if I had could I live in London – that is I should soon die there. I have said
                  to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> that one thing would make me at ease for life – ‘create for <span class="strikethrough">the</span> &lt;me&gt; the title of Royal Historiographer for England (there is one for Scotland) with
                  a salary of 400 £’.

                  be easy to supply myself. – Of course my present pension would cease. Whether <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">M<sup>r</sup> Canning</a> can do this I know not, but if this could be done it would be adequate to all I want,
