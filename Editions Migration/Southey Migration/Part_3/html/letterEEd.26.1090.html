                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey was hoping to move with the financial assistance of his brother, Thomas, whose
                           ship HMS Amelia, in which he was a lieutenant, had captured the Spanish brig Isabella
                           and the ship Conception, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship Commerce, laden
                           with cotton. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value
                           of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict.</span></div>

                  like those of which you speak.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your objections to the exordial lines are not valid:
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           Poetical Works 1793–1810, gen. ed. Lynda Pratt, 5 vols (London, 2004), II, p. 8.</span></div>
                  </div> I say there of what the poem is to treat, not affirming that it is historically true.
                  Just as I might have said in an introduction to Thalaba
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> that he destroyed the Domdaniel &amp; so put an end to all sorcery. – The want of numerals
                  is a fault – I confess. not so the namelessness of the divisions – nor indeed are
                  they nameless, for in the notes they are referred to as <span class="ital">Sections</span>, – &amp; that each has not its <span class="ital">specific</span> name, from its subject matter &lt;affixed to it,&gt; is you know the effect of your own
                  advice. However call them Sections, Cantos, Canticles, Chapters – what you will, &amp;
                  then consider in what is the mode of division objectionable? it differs only from
                  that of other poems in having shorter sections – in travelling by miles instead of
                  leagues the primary division into parts is unavoidable.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am not surprized at your little-liking the poem. – on the contrary I am more surprized
               <span class="strikethrough">that</span> at those who like it, – because what merit it has is almost wholly that of execution,
               which is infinitely better than the subject, – now every body can feel if a story
               be uninteresting or flat, whereas there are very few who can judge the worth of the
               language &amp; versification. I have said to somebody – perhaps it was to you yourself
               – that had this been <span class="ital">written</span> since Thalaba, (for as you know the plan was formed &amp; the key pitched before Thalaba
               was begun or dreamt of) I should have thought it ominous of declining powers, it is
               in so sober a tone, its colouring so autumnal, its light every where that of an evening
               sun. But as only the last finish of language, the polishing part is of later labour,
               the fair inference is that instead of the poets imagination having grown weaker, he
               has improved in the mechanism of his art. A fair inference it is – for I am no self-flatterer
               Heaven knows. – That you may see what is my own deep &amp; intimate conviction about the
               poem I send what I had written as the beginning of a preface: – the remarks are <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</a>. I acceded easily to the common-sense which they contained &amp; readily forbore telling
               the reader what he was likely enough to find out. But the truth it is. – I had chosen
               my subject ill, &amp; nothing could ever overbalance that radical &amp; constitutional defect.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Having confessed thus much I ought to add that the poem is better than you think it,
                  &amp; is certainly not of the patchwork-texture you describe. Compare it with the Odyssey
                  – not the Iliad – King John or Coriolanus, not Macbeth or the Tempest.

                  </div> The story wants unity, &amp; has perhaps too Greek – too Stoical – a want of passion,
