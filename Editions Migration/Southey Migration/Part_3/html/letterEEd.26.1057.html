                  to India he has never written me a line. The truth of the matter is this. At one time
                  he thought it prudent to drop his acquaintance with me – but the recollection which
                  he had of old times, &amp; the feeling which he had <span class="strikethrough">for</span> &lt;towards&gt; me in the bottom of his heart, &amp; the connecting link which you formed, –
                  forced him to an occasional intercourse which was always uncomfortable. – &amp; which
                  I ought to have broken off, seeing that it was uncomfortable to him, &amp; that his father
                  past me in the streets. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</a> feels all this &amp; when he remembers me is not pleased with himself, because he knows

                  from my own observations – but from some of his own letters which were once inadvertently
                  shown me. – I will not therefore write to him again, nor in way force myself upon
                  him. When he returns to England if we should meet by chance as most probably we shall,
                  I shall not forget his very many very excellent qualities, nor the deep &amp; unaffected
                  prepossession in his favour which I felt the very first day I ever saw him, when I
                  was placed under him as his shadow.

               is high praise, &amp; such praise as I conceive most appropriate. I heartily rejoice that
