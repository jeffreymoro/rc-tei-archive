               <p>Inevitable delays in London &amp; on the road, &amp; business accumulating meantime at home
                  – (for unlike the lilies of the world who neither toil nor spin, I inherit my full
                  share of Adams curse, having no other inheritance) – prevented me from returning thro
                  Lichfield. It cannot I hope be necessary to express how greatly to my disappointment.
                  You were good enough not to wish me to write from London, &amp; yet you cannot have foreseen
                  the unremitting succession of business in which I was involved, from the hour of my
                  arrival till that of my departure, strictly &amp; literally speaking. Five &amp; twenty cases
                  of books I packed with my own hands &amp; this was done in the intervals of other occupations.

                           arranging for his books, which had been stored by friends in London and the West Country,
                           to be collected together.</span></div>
                  </div> Whenever I found a spare half hour, this standing job of hard bodily labour served
                  to fill it up. The fatigue of the day did not send me so soundly to sleep &lt;at night&gt;,
                  but that the work of the morrow roused me up to an hours <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span>&lt;task&gt; before an early breakfast, &amp; I did not rest so quietly at any time during my
                  absence, as on those nights which were past in stage coaches, when like a piece of
                  live luggage all I had to do was to sit still, &amp; be patient. Thank God I am now once
                  more in my own chair, seated at my own desk, by my own fireside. The noise &amp; motion
                  of mail coaches are not yet out of my head, but the cold &amp; cough which the poisonous
                  air of London never fails to give me have taken flight, &amp; I have no other symptom
                  of fatigue remaining except that my sleep is as sound as a growing boys, or a hard
                  working peasants.</p>

                  part of it as it now stands will be new to you. The beginning is, in my judgement,
                  among the best things I have produced. – Why do you not write more poetry, has been
                  the question every where, &amp; my answer has everywhere been because I cannot afford
                  it. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</a> was talking to me about Thalaba,

                  that design had been abandoned. Finish them, said he, &amp; I will pay for printing them,
                  as many as you write, &amp; as many copies of each as you please. This has excited in
                  me a stinging desire to finish them, on other terms, if only to show him how highly
                  I value the <span class="strikethrough">applause</span> &lt;opinion&gt; of a man, <span class="strikethrough">to whose opinion I xxxx afraid</span> who is authorized to pass an opinion upon me as one of my peers. I am a proud man
                  &amp; do not allow that authority to many. We poets have no envy in our composition, –
                  &amp; poetasters seem generally to have nothing else in theirs. Nine tenths of the malignant
                  criticisms which injure our literature &amp; disgrace our age come from disappointed authors;
                  whose evidence would be rejected if their names were known. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</a> himself writes verses, – what sort of verses may easily be guessed.</p>

            <p class="indent1">The worst news which I learnt on my journey was from the stationers. Paper is so enormously
               dear that nothing can without great <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> imprudence be put to press till its price be materially reduced, &amp; when that will
               be is beyond the reach of any calculation. The rags of the continent found their way
               to England; it is an article which will not pay for freight, &amp; which came as ballast
               in all ships from Hamburgh. Every kind of trade with the continent is now at a stand,
               &amp; there is not printing-paper enough in this country for six months consumption, nor
               any hopes of obtaining a supply of rags to manufacture more.</p>
