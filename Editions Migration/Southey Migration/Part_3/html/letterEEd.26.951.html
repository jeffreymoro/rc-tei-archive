               <div class="salute">Dear Coleridge,</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The first news of you was from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb’s</a> letter, which arrived when I was in London. I saw, also, your letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#StuartDaniel">Stuart</a>, and heard of one to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TobinJamesWebbe">Tobin</a>, before I returned and found my own. Ere this you are at Malta. What an infectious
               thing is irregularity! Merely because it was uncertain when a letter could set off,
               I have always yielded to the immediate pressure of other employment; whereas, had
               there been a day fixed for the mail, to have written would then have been a fixed
               business, and performed like an engagement.</p>
            <p class="indent1">All are well – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">Sara</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sariola</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Moses</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Justiculus</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> and the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edithling</a>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerMary">Mary</a> is better.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I was worn to the very bone by fatigue in London, – more walking in one day than I
               usually take in a month; more waste of breath in talking than serves for three months’
               consumption in the country; add to this a most abominable cold, affecting chest, head,
               eyes, and nose. It was impossible to see half the persons whom I wished to see, and
               ought to have seen, without prolonging my stay to an inconvenient time, and an unreasonable
               length of absence from home. I called upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir George</a> unsuccessfully, and received a note that evening, saying he would be at home the
               following morning; then I saw him, and his lady, and his pictures, and afterwards
               met him the same day at dinner at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy’s</a>. As he immediately left town, this was all our intercourse; and, as it is not likely
               that he will visit the Lakes this year, probably will be all.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I went into the Exhibition merely to see your picture, which perfectly provoked me. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HazlittWilliam">Hazlitt’s</a> does look as if you were on your trial, and certainly had stolen the horse; but then
                  you did it cleverly, – it had been a deep, well-laid scheme, and it was no fault of
                  yours that you had been detected. But this portrait by Northcote looks like a grinning
                  idiot; and the worst is, that it is just like enough to pass for a good likeness,
                  with those who only know your features imperfectly. Dance’s drawing has that merit
                  at least, that nobody would ever suspect you of having been the original.

                           Lakes in autumn 1803. Southey had previously singled that of Wordsworth out for criticism

                           Southey. Part Two, Letter 868. The whereabouts of the portraits is now unknown. James
                           Northcote (1746–1831; DNB) painted Coleridge in 1804; this portrait is presently at

                  very important result: one in eight throughout Great Britain receives permanent parish
                  pay; – what is still more extraordinary, and far more consolatory, one in nine is
                  engaged in some benefit society, – a prodigious proportion, if you remember that,
                  in this computation, few women enter, and no children.

                           collected in fourteenth-century Welsh manuscripts and known as the Mabinogi. These
                           translations appeared in the journal he edited, The Cambrian Register (1796, 1799),

                  they offer a new problem, of almost impossible solution. Bard Williams communicated
                  to me some fine arcana of bardic mythology, quite new to me and to the world, which

               post, when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> arrived, and occasioned one day’s delay. I have left him talking to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Moses</a>, and mounted to my own room to finish.

The house remains <span class="ital">in statu quo</span>, except that the little parlour is painted, and papered with cartridge-paper. Workmen
               to plaster this room could not be procured when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Jackson</a> sent for them, and so unplastered it is likely to remain another winter. A great
               improvement has been made by thinning the trees before the parlour window, – just
               enough of the lake can be seen through such a framework, and such a fretted canopy
               of foliage as to produce a most delightful scene, and utterly unlike any other view
               of the same subject. The Lakers begin to make their appearance, though none have,
               as yet, reached us. But <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharpe</a> has announced his approach in a letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">W</a>.
