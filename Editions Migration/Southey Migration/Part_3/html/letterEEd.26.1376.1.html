            </header>
            <p>MS: the letter survives only in a partial transcript in the hand of Henry Crabb Robinson
               and made by him in ‘July 1858’, Dr Williams’s Library, London, Crabb Robinson MSS.
               The letter was possibly amongst the letters from Southey to Duppa that Robinson was
               given by Duppa’s niece, Mrs Stone, in January 1844, see <em>Henry Crabb Robinson on Books and their Writers</em>, ed. Edith J. Morley, 3 vols (London, 1938), II, p. 640.<br>Unpublished.<br>Dating note: dated ‘1810’ by Robinson, but this is clearly in error as the content
               suggests this was written shortly after Duppa announced his intention of studying
               at Oxford. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 9 November 1807 and this
               letter probably dates from about that time.</p>

                  – For them the society differs only from what they just left at school in the addition
                  of some decorum a few formalities &amp; the advantage of a degree in debauchery.</p>
