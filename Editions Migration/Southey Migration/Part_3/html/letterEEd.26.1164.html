            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have been thinking over your letter in much perplexity. Certainly I will myself
                  make enquiry upon the spot, but there are some reasons which induce me to wish to
                  do it on my return from London, rather than on my way there. 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Herbert Hill had the living of a parish at Staunton-Upon-Wye, Herefordshire, which,
                           while he was in Lisbon, he had left in the care of Dr Thomas, father of his business
                           agent William Bowyer Thomas, who had died in 1802. Southey was preparing to investigate
                           the payment of tithes on Hill’s estate for him while he was abroad; see Southey to
                           Charles Danvers, 17 March 1806, Letter 1166.</span></div>
                  </div> One main one is that when in London I should be able to learn what enquiries to make,
                  &amp; in what manner to set about them, – of which I feel at present most uncomfortably
                  ignorant. The other <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> may perhaps appear less cogent to you than it seems – &amp; than it really is to myself.
                  There is a good deal of cross country road to get over, in a track untravelled by
                  stages. Had I a chair of my own, or a servant on horseback with me, this would signify
                  nothing – but as it is it would <span class="strikethrough">x</span> occasion a heavy expence in post-chaises. Now when I shall be returning in May, the
                  weather will not be so cold but that I can travel in the stage as far as it goes without
                  a great coat, – &amp; then <span class="ital">more meo</span> 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> sling my knapsack &amp; pedestrianize the rest of the way. But <span class="strikethrough">x</span> at this time it is impossible to leave the great coat behind – &amp; as impossible to
                  walk with it. However if you think time of consequence I will pursue your plans.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There are some circumstances which lead me to think with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> that the roguery is in the parishioners. The tithes were let for 200 £ per year, for
                  two years, to Downes – <span class="strikethrough">x</span> (my Uncles lessee)
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)

                  </div> if any man could have made <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> this a good bargain he could, – but he did not renew, &amp; complained heavily that he
                  was a loser while he held them. Every thing had gone to ruin under the former Incumbent.
                  If the survey was made by a Londoner it is <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> &lt;probably&gt; over-rated – &amp; that too upon the supposition that every thing is tithable
                  in kind. Sir W<sup>m</sup> Scotts
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)

                  </div> advice about dilapidations proved very unfortunate. 80 £ only had been given by some
                  country assessors. my Uncle had down a man from London who gave some hundreds – the
                  consequence was that he never received a single shilling. Poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasDr">Thomas</a> <span class="strikethrough">forever</span> thought he had been ill advised. the first sum was inadequate but it would have been
                  paid – the latter was extravagant &amp; the executrix evaded it altogether by pleading
                  that there was no property to discharge it. The Herefordshire people are notoriously
                  litigious – the country is a sort of nursery for pettyfogging attornies. As for Evans
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> himself, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a> recommended him to me precisely on the ground of his honesty – they were schoolfellows,
                  &amp; Duppas father inhabits the same town. I cannot suspect him, but still after such
                  an opinion we should deserve to be cheated if we did not look into it. The only method
                  which I at present discover, <span class="strikethrough">it</span> is that when I go, I should go at once to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasDr">D<sup>r</sup> Thomas</a>, who lives some twenty or thirty miles from the place, – apprizing him first of my
                  intention, &amp; request him to accompany me there: but do you not think I shall be able
                  to do this far better after I have talked the matter over with some persons who are
                  capable of advising me in what manner to set about it, &amp; specifically what points
                  to investigate? in this case also there will be time to receive instructions from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> himself. All this I submit entirely to you – &amp; will make my arrangements as soon as
                  I receive your opinion. You will of course let me know it as soon as you can, &amp; if
                  you agree with me, it will save a mail, if you will have the goodness to apprise <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> of it, &amp; desire him to direct his instructions to me in town.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I purpose leaving this place in something less than three weeks. If the Herefordshire
               journey be postponed till my return, &amp; if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Taylor</a> is not going to London during my stay there, I purpose going to Norwich &amp; staying
               a week with him, on, or rather out of – the way. But I shall have occasion to write
               again &amp; will then tell you of my movements –</p>
