                           publications earned him a reputation for irreligious views, arrogant irritability
                           and personal immorality.</span></div>
                  </div> little tale (which reached me last night) be long enough for publication, I should
                  think it possesses sufficient interest to be saleable. The author is, in my judgment,
                  a man of very considerable, and indeed extraordinary, talents. This _____ he has probably
                  written hastily, and, I fear, upon the spur of want.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Having myself sought after information respecting the countries on the Mississippi,
               I can say that the descriptions and natural history are, as far as my knowledge goes,
               accurate, and therefore it is fair to presume that such circumstances as were new
               to me are equally true to nature.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I know nothing of _____ but from his Travels; from that he appears to be a self-taught
                  man, who has all his life long been struggling with difficulties; and the book left
                  upon me a melancholy impression, that however much adversity had quickened his talents,
                  it had injured his moral feelings. Pride and vanity are only defensive vices in a
                  poor and neglected man of talents; and being defensive, they cease to be vices. Something
                  of the same palliation, may be pleaded for an evident libertinism of heart and thought
                  which is everywhere too manifest in his book; in this he resembles Smollett and Defoe,

                  a letter to you upon the subject of the Collection some months ago, but laid it aside
                  when the alarm of invasion seemed to suspend all literary, and indeed all other, speculation.
