            <p>But this is not all: so many days and nights of unrelenting study, so many hopes and
               fears, so many aspirations after fame, so much genius, and so many virtues, have left
               behind them more than this, – they have left comfort and consolation to his friends,
               an honourable remembrance for himself, and for others, a bright and encouraging example.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Our intercourse will not be at an end. When I visit London, which will certainly be
               during the winter, and probably very soon, I shall see you. We shall have, it is to
               be hoped and expected, to communicate respecting after editions; and at all times
               it will give me great pleasure to hear from you.</p>
