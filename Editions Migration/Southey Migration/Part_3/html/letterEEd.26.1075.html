                           cargo captured in armed conflict, and Southey was concerned that Thomas would lose
                           his prize money from Spanish ships taken by HMS Amelia in December 1804. His fears
                           were exacerbated by the fact that in mid-1805 a squadron of French ships commanded
                           by Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand (1762–1828) and based at Rochefort, slipped past

                  350£ of it, for the purpose of removing &amp; furnishing a house near London. So that
                  if no unlucky accident turn up I may reasonably expect to get my books together &amp;

His fears were exacerbated by the fact that in mid-1805 a squadron
               of French ships commanded by Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand (1762–1828) and based
               at Rochefort, slipped past the British blockade to harass British ships in the Atlantic
