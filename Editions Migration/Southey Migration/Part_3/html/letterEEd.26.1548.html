                  </div> on this huge &amp; stiff paper, come to any thing, or not? – this is the question which
                  you will be ready to ask &amp; which I am not ready to answer. My earnest advice to him
                  has been, not to begin till he was stocked with materials for twenty weeks, – twelve
                  he thought sufficient, – so perhaps might I, had it not been for a suspicion that
                  if twelve were the stock in hand resolved on he would begin with six, – or probably
                  half that diminished number. Here however the Prospectus is. If the plan be carried
                  on it will produce him a considerable income, &amp; will be of great general good – eventually.
                  – He has begun clumsily with a Prospectus which already requires <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> alteration. – for if the numbers be to be delivered by the Post, they must be stamped,
                  &amp; in that case must be printed on a single sheet, – &amp; should he have any number of
                  country subscribers this must be the method adopted.</p>
