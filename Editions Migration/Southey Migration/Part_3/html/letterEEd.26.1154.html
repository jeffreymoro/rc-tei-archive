                  because you will be pleased to find that the Duke has given this pledge &amp; promise
                  of his good will. I also have reason to expect something. Whichever falls vacant first,

                           the 2nd Baronet Barham. When her family objected to the couple’s plans to marry, the
                           relationship soon ended. For more information; see Southey to John May, 1 November
