                  (that of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ClarksonCatherine">M<sup>rs</sup> Clarkson</a>) wherein by immediately proscribing it &amp; prescribing something else, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</a> checked the disease, &amp; saved the patient. For Gods sake Grosvenor if you do not certainly
                  feel yourself recovering by this ordinary mode of practise state your case to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</a>, a man who never tries experiments except when ordinary methods would fail, &amp; who
                  in liver cases is eminently successful. This is not said from any personal liking

                  talents, &amp; would in any case of illness resign myself into his hand with the most
