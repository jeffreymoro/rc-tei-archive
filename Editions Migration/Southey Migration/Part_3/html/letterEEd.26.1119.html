               had written a poem on the theme of the ‘Old Woman of Berkeley’ (J.W. Robberds (ed.),
               <em>A Memoir of the Life and Writings of the Late William Taylor of Norwich</em>, 2 vols (London, 1843), I, p. 235). This poem, entitled ‘A Tale of Wonder’ was written
               about 1791, but remained unpublished for many years until its appearance in the Iris,
               the weekly Norwich newspaper edited by Taylor, on 29 October 1803. Southey wanted
               to republish the poem with his own ‘Old Woman of Berkeley’ but Taylor declined the
               offer and it was published in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> 34 (1812), 234–236. See David Chandler, ‘Southey’s “German Sublimity” and Coleridge’s
