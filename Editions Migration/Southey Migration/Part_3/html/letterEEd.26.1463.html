            <p class="indent1">There has been a good deal of sickness in my house since you heard from me. An epidemic
               bilious fever which has attacked all the children in the place found its way here,
               – I had some uneasiness respecting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">little Edith</a> who was first attacked, – &amp; afterwards a serious alarm for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a>, who has been very ill. He began to show symptoms of recovery on Friday night, &amp;
               is still mending. I have had a good deal of anxiety &amp; sleeplessness, &amp; am thank God
               am not the worse for it. – Yesterday he wanted to <span class="strikethrough">walk</span> &lt;go&gt; about as usual, &amp; was angry at being held, – but it was quite affecting to see
               his fear when he found himself unable to walk. It was the first shudder of human nature
               upon discovering its own infirmity.</p>

                  begun to rise at an earlier hour, for the sake of creating time which may lawfully
                  be thus employed; – &amp; in that time <span class="strikethrough">have</span> advanced some little way in the poem, till this sickness stopt my career. You know
                  I believe I have revised <span class="strikethrough">what</span> the part which you have seen, &amp; introduced a good deal of rhyme into it.</p>
