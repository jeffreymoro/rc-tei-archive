            <p class="indent1">Had not your letter contained intelligence of your illness it would have been instantly
               answered, – on the spur of the moment. But on that subject I neither knew what to
               say nor how to be silent, &amp; have therefore shrunk from writing as from a task, instead
               of hastening to it as a gratification. I had a friend once who when above the age
               of seventy had an <span class="strikethrough">lesion</span> – abscess of the liver, she was feebler than is usual at that age, &amp; yet recovered
               so as to enjoy some years of longer life. When an organic disease is not necessarily
               fatal the chances in a good constitution are for its favourable termination; – &amp; where
               the heart &amp; the spirit are so young as they are in you, the power of life also will
               be strong.</p>

               <p>I have directed my publishers to send you a book which is just gone into the world

                  chiefly with a hope that it may pass unknown thro the hands of those Reviewers who
                  are sure to detract from whatever is mine. My object was to give a picture of the
                  present state of England, but for this I have not left myself room, having for the
                  sake of preserving the assumed character taken up too large a portion in mere travelling.
                  If however it should sell, the work may easily be lengthened so as to compleat the
                  design. You will easily distinguish what is written <span class="ital">for</span> the Spaniard from what is written <span class="ital">thro</span> him. – The heretical history is really valuable, few persons would have had the patience
                  to collect materials for it; it is written with full knowledge, &amp; the strictest truth.</p>

                  </div> Let me consult you concerning an alteration of this part. Suppose that Tezozomoc encourages
                  the thought of emigrating when it is first hinted at by the King, &amp; plots with Tlalala
                  to kill Madoc &amp; his chiefs at a conference: meaning to kill Yuhidthiton also in the
                  fray, but this part of his design he dares not entrust to Tlalala. The meeting takes
                  place on an Island, – so that all the people are spectators. To make all sure the
                  priests poison their knives. At the moment of danger Yuhidthiton alarms Madoc, who
                  stabs Tezozomoc, but is hurt in the arm, &amp; the priest writhing in death tells him
                  exaltingly the wound is mortal. Madoc heats his sword red hot upon the altar, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">burn</span> cauterizes his arm with it. Then he &amp; Yuhidthiton part in friendship, &amp; Tlalala, who
                  seeing the Kings life aimed at in the treason has saved him &amp; turned upon the Priests,
                  gives his wife &amp; child to Madoc’s care<span class="strikethrough">s</span>, &amp; terminates the poem as at present.</p>

                  but from this I was dissuaded, – and perhaps justly. I now think of bringing a dog
                  from the field of battle in Arvon, who was found there watching his dead master, –
                  &amp; making him save Goervyl after Malinal can do no more. At any rate this section must

                  is that that half of my time is devoted which I can afford to give to labours worthy
                  of myself &amp; of posterity. This work is far advanced – that part of it which relates
