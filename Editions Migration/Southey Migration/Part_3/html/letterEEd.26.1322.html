               <div class="salute">My dear Sir,</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You will have wondered at the length of time that your letter has remained unnoticed;
               the fact is, that it has only this evening reached me.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>By all means make the omission which you propose. I perfectly feel the justice of
                  your remarks; do, I beseech you, correct and alter as freely as if the writing were
                  your own.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey refers to edits for his Remains of Henry Kirke White, of Nottingham, 2 vols
                           (London, 1807).</span></div>
                  </div> With respect to Mr. Blanchard, it may be said, instead of ‘Poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a>,’ &amp;c., ‘in consequence of which Henry was removed’. The sentence about <span class="ital">tyranny</span> may be omitted, for what follows, if I rightly remember it, will be sufficiently connected.
                  If any better mode of alteration occur to you, use it without thinking of this. It
                  would give me serious pain if a single sentence were left which could in any possible
                  way produce a bad effect. The sum which you allowed your brother should be particularized.
                  Were you the ostensible editor, I would not urge this, but I request that I may be
                  permitted to do it, not merely because this sort of minute accuracy should always
                  be observed when possible, but for the higher motives of doing justice to one who,
                  from little, contributed what of that little must have been so much, and of holding
                  up a good and virtuous example to the world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You have, indeed, had a painful task in transcribing the Letters of Henry. I do not
                  rely upon my own judgment of the saleableness of books; but it is certain that those
                  which circulate among the religious public have the largest sale, and if these volumes
                  succeed in that direction, their produce may be far more considerable than you can
                  imagine. The manner in which I have been compelled, conscientiously, to express my
                  own dissent from his views of Christianity, cannot possibly impede their success.

                  </div> I should have felt guilty of hypocrisy had I suffered it to be supposed that my opinions
                  accorded with them, which would else necessarily have been the case. There are many
                  divisions and subdivisions of the public, and among many of them these works ought
                  to be well received; they who are best able to appreciate human excellence will value
                  them most.</p>

                           from poor backgrounds. His second wife, Sarah Watson Finch, a magazine poet published
                           in The Monthly Mirror and The Morning Chronicle, contributed an Ode to the Remains.</span></div>
                  </div> which is much better than I expected, and will very generally be admired. He does
                  not think the Greek poems in a state sufficiently finished for publication; they are
                  all fragments, and bear all the marks of Henry’s wonderful powers, but correctness
                  is in these things what is most looked to, and they had not been corrected. About
                  the ‘Melancholy Hours,’ I replied in my last: my reason for not at first inserting
                  them was trifling, and I am very desirous of following your wishes in everything.

                           hoping that he might be allowed to dedicate it to her; she politely declined but encouraged
                           him and subscribed to the publication; see The Remains of Henry Kirke White, of Nottingham,

                  </div> She will probably be better pleased with the way in which it is mentioned, than if
                  it had been inserted; neither have I included the lines to her, partly from a fault
                  (a grammatical one, I think,) in one of the lines, and partly because she did not
                  quite deserve the compliment which they contained. Of the letter on chronology, only
                  the extract is to be copied; it is a very able one, but the information which it contains
                  (though excellent for an elementary book) would, I think, not be well placed here.
