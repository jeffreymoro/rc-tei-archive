                  </div> letter I have been in great uneasiness concerning you, for by the same post <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> told me he supposed you were by that time here.

                  </div> This evening your letters from Acton have brought the first intelligence of you, which
                  has been delayed some days by a blunder of the post in carrying it to Birmingham.
                  Now that you are in London, &amp; the shock of meeting is over, I am glad you are there.
                  had you come on I should have endeavoured to detain you as long as possible.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">What shall I say <span class="strikethrough">you</span> to you? – this is the first heavy loss which you have ever experienced, – hereafter
               the bitterness of the cup will have past away, &amp; you will then perceive its wholesomeness.
               This world is all to us till we suffer some such loss, &amp; every such loss is a transfer
               of so much of our hearts &amp; hopes to the next, – <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxxx xxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx</span> &amp; they who live long enough to see most of their friends go before them, feel that
               they have more to recover by death than to lose by it. This is not the mere speculation
               of a mind at ease. Almost all who were about me in my childhood have been removed.
               I have brothers, sisters, friends, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">father</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">mother</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">child</a> in another state of existence, – &amp; assuredly I regard death with very different feelings
               than I should have done if none of my affections were fixed beyond the grave – To
               dwell upon the circumstances which in this case lessen the evil of separation, would
               be idle; – at present you acknowledge, &amp; in time you will feel them.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Pray let me hear from you. I am very anxious about your own state of health.
