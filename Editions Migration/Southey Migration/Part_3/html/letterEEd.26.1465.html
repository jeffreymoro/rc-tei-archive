                           designed to improve the nation’s defences by requiring men to join local militias
                           for up to 28 days per year. The amendments proposed by Wynn in the Commons debate
                           of 30 May concerned exemptions from service and the administering of an oath – a procedure
                           with which Southey, as an objector to the 39 articles of the established church, would,

               introduced a Local Militia Bill designed to improve the nation’s defences by requiring
               men to join local militias for up to 28 days per year. The amendments proposed by
               Wynn in the Commons debate of 30 May concerned exemptions from service and the administering
               of an oath – a procedure with which Southey, as an objector to the 39 articles of
               the established church, would, in common with many radicals and dissenters, have been
               reluctant to comply. Thus Hansard: ‘Mr. C. Wynne observed that in this case a strong
               temptation to perjury existed, and there was every opportunity for evasion; he therefore
               objected to the oath. He contended that the frequency with which oaths were administered
               had much diminished their influence on the public mind, especially when they were
               administered in cases where there was every temptation to perjury. – Mr. Windham,
               Mr. W. Smith, Mr. Wilberforce, sir S. Romilly, sir T. Turton, and Mr. Stephens, joined
               with Mr. Wynne, in his representation of the mischievous effects that resulted to
               the community from the frequency of appointing oaths to be taken in improper cases,
               and declared their conviction of the soundness of the common law principle, which
               prohibits oaths being taken by persons strongly interested in the cause. – Lord Castlereagh
               agreed that the oath should be left out, and that the clause should remain with the
               provision that a declaration to the same purport should be signed by the volunteer,
               with a penalty of 20<span class="ital">l.</span> if false. In the twenty second clause, exempting persons who shall have served four
               years in the local militia from being liable to serve therein again for four years
               after, two amendments were proposed. One was, that instead of the term of the exemption
               for four years, the exemption should be till the turn came by rotation. The other,
               proposed by Lord Milton, was, that one who served four years in the local militia
               should be for two years, subsequent to the close of that period, exempt from the regular
               militia ballot. Both were agreed to’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
