                  </div> &amp; Southey. It seems to me very doubtful whether my career of poetry is not at an end:
                  I have disused it so long that as <span class="strikethrough">before</span> &lt;for&gt; every thing else after long disuse, the inclination &lt;for it&gt; is gone. There
                  is a calmer &amp; steadier pleasure in acquiring &amp; communicating the knowledge of what
                  has been &amp; of what is, – I am passionately fond of history, – even when I have been
                  most delighted with the act of poetical composition. the recollection that all was
                  but fable in the story with which I had exerted myself, frequently mingled with the
                  delight. I am better pleased with rendering justice to the mighty dead, – with holding
                  up to the world the action of Kings, Conquerors, Heroes &amp; Saints, not as they have
                  usually been held up, but as they really are, good or evil, according to the opinions
                  formed of them by one who has neither passion, prejudice, nor interest of any kind
                  to mislead his mind. There is a delight in decoding great actions, &amp; (this of a different
                  kind) in execrating bad men beyond any thing which poetry can give, when it departs
                  from historical truth. There is also a source of power even beyond what the poet,
                  creator as he is, can exercise. It is before my earthly tribunal that these mighty
                  ones are brought for judgement. Centuries of applause, trophies &amp; altars, canonizations
                  or excommunication <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> &lt;avail&gt; nothing with me. No former sentences are cognizable in my court. The merits
                  of the case are all I look to, – &amp; I believe I have never failed to judge of the <span class="ital">actions</span> by themselves, &amp; of the <span class="ital">actor</span> by his motives, &amp; to allow manners, opinions, circumstances &amp;c their full weight in
                  palliation. What other merits my words will have others must find out for themselves,
                  – but this I will vouch for, that never was the heart of any historian full of purer
                  opinions, &amp; that never any one went about his work with more thorough industry or
                  more thorough good will.</p>
