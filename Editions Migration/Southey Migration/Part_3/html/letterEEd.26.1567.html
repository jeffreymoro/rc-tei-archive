            <p class="indent1">You make a right distinction, my dear Miss Betham, between the egotism of words &amp;
               of actions. The egotism of the heart seldom reaches to the lips, – none are so intensely
               selfish as the race of fawners &amp; flatterers, who always talk about <span class="ital">you</span> for the sake of making <span class="ital">themselves</span> appear amiable. Those letters are always the most interesting which are most about
               the writer. Am I wrong in supposing that generous minds express themselves more fully
               by the pen than by word of mouth, whereas a knave never lays himself open except he
               is thrown off his guard in conversation? – I have myself not so much a principle,
               as an instinct of unreservedness, – nor do I know whether I can help it or no, for
               I never <span class="strikethrough">have tr</span> tried the experiment. My very reserve resembles the rolling itself up of a hedgehog,
               &amp; is a manifestation too plain to be mistaken that I do not like my company. Yet I
               am sensible that I express myself more fully &amp; more freely when writing by my own
               fire side, than ever I do <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> at an after-dinner table, or in the most confidential &lt;personal&gt; intercourse.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In June then we hope &amp; look to see you here. What the picture wants can easily be
                  given it, – or rather what it has too much of can easily be taken away.

                  Southey character about it, for every body recognizes me, but thinks more of my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a>. But Henry’s face has got him into so many love-scrapes that I have told him he ought
                  not to go about without a muzzle, a precaution of which I never felt the slightest
                  occasion myself. My skin thickened just as I ceased to be a boy, I was always lean,
                  &amp; at that age when men in general think of nothing but their pleasure I had <span class="strikethrough">so much</span> occasion both for thought &amp; feeling which have left their indelible stamp <span class="strikethrough">behind</span> upon my strong features.</p>

                  windows, – in rowing you to the spot where we boil our kettle by the lake side, –
                  in seeing you, tempted by emulation at the example of my boat<span class="ital">women</span>, take the oars in your hand instead of the pencil, – in guiding you over the mountains
                  &amp; into the glens, – in talking to you about your poems &amp; telling you what you could
                  do, – &amp; in showing you how very happy a man may be upon very scanty means, who cares
                  nothing for the pomps &amp; vanities of the world, &amp; preserves a boys heart when the grey
                  hairs are beginning to show themselves. And in pointing out to you the house where
