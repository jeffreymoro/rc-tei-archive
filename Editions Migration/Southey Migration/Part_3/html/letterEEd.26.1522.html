               <div class="l">Then in the Ship of Heaven Ereenia laid</div>
               <div class="l">The waking, wondering Maid.</div>
               <div class="l">The Ship of Heaven, instinct with thought, display’d</div>
               <div class="l">Its living sail &amp; glides along the sky.</div>
               <div class="l">On either side in wavy tide</div>
               <div class="l">The clouds of morn along its path divide; –</div>
               <div class="l">The Winds who swept in wild career on high</div>
               <div class="l">Before its presence check their charmed force; –</div>
               <div class="l">The Winds that loitering lagg’d along their course</div>
               <div class="l">Around the living Bark enamoured play,</div>
               <div class="l">Swell underneath the sail, &amp; sing before its way.</div><br><div class="l">That Bark in shape was like the furrowed shell</div>
               <div class="l">Wherein the Sea Nymphs to their parent King</div>
               <div class="l">On festal day, their duteous offerings bring.</div>
               <div class="l">It’s hue? – go watch the last green light</div>
               <div class="l">Ere Evening yields the western sky to Night;</div>
               <div class="l">Or fix upon the Sun thy strenuous sight</div>
               <div class="l">Till thou hast reachd its orb of chrysolite.</div>
               <div class="l">The sail, from end to end displayd</div>
               <div class="l">Bent like a rainbow oer the Maid.</div>
               <div class="l">An Angels head with visual eye</div>
               <div class="l">Thro trackless space directs its chosen way,</div>
               <div class="l">Nor aid of wing nor feet nor fin</div>
               <div class="l">Requires to voyage oer the obedient sky.</div>
               <div class="l">Smooth as the Swan when not a breeze at even</div>
               <div class="l">Disturbs the surface of the silver stream,</div>
               <div class="l">Thro air &amp; sunshine sails the Ship of Heaven.</div><br><div class="l">Recumbent there the Maiden glides along,</div>
               <div class="l">How swift she feels not, tho the swiftest wind</div>
               <div class="l">Had flaggd in flight behind <span class="strikethrough">x</span></div>
               <div class="l"><span class="strikethrough">She feared not</span></div>
               <div class="l">She felt no fear, for that etherial air</div>
               <div class="l">With such new life &amp; joyaunce filled her heart</div>
               <div class="l">Fear could not enter there;</div>
               <div class="l">For sure, she deemd, her mortal part was oer,</div>
               <div class="l">And she was sailing to the heavenly shore,</div>
               <div class="l">And that angelic form who moved beside</div>
               <div class="l">Was some good Spirit sent to be her guide.</div><br><div class="l">Eye hath not seen nor painters hand pourtrayd</div>
               <div class="l">Form so divine as floats beside the Maid.</div>
               <div class="l">His wings were plumeless from the neck displayd</div>
               <div class="l">Down to the ankle spread their long expanse.</div>
               <div class="l">In colour like the winters moonless sky,</div>
               <div class="l">When all the stars of midnights canopy</div>
               <div class="l">Shine forth, or like the azure deep at noon</div>
               <div class="l">Reflecting back to Heaven a brighter blue.</div>
               <div class="l">Thro the broad membrane branched a pliant bone</div>
               <div class="l">Whose veins like interwoven silver shone,</div>
               <div class="l">Or liker shells of lovelier pearly hue.</div>
               <div class="l">Now with strong stroke he smites the buoyant air.</div>
               <div class="l">Now on still wing expanded shoots along,</div>
               <div class="l">Careering on his rapid way</div>
               <div class="l">Swift as the chariot wheels of Day.</div><br><div class="l">Thro air &amp; sunshine sails the Ship of Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Far far beneath them lies</div>
               <div class="l">The gross &amp; heavy atmosphere of earth</div>
               <div class="l">Below all scope of sight, –</div>
               <div class="l">Kalyal inhales the Swerga-gales</div>
               <div class="l">And every breath infuses new delight. </div>
               <div class="l">And now towards its port the Ship of Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Swift as a falling meteor slopes its flight, –</div>
               <div class="l">Yet gently as the dews of night that gem</div>
               <div class="l">And do not bend the hair-bells slenderest stem.</div>
               <div class="l">Daughter of Earth, Ereenia cried, alight.</div>
               <div class="l">Lo! this thy place of rest,</div>
               <div class="l">Lo! here my my bower of bliss.</div><br><div class="l">He furls his azure wings. – </div>
               <div class="l">The happy Kalyal knew not where to gaze,</div>
               <div class="l">Her eyes in restless pleasure roam,</div>
               <div class="l">Now turnd upon the lovely Glendoveer</div>
               <div class="l">Now on his heavenly home.</div>
               <div class="l">Here rest in peace, Ereenia cried,</div>
               <div class="l">And I will guard thee, feeble as I am, –</div>
               <div class="l">I trust the Rajah shall not harm thee here.</div>
               <div class="l">Kalyal.</div>
               <div class="l">Alas thou fearest him!</div>
               <div class="l">Immortal as thou art thou fearest him! –</div>
               <div class="l">I thought that Death had saved me from his power,</div>
               <div class="l">Not even the dead are safe.</div>
               <div class="l">Ereenia.</div>
               <div class="l">Long years of life &amp; happiness</div>
               <div class="l">O Maiden yet be thine.</div>
               <div class="l">From death I saved thee, from all enemies</div>
               <div class="l">Will save thee while the Swerga is secure.</div>
               <div class="l">Kalyal.</div>
               <div class="l">Not me alone, O gentle Deveta!</div>
               <div class="l">I have a father suffering upon earth,</div>
               <div class="l">A persecuted wretched – poor good man</div>
               <div class="l">For whose strange misery</div>
               <div class="l">There is no human help,</div>
               <div class="l">And none but I dare comfort him</div>
               <div class="l">Beneath Kehama’s curse.</div>
               <div class="l">O gentle Deveta, protect him too!</div><br><div class="l">Ereenia</div>
               <div class="l">Didst thou not say beneath Kehamas curse? –</div>
               <div class="l">Come, – plead thyself to Indra! Words like thine</div>
               <div class="l">May win their way, – revigorate his heart,</div>
               <div class="l">And make him yet put forth his arm &amp; wield</div>
               <div class="l">The thunder, while the thunder is his own.</div><br><div class="l">Then to the garden of the Deity</div>
               <div class="l">Ereenia led the Maid.</div>
               <div class="l">In the mid-garden towered a giant Tree;</div>
               <div class="l">Rock-rooted on a mountain there it grew,</div>
               <div class="l">Reard its unrivalld head on high</div>
               <div class="l">And stretchd a thousand branches oer the sky,</div>
               <div class="l">Drinking with all its leaves celestial dew.</div>
               <div class="l">Adown the mountain-side.</div>
               <div class="l">A thousand torrents pour their glittering tides</div>
               <div class="l">And form an ample lake which spread below. </div>
               <div class="l">That giant Tree the wonderous well</div>
               <div class="l">From whence the torrents flow;</div>
               <div class="l">For still in one perpetual shower,</div>
               <div class="l">From every leaf of all its ample bower,</div>
               <div class="l">Like diamond drops etherial waters fell.</div>
               <div class="l">Forth winding from the Lake below</div>
               <div class="l">A thousand rivers watered Paradise.</div>
               <div class="l">Full to the brink yet never overflowing,</div>
               <div class="l">They coold the amorous gales which, ever blowing,</div>
               <div class="l">Oer their melodious surface loved to stray;</div>
               <div class="l">Then winging back their way,</div>
               <div class="l">Their load of vapour to the Tree convey;</div>
               <div class="l">And ending thus where they began,</div>
               <div class="l">And feeding thus the source from whence they came,</div>
               <div class="l">The eternal rivers of the Swerga ran</div>
               <div class="l">For ever renovate, yet still the same.</div><br><div class="l">On that etherial lake whose waters lie</div>
               <div class="l">Blue &amp; transpicuous, like another sky,</div>
               <div class="l">The Elements had reard their Kings abode.</div>
               <div class="l">A strong controlling power their strife suspended,</div>
               <div class="l">And there their hostile essences they blended</div>
               <div class="l">To form a Palace worthy of the God.</div>
               <div class="l">Built on the Lake, the waters were its floor;</div>
               <div class="l">And here its walls were water archd with fire,</div>
               <div class="l">And here were fire with water vaulted oer,</div>
               <div class="l">And here were lucid cloud with both embraced,</div>
               <div class="l">And here of rainbow interlaced</div>
               <div class="l">With water, cloud &amp; flame.</div>
               <div class="l">And towers &amp; pinnacles of fire</div>
               <div class="l">Round watry cupolas aspire:</div>
               <div class="l">And fiery domes on towers of rainbow rest;</div>
               <div class="l">And roofs of cloud are turreted around</div>
               <div class="l">With flame, &amp; shafts of cloud with flame are bound,</div>
               <div class="l">And domes of water here with cloud are crownd</div>
               <div class="l">And tongues of flame on spires of water quiver.</div>
               <div class="l">Here too the Elements for ever change,</div>
               <div class="l">Fire climbs the watry cupolas, &amp; round</div>
               <div class="l">The courts of cloud meanders like a river;</div>
               <div class="l">The watry cupolas descend</div>
               <div class="l">To bear on liquid walls the cope of fire;</div>
               <div class="l">And clouds roll down the flamy halls to floor,</div>
               <div class="l">And water rises up the rainbow tower</div>
               <div class="l">Pursued in love &amp; thus in love pursuing</div>
               <div class="l">In circulating changes thus they roll,</div>
               <div class="l">For ever here their wondrous work renewing,</div>
               <div class="l">The parts all shifting, still unchanged the whole.</div>
               <div class="l">Even we on earth at intervals descry</div>
               <div class="l">Gleams of the glory, streaks of flowing light,</div>
               <div class="l">Openings of heaven, &amp; streams </div>
               <div class="l">That flow at night along the northern sky.</div><br><div class="l">Impatient of delay Ereenia caught</div>
               <div class="l">The Maid aloft, &amp; spread his wings abroad,</div>
               <div class="l">And bore her to the presence of the God.</div>
               <div class="l">There Indra sate upon his throne reclin’d,</div>
               <div class="l">Where Devetas adore him,</div>
               <div class="l">The lute of Nared warbling in the wind,</div>
               <div class="l">All tones of magic harmony combin’d</div>
               <div class="l">To sooth his troubled mind,</div>
               <div class="l">While the dark-eyed Apsāras danced before him.</div>
               <div class="l">In vain the God Musician playd,</div>
               <div class="l">In vain the dark-eyed Nymphs of Heaven essayd</div>
               <div class="l">To charm him with their beauties in the dance,</div>
               <div class="l">And when he saw the mortal Maid appear,</div>
               <div class="l">Led by the heroic Glendoveer,</div>
               <div class="l">A deeper trouble filld his countenance.</div>
               <div class="l">What hast thou done, Ereenia? – said the God.</div>
               <div class="l">Bringing a mortal here! –</div>
               <div class="l">And while he spake his eye was on the Maid; –</div>
               <div class="l">The look he gave was solemn, not severe; –</div>
               <div class="l">No hope to Kalyal is conveyd,</div>
               <div class="l">And yet it struck no fear;</div>
               <div class="l">There was a sad displeasure in his air,</div>
               <div class="l">But pity too was there.</div><br><div class="l">Ereenia.</div>
               <div class="l">Hear me O Indra! – On the lower earth</div>
               <div class="l">I found this child of man, by what mishap</div>
               <div class="l">I know not, lying in the lap of death.</div>
               <div class="l">Aloft I bore her to our fathers grove,</div>
               <div class="l">Not having other thought than, when the gales</div>
               <div class="l">Of bliss had heald her, upon earth again,</div>
               <div class="l">To leave its lovely daughter. Other thoughts</div>
               <div class="l">Rose, when from Casyapa I learnt her doom,</div>
               <div class="l">For she is one who groans beneath the power</div>
               <div class="l">Of the dread Rajah, terrible alike</div>
               <div class="l">To men &amp; Gods. His son, dead Arvalan,</div>
               <div class="l">Armd with that portion Indra, of thy power</div>
               <div class="l">Already wrested from thee, persecutes</div>
               <div class="l">The Maid, – the helpless one, the innocent.</div>
               <div class="l">What then behoved me but to waft her here</div>
               <div class="l">To my own bower of bliss? – What other choice?</div>
               <div class="l">The accursed spirit of foul Arvalan</div>
               <div class="l">Who rules the lower elements, not yet</div>
               <div class="l">Hath the power to enter here, here thou art yet</div>
               <div class="l">Supreme, &amp; yet the Swerga is thy own.</div>
               <div class="l">Indra.</div>
               <div class="l">No child of man, Ereenia, in the bower</div>
               <div class="l">Of bliss may sojourn, till he hath put off</div>
               <div class="l">His mortal part; for on mortality</div>
               <div class="l">Time &amp; Infirmity &amp; Death attend,</div>
               <div class="l">Close followers they, &amp; in their mournful train</div>
               <div class="l">Sorrow &amp; Pain &amp; Mutability.</div>
               <div class="l">Did they find entrance here, we should behold</div>
               <div class="l">Our joys, like earthly summers, pass away.</div>
               <div class="l">Those joys perchance may pass! another hand</div>
               <div class="l">May seize my sceptre, &amp; unparadise</div>
               <div class="l">The Swerga! … but Ereenia if we fall</div>

               <div class="l">Take me to Earth O gentle Deveta!</div><br><div class="l">Saying thus she knelt &amp; to his knees she clung</div>
               <div class="l">And bowd her head, in tears &amp; silence praying.</div>
               <div class="l">Rising anon around his neck she flung</div>
               <div class="l">Her arms, &amp; there with folded hands she hung,</div>
               <div class="l">And fixing on the guardian Glendoveer</div>
               <div class="l">Her eyes more eloquent than Angels tongue,</div>
               <div class="l">Again she cried, there is no comfort here!</div>
               <div class="l">I must be with my father in his pain; –</div>
               <div class="l">Take me to earth, O Deveta, again!</div><br><div class="l">Indra with admiration heard the Maid,</div>
               <div class="l">O child of earth, he cried,</div>
               <div class="l">Already in thy spirit thus divine,</div>
               <div class="l">Whatever weal or woe betide,</div>
               <div class="l">Be that high sense of duty still thy guide,</div>
               <div class="l">And all good Powers will aid a soul like thine.</div>
               <div class="l">Then turning to Ereenia thus he said –</div>
               <div class="l">Take her where Ganges hath its second birth,</div>
               <div class="l">Below our sphere, &amp; yet above the Earth,</div>
               <div class="l">There may Ladurlad rest beyond the power</div>
