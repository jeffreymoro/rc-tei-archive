            <p>Address: To/ John Rickman Esq<sup>r</sup> <br>Endorsement: RS./ End &lt;Middle&gt; of Ap. 1807.<br> MS: Huntington Library, RS 109<br>Previously published: Kenneth Curry (ed.), <em>New Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 2 vols (London and New York, 1965), I, pp. 448–449.<br>Dating note: Dating from JR’s endorsement; note by E. L. Griggs inserted with MS says
               JR’s letter of 27 April is a reply to this. Also in this letter RS says he is enclosing
               a letter for Lightfoot (‘an old fellow collegian of mine, who now keeps a school &amp;
               is contented with very little’) and this letter is dated 24 April 1807 (see Letter
               1310).</p>

            <p class="indent1">What you have heard of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> is true, he is about to seperate from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">his wife</a>, &amp; as he chuses to do every thing in a way different from the rest of the world,
               is first going with her to visit his relations where however she has long since been
               introduced. The seperation is a good thing, – his habits are so murderous of all domestic
               comfort that I am only surprized <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxxx</span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs C.</a> is not rejoiced at being rid of him. He besots himself with opium, or with spirits,
               till his eyes look like a Turks who is half reduced to idiotcy by the practise – he
               calls up the servants at all hours of the night to prepare food for him, – he does
               in short <span class="strikethrough">every</span> all things <span class="strikethrough">just at the time when it</span> at all times except the proper time, – does nothing which he ought to do, &amp; every
               thing which he ought not. His present scheme is to live with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> – it is from his idolatry of that family that this has begun, – they have always
               humoured him in all his follies, – listened to his complaints of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">his wife</a>, – &amp; when he has complained of the itch, helped him to scratch, instead of covering
               him with brimstone ointment, &amp; shutting him up by himself. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthDorothy">his sister</a> who pride themselves upon having no selfishness, are of all human beings whom I have
               ever known the most intensely selfish. The one thing to which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">W.</a> would sacrifice all others is his own reputation, concerning which his anxiety is
               perfectly childish – like a woman of her beauty: &amp; so he can get <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> to talk his own writings over with him, &amp; critise them &amp; (without amending them)
               teach him how to do it, – to be in fact the very rain &amp; air &amp; sunshine of his intellect,
               he thinks <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> is very well employed &amp; this arrangement a very good one. I myself, as I have told
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a>, think it highly fit that the seperation should take place, but by no means so that
               it should ever have been <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> necessary.</p>

               <p>There were but four books in that catalogue you sent me which I wanted – all the others

                  you see this my Scrap &amp; Omnium) – but there is a tale there of a certain Father Domenick
