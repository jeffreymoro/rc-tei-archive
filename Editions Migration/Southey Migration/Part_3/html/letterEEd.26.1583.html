                  illness which was the more alarming inasmuch as there was great danger of its bringing
                  on premature labour; thank God she is now on the recovery. When I am unhappy (&amp; nothing
                  but such things as this ever can make me so) I employ myself <span class="strikethrough">on</span> more unintermittingly than at any other time, but it must be upon &lt;something&gt; which
                  does not require much more attention than the eye &amp; the hand are sufficient for, –
                  note-making, matters of extract or reference, – anything which will supply constant,
                  but not continuous employment, &amp; which may be broken off &amp; resumed again at any minute.
                  I have no heart for any thing better [MS torn] do not write letters when they cannot
                  be happy ones. – This then is the reason why I have not sooner thanked you for M<sup>r</sup> Mundys Poem. Its merits are his own; – its defect is that of all descriptive poems,
                  – a want of necessary connection between the parts, – one paragraph does not grow
                  out of another, – like some of the scenes in Samson Agonistes

                  class is not to be charged upon the individual. The poem is full of feeling &amp; beauty,

                  what it only pretends to be, originally written to a friend. There is something absurd

                  understand it, &amp; they will not like it. Neither does the tone of humility which is
                  here assumed accord with what is promised, or with my temper. Such however as the
