                  this department &amp; offers for it 400 £ a year, which is certainly very liberal pay.
                  I have however promised only for the first volume, – which will suffice to show him
                  how far my view of things, &amp; my manner of speaking of them may accord with his objects,
                  &amp; also how far it will be compatible with my better pursuits, to undertake so large
                  a portion of trade work. He has applied to me upon very short notice, &amp; I am by no
                  means prepared for the task: it was indeed in other hands, but the sample sent was
                  so thoroughly tame &amp; worthless (I had it sent to me) that he has done wisely to pay
                  for it &amp; cancel it at once. – I am waiting for documents, which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> is slow in sending, &amp; mean time get on with a preliminary view of parties at home,
