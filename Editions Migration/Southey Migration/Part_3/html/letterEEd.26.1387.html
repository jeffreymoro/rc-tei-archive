                  opinions of the Edinburgh Review – both in taste, morals, politics &amp; religion. The
                  question is whether it be worth while in this rascally <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> age of party-feeling to secure good treatment for myself in that quarter, &amp; take care
                  of my friends; – as for the employment in a financial point of view it is likely that
                  my time may be as profitably given to better work. My greatest inclining is to lay
                  every thing else aside &amp; get the Brazilian book forward. The sale of 500 cannot be
                  doubtful. – enough to pay the expense of publication quite certain to be immediate.
                  I mean therefore to print it on my own account, – for which I can, without difficulty,
                  borrow the necessary sum. – there is no reason why the booksellers should share my
                  profits <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> as interest for an advance of money, which is merely nominal, – <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> they paying nothing before they receive.</p>

            <p class="indent1">We have had extraordinary weather here – a deeper snow than has been remembered since
               1767. Three days we were without a post, – on one day only one person came into the
               town. In some places the ro[MS torn] is cut thro drifts seven or eight feet deep [MS
               torn] went out to see this pass thro <span class="strikethrough">banks of snow</span> walls of snow, &amp; very singular it is. Even today after four days gentle thaw, a hundred
               men are employed in opening the road to Penrith, where the stage has been stuck since
               Friday week last: – there the drifts are in some places twenty feet deep. The mountain
               scenery has been fine beyond all powers of pen or pencil to express – at morning when
               the valley was in mist. the heights in sunshine – &amp; blue sky above them, – &amp; &lt;at noon&gt;
               when clouds lay upon their summits, &amp; the sun shone upon the clouds, &amp; the clouds
               &amp; the snow &amp; the sunshine made up one glory.</p>
            <p class="indent1">There is little &lt;doubt&gt; that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> will wish me to meet him in town speedily. His letter I shall get on Saturday or
               Sunday next, &amp; start within three or four days after I receive yours. But I shall
               halt three or four ways on the way.</p>
