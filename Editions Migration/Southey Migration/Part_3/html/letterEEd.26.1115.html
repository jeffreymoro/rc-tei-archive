                           became Lieutenant-governor of Senegambia. His brutality and maladministration culminated
                           in the deaths by flogging of three African corps members, who were punished for mutiny.
                           In 1784, after his return to England, Wall was arrested and charged with murder, but
                           escaped abroad. In 1801 he gave himself up for trial, and having been found guilty
                           was executed on 28 January 1802. Southey recounts these events, and Wall’s public
