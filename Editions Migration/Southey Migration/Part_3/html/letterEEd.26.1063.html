               compass by suspending the needle over a design on which the cardinal points were indicated,
               though modern scholarship doubts Flavio’s existence. Southey found an earlier reference
               in a work attributed to Alfonso X (1221–1284, King of Castile, León and Galicia from
               1252–1284), the <em>Siete Partidas</em> (Seven-Part Code) or <em>Libro de las Leyes</em>, a comprehensive legal code, compiled during his reign. No. 3610 of the sale catalogue
               of Southey’s library was <em>Las Siete Partidas del Sabio Rey Don Alonso el Nono</em> (1789). See Southey to John Rickman, 22 March 1805, Letter 1049.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
