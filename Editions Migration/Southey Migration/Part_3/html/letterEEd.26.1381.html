               &amp; therefore <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx xxxxxxxx</span> it is of all work the slowest. – These must be done before I can stir, – &amp; then –
               I must settle pros &amp; cons in my own mind whether it be absolutely necessary that I
               should take the journey at all. Certain it is that I should collect much matter both
               for the introduction &amp; notes to my forth-coming quarto, – but the materials already
               at hand are more than room can be found for; – &amp; I weigh the misery of travelling,
               the expence, &amp; the loss of time, – &amp; find little to set against them except the pleasure
               of seeing my friends. By the time the campaign of reviewing is done I shall better
