               June 12. the other of no date but marked 3 Extract – by which I understand that you
               have sent off two former ones which have not come to hand. I look very anxiously for

                  or let me do it, &amp; I have good hope that by getting a paper so abominably ministerial
                  on our side, government may be persuaded to give up so iniquitous a measure as that
                  of robbing the sailors to indemnify the merchants. Depend upon it whatever can be
                  done by paragraphs or pamphlets I will set about: &amp; if the ministry will have the
                  money, they shall have their full share of odium into the bargain.

                           and brandy, and the ship Commerce, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers
                           to be allotted a share of the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict,
                           but in this case the prize money was withheld because the ships were captured before
                           war was officially declared. Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share

It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of
               the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict, but in this case the prize
               money was withheld because the ships were captured before war was officially declared.
               Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share reinstated. It was presumably
               Southey’s influence that caused <em>The Courier</em> to publish a paragraph supporting the sailors’ claim to the prize-money on Saturday
               24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <em>The Courier</em> on 31 August 1805 under the title ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
