        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Many thanks to you for your letters &amp; the friendly part you have taken. The business I hope is now in a fair
                    train, for it is by no means likely that such an appointment should have been promised without <ref target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdales</ref> concurrence.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> In July 1809,
                        Southey was informed by <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">Richard Sharp</ref> that the stewardship of the Derwentwater
                        Estates (which were owned by Greenwich Hospital) would soon become vacant on the death of the incumbent. Southey asked several
                        friends to intercede on his behalf, including Senhouse and <ref target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">George Beaumont</ref>,
                        but in the end it was considered unsuitable for him; see Southey to Walter Scott, 8 August 1809 (Letter 1666) and Grosvenor
                        Charles Bedford, 12 August 1809 (Letter 1669).</note> Of course I must go to <ref target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lowther</ref>, &amp; it will be far more pleasant to do so while you are there, than to make my appearance as a stranger. If
                    you hold your intention of going on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, I will follow you by the next days stage.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have just bound myself to this country for better for worse, by taking a lease of these premises for one &amp;
                    twenty years; &#8211; a necessary precaution, because poor <ref target="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Jackson</ref> my Landlord has long
                    been dying by inches, &amp; cannot possibly linger much longer.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If we mean to keep Walcheren &amp; the other Islands when we have taken them,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Walcheren expedition was an unsuccessful British attempt to open another front in the Netherlands in support of the
                        Austrian Empire&#8217;s struggle with France. Approximately 40,000 soldiers with supporting horses and artillery landed at Walcheren
                        on 30 July 1809. There was little fighting but the army sustained heavy losses from sickness, and in December 1809 the rest of
                        the force withdrew.</note> it will lessen the chances of invasion, &amp; be a prouder manifestation of British power than any
                    which we have yet seen. Any thing short of this would be wasting great means that might be well employed elsewhere, but this would
                    be worth doing, because it would be so proud a proof of our strength to the Continent, &amp; so intolerably galling to
                    Bonaparte.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Soults army in their flight before <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Wellesley</ref> had to cross a bridge over a ravine. <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The French general Nicolas
                        Jean-de-Dieu Soult, 1st Duke of Dalmatia (1769&#8211;1851), whose invasion of Portugal in the spring of 1809 was to have been the
                        first step in Napoleon&#8217;s plan to end the Peninsular War. After taking command of the British troops in Portugal in April 1809
                        Wellington advanced on Soult&#8217;s troops at Porto, on 12 May. Their attempts at a defence were in vain, ending in a disorderly
                        retreat from the city and the failure of the second French invasion of Portugal.</note> &#8211; the parapet was low, &amp; when the
                    pursuers came up they found the ravine to the right &amp; left choaked up with men &amp; horses who had been jostled over in their
                    haste. This was communicated to <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">W Scott</ref> by an officer of cavalry who was foremost in
                    the pursuit. Remember us to <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> S</ref> &amp; at <ref target="places.html#Netherhall">Netherhall</ref> &#8211; </p>
