        <p rend="indent1"> The contents of your letter concern me more than they surprize me. I think you have been used ill, &amp; wish you
                    to think so. The displeasure of Miss N.s<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Southey had met Emma Noel (d. 1873), while
                        at the home of <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Charles Lloyd</ref> near <ref target="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</ref>. She was the daughter of Gerard Noel Edwardes, of Exton Park, Rutland (1759&#8211;1838; <title>DNB</title>),
                        who had adopted the surname Noel in 1798, and inherited a baronetcy in 1813 to become the 2nd Baronet Barham. When her family
                        objected to the couple&#8217;s plans to marry, their relationship ended.</note> parents she must have foreseen, &#8211; it was naturally
                    to be expected, &amp; would just as naturally have given way to proper obstinacy on her part. I see nothing that you &lt;can&gt;
                    do &#8211; except by any accident you meet her again, &amp; then you must run away in the first slow waggon. &#8211; You have this for your
                    consolation that what has happened to you, has happened almost without exception to every body before, &#8211; one such disappointment
                    being as regular as the small-pox &#8211; &amp; as impossible to be suffered a second time. It has too this advantage &#8211; that a man
                    marries his second love with sobered expectations &amp; as Goldsmith says not expecting rapture, makes shift to find
                        contentment.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;They lived together for many years in great tranquillity, and not
