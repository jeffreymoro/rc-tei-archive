          <salute>My dear friend,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Inclosed is a draft on <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> for fifty pounds. It is superfluous to
                    accompany it with expressions of thankfulness which never can be satisfactorily expressed; &#8211; &amp; it will be better to proceed
                    with a brief statement of my affairs in the <ref target="places.html#PaternosterRow">Row</ref>, &#8211; where all my property, such as
                    it is is vested.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The system of foregoing immediate profit in expectation of greater ultimate advantage, will I trust soon begin to
                    operate well. It obliged me however (chiefly on account of the ill sale of Madoc, by which I gained only 25 &#163; &#8211;) to have money in
                    advance of Longman. 100 &#163; when I was last in town, 200 &#163; this year. To set against this there is the current edition of
                        Espriella,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated
                            from the Spanish</title> (1807).</note> almost sold, which I estimate at 160 &#8211; writing done in the Athen&#230;um<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Athen&#230;um, A Magazine of Literary and Miscellaneous Information</title>, to which
                        Southey contributed several short pieces in 1807.</note> &#8211; about 30 &#8211;&amp; what the sale of the small edition of Madoc<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The second, duodecimo edition of <title>Madoc</title> (1807).</note> may have produced.
                    I calculate that a second edition of Espriella (the sale of which is <del>not to be</del> almost certain will turn the balance in
                    my favour, &amp; shall then have to look on to the profits of Palmerin<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Palmerin

                        with <ref>Grosvenor Charles Bedford</ref>, and published, to Southey&#8217;s dismay, with numerous errors. The printer was S.
                        Hollingsworth (first name and dates unknown), Crane Court, Fleet Street.</note> I reckon nothing <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> &amp; the Printer between them having utterly ruined the book) &#8211; of
                    the Cid,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s edition of the <title>Chronicle of the Cid</title> (1808).</note> of
                    about 60 &#163; in the next Annual<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Annual Review</title>.</note> &amp; half as
                    much in the Athen&#230;um, as ways &amp; means for the ensuing year. Espriella promises so well, that it seems at present more than
                    likely to float me into fair water.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It appears therefore that the other works which I have to bring forth in the ensuing year may so far be considered
                    as supererogatory, that I have good reason to think their whole profits may be left untouched; that is, that they may be applied
                        <del>to les</del> towards liquidating my debt with you. The first volume of the Brazilian History<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> was published in 1810.</note> will nearly
                    do this, if I print the volume on my own account, &amp; thereby secure the whole profits to myself as I think of doing. 500 copies
                    will produce 300 &#163;. &amp; if I can follow the example of my friend <ref target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</ref>, &amp;
                    dispose of any considerable number of copies myself, I shall save upon them the 27&#189; per cent which the booksellers take away
                    themselves. Upon this I shall consult Clarkson, who is as willing as he is able to <del>xxx</del> befriend me in this matter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Another work which I have in contemplation will be equally profitable, &amp; its sale equally certain, &#8211; that of my
                    travels in Portugal.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey did not produce this projected book; his 1797
                            <title>Letters Written D a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> were, however, reprinted in an expanded form in
                        1808.</note> Upon this I wish to talk with my uncle. I have materials enough for a quarto volume, &#8211; to which I think of adding
                    prints. Some drawings he has, my fellow-traveller <ref target="people.html#SetonBarbara">Miss Seton</ref> has many. This book will
                    cost me little labour. The expence of engraving will stand in the way of my publishing it myself, &#8211; but this also is matter of
                    consideration &amp; consultation, &amp; at any rate this may be calculated upon for 150 &#163;, supposing the booksellers share with
                    me.</p>

                    cannot tell, &#8211; at any rate, it costs me <del>only</del> little time, &amp; that employed in such a way as to be pure relaxation
