        <p rend="indent1"> I have not been to Bath. <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref> was <del>of</del> decidedly of
                    opinion that if I <del>could not</del> called on Sealey, <del>without</del> after the manner in which he had conducted himself
                    towards me at Lisbon, &#8211; it would be too manifestly for the sake of seeing his daughter, &#8211; &amp; this, it appeared to me might lead
                    to something unpleasant to myself, or her, or both. If you recollect that of all <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my
                        Uncles</ref> friends he was the only person who never called upon me during my last residence in Lisbon, you will perceive a
                    marked &amp; purposed incivility, which was doubtless on account of my Jacobinism, &amp; which is not likely to be softened by the
                    present state of affairs between you &amp; him. I have been a good deal vexed at it, for it was very much my wish to have seen my
                    sister elect. <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry married <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMaryHarriet">Mary
                        Sealy</ref>, the daughter of a wealthy Lisbon merchant, Richard Sealy, in 1809.</note> I beg you will explain to her that my
                    non-appearance was occasioned rather by too much attention than by too little, &#8211; the fear I had of occasioning any unpleasant
                    conversation with her father making me <del>relinquish</del> forego what would have been a great gratification.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter followed me from London. <ref target="people.html#AikinArthur">A Aikin</ref> promised me to send your
                    account immediately, &amp; if he had kept that promise you would have received it now a month ago. I saw Pinkerton, &amp; settled
                    with him that you should do any thing from the Spanish or Portugueze that I thought fit, Pinkerton leaving the selection entirely
                    to me. Here will be present employment, but unluckily not present pay, &#8211; for he begins with Europe, &amp; our main materials
                    relate to Africa &amp; America.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry was to provide materials for John Pinkerton

                            in All Parts of the World</title> (1808&#8211;1814).</note> As soon as my books arrive <del>which</del> I shall draw out a
                    catalogue of all the Sp &amp; P. voyages, &amp; send to him, stating what ought to be abstracted. About those books you may have
                    it in your power to make a useful enquiry for me. They sailed a fortnight ago for Newcastle, on board the Carlisle. W. Currie. Do
                    you know any body whom you could desire to look after them, &#8211; that is to learn whether the ship is arrived, &amp; to give orders
                    that the cases (22 in number) be forwarded by waggon according to direction. There is nothing to pay, &amp; no other trouble than
                    making the enquiry at the proper place.</p>

                    speak of it, as something which ought to be translated &amp; published for the use of our Indiamen. When the books arrive &amp;
                    are arranged I will make up a parcel for you of such as are fit for this purpose, &amp; a few others that may help to furnish your

          <ref target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</ref> told me you thought of writing a novel. Do you think you could put a comedy
                    together? I have a story for one which if you can arrange into acts &amp; scenes &amp; <del>put together</del> make up, I would
                    finish off &amp; get presented. The fact is that I have plenty of stories for all sorts of dramas, but dislike the drama too much
                    to get about them, &#8211; tho to make a play would actually be, in my circumstances, to make a fortune. But if you have any disposition
                    that way I will send you <del>my</del> the plans.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Omniana in the Athen&#230;um<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had been contributing miscellaneous
                        pieces of knowledge to John Aikin&#8217;s new journal since its start in 1807. He gathered these as <title>Omniana, or Horae
                            Otiosiores</title> in 1812, adding items by <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>.</note> are
                    mine. With the College Library of Durham at hand can you not supply articles quaint or curious for that collection? &#8211; my intention
                    is when enough have appeared, to arrange them &amp; print them in a volume, with the authorities, notes &amp;c, so as to make a
                    curious book, which is very likely to sell, &amp; of which a volume may be published from time to time, as materials accumulate.
                    Of this you may very easily take your share of the labour &amp; the profit, &amp; if you find matter enough, we can open a similar
                    collection under another name in the Monthly Mirror.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wish I could have sent you some money, but the state of my accounts would not permit it. I talked of you to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Southey</ref>. My <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt
                        Mary</ref> thought it better that I should not directly ask him to help you, but that you should write to him yourself, &#8211;
                    because he is a little hurt that our letters should be to her, &amp; not to him; &#8211; &amp; because he hopes to see his consequence
                    acknowledged. She gave me a shirt for you, which shall form part of the parcel. I was at Taunton four days, &amp; weather bound
                    the whole time. He made me a present of 25 &#163;, &#8211; which was as welcome as it was little expected.</p>
