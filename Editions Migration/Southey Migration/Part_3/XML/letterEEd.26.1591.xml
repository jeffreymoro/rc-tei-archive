          <ref target="people.html#PopleWilliam">The Printer</ref> has sent me a proof <del>xxxx xxxx</del> straight thro the post against
                    all fitness, &amp; I inclose it to you because it belongs to the most amusing chapter in the volume,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Of the first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810).</note> &#8211; if you see any needful
                    amendment make it, &amp; put it unpaid, into the Twopenny Post, directed to <ref target="people.html#PopleWilliam">Mr Pople</ref>
                    &lt;Printer&gt;, Old Boswell Court &#8211; Strand. This &amp; the chapter immediately following, (on which I am now at work) will
                    contain every thing that is known concerning the most numerous of the old Brazilian tribes. As I was about to write to you on the
                    subject of the map I thought it worth while to put the sheet in, not for the sake of franking it (for they all go back under cover
                    to <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> the M P. &#8211; )</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There will be so much to alter &amp; so much to add that I do not think this map ought to serve.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was designing a map of Brazil; the finished map was included in the second volume of his
                            <title>History of Brazil</title> (1817).</note> Do you think it is best to cut off the <del>xxxxx</del> knuckle of the
                    shoulder of mutton, just below the Plata ([MS torn] of which I have no business) for the sake of increasing the scale? &#8211; I will
                    correct as many of these names as I can, &amp; the return of the map, &#8211; <del>thxx xxx</del> that they may be inserted in my
                    outline; &#8211; it will <del>xx</del> be easier then to add the rest. But it must travel to <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>, for his mss. maps will enable him to correct many <del>which</del> more than I can do. &#8211; The different
                    tribes must be marked in their situations &#8211; how will it be best to distinguish them? a + will be the fit mark for a Missionary
                    settlement. Maps of the several Captainships <del>x xxx</del> &lt;had better&gt; not be given, unless I could give
                        <del>xxxxxx</del> all &#8211; &amp; how many <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> has I do not know. If he
                    writes a statistic account of Brazil that will be a fitter place for them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We gain nearly a third by cutting off the knuckle. There is no occasion to fear any thing more than the few
                    principal towns N. &amp; E. of Brazil &amp; Paraguay, &#8211; with the rivers &amp; mountains.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have written to <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> to review the Cid,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> For this letter, see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 28 February 1809, Letter 1590.</note>
                    &#8211; he <del>xx</del> will do it quite as well as it would otherwise be done, &#8211; &amp; as for any points of Spanish information he may
                    apply to his in that respect &#8211; better. &#8211; Do if it be possible let Aaron hunt out Dobrizhoffer,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Aaron Arrowsmith (1750&#8211;1823; <title>DNB</title>), cartographer of Soho Square, London who was to make the map
                        being discussed here; Martin Dobrizhoffer (1717&#8211;1791), <title>Historia de Abiponibus, Equestri, Bellicosaque
                            Paraquari&#230;</title> (1784). Southey eventually owned a copy of this work, no. 843 in the sale catalogue of his library.
                        It was translated by Sara Coleridge (with Southey&#8217;s encouragement), as <title>An Account of the Abipones, an Equestrian People
                            of Paraguay</title> (1822).</note> he says he has corrected many errors on his maps, &#8211; &amp; he is to be believed for the
                    confession which immediately follows &#8211; that very likely; his own may in other points require correction also. But I think he is
                    more to be relied upon than most his brethren, being a far abler man.</p>
