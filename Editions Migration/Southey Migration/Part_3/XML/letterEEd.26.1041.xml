          <salute>Dear Rickman</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am perfectly accurate about the catoptrics. &#8211; see the prose title of the question &#8211; qual es <del>xx</del> mejor
                    espejo para estudiar, plano, concavo, o convexa? &#8211; Espejo is <hi rend="ital">speculum</hi>.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish translates as &#8216;what is the best mirror for studying, flat, concave or convex?&#8217; &#8216;Espejo&#8217; is Spanish for mirror,
                        &#8216;speculum&#8217; Latin.</note> yet <hi rend="ital">antojos</hi>, <hi rend="ital">spectacles</hi>, were used at the same time, &amp;
                    mentioned in the same volume so as not to be mistaken. &#8216;The thing which is smaller appears greater if we see it with spectacles.&#8217;
                    &#8211; I cannot understand the reason <del>xxxx</del> for using these reflecting mirrors. &#8216;They who <del>xxx</del> are accustomed to
                    study &amp; find <hi rend="ital">el molde</hi> hurtful to the sight, recommend them as the best remedy.&#8217; I know no other meaning
                    of <hi rend="ital">molde</hi> than its plain English a <hi rend="ital">mould</hi> or frame; unless it be put shortly for type. <hi rend="ital">libros de molde</hi> being used for printed books. &amp; how these mirrors should be better than spectacles &#8211; when
                    so much more expensive &amp; so troublesome, heaven knows. However the testimony to their use is positive, &amp; a very curious
                    fact it is.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey is continuing the discussion of the origin of spectacles begun in
                        letter 1038 of this edition. He had come upon the reference discussed here while reading Luis de Escobar (d. after 1552),
                            <title>Las Quatro Cientas Respuetas, a Otras Tantas Preguntas, con Quinienfos Proverbios de Consejos y Avisos a Manera de
                            Letania</title> (1550&#8211;1552).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The symptoms in the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edithling</ref> which alarmed me have disappeared.
                    you have good reason <del>xxx</del> to believe that I had not good reason for apprehension, &#8211; but the truth is that there was
                    reasonable ground. <del>xxx</del> If the disease should decidedly manifest itself I mean to adopt a vigorous mode of treatment,
                    &amp; open the jugular vein instead of trifling with leeches. Three children have been saved at Bristol thus. I hope we may have
                    no occasion to try the experiment, &amp; at present the child seems well, &#8211; but the most critical time is yet to come.</p>

                        His play <title>The Honey Moon; A Comedy in Five Acts</title> (1805), was staged posthumously at Drury Lane, to great
                        success.</note> is precisely the contrary of what I should have expected so much better in language &amp; versification, &amp;
                    so much worse in plot. character it has none. but it is a great merit to have ventured to write comedy in blank verse. I knew that
                    poor man would die unless especial care were taken, &amp; told <ref target="people.html#TobinJamesWebbe">his brother</ref> so, &#8211;
                    but people always let consumption steal upon them. he is one of the many men killed by unwholesome study in a great city. Law
                    sends as many men to the grave by this way as it does vi&#226; patibuli<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning &#8216;by way of

                    this gave me a shock &#8211; for tho I had long ceased to esteem him, the remembrance of many happy hours &amp; of many good qualities
                    which were in his nature &amp; of which no follies ever could divest him &#8211; still remained. Is not apoplexy a disorder usually or

                    second hand &#8211; which is nearly as bad for the intellect as it would be for the body to take <del>or</del> our food ready digested
                    by some friendly neighbour. The best thing that could be done for literature would be to hang a few booksellers &amp; whip others
                    at the catstail. prohibit all criticism, burn all reviews, &amp; put most of the reviewers in the pillory &#8211; not all for a very
