        <p rend="indent1"> We are under some uneasiness concerning <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>. he left
					Malta early in September, &amp; from Malta we have heard that he had reached Trieste, charged, as we suppose from his former
					letters, with dispatches overland from Naples. He would be at Vienna not much before the French, but the danger of travelling in a
					country full of soldiers is so great that I am far more alarmed than I think it proper to let <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref> know.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
						Coleridge arrived back in Britain in August 1806.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I felt myself much obliged to you for inserting the articles respecting the Spanish Captures.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1800 or 1801, Daniel Stuart had purchased <title>The Courier</title> newspaper with T. G.
						Street (first names and dates unknown). Although Street was described as the sole editor, Southey used his association with
						Stuart to publicise in <title>The Courier</title> a dispute over remuneration from the capture of enemy ships, which his
						brother, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>, had become involved in. In December 1804 Tom&#8217;s ship, HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi>, had captured the Spanish brig <hi rend="ital">Isabella</hi> and the ship <hi rend="ital">Conception</hi>, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship <hi rend="ital">Commerce</hi>, laden with cotton. Though
						it was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict, this
						case was contested because the ships were captured before Spain had declared war on Britain, on 14 December 1804. Southey took
						up his brother&#8217;s cause to have his share of the prize money reinstated and <title>The Courier</title> published a paragraph supporting the
						sailors&#8217; claim to the prize-money on Saturday 24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in
							<title>The Courier</title> on 31 August 1805 under the title &#8216;Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants&#8217;.</note> There was
					no intention on my part to set the sailors against the service, but to show government that what they were doing had that
					inevitable tendency. The way in which the discussion was stopt fairly deceived me. Had the positive assurance that I was mistaken
					&#8211; &amp; that the Sailors were to have the same share as usual, appeared in any other ministerial paper, I should have been
					suspicious, knowing that it was not an uncommon man&#339;uvre last war in the Anti Jacobine<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine</title>, published between 1798&#8211;1821, was a ministerial paper, funded by
						government.</note> to silence enquiry by a downright falshood. But in this case I expected that if my articles had been
					offensively worded, they would have been softened or suppressed &#8211; &amp; that if you wished them to stop, you would as freely have
					told me so &#8211; as I had applied to you to insert them. However I consider myself much obliged to you &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
