        <p rend="indent1"> Your question concerning the Review would have been sooner answered if it had not been put out of mind by a
                    circumstance which for some time greatly alarmed &amp; distressed me. My <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">little boy</ref>
                    was seized with the croup &#8211; by taking about six ounces of blood from the jugular vein &amp; blistering the throat he has, thank
                    God, been saved.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> One number of the Quarterly Review has appeared. it contains a single article of mine upon the Mission in
                        Bengal,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey reviewed the <title>Periodical Accounts Relative to the Baptist

                    considerable part in it, &amp; I believe all persons concerned would fain have me do so, &#8211; but I am afraid it will not be long
                    before their politicks compel me to withdraw. As long as they support the Spanish cause &amp; the war against Bonaparte I will go
                    on with them, &#8211; the Whigs too they may abuse to their hearts content &amp; I shall say amen tho they go thro all the curses in

                        the Commander of the British forces in northern Spain also to do so, despite Moore&#8217;s inclination to retreat through Portugal.
                        After the disastrous retreat to Corunna, Frere was blamed for this advice and recalled by the British government. Some of
