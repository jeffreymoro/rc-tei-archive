          <salute>My dear Edith</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> After writing my last hasty epistolet, I set off with <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Mary Cray.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> A village to the southeast of London; home of <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Peter Elmsley</ref>.</note> We were told it was twelve miles distant, so we walked,
                    while his servant went by the stage like a gentleman, &amp; carried what little luggage we wanted. In spite of a severe east wind
                    blowing always either in our teeth or our ears, &amp; of occasional show showers we had on the whole a pleasant walk. The view of
                    Greenwich &amp; Maize Hill <del>which</del> on our left was exceedingly striking, &#8211; masts &amp; towers, &#8211; houses &amp; gravel
                    clifts, &#8211; there wanted only <del>ver</del> summer verdure for the gardens &amp; trees, &amp; sunshine which would have made an
                    incumbent atmosphere of smoke beautiful. We very soon got into an unfrequented road, where even fewer travellers were to be met
                    than I have seen between <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> &amp; <ref target="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</ref>, when the laking season is over, &amp; the country left to its own inhabitants. From time to time we had fine
                    rich, woody inland views, &#8211; of that character which is peculiar to Kent. There is a greater appearance of general comfort in this
                    county than in any other, &#8211; the cause is probably to be found in the old <del>xxxxx</del> british law of gavel-kind,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> System of land tenure that is particularly associated with Kent.</note> which is retained here
                    &amp; here only, &amp; which has necessarily prevented the formation of great estates, &amp; (what <del>would</del> might not have
                    been so much expected) has also preservd old families in the possession of small but independant estates. Hence there is less
                    riches, less poverty, more industry &amp; more comfort.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The distance proved to be 15 miles instead of 12. The last three, we complained of as an imposition, &amp;
                        <del>but</del> like other impositions we would not have submitted to it, &#8211; if it could have been helped. <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> has got into a comfortable old house, built about a hundred years ago. His
                    garden communicates with the church yard, &amp; the river Cray flows thro it, immediately under the dining room window. That river
                    would be very beautiful if it were not bricked up with formal banks, &amp; its bed defiled with the filth of the village,
                    potshards, a dead dog or two &#8211; <del>all xxxxx</del> no ornaments to a stream of clear water which is nowhere above three feet
                    deep. When the weather is warm enough <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> means to send in boys to clean it,
                    &amp; then to keep it clean by a grating where it enters his premises, small enough to stop such nuisances, &amp; not so small as
                    to shut out the fine trout, which at present look as if they had no business in so denaturalized a brook,. There are paper mills
                    just above &amp; below, &#8211; near enough to be heard, but not unpleasantly. He has two nephews &amp; two nieces with their mother,
                    living with him, &amp; I believe wholly dependant on him. The eldest is a boy of eight years, the youngest a girl of four, &#8211; fine,
                    good-humoured children, always disposed to laugh &amp; romp, &#8211; but without the least shyness at the sight of strangers.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The post &#8211; &amp; your letter. &#8211; I have escaped some uneasiness by being out of the way during <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Ediths</ref> feverish attack, &#8211; &amp; yet I wish I had been there to have <del>xx</del>
                    eased you of some part of the nights trouble. How is it that you have not mentioned the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEmma">little one</ref>
          <del> in</del>? &#8211; not a word concerning her!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have written to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Taunton</ref> &amp; expect an answer every day. On Monday
                    next I leave town &#8211; reach <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> this day week, stay with him Wednesday, &amp; if it be
                    possible shall go to Sir Ch. Mallets<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir Charles Warre Malet, 1st Baronet (1753&#8211;1815;
                            <title>DNB</title>), of Wilbury Wiltshire, a retired East India Company servant.</note> on the Thursday, but that will
                    depend on the situation &amp; accessability of his house. Your next must be directed to Taunton, &#8211; unless you will write me a line
                    by Fridays post, which will reach me on the morning of my departure. The whole of my business is nearly compleated &#8211; I have not
