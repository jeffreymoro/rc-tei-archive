        <p rend="indent1"> An odd coincidence has occurred <del>here</del> in this neighbourhood. a day labourer who works for <ref target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</ref> the friend of the Negros came the other day to a friend of his masters
                    &amp; askd him if he <del>knew</del> had heard of Addison who wrote the Spectator.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Joseph

                    perhaps you do not know that my name is Addison. he was my grandfathers brother &#8211; &amp; we have always understood that by his will

                    her life, &amp; afterwards to revert to his heirs at law. she is lately dead &#8211; &amp; the property is gone to the Warwick
                        family<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1716, Addison married Charlotte Rich, n&#233;e Myddleton, Countess of Warwick
                        (bap. 1680&#8211;1731) to whose son, Edward Rich (b. 1698) he had been tutor. Rich, who became the 7th Earl of Warwick on reaching
                        his majority, died in 1721 aged twenty three, supposedly worn out by the excesses of a rake&#8217;s way of life.</note> &#8211; but &#8216;I am
                    Addisons heir at law. &#8211; the man then requested Luff<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Captain Charles Luff (d. 1815): a

                    dream that a question should now arise concerning Addisons will!</p>
