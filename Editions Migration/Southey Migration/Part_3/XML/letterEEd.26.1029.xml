                    upon a boy, upon whom four pence would have been thrown away if given in any other shape than that of a halter. &#8211; I have written

                    regular as I am, &amp; we are doing all in our power to secure regular returns from Herefordshire. What trouble I take in these
                    affairs is wholly on your account as I receive nothing from my Uncle myself. Things unless we very much deceive
