          <salute>My dear Rickman</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I can wish you nothing better than that your life may be as long, your age as hale &amp; your death as easy as your
                    fathers. The death of a parent is a more awful sorrow than that of a child, &#8211; but <del>x</del> a less painful <del>x</del> one, &#8211;
                    it is in the inevitable order &amp; right course of nature that ripe fruit should fall; &#8211; it seems like one of its mishaps when
                    the green bud is cut off. In the outward &amp; visible system of things nothing is wasted, &#8211; it would &lt;therefore&gt; be belying
                    the whole system to believe that intellect &amp; love, &#8211; which are of all things the best, could perish. I have a strong &amp;
                    lively faith in a state of continued consciousness from this stage of existence, &#8211; &amp; that we shall recover the consciousness
                    of some lower stages thro which we may previously &lt;have&gt; past seems to me not improbable. The supposition serves for dreams
                    &amp; systems, &#8211; the belief is a possession more precious than any other. I love life, &amp; can thoroughly enjoy it, &#8211; but if to
                    exist were but a lifehold property, I am doubtful whether I should think the lease worth holding. It would be better never to have
                    been than ever to cease to be.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Still I shall hope for your coming. You would at any rate have been inconveniently late for the Highlands, for
                    which as near Midsummer as possible is the best season. September is the best for this country.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been made to do what has proved to be a foolish thing. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter
                        Scott</ref> wrote to me to say that <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> had a great wish to serve me, &amp;
                    that he Scott had been commissioned by him to find out in what manner it might be done conformably to my inclinations. <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharp</ref> was here at the time, &#8211; I told him of this &amp; he advised me to ask for the
                    Stewardship of the Derwentwater Estates which will soon be vacated by death. Upon this I wrote to Scott &amp; also to <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> For these, see Southey to Walter Scott,
                        6 July 1809 (Letter 1648) and Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 8 July 1809 (Letter 1651).</note> &#8211; both agreed that it
                    would be the best thing possible for me, &amp; both advised me as a sine qu&#226; non<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning
                        &#8216;an essential element&#8217;.</note> to make interest for <ref target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdales</ref> countenance.
                    Behold me thus place-hunting in regular form. I got <ref target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir George Beaumont</ref> to write
                    to L Lonsdale. &#8211; my friend <ref target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Humphrey Senhouse</ref> (who has election weight with him)
                    did the same,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> For Southey&#8217;s letters to Beaumont and Senhouse, see Southey to Sir George
                        Beaumont, 17 July 1809 (Letter 1656) and Southey to Humphrey Senhouse, 25 July 1809 (Letter 1659).</note> &#8211; &amp; that
                    positi[MS torn] was effectually secured. He promised every thing, &amp; instructed Sir George to write to Lord Mulgrave<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The politician Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave (1755&#8211;1831; <title>DNB</title>), First Lord of
                        the Admiralty 1807&#8211;1810.</note> in whose gift it lies. Lo &amp; behold I had proceeded upon the opinion of the equal
                    eligibility of all men to all offices under our happy form of Government, &#8211; which custom should seem in that respect to have been
                    framed upon the system of M. Helvetius.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The French philosopher and writer, Claude Adrien
                        Helv&#233;tius (1715&#8211;1771), who espoused the natural equality of all men in all nations, though he applied this particularly to
                        intelligence, or &#8216;disposition for understanding&#8217;.</note> But it turns out that this place requires great practical knowledge
                    &amp; very hard work, &amp; so there is an end of the business. But all this produced an invitation to Lowther Castle couched in
                    such a manner that I could not well avoid going, &#8211; &amp; there I went &#8211; slept two nights, walked over his grounds with one of his
                    daughters for my guide &amp; came back yesterday.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The shortest way here is by the Carlisle mail, <hi rend="ital">not</hi> that which goes through Manchester by which

                    at Manchester, &#8211; but that which takes the Newark &amp; Greta Bridge road &amp; sets off from the Bull &amp; Mouth. You take your
                    place for Penrith, 17 miles distant from hence.</p>
