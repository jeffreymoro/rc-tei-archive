        <p rend="indent1"> An Irishman who was abroad came in one day &amp; said that he had seen that morning what he had never seen before,
                    &#8211; a fine crop of anchovies growing in the garden. Anchovies? said an Englishman, with a half laugh &amp; a tone of wonder. And
                    from this the other according to the legitimate rules of Irish logic, deduced a quarrel, a challenge, &amp; a duel in which the
                    poor Englishman, who did not believe that anchovies grew in the garden, was killed on the spot. The moment <del>xx</del> he fell,
                    the right word came into the challengers head &#8211; Och! what a pity! he cried, &#8211; by Jasus, &amp; I meant capers all the while! &#8211; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Spence knew the parties, &amp; told this story the other day at Calverts,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Calvert (1771&#8211;1829; <title>DNB</title>), who was at school with Wordsworth at Hawkshead, where he
                        later became the schoolmaster. On the death of his father, Calvert became a man of independent means, inheriting, with other
                        property, the estate of Bowness on the east shore of Bassenthwaite, near Keswick, where he lived with his family.</note> from
                    whence it travelled to me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> is not yet come, I have been daily expecting a letter to say that he is on the
                    road. He comes unfortunately late, for winter has begun full six weeks before its usual time, &amp; if it continues as cold as it
                    now is, we shall have no more boating this season. &#8211; Miss Wood<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Isabella Wood (dates
                        unknown), cousin of <ref target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Humphrey Senhouse</ref>.</note> is going to Bristol, to spend

                    &amp; of all possible modes of getting there she has fixed upon going by sea to Chepstow &#8211; a precious voyage at this time of year! </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am expecting a parcel as eagerly as you can be, for the Cid<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s
                        edition of the <title>Chronicle of the Cid</title> (1808).</note> has not reached me yet. To day it should have come, &amp; I
                    have been groaning over my disappointment. &#8211; What think you was announced the other day in the <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> play-bill? &#8211; &#8216;a tale in verse by R. Sou<hi rend="ital">thy</hi> Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &#8211; to be recited by

                        Inn,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Mary, the Maid of the Inn&#8217;, written in 1796 and published by Southey in
                            <title>Poems</title> (1797), in <title>The Oracle</title>, 11 February 1797 and, revised, in later editions of the 1797
                            <title>Poems</title>, in <title>Minor Poems</title> (1815 and 1823) and in <title>Poetical Works Collected by
                            Himself</title> (1837&#8211;1838). It was still being issued as a one penny broadside ballad in the mid-nineteenth
                        century.</note> which is right worthy of such recitation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It <del>has just</del> occurred to me last night, I know not how, &#8211; that I have never (to the best of my
                    recollection) seen one of the large house snails in this country, &amp; very few indeed of the smaller kind which are so numerous,
                    &amp; of such beautiful varieties in our part of the kingdom. &#8211; You know what a collector of snail-shells I was in my time, &#8211;
                    hoarding up all the empty ones I could find, &#8211; the rocks used to be my hunting-places. That amusement has made me familiar with
                    every variety in that neighbourhood, &amp; certain I am that the greater number are not to be found here. Slugs we have in plenty.
