        <p rend="indent1"> I have received two letters from you, both at once &amp; by ship to Liverpool. One of June 12. the other of no date
                    but marked 3 Extract &#8211; by which I understand that you have sent off two former ones which have not come to hand. I look very
                    anxiously for them, &#8211; for this is full of interesting information. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your news about the prize money is truly vexatious. but the matter must not be quietly given up. I am taking
                    measures to get the subject into the Courier &#8211; if <ref target="people.html#StuartDaniel">Stuart</ref> be not sold body &amp; soul
                    to the Devil. most likely he will take the matter up there, or let me do it, &amp; I have good hope that by getting a paper so
                    abominably ministerial on our side, government may be persuaded to give up so iniquitous a measure as that of robbing the sailors
                    to indemnify the merchants. Depend upon it whatever can be done by paragraphs or pamphlets I will set about: &amp; if the ministry
                    will have the money, they shall have their full share of odium into the bargain.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> In
                        December 1804, the naval ship HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi>, of which Thomas Southey was a lieutenant, had captured the
                        Spanish brig <hi rend="ital">Isabella</hi> and the ship <hi rend="ital">Conception</hi>, both laden with wine and brandy, and
                        the ship <hi rend="ital">Commerce</hi>, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the
                        value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict, but in this case the prize money was withheld because the ships were
                        captured before war was officially declared. Southey took up his brother&#8217;s cause to have his share reinstated. It was presumably Southey&#8217;s influence that caused <title>The Courier</title>
                        to publish a paragraph supporting the sailors&#8217; claim to the prize-money on Saturday 24 August 1805. This was followed by a
                        longer defence of their position in <title>The Courier</title> on 31 August 1805 under the title &#8216;Indemnification to the
                        Spanish Merchants&#8217;.</note>

                        a few exceptions written by Taylor, including a review of Southey&#8217;s <title>Madoc</title> (1805). This appeared in the

                    been sold, which is much for a book of so heavy a price. I am already thinking of the alterations for a second edition, &amp; mean
                    to alter the catastrophe. At present the interest is in the last book transferred from Madoc to Yuhidthiton, a great &amp;
                    grievous fault; this I shall try to amend.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poem ends with Yuhidthiton, the remaining
                        leader of the defeated and chastened Aztecas, leading his people into exile, rather than with Madoc, the Welsh colonist,
                        presiding over a new American civilisation. This was not altered. On the history of the poem&#8217;s drafting and revision, see the
