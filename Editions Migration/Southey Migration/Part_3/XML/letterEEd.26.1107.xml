          <salute>Dear Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have just received a very flattering letter from Ld Carysfort.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> John
                        Joshua Proby, 1st Earl of Carysfort (1751&#8211;1828; <title>DNB</title>): judge, diplomat, Whig politician and poet, who was the
                        author of <title>Dramatic and Narrative Poems</title> (1810). He was a fellow pupil of Southey&#8217;s at Westminster School.</note>
                    when he comes to <ref target="places.html#Wynnstay">Wynnstay</ref> have the goodness to say how much I am gratified by his praise,
                    &amp; how gladly I expect his promised animadversions.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What think you of these meditated alterations in Madoc? &#8211; to try the Hirlas &amp; the other songs in lyrical
                        measures.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> See <title>Madoc</title> (1805), Part 1, &#8216;Madoc in Wales&#8217;, Book 2, lines
                        142&#8211;167; Book 10, lines 42&#8211;110; Book 11, lines 98&#8211;160. The alterations were not made.</note> to alter that attack upon the

            <title>Madoc</title> (1805), Part 2, Book 16.</note> &#8211; which is the worst part of
                    the <del>xxxxxx</del> poem &amp; make Erillyab put Amalahta to death with her own hand &#8211; or order his death.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Erillyab, Queen of the Hoaman tribe in <title>Madoc</title> (1805); Amalahta, her son, disloyal
                        to her. The alterations were not made.</note> lastly to rewrite the two concluding sections at any rate, &amp; insert some new
                    catastrophe, to be produced by the agency of Madoc himself &amp; not by a providential interference. At present the interest is
                    transferred to Yuhidthiton, which is a great &amp; grievous fault. Moreover &#8211; shall I or shall I not sprinkle the poem with
                        similies?<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poem ends with Yuhidthiton, the remaining leader of the defeated and
                        chastened Aztecas, leading his people into exile, rather than with Madoc, the Welsh colonist, presiding over a new American
                        civilisation. These alterations were not incorporated. For an account of <title>Madoc</title>&#8217;s publication history, see the
                        editor&#8217;s introduction to <title>Robert Southey: Poetical Works 1793&#8211;1810</title>, gen. ed. Lynda Pratt, 5 vols (London, 2004),

                    thing is left to invention. I have a dim sort of second sight of some dramatic situations. Emma&#8217;s character may be made striking,
                    &amp; in some degree original &#8211; as a woman bound to her husband by no tie but duty, but acknowledging the whole force of that tie.
                    the historical facts you know &#8211; that David &amp; his son by Emma many years after Llewelyn had recovered Mona<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The isle of Anglesey.</note> were slain by him in battle.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Dafydd (in English, David) (d. 1203; <title>DNB</title>), was the son of Owen Gwynedd (1100&#8211;1170, Prince of Gwynedd 1137&#8211;1170;
                            <title>DNB</title>). At Owain&#8217;s death, the territory of Gwynedd was divided between several of the brothers; Dafydd
                        gradually brought it all under his rule. When the sons of Henry II (1133&#8211;1189; King of England 1154&#8211;1189; <title>DNB</title>)
                        went to war against their father, Dafydd supported Henry, which was probably the reason for his marriage in 1174 to the
                        English king&#8217;s illegitimate half-sister Emma of Anjou (b. c. 1138). Dafydd was imprisoned by Llewelyn in 1197 and then driven
                        out by him in 1203, dying in the same year. His son, Owain (d. 1212; <title>DNB</title>) was also overthrown by
