        <p rend="indent1"> I am desired by <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> to send you this sonnet, &amp; to add
                    how mortified he is that he has not been able to translate any more.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> After Duppa&#8217;s visit
                        to the Lakes in the summer of 1804, both Wordsworth and Southey translated poems for Duppa&#8217;s <title>Life and Works of Michel
                            Angelo Buonarroti, with his Poetry and Letters</title>, which was published in 1806. Wordsworth translated one sonnet;
                        Southey three sonnets and a madrigal. A further poem, &#8216;And sweet it is to see in summer time&#8217;, was a joint effort, the first
                        four stanzas by Wordsworth, the following five by Southey. See Kenneth Curry, &#8216;Uncollected Translations of Michelangelo by
                        Wordsworth and Southey&#8217;, <title>Review of English Studies</title>, 14 (1938), 193&#8211;199.</note> that the originals are
                    exceedingly difficult you need not be told, but you do not know how difficultly <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> can satisfy himself. This which he has done is in my judgement, a fine poem &#8211;</p>

                    will do my best once more. the Epitaph will be better omitted altogether, &#8211; for it has little but what is commonplace, &amp; is
                    moreover badly versified. Sonnet V has in it something of Michel Angelos<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Michelangelo di
                        Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni [Michelangelo] (1475&#8211;1564), Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, poet, and
                        engineer.</note> mind, &#8211; that aspiration after the permanent &amp; imperishable which breathes thro his poems: the word <hi rend="ital">heavenly</hi> cannot <del>with</del> be substituted for <hi rend="ital">beauteous</hi>, because a word is
                    necessary which should imply something mortal &amp; perishable. lovely may be substitute &#8211; but this would be alteration without
                    amendment.</p>

                        date&#8217;.</note> I always calculated upon possible disappointments, &#8211; &amp; one has taken place which of all others was the least
                    to be expected or foreseen. To indemnify the Merchants whose property has been confiscated in Spain, Government has thought proper
                    to apply all the Spanish prizes taken before a particular day. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brothers</ref> were taken

It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and
