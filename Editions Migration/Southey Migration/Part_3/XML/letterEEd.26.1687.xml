          <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Freres</ref> defence has been performed by <ref target="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis</ref>, with what success or ability I do not yet know, for the number has not reached me. Had I undertaken it I should
                    have shown that the Ambassador had the spirit &amp; feeling of an Englishman both of which were wanting in the General, who was
                    cowed by the reputation of the French Generals &amp; ran away from them. I should think that it would have been better for an
                    English army to have been cut to pieces than so to have effected its escape, &#8211; that either with Blake in Biscay or at
                        Somosierra,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lieutenant General Joaqu&#237;n Blake y Joyes (1759&#8211;1827), a Spanish army
                        officer in command of the army of Galicia and renowned for his determined resistance to superior French numbers. Somosierra is
                        a mountain pass near Madrid which the Spanish army had unsuccessfully defended against Napoleon in 1808. Until the end of that
                        year, Madrid itself was holding out against the French, after a popular rebellion had expelled them from the city, when Moore
                        decided to retreat through the mountains rather than fight there.</note> or under the walls of Madrid, such an army might have
                    turned the whole current of fortune, have saved Spain, &amp; delivered Europe.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is a want of talent in the Junta,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish Supreme Central Junta,
                    whose unwillingness to organise supplies for the British Army while urging a policy of attack, led <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Wellesley</ref> (and Southey) to
                        suspect some of the Junta of co-operating with the French.</note> but no want of patriotism in the people. It angers me when
                    people who take their politics from the Scotch Review<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Quarterly</title>&#8217;s
                        political and literary rival, the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>.</note> or the Morning Chronicle,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A newspaper founded in 1769, which under its current owner and editor, James Perry (1756&#8211;1821;<title>
                            DNB</title>) had established a Whig political standing, with contributions from radical authors who were critical of the
                        government.</note> or <ref target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref>, depreciate the Spaniards, &#8211; it grieves me that
                    you should do so, after the proofs afforded by Zaragoza &amp; Gerona<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish city of
                        Zaragoza had been besieged in 1808 and 1809, when it fell to the French after a heroic defence was broken by an outbreak of
                        disease. For Southey&#8217;s accounts of the sieges, see <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 306&#8211;321;
                        and <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 508&#8211;527. The Spanish city of Gerona had been under siege
                        by the French since 6 May 1809. After nearly seven months it finally fell on 11 December 1809.</note> &amp; the spirits
                    displayed in Galicia from the moment in which their routed allies left them to carry on the war in their own way.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The dispersed army of Galicia was effective as guerrilla forces harassing French supply
                        lines.</note> &#8211; I expect to see last winters tragedy again represented, except that <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Ld Wellington</ref> will preserve his credit &amp; that of the English name.
                    Bonaparte will probably again over run the country but he will never keep it. A nation that has carried on a war of seven
                    centuries against one invader will never rest till it has thrown off this yoke also. Doubtless they have much to endure, &#8211; no
                    nation owes so heavy a debt to divine vengeance. There is retribution to be exacted for the Jews, for the American Indians, for
                    the Dutch.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Referring to Spain&#8217;s bloody history: its expulsion of the Jews of 1492,
                        slaughter of South American Indians over a three hundred year period, and sixteenth-century wars on the Netherlands.</note> It
                    is in the righteous &amp; natural order of things that the sins of the father should &lt;thus&gt; be visited upon the children.
