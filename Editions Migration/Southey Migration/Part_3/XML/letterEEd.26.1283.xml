          <salute>My dear Madam</salute>

        <p rend="indent1"> You attribute more weight among the Booksellers to my recommendation than it possesses. It might be of some avail
                    if they referred a manuscript to me, <del>xxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx</del> but it is of none in
                    introducing a work to them, for this reason &#8211; that they regard subject as the main thing, &amp; consider themselves as the best
                    judges of that, which probably they are. If the subject be likely to succeed among other winter fashions, then they think about
                    the execution, &amp; refer it to some professor of criticism which in contradistinction to cobbling, may be called the ungentle
                    craft.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should conceive your subject a good one, but that the booksellers would object to the proposed extent of the
                    work, &amp; that you would be far more likely to obtain a purchaser for three volumes than for six.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will peruse your MSS. with great pleasure, &amp; return it with such remarks as may occur upon perusal. Mess<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
          <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> &amp; Co are the only publishers with whom I am acquainted; &#8211; to them I will
                    mention the book &#8211; if you still think such mention can be of use; &#8211; but the truth is that they find my own books so little
                    successful in point of sale, that tho my opinion might induce them to think <del>I</del> well of a published work, it is by no
                    means likely to induce them to publish one.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The history of our manners from the accession of the Stuarts, is I fear only to be collected from scattered
                    authorities. Just at that point you will find a very interesting document at the end of Stowes Chronicle,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Stow (c. 1525&#8211;1605; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Annales, or a Generale Chronicle of England from Brute

                        to 26 March 1605, or within ten days of his death; further updated editions were published in 1615 and 1631.</note> containing
                    all his recollections of the changes which had taken place. A continuation of Wartons History of Poetry<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Warton (1728&#8211;1790; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of English Poetry, from the Close of the

                    announced which will probably give you all the light you want respecting the literature. But for morals, fashions &amp; domestic
