                    most comfortless might have been added, if it were not an ungrateful word to employ upon a glad occasion. Here are all my books

                        Having decided to remain at <ref target="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</ref> the previous year, Southey had been steadily
                        arranging for his books, which had been stored by friends in London and the West Country, to be collected together.</note>
                    Henry Pooley<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry (or Harry) Pooley was a Keswick carpenter, but no further information

                        his more dilapidated books &#8216;ducks&#8217;.</note> The parchmentarians have all been rubbed &amp; scrubbed, &amp; a good number of
                    them have taken their seats on the brackets.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> That is, Southey&#8217;s valuable manuscripts,
                        stored on shelves bracketed to the wall.</note> One set of six folios is lettered in gold upon bister as thus </p>

                        built bookcases for him and bound his books. It may also be a pun based on Friar Juniper, disciple of St Francis, who cut the
