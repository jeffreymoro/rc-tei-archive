                    enough that he had little influence in that quarter.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> In July 1809, Southey was informed by

                        owned by Greenwich Hospital) would soon become vacant on the death of the incumbent. Southey asked several friends to

                        Southey to Walter Scott, 8 August 1809 (Letter 1666) and Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 12 August 1809 (Letter

                    I am hopeless, for if he could have done it &amp; wished to have done it, I think he would not have waited for me to solicit him.
                    However I will write to him, at the risk of being set down in his opinion for an Asker, &#8211; a name, be it known with you, if you do
                    not already know it, by which the professional beggars designate themselves. &#8211; <del>x</del> My own prospects seem to be at an end.

                        1804. From 1802&#8211;1805 Melville&#8217;s use of public funds when Treasurer of the Admiralty (1782&#8211;1800), was investigated by a Royal
                        Commission. When the Commission reported, Melville was censured in the House of Commons for allowing public funds to be
                        diverted to private accounts. He resigned and impeachment proceedings were commenced against him. Though the proceedings
                        failed, he never held office again.</note> I wish for it for this reason among others &#8211; that being an honorary distinction it

        <p rend="indent1"> My main fear in this wretched state of political affairs is that the miserable ministry who may be patched up will
                    make <del>xxx</del> peace for the sake of six months popularity, &#8211; &amp; this I am afraid any set of men who might succeed them

                    downright insanity or pure folly.
