                        of romances about the deeds and desires of Palmerin d&#8217;Oliva, emperor of Constantinople, and his descendants comprised eight
                        books, dating from the early sixteenth century. <title>Palmendos</title> was one of these. It was translated as <title>The

                            (<title>Amadis of Gaul</title>). Garci Rodr&#237;guez de Montalvo (c.1450&#8211;1504), arranged the first three books in the series,
                        which were written by an unknown fourteenth-century writer. Montalvo added a fourth book written by himself, as well as a
                        sequel to it, <title>Las Sergas de Esplandi&#225;n</title> (<title>The Exploits of Esplandi&#225;n</title>), the fifth book in the
                        series (1510) in which he gives an account of the life of Amadis&#8217;s son. The saga was continued in further books by other
                        authors, several of which were written by Feliciano de Silva (1491&#8211;1554), including <title>Amadis de Grecia</title>
                            (<title>Amadis of Greece</title>), published in 1530.</note>

                    expedient to do. A. Mundays version is very nearly, if not quite, as long again as the Portugueze,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Portuguese version of this text was written by Francisco de Moraes Cabral (1500&#8211;1572) and entitled

                            Palmerin of England</title> (1547). Anthony Munday (bap. 1560&#8211;1633; <title>DNB</title>), playwright and translator,
                        published an English version of the Portuguese text, entitled <title>The First and Second Parts, of the No Lesse Rare, Historie of

                    produced by any alteration of story of introduction of adventure, it is always for the worse. Old Antony himself, &amp; probably
                    the Frenchman whom he followed as well, had never read the preceding Romances of the series when he translated this, &amp; has
                    therefore very frequently misunderstood the allusions to them &amp; introduced nonsense. The costume is rather omitted than
                    altered, &amp; the dialogue (which is what Cervantes particularly praised<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> In Miguel de

                        excellent; and secondly, because it is said to have been composed by an ingenious king of Portugal&#8217; (I, p. 46).</note> &#8211; or

            <title>Primaleon</title>,

                        in 1516. It was translated from the French by Munday, between 1595 and 1619. Its popularity can be established from the fact
