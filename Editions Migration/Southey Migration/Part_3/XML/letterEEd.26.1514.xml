        <p rend="indent1"> Your parcel arrived yesterday afternoon &amp; I have gone thro the papers. I did not before comprehend the precise
                    nature of what you were doing, &#8211; of the utility of this there can be no doubt, &amp; the sale of it is a calculable thing: as no
                    ship will trade to Brazil without it.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Hill was compiling his anonymously authored
                            <title>Brazil Pilot</title> to assist ships trading to Brazil.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It seems to me worthy of consideration whether the original should not be printed on the opposite page to the
                    translation, &#8211; many copies would then sell among the Portugueze. <del>But the xxxx xx would be when if</del> At any rate I will
                    add in every instance the original names of places wherever you happen to have omitted them. &#8211; You write <hi rend="ital">mangues</hi> the common mode is mangoes, <del>&amp; seems to</del> in that shape the word seems to be naturalized.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> vindo de mar en fore: I should take to be, &#8216;coming from the sea, outward-bound,&#8217; &#8211; the better way would be to ask
                    some Portugueze captain in London, as the difference is of consequence. It is precisely in the common phraseology of the language
                    that my knowledge is deficient; &#8211; their antiquated tongue I probably understand as well as the P. themselves.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My first volume<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey is referring to his <title>History of
                            Brazil</title>, the first volume of which was published in 1810.</note> will end either with the Acclamation,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The acclamation in 1640 of Joam IV (1603&#8211;1656), as King of Portugal and the Algarves.</note> or
                    the final expulsion of the Dutch, as may best suit the size of the book: a weeks work will bring me to the first period whenever
                    my idle season ends. The next chapter to what you have contains whatever more is to be said of the Tupinambas,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The powerful Indian nation which dominated the coast of Brazil.</note> introduced when the
                    Jesuits first begin their dealing with them. The book may go to press whenever the price of paper makes it expedient.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I hope the Cid is published.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s edition of the <title>Chronicle of
                            the Cid</title> (1808).</note> &#8211; Thalaba is at last sold off, &amp; with a quickened pace: the <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Long Man of the Row</ref> recommends a second edition with as little delay as may be, &amp;
