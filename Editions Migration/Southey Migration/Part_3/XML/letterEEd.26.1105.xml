                    look there for curiosity to satisfy yourself you will find the said poem praised &#8211; or in modern language puffed in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 658 &amp; 660. The volume is now open before me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You may print 440 pages without preface &#8211; but you had better look over your list &amp; calculate, that our volumes

                        movement that developed from the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688&#8211;1772), a Swedish scientist and theologian, who claimed
                        to have received a new revelation from Jesus Christ. In 1788 his followers styled themselves &#8216;The New Church&#8217;. Southey&#8217;s
                        account of Swedenborgianism is given in Letter 62 of <title>Letters from England</title> (1807).</note> &#8211; of which moreover I
                    beseech you say not one word to any one person. the Chapel is somewhere near S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> James&#8217;s Square. I am deep in
                    the mysteries of Swedenborgianism, &amp; have actually made such a discovery therein that if I were crazy enough I might on very
                    sufficient ground set up as the successor of Emanuel himself, &amp; the fulfiller of the revelation which he has left imperfect. &#8211;
                    One word &lt;more&gt; about this Liber of mine &#8211; if it bring me to London, which is not improbable &#8211; one weighing motive will be
                    the desire that your worship should interpolate the MSS. In my next I will tell you more &#8211; now farewell in haste</p>
