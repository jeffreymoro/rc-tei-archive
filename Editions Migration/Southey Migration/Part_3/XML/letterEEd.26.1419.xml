        <p rend="indent1"> We have been very long, &amp; somewhat impatiently looking for news of you, &amp; certainly had I thought a letter
                    would have reached you in time I should have written to dissuade you from trying Durham, &amp; urge you to take Whitehaven in
                    preference &#8211; I have learnt that Durham is a purse-proud priestly place, &#8211; where great entertainments must be given, &amp; a great
                    stile of living is necessary to succeed at all, &amp; Fenwick<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dr. John Ralph Fenwick
                        (?-1855), of North Baily, Durham.</note> is a man of reputation, &#8211; in that very party to whom your name would else be an

                    Whitehaven would have been better for him than Carlisle, &amp; yet he is satisfied with his success there. At Whitehaven you are
                    sure of beating Jos. Dixon<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dr. Joshua Dixon (1744&#8211;1825), of Lowther Street,
                        Whitehaven.</note> out of the field almost immediately. It is not a place to make a fortune, &#8211; but it is a place to make a
                    good livelihood, &amp; get a reputation which may be transplanted if necessary. It is <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworths</ref> opinion that living must be fifty per cent cheaper than at Durham; &#8211; indeed as cheap as &lt;at&gt; any
                    place in England. It is a very pretty place, &#8211; &amp; within a walk of <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. We could
                    come to you for sea bathing, <del>&amp; change of air</del>, &#8211; &amp; you to us for fresh water, &amp; mountain air. I say this on
                    the supposition that you will soon find Durham a bad post. There is no physician near Whitehaven except an old apothecary at
                    Egremont or thereabouts who has taken a fancy to the name of Doctor, &amp; gone to Scotland for it. Perhaps you may take wing

            <title>The Post Captain, or, the Wooden Walls Well-Manned</title> (1805), was authored by Davis, a little-known former sailor,
                        but advertised by the bookseller Thomas Tegg (1776&#8211;1846; <title>DNB</title>), known for his commercial acumen, as the work of
                        Dr John Moore (1729&#8211;1802) author of <title>Zeluco</title> (1789).</note> I happen to know this because <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> sent me the MS. for my opinion upon it. You need not explain the meaning of

                    heraldic remarks &#8211; which are decisive of the controversy &#8211; are his &#8211;. If you say any thing about the controversy here is a remark
                    &#8211; or rather discovery of <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref> which will figure in the argument. The pieces which

                    &amp; traced all the varieties of this letter, &#8211; there said he &#8211; theres proof of the forgery. This is quite characteristic of <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>. Speak of this &lt;argument&gt; as the <del>argume</del> discovery of a man who
