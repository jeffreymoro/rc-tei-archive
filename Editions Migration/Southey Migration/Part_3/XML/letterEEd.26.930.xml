                    retired to her room at half after eight, &amp; before ten she &amp; her child were two. They are doing well thank God. but the young one is very very ugly. so ugly that if I did

                        is by Udal ap Rhys [Uvedale Tomkyns Price] (1685&#8211;1764), <title>An Account of the Most Remarkable Places and Curiosities in Spain and Portugal</title> (1749). Price is an
                        anglicised form of ap Rhys which led Southey to mistake the author and look for a work on Spain by his contemporary Uvedale Price (1747&#8211;1829; <title>DNB</title>), author of an
                            <title>Essay on the Picturesque</title> (1796), rather than one by Price&#8217;s grandfather Udal ap Rhys. Thus, writing to Barker on 10 December 1804 (Letter 1000), Southey
                        again declared his ignorance of the book. According to Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, (&#8216;The Letters of Robert Southey to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826&#8217; (unpublished PhD, Harvard,
                        1967), pp. 144&#8211;147), <ref target="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">Sir Edward Littleton</ref> then wrote on the blank third page of Southey&#8217;s letter, confusingly: &#8216;Uvedale Price

                        Dogs, Scipio &amp; Braganza&#8217;. Because Littleton still failed to distinguish between grandfather and grandson, Southey continued to mistake the author in his letter to Barker of
                        10 December 1804 (Letter 1000).</note>
