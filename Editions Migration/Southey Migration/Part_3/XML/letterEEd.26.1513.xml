        <p rend="indent1"> As for this curst affair in Portugal, I have no heart to write about it. One comfort is that all England is in an
                    uproar about it, every man feels like, &amp; I think there is good reason to hope that at last we shall see a General shot for
                    misconduct. The plain course which an able ministry would pursue would be this, &#8211; to break the convention, &amp; deliver up to the
                    French the wretch who signed it, with a halter round his neck. This was a Roman custom, &amp; a wise one it was. My own belief is
                    that no man could have consented to let Junot carry away his plunder, unless he had had a share given him for his consent; surely
                    he who had so little sense of honour as to make such terms, cannot be supposed to have enough to stand in his way upon any
                        occasion.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s exasperation was caused by the Convention of Cintra, signed on 30
                        August, whereby the French army commanded by Jean-Andoche Junot (1771&#8211;1813) and defeated by Anglo-Portuguese forces under Sir
                        Arthur Wellesley (later the 1st Duke of Wellington) (1769&#8211;1852; <title>DNB</title>) at Vimeiro on 21 August, was allowed to
                        retreat intact, with its weapons, from Portugal. Wellesley, who did not sign the Convention, had been superseded in command by
                        two veteran generals, just arrived in Iberia, who were content to make peace: Sir Harry Burrard (1755&#8211;1813;
                        <title>DNB</title>) and Sir Hew Dalrymple (1750&#8211;1830;<title> DNB</title>). Public outcry led to an inquiry, after which
                        Burrard and Dalrymple never again took command.</note>
