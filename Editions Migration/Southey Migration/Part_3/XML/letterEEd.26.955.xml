          <salute>Dear Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I begin to feel like myself again. in London the perpetual bustle &amp; stir &amp; walking &amp; talking, had almost worn me out &#8211; &amp; in addition I had a cruel
                    cold which affected head &amp; chest, eyes &amp; nose. here I am at last thank God, safe &amp; sound, &amp; refreshed, tho I still think that it would be but right &amp; proper to
                    take out in afternoon naps the ninety nine hours of sleep lost upon the journey, &amp; by late hours in town.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I did not see you after I had read three tales of the Mabinogion.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was reading a translation of the Welsh romances
                        dating from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, collected in fourteenth-century Welsh manuscripts and known as the Mabinogi. Some of these were published in the journal
                        edited by William Owen Pughe, <title>The Cambrian Register</title> (1796, 1799), where they are entitled <title>The Mabinogion, or Juvenile Amusements, being Ancient Welsh
                            Romances</title>.</note>
          <ref target="people.html#PugheWilliamOwen">Owen</ref>  has translated them admirably, in so Welsh a syntax &amp; idiom that they convey the full manner of the
                    original. The tales themselves resemble the Arabian Nights in the character of their fictions most remarkably. It is perfectly unaccountable to me whence this resemblance can have
                    originated. If the others be at all equal to these &#8211; which there should seem no reason to doubt, you Celts will be able to produce a specimen of far greater genius than we Goths
                    have been willing to give you credit for. Yet it is idle in an Englishman to call him self Goth &#8211; we are a mongrel breed, &amp; all the better for the various crosses. I suspect
                    that all dark hair, dark eyes &amp; dark complections indicate a southern origin &#8211; that is in general a Roman one. for the Cimbric race<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The Cymbri, an ancient tribe, conjectured by some early nineteenth-century scholars to have descended from the Picts, who supposedly conquered Wales, Cornwall and Britanny
                        after the fall of the Roman empire.</note> were all fair, &amp; so also were all the Northern invaders, flaxen or carrot<del>t</del>y, &amp; our climate is not hot enough to
                    ripen a Danes complection. In two or three generations we should probably bleach a Spaniard, but a red headed Irishman will propagate rankness from generation to generation unless
                    the breed be crosst. If this theory be true we are more of us Romans than has been suspected, or than our language indicates.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If you have an opportunity I wish you would introduce <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Dapple</ref> to <ref target="people.html#HeberRichard">Heber</ref> &#8211; as my Lieutenant &#8211; Deputy &#8211; or Viceroy in the Specimens<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

I thought of inclosing to you a note of introduction &#8211; but
                    probably <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> will like a personal introduction better. Or I will write the note &#8211; &amp; you can tell <ref target="people.html#HeberRichard">Heber</ref> to expect it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The little <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edithling</ref> goes on well. &amp; has a profile as like mine as an infants can be. We hear that <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> has got some appointment at Malta thro Sheridan.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> By July 1804 <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> was working as the private secretary to Sir Alexander Ball (1757&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), the naval officer
                        governing Malta. He became acting public secretary under Ball the following January. Before Coleridge left England on 27 March 1804, in the company of <ref target="people.html#StuartDaniel">Daniel Stuart</ref>, he had by chance met Stuart&#8217;s friend Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1757&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), leader of the Whig
                        opposition in parliament and acquaintance of the Prime Minister. Stuart then asked Sheridan to use his interest to seek a post in the government of Malta for Coleridge.</note>
                    this does not sound likely &amp; yet <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharp</ref>  says it is true.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wish you success in your campaign against the Chancellor of the Exchequer,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Pitt (1759&#8211;1806;
                            <title>DNB</title>) returned to office as Chancellor, the first minister in the government, in April 1804.</note> &amp; the Emperor of the French<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; First Consul 1799&#8211;1804; Emperor of the French 1804&#8211;1814).</note> &#8211; but I wish also that some cessation of hostilities may
