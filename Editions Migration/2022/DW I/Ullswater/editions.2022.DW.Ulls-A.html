Martindale divides itself into two dales at the<br/> head.

At the bottom of the other dell is the house<br/> I have mentioned; and beyond the enclosures of this Man’s<br/> Farm there are no other. A few old trees remain, relicks<br/> of the Forest, a little stream passes in serpentine wind<br/> -ings through the uncultivated valley, where many cattle<br/> were feeding.

Ulswater was of a dazzling brightness bordered<br/> by black hills. The Plain beyond Penrith smooth &amp; bright<br/> or rather gleamy, as the Sea or Sea-sands. Looked <sup>down</sup> into Boar<br/> Dale, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">above Sanwick</span> — deep and bare — a stream winding <br/> through it. After having walked a considerable way along<br/> the tops of the hills came in view of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Sanwick</span> Glenridden, <br/> and the Mountains at the head of Grisdale. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Luff then</span> <sup>Our companion</sup> <br/> <span style="text-decoration: line-through">took us</span> turned aside before we had begun to descend to a small <br/> Ruin, which was formerly a Chapel, or place of worship,<br/> where <sup>it is said</sup> the Inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale were<br/> accustomed to meet on Sabbath days.

Whether it was ever consecrated ground<br/> or not, I do not know; but the place may be kept<br/> holy in the memory of some now living in Patter-<br/> dale; for it was the means of preserving the<br/> life of a poor old Man last summer who, having gone up<br/> the mountain to gather peats together, had been overtaken<br/> by a storm, and could not find his way down again.<br/> He happened to be near the remains of the old Chapel<br/> and in a corner of it he contrived, by laying turf, &amp; ling,</p>

            <p>and stones in a corner of it from one wall to the other, to make<br/> a shelter from the wind, and there he sate all night.<br/> The Woman who had sent him on his errand began to<br/> grow uneasy towards evening, &amp; the Neighbours went to<br/> seek him. At that time the old Man had housed himself<br/> in his nest, &amp; he heard the voices of the men; but could not<br/> make himself heard, the wind being so loud; &amp; he was afraid<br/> to leave the spot, least he should not be able to find it<br/> again, so he remained there all night, and they return-<br/> ed to their homes, giving him up for lost; but the next<br/> morning the same persons discovered him, huddled up in<br/> the sheltered nook. He was at first stupefied, &amp; unable<br/> to move, yet after he had eaten and drunk, &amp; recollected<br/> himself a little he walked down the Mountain, and his<br/> health did not afterwards seem to have suffered. As we<br/> descend the Vale of Patterdale appears very simple<br/> and grand with its two heads, Deep dale, &amp; Brothers-water<br/> or Hartsop. It is remarkable that two pairs of Brothers<br/> should have been drowned in that Lake. There is a traditi-<br/> on, at least, that <span style="text-decoration: line-through">two were drowned there</span> it took its<br/> name from two who were drowned there many years<br/> ago; and it is a fact that two others did meet that<br/> melancholy fate about twenty years since. It was after<br/> a New-year’s-day. Their Mother had sent them to thresh<br/> some corn, and they (probably thinking it hard to be so <br/> tasked when all others were keeping holiday) stole out<br/> to slide upon the ice, and were both drowned. A neighbour</p>

He was then convinced of the truth,<br/> and told her that they were drowned. It is said that they<br/> were found locked in each other’s arms. I was exceedingly<br/> tired when we reached M<sup>r</sup> Luff’s house, owing to the<br/> steepness and roughness of the peat track down which<br/> we descended.

               flying mists.” </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Beginning here, DW adds material between the next three lines of text. The result
               is difficult to make intelligible in a transcription, but the intended final reading
               must be something like this: “Our fancies could not resist the temptation &amp; we fixed
               upon a spot for a cottage which we <span style="text-decoration: line-through">built</span> began to build &amp; finished as easily as castles are raised in the air. We visited
               the same spot by moonlight that evening.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Possibly “covered by the.” </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">This is another difficult section of the manuscript. New writing enters crookedly,
               large portions of text are scribbled over in pencil, and it is hard to discern where
               insertions are meant to belong. DW adds, “We [illegible verb that ends with <span style="font-style:italic">tted</span>] for to visit the [?],” but unsure how to place this rejected text, we omit it from
               the transcription.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Here, DW overwrites the lowercase <span style="font-style:italic">a</span> with a capital <span style="font-style:italic">A</span>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">In this passage, presenting insertions as they appear on the page makes the transcription
               slightly confusing. Obviously, DW means the fragments to stick together: “with sheep
               collected around him one of which he was smearing with tar for protection against
               the winter cold.” </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">To make “The” the beginning of the revised sentence, DW overwrites her lowercase <span style="font-style:italic">t </span>with a capital one.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Despite the confusing placement of the insertions, DW obviously intends, “I shall
               not describe the scene or relate our little adventures, but will only add,” and so
               forth. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">The heavily canceled sentence must be similar or identical to one that appears in
               the Coleorton Manuscript: “My heart was full; and I could not but grieve that any
               strangers were with us.” </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">No doubt DW intends this to read “waited upon by little Hannah” but accidentally skips
               a word on moving to the next page. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">DW inadvertently repeats “to delay the moment of parting, paced up one street and
               down another.” The second instance is canceled, but only in pencil (i.e., at a later
               date). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">DW injects material between the next several lines without indicating precisely where
               it belongs, though the insertion point seems to follow 
               “The trees in Gowbarrow Park were.”
               While the additions are difficult to decipher, they seem to read more or less as follows:
               “in that state when what is gained in interest by the disclosure of their Bark and
               Brambles compensates almost for the loss of foliage; they exhibited that variety which
               characterizes the point of time between autumn &amp; winter.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
