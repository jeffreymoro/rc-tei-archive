                <p rend="noCount">Our aim is to produce a thoroughly annotated and contextualized edition of Wordsworth's Guide to the Lakes that will prove
                    useful to students, researchers, and the general public. Our edition will feature complete transcriptions of the first and final editions of the Guide and highlight key variants across the five editions Wordsworth oversaw during his lifetime. We will also include extensive
                    background information on the Guide including annotations for obscure terms, references, and literary allusions as well as maps
                    and photographs of key locations in England's Lake District. We will include high-resolution scans of the rarely seen
                    Joseph Wilkinson sketches that inspired the Guide's original composition. The edition will also provide a bibliography of scholarship on the Guide and an appendix comprised of Wordsworth-circle letters related to the text.</p>

            Scar is a series of long, cavern-filled limestone cliffs that run along the route of the
            old A65. The natural curiosity Wordsworth mentions (the well) intrigued tour writers
            from the eighteenth century forward. An underground syphon seems to be the most likely
            explanation for the rise and fall of the water, which is less frequent and dramatic now
            than it was in Wordsworth’s time. The well may still be seen at the side of the road at
            the base of the cliffs. (Photo by kind courtesy of http://www.yorkshire-dales.com and

          The cloud’s-eye vision Wordsworth conjures here is easy to understand with the help of
            a map. Wordsworth was fond of this passage. In a letter to Lady Beaumont (10 May 1810),
            he wrote, “I am very happy that you have read the Introduction [to <emph>Select Views</emph>] with so
            much pleasure…. I though the part about the Cottages well-done; and also liked a
            sentence where I transport the Reader to the top of one of the Mountains, or rather to
            the Cloud chosen for his station, and give a sketch of the impressions which the Country
            might be supposed to make on a feeling mind, contemplating its appearance before it was
            inhabited.” Commentators have debated the originality of Wordsworth’s wheel metaphor,

          The Windermere island Wordsworth calls “Chapel-Holm” is more commonly known as Lady Holme
            (i.e., “the island of Our Lady”) or St. Mary Holme, taking its name from the chantry
            established there in medieval times. St. Herbert’s Island on Derwentwater is named for
            the seventh-century anchorite who had his hermitage there. The island became a place of
            pilgrimage by 1374, when the Bishop of Carlisle ordered the vicar of Crosthwaite to
            celebrate mass there on the saint’s feast day and offered forty-day indulgences to
            participants. See Wordsworth’s inscription poem “For the Spot Where the Hermitage Stood

          Derwentwater’s floating island has long been a curiosity, varying in size during its
            different appearances. Early writers on the Lakes offered various ingenious speculations

              <emph>Prelude</emph> (1850, III.336–39), and Dorothy wrote a poem called “Floating

            from the 1823 <emph>Guide</emph> forward. The passage, as loosely translated by John Talbot, reads:
            “You really ought to visit the fields of Tivoli, and the lake of Albunea, with its leafy

          Wordsworth’s contention here is generally true, in part because most landscape
            paintings by these “ancient masters” of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were set
            in classical or Biblical lands. Titian (1488/1490-1576) was born in the village of Pieve
            di Cavore in the Italian Alps and lived much of his life in nearby Venice. Nicolas
            Poussin (1594-1665) and his brother-in-law Gaspard Dughet (self-styled “Gaspard
            Poussin”) (1615-1675) lived primarily in Paris and Rome, respectively, and spent little
            to no time in the Alps (although Nicolas did paint <emph>Hannibal Crossing the
              Alps</emph> in 1625-1627). The French painter Claude Lorrain (1600-1682) visited Tyrol
            and Bavaria in his twenties but was generally more drawn to beautiful or picturesque
            settings than sublime landscapes like the Alps. The minor Italian painters Pellegrino
            Tibaldi (1527-1596) and Bernardino Luini (c. 1482-1532) both resided in Milan, which is
