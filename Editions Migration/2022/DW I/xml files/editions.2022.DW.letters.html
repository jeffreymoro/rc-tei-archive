                     William walked by my side. We came over Kirkstone and had a very pleasant journey
                     though the day was misty; &amp; at the top of Kirkstone we could not see fifty yards around
                     us. We were very anxious to visit some of the Vales tributary to Ulswater where we
                     have never been before, while yet the brown leaves are upon some of the trees; but
                     I am afraid it must not be this year, for the weather seems broken. We are in the

                     I look over the level bed of the valley, intersected with hedgerows, (it seems as
                     level as a bowling-green) horses &amp; cows are feeding in the fields which are of a soft
                     yellow hue, through which you hardly perceive the tinge of the fading green, a colour
                     that harmonizes exquisitely with that of the trees upon the mountain opposite, where
                     a thick cloud is resting; and through that veil, rocks and craggy points now appear.—and
                     then are hidden again. My dear Lady Beaumont, this is a wonderful country; the more
                     wonderful, the more we know of it, much as the Tourists stare at our great rocks while
                     they wheel along the turnpike roads. Yesterday we had visions of things, imperfectly
                     seen as we passed along, that might have employed our fancy happily for hours, if
                     they had not in the next moment been replaced by others as beautiful. This Dale has
                     not yet been intruded upon by any of the Fancy-builders, —there is only one offensive
                     object, the house of Mr Mounsey, the King of Patterdale,

                              Border raiders. DW may use the title somewhat ironically on the model of “King Pocky,”
                              the nickname given to Joseph Pocklington (1736–1817), who, among his other eccentricities,
                              purchased the island in Derwentwater and built a folly house there. Later in this
                              letter, when DW speaks of a gentleman purchasing the island in Grasmere and likely
                              building a pavilion or obelisk on it, she has actual exploits of “King Pocky” in mind.…</span></div>

                     grand view of the Vale, but alas poor Grasmere! The first object which now presents
                     itself after you have clomb the hill from Rydale is Mr Crump’s newly-erected large

                           a “monster of a house,” it commanded excellent views of the Grasmere Vale and more

                           be surprised by this statement of DW’s. However, by 1805 it was obvious that Dove
                           Cottage was too small for the family. Moreover, the Wordsworths hoped to own (not
                           merely rent) a home. In the end, the Wordsworths spent the winter of 1806–1807 as
                           guests of the Beaumonts at Coleorton, and in 1808 they moved to Allan Bank (see n4).
                           Removals to the Rectory in Grasmere (1811) and finally to Rydal Mount (1813) would
                           follow. In this letter, DW comforts herself at the necessity of moving by lamenting

                  (which hardly vary from day to day,) &amp; my own peculiar feelings; and to make these

            <p>I do not know whether I gave you a distinct notion of Sir Michael’s white wall. It
               is high upon the hillside, directly under the woods behind his house, which are backed
               by the mountains of Rydale head. This wall many would take for a bleaching yard, only
               that linen cloth is generally bleached in a low meadow by a river-side. — It is like
               a piece of broad-cloth hung upon tenters as you see them in Yorkshire, only twice
               the length of an ordinary piece of cloth &amp; perhaps three times the breadth. This white
               Line entirely destroys the grandeur &amp; simplicity of the Recess, or mountain Cove behind

               was passed down by local courtesy from an ancestor said to have defeated a party of
               Border raiders. DW may use the title somewhat ironically on the model of “King Pocky,”
               the nickname given to Joseph Pocklington (1736–1817), who, among his other eccentricities,
               purchased the island in Derwentwater and built a folly house there. Later in this
               letter, when DW speaks of a gentleman purchasing the island in Grasmere and likely
               building a pavilion or obelisk on it, she has actual exploits of “King Pocky” in mind.

               between 1808 and 1811. Although William called it “a temple of abomination” and Dorothy
               a “monster of a house,” it commanded excellent views of the Grasmere Vale and more
               space for a growing family and frequent houseguests.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Apparently DW is describing a “ha-ha,” a landscape feature that became fashionable
               in the late eighteenth century. Its usual intent was to prevent sheep from grazing
               on the lawns and gardens near a house without obstructing views. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Aware of the Wordsworths’ fondness for their home at Town End, Grasmere, readers may
               be surprised by this statement of DW’s. However, by 1805 it was obvious that Dove
               Cottage was too small for the family. Moreover, the Wordsworths hoped to own (not
               merely rent) a home. In the end, the Wordsworths spent the winter of 1806–1807 as
               guests of the Beaumonts at Coleorton, and in 1808 they moved to Allan Bank (see n4).
               Removals to the Rectory in Grasmere (1811) and finally to Rydal Mount (1813) would
               follow. In this letter, DW comforts herself at the necessity of moving by lamenting
               that Grasmere is not what it used to be. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               “Miscellaneous Sonnets”
               in the first volume of <em>Poems</em> (1807). WW tried to translate “at least fifteen” of Michelangelo’s sonnets at the
               request of a friend, who was writing a biography of the artist. In speaking of “so
               much thought” in the poems, DW echoes something WW wrote to Sir George Beaumont in
               late October: “So much meaning has been put by Michael Angelo into so little room,
               and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that I found the difficulty of translating
               him insurmountable” (<em>Letters</em>, 1.628).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               the night before: “Again we all thank you for the game—it will almost make epicures
               of us—coming from you it will be such a feast” (<em>Letters</em>, 1:635–36). Presumably, the Leicestershire hare was a remnant of that gift.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of his life, “She lived alternately with her brother and with us” (<em>Memoirs</em>, 17). In truth, she lived mostly with the Wordsworths from 1806 forward.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">In 1803, Sir George Beaumont had given the Wordsworths a plot of land at Applethwaite,
               near Keswick, so that they might live closer to STC. Sir George had also sent a drawing
               of “the Cottage, its dashing waters, and the corner of old Skiddaw” (DW to Lady Beaumont,
               <em>Letters</em>, 1:483). This picture, a symbol of home, friendship, and friends’ belief in WW’s
               poetic calling, hung in Dove Cottage for the whole time the Wordsworths lived there.
               It now resides at the Wordsworth Trust (reference GRMDC.B31).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               coast. He was captain of the <em>Earl of Abergavenny</em>, an East Indiaman that was wrecked in Weymouth Bay. Though 155 people survived, Captain
               Wordsworth went down with the ship, along with much of his crew.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               his addiction to opiates, and restore his physical and mental health. As DW suggests,
               the ongoing war with Napoleonic France, compounded by STC’s own delays (including
               wanderings around Italy), made his long absence a trial to both family and friends.
               When he finally returned to England in 1806, DW was shocked at his condition. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note20"><span class="noteLabel">20. </span><span class="noteBody">DW refers to <em>The Recluse</em>, which WW never did complete, though he considered <em>The Prelude</em> (what DW calls “the Poem on his own life” later in the paragraph) its prologue and
               <em>The Excursion</em> (published 1814) its second part.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               WW would, of course, revise the poem further, and it would not see print until after
               his death in 1850. Nonetheless, this letter of DW’s is one authority for considering
               the 1805 <em>Prelude</em> as a complete version of the work, widely considered her brother’s masterpiece.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
