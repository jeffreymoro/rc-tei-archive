               <p>Can we ever hear the sound of our own voice? When as a child I was asked by my mother,
                  “Do you hear yourself?!”, I would think to myself, “Well, no. But you do. Or do you?”
                  Mladen Dolar calls the voice “the material support of bringing about meaning, yet
                  it does not contribute to it itself. It is, rather, something like the vanishing mediator”
                  that “makes the utterance possible, but . . . disappears in it.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> What “persists,” Dolar argues, is the “object voice,” which “does not go up in smoke
                  in the conveyance of meaning, and does not solidify in an object of fetish reverence.”

                  </div> Hence a paradox: although “voices are the very texture of the social, as well as the
                  intimate kernel of subjectivity,” the voice “is <span style="font-style:italic">what does not contribute to making sense.</span>”

                  </div> Voice “is the material element recalcitrant to meaning,” for “if we speak in order

                  </div> I want to explore this incommensurability between voice and the said in Percy Shelley’s
                  lyrical drama, <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound </span>(1820). If the materiality of voice and sound mediates and grounds meaning and the
                  human, more often than not in Romantic verse (think of Keats’ nightingale) they remain
                  “recalcitrant to meaning,” opening a fissure within human being. This vanishing potential
                  makes transformation possible while at the same time challenging notions of “a unified
                  self-representation.”

                  Romanticism explores what this apprehension misses as that which necessarily <span style="font-style:italic">remains </span>missing such that human potential “does not solidify in an object of fetish reverence”
                  – the kind of reverence that guarantees Jupiter’s tyranny as a symbol and method of

                  Scene Three: “Hercules unbinds Prometheus, who descends” (259). But the poem enacts
                  no straightforward feat of recall. For one thing, Shelley’s is not “the individual
                  Mind that keeps her own / Inviolate retirement,”

                  </div> grounded in its ability to reclaim the past within the present and thus gain purchase
                  on the future. Shelley draws his imagery “from the operations of the human mind” (Preface
                  to <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound</span>, 207) as a reflection of “different modifications of the one mind” (“On Life,” 508).
                  But whereas for an earlier criticism the “one mind” signalled a movement from Shelley’s
                  early skepticism toward the metaphysics of “postmortal transcendence,”

                  unbound and unbinding nature is the fact that Prometheus’ curse has gone viral in
                  the environment. There it remains, ready to haunt, if not return, a “voice” which
                  is both “contagion to the world” (2.3.10) and “an awakening sound” (3.3.14). That

                  the curse indicates a rather more distributed cognition.

                  </div> Recalling the curse itself is beside the point, for “words are quick and vain” (1.303).
                  What matters instead is “the voice / Which [Prometheus] gave forth” (1.112-13). He
                  has less forgotten the curse than he wants to recall the sound of his – its – defiance
                  at the moment of its saying. But again, this is not merely to summon the voice of
                  this defiance. More complexly, it is both to express and to register the autonomous
                  affect of resistance as the vanishing mediator of any attempt to renovate a devastated

                  gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present” (<span style="font-style:italic">A Defence of Poetry</span>, 535), tracks the primal scene of an experience that can never be recalled but that
                  remains as the habitual performance of its absence. As Fred Moten argues, “It’s the
                  ongoing repression of the primal scene of subjection that one wants to guard against
                  and linger in. . . . the <span style="font-style:italic">conjunction </span>of reproduction and disappearance is performance’s condition of possibility, its ontology

                  </div> the activity of its occurrence, provides the answer, which is why echoes come to signify
                  at once the failure of recall and its insistent possibility. In Shelley’s lyrical
                  drama, a voice, like Echo herself, is nothing more than sound cursed to repeat what
                  it hears, wasted by the desire she can never express for the astonishing beauty of
                  another she can never have. But unlike Narcissus’ perpetually redirected inwardness,
                  that the voice is nothing more means it also has the queerly powerful potential to
                  release itself from the gaze of the other.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Eventually I want to argue that this potential resides with the capacity to listen
                  and to be heard as nearly impossible markers of what it means to be human. Listening
                  is the literal act of a possible communication between individuals. Yet at the same
                  time speaking with and to others is less to listen for and hear the content of what
                  is being said, the grounding of a human relationality, than it is to register what
                  risks getting lost in translation. Listening is facilitated by the materiality of
                  sound, but it transpires as and results in the immaterial or ideational affect and
                  effect of what is possibly being heard. We can, that is, differentiate between hearing
                  and listening. To hear and be heard is to indicate a certain transmission of meaning.
                  To listen is to remain open to the possibility <span style="font-style:italic">of </span>meaning, not as its crystallization but as what cannot be conscripted into meaning,
                  as what takes us always already beyond ourselves. Prometheus listens more than hears
                  and listens for more than he hears. In doing so, listening moves the poem perpetually
                  along the non-human trajectory of what Chris Washington calls Romanticism’s post-apocalyptic
                  future.

               <p>At the opening of Act One, Prometheus asks the Earth, “have not the mountains felt?”
                  (1.24), “yon Heaven – the all-beholding Sun, / Has it not seen?” and “The Sea, in
                  storm or calm / Heaven’s ever-changing Shadow, spread below – / Have its deaf waves
                  not heard my agony?” (1.26-29). Feeling, sight, sound. The poem seems to avoid prioritizing
                  one over the other, though it’s not as simple as that. When he encounters the Furies
                  Mercury sends to harrow his soul, Prometheus states, “Whilst I behold such execrable
                  shapes, / Methinks I grow like what I contemplate / And laugh and stare in loathsome
                  sympathy” (1.449-51). Here the ominous fixity of the gaze orchestrates the scene of
                  Romantic sympathy. The Furies anatomize what Panthea calls “A woeful sight – a youth
                  / With patient looks nailed to a crucifix” (584-85). This image marks the nightmare
                  of iconography and thus of the visual to supersede and thus oppress all other senses.
                  Or as Blake writes in <span style="font-style:italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell </span>(1790-1793), “man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro’ narrow chinks
                  of his cavern.”

                  </div> The statement suggests by the time of the First Reform Bill the enduring post-Enlightenment
                  hegemony of the visual. Yet one of Brewster’s examples is the Spectre of the Brocken,
                  an atmospheric phenomenon by which our shadows, cast upon mist, both magnify and distort
                  the human form. The Spectre reflects the spectral nature of vision itself, the way
                  in which reality passes into consciousness via a logic beyond comprehension, like
                  the hallucinatory doubles of James Hogg’s <span style="font-style:italic">Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner </span>(1824) or Thomas De Quincey’s opium fantasias.</p>

               <p>In Shelley’s poem the Sea challenges the Sun’s “all-beholding” pre-eminence of the
                  visual as the mirror or “ever-changing Shadow” of Heaven “spread below,” where Prometheus’
                  “agony” falls on “deaf” ears. Glen O’Malley has explored this transitional space between
                  sight and sound as part of Shelley’s synesthetic aesthetic. Synaesthesia suggests
                  how the neuronal pathways of the poem’s sensorium – the “vitally metaphorical” way
                  in which the transferences of figurative language embody a poem’s experience as it
                  unfolds <span style="font-style:italic">in medias res</span> – produce a kind of involuntary interconnectedness in which subjects hear sight or
                  see sound.

                  at once brings its own form of hell, a kind of perceptual deluge that overwhelms and
                  suspends the self, as if to open a fissure within human being. Addressing the capacity
                  of images to compel and fascinate our notice, W. J. T. Mitchell asks “What do pictures

                  </div> Asking how and why the visual arrests our attention is to account for the lack that
                  mobilizes this mutual desire in the first place, one for which neither we nor the
                  picture can account. In a similar way, Shelley’s poem both desires and demands our
                  attention without any guarantee that we will be able to make sense of its felt environment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The poem thus implicitly differentiates between making sense and the making <span style="font-style:italic">of </span>sense, between what we imagine the result of sense-making to mean and the perceptual
                  actions that make meaning possible in the first place, but on which we can gain no
                  objective purchase. Sound signals this paradoxical embeddedness, what in a somewhat
                  different context Jacques Lacan calls the “filigree” in which we “feel the presence
                  of the gaze” even when “any representation of the human figure is absent.”

                  </div> Put another way, sound in <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound </span>confronts us with a subjectivity without subjects, what one might call a transferential
                  subject or subject <span style="font-style:italic">of </span>transference. And in this sense, sound suggests a mode of survival that survives the
                  visual. At the end of Act Three the Spirit of the Earth recounts to Asia that he has
                  heard the “voice to be accomplished” as a “long long sound, as it would never end”
                  (3.4.57). In Act One Ione asks where the Chorus of Spirits that bring the sound of
                  the future from “the dim caves of human thought” (1.658) have “fled” (1.801). Panthea
                  replies: “Only a sense / Remains of them, like the Omnipotence / Of music when the
                  inspired voice and lute / Languish, ere yet the responses are mute” (1.802-5). Something
                  about the loss of sound registers as the enduring sound of loss, the ineluctable transference
                  between invincibility and expiration. Or as Jean-Luc Nancy writes,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the “visual persists until its disappearance,” while “the sonorous appears and fades

                  </div> that will be the poem’s final vision and celebration of a kind of post- or para-human
                  life. In Act Three Earth feels these effects as a “touch” that “runs down / Even to
                  the adamantine central gloom / Along those marble nerves” (3.3.85-87). At first, however,
                  the sound of Prometheus’ curse seems to echo Jupiter’s oppression, resonating as a
                  sound within Jupiter’s hearing that confirms his power. The “Mountains” and “ice Springs”
                  “vibrated to hear” Prometheus’ curse “and then crept / Shuddering through India” (63-65).
                  The sound of the curse was like that of an “Earthquake’s couch” over which the Mountains
                  “stood,” and like “men convulsed with fears / We trembled in our multitude” (1.75-77).
                  This traumatic sonic vibration registers as the involuntary and inarticulate affective
                  vocabulary of groans: “rending groan” (1.85), “the groans of pining slaves” (1.128),
                  “groans and blood” (1.332), “groans half heard, and blood untasted” (1.529), “low
                  yet dreadful groan” (1.578). As Panthea says, revisiting the effects of Jupiter’s
                  curse on earth and throughout history, “those groans are grief enough” (1.593). They
                  manifest what Goodman calls “sonic warfare.” In 2005 the Israeli military used “sound
                  bombs” in the Gaza Strip, “the high-volume, deep-frequency effect of low-flying jets
                  traveling faster than the speed of sound.” The “objective was to weaken the morale
                  of a civilian population by creating a climate of fear through a threat that was preferably
                  nonlethal yet possibly as unsettling as an actual attack.”

                  </div> The last Fury says, “Blood thou canst see, and fire; and canst hear groans: / Worse
                  things unheard, unseen, remaind behind” (1.617-18). If the sound of grief is felt
                  along the pulses, it also heralds another “unheard, unseen” materiality that here
                  signals an ominous future but, as we later see, is also a redemptive sonic possibility.
                  The Fury’s negative formation embeds its inverse as the “happy sounds” of Earth that
                  remain to this point like the “inarticulate people of the dead” (1.188, 183). Asking
                  to hear the sound of the voice he “gave forth,” Prometheus hears “an awful whisper”
                  that “rises up,” the “inorganic voice” of a “Spirit” that Prometheus feels “art moving
                  near” (1.132-36). That this voice is “scarce like sound” (1.133) suggests the weakening
                  resonance of Prometheus’s curse that he would re-amplify in order to dismiss. Yet
                  the phrasing also indicates a potentiality that “connects every separate entity in

                  effect of this movement to Asia in Act Two, Ione and Panthea see the voice as “A Shape,
                  a throng of sounds” (1.226). But this “Shape” is at the same time “awful <span style="font-style:italic">like</span> the sound” (1.233; emphasis added), indicating a metonymic or sideways movement or
                  force that the Phantasm of Jupiter hears as “unaccustomed sounds . . . hovering on
                  my lips” (1.242-43), as if to anticipate their decentering power to overthrow the
                  tyrant. More pointedly, Prometheus in turn hears the voice of the Phantasm as “empty”
                  (1.249), as if to signal it as now void of meaning, just as Prometheus, upon hearing
                  the curse, famously responds, “It doth repent me: words are quick and vain” (1.1.303).</p>
            </div>
            <p>But “empty” also foreshadows within the plenitude of sound the vanishing mediator
               of voice that is, as Dolar notes, the matrix of sound itself, one that by Act Four
               will drown out all other voices. Tellingly, when the Fury finally vanishes and the
               “sights with which [Jupiter] torturest gird [Prometheus’] soul / With new endurance”
               (1.643-44), Prometheus then says, “There are two woes: / To speak and to behold; thou
               spare me one” (1.646-47). This spared woe I take to be the sound of words themselves.
               Earlier Prometheus says, pondering the sacrificial image or “emblem” he might become
               to “heap / Thousand-fold torment” (1.595-96) on humankind, “Thy name I will not speak,
               / It hath become a curse” (1.603-5). He is thus spared succumbing to the fixed sound
               of his original curse, so that its traumatic sonic effects can be released into its
               more productive vibratory movement. At this point the Earth calls upon a chorus of
               spirits to voice what “they behold / Beyond that twilight realm, as in a glass” (1.661-62),
               but a glass darkly that is the mirror stage of sound through which Prometheus and
               Asia will pass. And what they bear/speak is the sound of “The future” (1.663): “One
               sound – above, around, / One sound beneath, around, above / Was moving” (1.703-5).
               Through this medium, as Ione states, “despair” is “Mingled with love, and then dissolved
               in sound,” which in turn stops up words altogether. As Panthea responds, “Canst thou
               speak, sister? all my words are drowned” (1.758), and the Spirits having fled, they
               hear “Only a sense” of their presence, but one that “Like echoes through long caverns,
               wind and roll” (1.806). Here the echoes that earlier in the Act threatened to die
               out now resonate with a startling and complex materiality as sound bends (“wind and
               roll”) through a space that is at once physical, natural, psychological, spiritual,
               and cosmic.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This resonance, at once material and metaphysical, drives Act Two. Here Asia, long
                  parted from Prometheus in the Indian Caucasus, now occupies the “scene of her sad
                  exile” (1.827), patiently awaiting his return. Yet their impending reunion, meant
                  to signal the rebirth of the world released from the effects of Jupiter’s curse, is
                  less the <span style="font-style:italic">hieros gamos </span>of two identities than their mutual submersion in sound as their very mode of being.
                  Panthea enters with the knowledge of two dreams, the sound of which carries her and
                  Asia to the realm of Demogorgon. One heralds the imminent liberation of Prometheus
                  from Jupiter’s tyranny, a gradual transformation Panthea witnesses while asleep in
                  Ione’s arms in Act One, enacted in Act Three’s stage direction. That dream carries
                  Panthea in Act Two as “the wind / Which fails beneath the music that I bear” (2.1.50-51),
                  which is the “wordless converse” (2.1.52) already transpiring between Asia and Prometheus
                  since Act One. Asia reads the psychic interiority of Prometheus in Panthea’s face,
                  now a site of potential recognition and communication between Asia and Prometheus:
                  “Lift up thine eyes, / And let me read thy dream” (2.2.55-56).

                  </div> Finding Panthea’s “words / Are as the air. I feel them not” (2.1.109), Asia then implores
                  her to “lift / Thine eyes that I may read his written soul!” (2.1.109-10). Yet their
                  transference suggests neither entrapment within the gaze of the visual nor the prison
                  house of language; instead it does the felt work of reading through the medium of
                  sound. The Norton Editors tell us that Panthea’s second dream – which, tellingly,
                  she “remember[s] not” (2.1.610) – is of “the Spirit of Hours that are to usher in
                  the fall of Jupiter and the release of Prometheus, and to the course of necessity”
                  (238n2). I would argue that the purpose of this second dream is to manifest sound
                  as what “has no hidden face; it is all in front, in back, and outside inside, <span style="font-style:italic">inside-out</span> in relation to the most general logic of presence as appearing, as phenomenality or
                  as manifestation, and thus as the visible face of a presence subsisting in self.”

            <p>This subjectivity without subjects gradually emerges as the poem’s <span style="font-style:italic">modus operandi</span>. The second Dream tells Asia and Panthea to “Follow, follow!” (2.1.132), then “disappears”
               (2.132) and “passes now into [the] mind” (2.133) of Panthea, who echoes its sound:
               “<span style="font-style:italic">O follow, follow!</span>” (2.141). As Panthea speaks the sound of her “words / Fill, pause by pause [Asia’s]
               own forgotten sleep / With shapes” (2.141-43) that in turn echo the Dream’s sound
               at lines 153 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Follow, O follow!</span>”), 159 (“<span style="font-style:italic">O follow, follow, follow me!</span>”), and 162 (“<span style="font-style:italic">follow, follow</span>”), what she hears as the “clinging music” of “Low, sweet, faint sounds, like the
               farewell of ghosts” (2.1.157, 158). This <span style="font-style:italic">menage-a-trois </span>of sound signifies the tangled transference between Panthea, Asia, and Prometheus
               that then resounds in the Echo of the Dream – “Follow, follow!” (2.1.162) – and yet
               again in “<span style="font-style:italic">unseen</span>” Echoes who announce, “Echoes we – listen! / We cannot stay / As dew-stars glisten
               / Then fade away” (2.1.166-69). Here, as throughout the poem, Shelley’s syntax is
               maddeningly opaque. Although sound cannot be seen, it nonetheless announces its presence
               “as the visible face of a presence subsisting in self.” Like Heideggerian<span style="font-style:italic">Schein, </span>in which<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>being is at once revelatory and illusory, it <span style="font-style:italic">appears</span>, as in the phrase “We are echoes,” a performative speech act that implores Asia and
               Panthea to “listen” before this presence fades. At the same time, the echoes carry
               the sounds of this listening and thus do the work of listening itself. As Asia and
               Panthea approach Demogorgon’s realm, they hear a sound that “Satiates the listening
               wind, continuous, vast, / Awful as silence” (2.3.35-36). We might ask how wind can
               listen, but then we need to ask what a sound might be with no wind to carry – to hear
               – it?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At the end of Act Two, after her descent to the Cave of Demogorgon, where she finds
                  that “the deep truth is imageless” (2.4.116), Asia, hearing only the sound of her
                  thought echoed back by Demogorgon, is told instead simply to “Behold!” (2.4.128).
                  The exclamation is less an injunction to <span style="font-style:italic">see </span>than to <span style="font-style:italic">feel </span>and thus <span style="font-style:italic">hear </span>what the future holds. Or rather, if it is to see, it’s to see what cannot be seen,
                  to see the sound of the future as the picture of what sound might look like. The Spirit
                  of the Hour arrives to transport Asia to her reunion with Prometheus in Act Three.
                  Seeing the change in Asia’s presence, Panthea cannot “endure the radiance of [her]
                  beauty” (2.5.17-18), like the synaesthete unable to withstand all senses firing at
                  will: “I feel, but see thee not” (2.5.17). Yet at the same time this perceptual crisis
                  heralds the emergence of a greater immersive sonic environment, the “sounds i’ the
                  air which speak the love / Of all articulate beings” (2.5.35-36) and sing of Asia
                  as the “Life of Life” (2.5.48) and “Child of Light” (2.5.54). Immersed in this music,
                  Panthea experiences the abandonment of and by sight as the pre-existing condition
                  for transformation by the feeling of sound: “all feel, yet see thee never / As I feel
                  now, lost forever!” (2.5.64-65). At this point Asia, “by the instinct of sweet Music
                  driven” in the “enchanted Boat” of her “desire” (2.5.90, 72, 94), is carried to the
                  poem’s primal scene, as it were, of its sonic imagination

               <p>In Act Three Ione announces both what sound prophecies and the sound <span style="font-style:italic">of </span>prophecy itself. Implored by Prometheus, she takes “that curved shell, which Proteus
                  old / Made Asia’s nuptial boon, breathing within it / A voice to be accomplished”
                  (3.3.65-67), as if the sound emanates at once from Ione’s breath <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> autonomously from the shell itself. Similarly, the resulting “sound must be at once
                  both sweet and strange” (3.3.75), familiar and alien, one whose timbre is pitched
                  ambiguously between present and future as well as past. “Must” signals variously as
                  ‘it must be this way,’ ‘it must take this form,’ but also it ‘must already be this
                  way,’ at once given, imperative, and prognostication. As Prometheus announces, Ione
                  will “chant fragments of sea-music” (3.3.27) that signal a “Mutability” from which
                  “man” cannot “hide” (3.3.25), while Asia and Prometheus, “unchanged,” “will sit and
                  talk of time and change / As the world ebbs and flows” (3.3.23-24). Moreover, they
                  shall “Weave harmonies divine yet ever new, / From difference sweet where discord
                  cannot be” (3.3.38-39). This vision is of things “though unimagined, yet to be” (3.3.56).
                  This “voice to be accomplished” suggests a blank utopian future that might never be
                  realized, a sterile ‘no-place’ of only ever potential action. But it also suggests
                  Frederic Jameson’s reading of utopia as an “imaginary enclave within the real social
                  space,” one whose “very possibility . . . is itself the result of spatial and social
                  differentiation” born of two “contradictory features.”

                  </div> This “pocket of stasis within the ferment and rushing forces of social change” is
                  the product of the agitations of transitional historical moments, like the effects
                  of Jupiter’s tyranny or Prometheus’ curse. But it also marks a “distance . . . from
                  practical politics, on the basis of a zone of the social totality which seems eternal
                  and unchangeable,” like the cave to which Prometheus and Asia repair at the end of
                  Act Three.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We can thus read Jameson’s two “contradictory features” in terms of how <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> wrestles with the uncanny connection between tyranny/oppression and liberation/transformation.
                  The poem’s utopianism only makes sense by virtue of its emergence both within and
                  apart from the space of discord that is the occasion of Prometheus wanting to remember
                  his curse against Jupiter in the first place. Yet this paradox, as I have explored
                  it to this point, is to map a space of listening negotiation based, not in “discord”
                  but in a “difference” that does not at the same time produce identity. Just at the
                  moment that the Chorus of Spirits announces the song of the Promethean in Act Four,
                  the Chorus of Hours, whose temporality signals the movement of social transition,
                  announces, “Break the dance, and scatter the song; / Let some depart and some remain”
                  (4.159-60). As Kandice Chuh notes, borrowing from Fred Moten, this ‘break’ in sound,
                  which is also an invitation “‘into the break,’” indicates a “radical aesthetics that
                  undermines the privileged position of visual representation and its attendant processes
                  of subjectification/subjection.”

                  awful sound?” (4.184-85). Like Demogorgon’s realm, “Awful as silence,” this sound
                  cannot be understood or turned into meaning. Instead it must be felt as part of the
                  subject’s immersion in the matrix of her own coming to being.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This absorption is less to trap the subject between oppression and transformation,
                  which Shelley seems to recognize as an unavoidable capture, than it is to mark a “pocket
                  of stasis” in which a subjectivity without subjects registers a rather more fluid
                  and dynamic possibility. At this point Ione and Panthea “Listen” for “The Ocean-like
                  inchantment of strong sound / Which flows intenser, keener, deeper yet / Under the
                  ground and through the windless air” (4.203-5). This tonal motion heralds the “Two
                  visions of strange radiance” (4.202) whose “path of melody” (4.198) carries the “lovely
                  grief” of “sweet sad thoughts” (4.201). Again, the ambiguity of Shelley’s phrasing
                  indicates the lived experience of listening itself as both active attunement and submission
                  to the act of listening. As the Earth says when in Act Three Prometheus heralds the
                  “thunder mingled with clear echoes,” “I hear – I feel” (3.3.84). Sound and voice but
                  more importantly <span style="font-style:italic">listening </span>to either indicates a sensory intake that is itself constitutive of the poem’s revolutionary
                  movement. This agitation within the social space of a world reeling from both the
                  tyrant’s oppression and defeat that instantiates the very moment of political practice
                  itself as a lived utopian gesture. As Chuh notes, “sound can interrupt the social
                  order more immediately, perhaps more effectively, than can visual representation.”

                  in listening yet can never anticipate what will be heard. As Glissant states, “The

                  Chorus of Spirits and Hours in Act Four foretell, “shall be called the Promethean”
                  (4.158). This “awakening sound” “shall be / As thunder mingled with clear echoes”
                  (3.3.81-82), yet not in the sense that the echoes themselves provide a clarity of
                  sound for they are “mingled” with the sound of the thunder itself. The poem attends
                  to a rather more complex “loud and whirlwind harmony” (4.237) that is “the deep music

                  (4.186-88). Listening, that is to say, is neither an easy nor isolated and solitary
                  task. As Ione says in Act Four, one must “Listen too, / How every pause is filled
                  with under-notes, / Clear, silver, icy, keen, awakening tones / Which pierce the sense
                  and live within the soul / As the sharp stars pierce Winter’s chrystal air / And gaze

            <p>Jupiter’s tyranny is sustained by his capacity to incite hate in those he oppresses;
               their curse against him is a sign of his power <span style="font-style:italic">to</span> oppress. He listens for it; he yearns to hear it, though like Oedipus confronted
               by Tiresias, he cannot hear what is being said. When the Car of the Hour bearing Demogorgon
               arrives at the opening of Act Three, Jupiter demands, “Awful Shape, what art thou?
               Speak!” (3.1.51). Demogorgon responds, “Eternity – demand no direr name” (3.1.52),
               which short circuits the master/slave dialectic whose words no longer have power as
               both “conqueror and the conquered” sink “into the bottomless void” (3.1.78, 76). This
               pointed, almost traumatically abbreviated exchange symbolizes the absurdly fragile
               nature of power and its ideological labour. Like Dorothy in <span style="font-style:italic">The Wizard of Oz </span>pulling aside the Wizard’s curtain to reveal the farce of a utopian wish that has
               misguided her journey toward a future divorced from reality, the scene performs in
               political time the paradox of what in Act Two the empty throne in Demogorgon’s cave
               stages in metaphysical time: the effects of power are all-too-real, but power itself
               functions in a vacuum. At this point we realize what makes Prometheus’ desire to hear
               the curse repeated, only to refute its words, so potent (again, as Prometheus earlier
               notes, “how vain is talk”). This is to bring the two “contradictory features” of Frederic
               Jameson’s understanding of utopia into sharp relief as a potentiality at once embedded
               within yet separate from the very sociopolitical and historical reality that makes
               it possible. Prometheus invokes the words themselves not even to refute, but merely
               to dismiss their power as “unregarded now” (3.4.179) in order simultaneously to mark
               and to efface their potency. Put another way, because Prometheus refuses to memorize
               the curse, he signals instead another form of active listening to the sound of music
               and the music of sound.</p>

                  crimson dawn?” (2.1.25-27). The phrasing at once affirms and renders ambiguous the
                  potentiality of sound, a hypostasis that may or may not transpire. In a seminal essay
                  D. J. Hughes explored the poem’s potentiality as its means of “cleansing the ontological
                  situation, restoring our sense of the potential, turning, through a series of verbal
                  strategies, the actual back upon itself,” such that the “world at the end of the poem
                  is a virtual one, with the seeds of decline checked, themselves remaining in potency.”

                           social justice. Such a utopia is distinctly at odds with the ‘sense of sound’ that

                  what has been lost since 2016, in the Trump-Pence camp by revisiting the nostalgia
                  of 2016 when Trump (like Reagan before him) promised to return America to its former
                  glory. In either case, as O’Toole rather trenchantly remarks, “the point of genuine
                  mourning is that the thing you are grieving for cannot be restored. The grief is an
                  acceptance that the loss is irreparable,” and so what is needed is a “hard, sad, relentless

                  </div> I take O’Toole’s Freudian primer on the psychology of our political moment as a reflection
                  of Prometheus’ insistence on hearing his curse against Jupiter: he wants – needs –
                  to know that it’s dead. In this case it’s not ocular proof, as Othello demands of
                  Desdemona’s alleged adultery, not the verbal sign of the words themselves, but the
                  sound of their rage. In this sense the curse itself dies, but the affective resonance
                  that sustains its utterance doesn’t. It thus falls to that transformational, even
                  transmogrifying process to carry Prometheus, Asia, and Co., indeed the entire cosmos,
                  toward their collective future. If elections are waged and won by emotion, then we
                  see in <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound </span>that sound literally as well as figuratively carries the day. The poem asks us to
                  listen without prejudice, as if that is ever possible. For listening requires the
                  implicit acknowledgement that we can never truly understand what we are listening
                  for. I mean this in the sense of Glissant’s “right to opacity”

                  itself, brought to a close only through the <span style="font-style:italic">deus ex machina </span>of Demogorgon’s arrival.

Hogle reads the nomadic principle of Shelley's
               aesthetic as “a rootless passage between different formations,” a “primordial, preconscious
               shift, intimated in the movement of perception, feeling, and language, always already
               becoming a different enactment of itself at another time and in conjunction with other
               elements” (15). For Hogle, Shelley’s Prometheus represents “the transitional and disruptive
               actions of the Titan in his previous [mythic] forms,” which “shifts make him very
               nearly the activity of transference incarnate” (172). In my reading sound both enacts

               form of conciliation rather than reconciliation, which presupposes the return to some
               pre-existing harmony. Reconciliation entails the just state as a kind of blank utopian
               notion that implicitly elides the situational and the everyday and thus any<span style="font-style:italic">sense </span>of social justice. Such a utopia is distinctly at odds with the ‘sense of sound’ that
               makes the poem’s final act such a powerfully resonant auditorium for political action.
