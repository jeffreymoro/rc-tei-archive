            </header><br/><p>The terrifying mystery in Ann Radcliffe’s second novel, <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span> (1790), is a sound. <a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                     (1)
                     </sup></a> Julia Mazzini hears a distinct knock coming through the wall of a supposedly vacant
               part of Castle Mazzini, and spends the novel trying to understand how something like
               that could arise with no one to produce it. The knock, predecessor to terrifying sounds
               encountered in later texts by Thomas de Quincey and Charlotte Brontë, seems to be
               what psychoanalysts would call an “object voice,” a sound “fully unfastened from phonemization,”
               which marks a void in the castle architecture through its menacing excess to signification.<a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                     (1)
                     </sup></a> Though indeterminate, it soon becomes what Mladen Dolar would call “a grain of desire,
               a small provocation which triggers off massive consequences.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                     (2)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>To the extent that the sound in this novel asks for anything, it asks to be seen.
               Julia and her comrades, in concerted acts of synesthesia, frequently look around for
               sounds and listen for sights. The characters constantly attempt to keep a lookout
               for the sound: “For the remainder of this night they resolved to watch.” <a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                     (3)
                     </sup></a> The mystery of the knock (as buttressed by other associated sounds, like footsteps
               or a groan) first manifests as a visual sign, a light in the tower seen and then “seen
               no more,” with all of the narrator’s emphasis placed on “what she [in this case, Madame
               de Menon] had seen.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                     (2)
                     </sup></a> Radcliffe consistently presents sound as an excessive aspect of vision, and visuality
               as something lacking in sound, and thus repeatedly encourages the reader to contemplate
               the relationship between sound and vision, just as David Bowie recommends. Julia’s
               brother Ferdinand, the narrator assures us, “ had himself witnessed the sounds.” <a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                     (4)
                     </sup></a> Certainly, it is possible to witness something auditorily, but the term, in 1790
               as now, especially pertains to visual phenomena.<a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                     (5)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>Inspired by this strange synesthesia, this essay will resort to theories of the gaze
               in an attempt to think through the novel’s frightening maternal sound. First, I consider
               Michel Foucault’s comments in “The Eye of Power,” an interview in which he considers
               the ways that Radcliffe’s castle spaces seek illumination, to better herald the arrival
               of a gaze exercised pervasively. I suggest that sound in <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span> complicates that model, given how, on the one hand, both the ruins of the castle
               (in the narrative frame) and the castle itself (in the main narrative) remain inundated
               by sounds and silences that interfere with the operation of power, and how, on the
               other hand, the sound through the wall tends to disperse and diffuse the patriarchal
               authority of Castle Mazzini with a maternal counterpoint. Second, I connect this mechanism
               to a little-discussed aspect of Jacques Lacan’s commentary of the gaze in <span style="font-style:italic">The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis</span>: as Lacan engages with and attempts to challenge Jean-Paul Sartre’s theory of the
               gaze, he notes that the gaze has to do with sound rather than sight directly. This
               sonic facet of the gaze will help us understand the role sound plays in Julia’s protestations
               of love for Hippolitus. Third, I consider Sigmund Freud’s discussion of alarm clock
               dreams in <span style="font-style:italic">The Interpretation of Dreams</span>, in which he contemplates how the same stimulus, and the same dreamer, can produce
               a diversity of dream images. Freud’s consideration of F. W. Hildebrandt’s alarm clock
               dreams complicates any attempt to understand the “meaning” of the knocking sound in
               Radcliffe’s novel or confine it to its seemingly obvious Oedipal resonances. Sending
               sound beyond any patent relation to signification, the bells of Castle Mazzini, like
               the knocks that emanate from within, position Julia as their true agent, as if the
               plot were bent on undoing her subjectivity rather than, as it may at first appear,
               asserting her right to make her own sexual decisions.</p>
            <p>In thinking about sound through epistemologies of vision, Radcliffe could respond
               to contemporary debates about gender, class, and privilege. It has often been noted
               that vision was increasingly presumed, over the eighteenth century, to be the basis
               of all knowledge and the instrument of subjectivity.<a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                     (6)
                     </sup></a> Landed male poets would climb hills to “assume a position of superior knowledge drawn
               from personal experience,” while women writers would oftener adopt points of view
               within, rather than above, the field of vision.<a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                     (7)
                     </sup></a> The priority of vision within Enlightenment epistemology has helped to sustain several
               important analyses of Radcliffe’s work.<a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                     (8)
                     </sup></a> “What is new in Radcliffe’s fiction,” explains Alison Milbank, “is located in her
               way of seeing,” and <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span> particularly brims with “pictorial effects.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
                     (9)
                     </sup></a> Even today, as Kandice Chuh has argued, the visual regime continues to reify neoliberal
               hierarchies of race and gender inherited from the Enlightenment.<a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">
                     (10)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>Critics remain in dispute over the function of sound in Radcliffe’s work, with Frits
               Noske arguing that “the sounds in her novels appear for their own sake,” and Angela
               M. Archambault arguing that Radcliffe uses sound, and especially the voice, to create
               terror and chaos in her novels, generally starting with quiet, peaceful sound effects
               which become more jarring as the novels progress.<a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">
                     (11)
                     </sup></a> Thinkers like Samuel Taylor Coleridge would, during the early nineteenth century,
               frequently associate sound with the sublime, arguing both that sound is intrinsically
               indeterminate and that we are relatively defenseless against it.<a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">
                     (12)
                     </sup></a> Noske maintains that “it was Ann Radcliffe who first used sonorous means as a structural
               factor in fiction.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">
                     (13)
                     </sup></a> In implicit opposition to Milbank’s conclusions, Matt Foley, from a Lacanian perspective,
               traces “the acoustics of the Gothic romance,” and finds, in <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span>, that voice conveys tyrannical authority.<a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">
                     (14)
                     </sup></a> Throughout these debates, critics do tend implicitly to accept Noske’s now-classic
               assessment that Radcliffe uses music as a “connecting factor” between characters and
               as an “indicator of moral values.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">
                     (15)
                     </sup></a> Yet this essay will suggest that sound, at least in <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span>, connects characters only by cutting relations between them in ways that defy moral
               classification. Sound (including music, noise, and silence) had an important visual
               component in eighteenth-century English culture, especially for the construction of
               gender,<a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">
                     (16)
                     </sup></a> and yet existing criticism on Radcliffe has seldom considered sight and sound at
               once. Milbank finds sight and sound to be dichotomous in Radcliffe’s early fiction,
               with tyrants exercising a visual dominance and “virtuous characters . . . particularly
               influenced by sound.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note19" id="Note19_return"><sup class="super">
                     (17)
                     </sup></a> This essay challenges that dichotomy by showing vision to be an aspect of sound in
               <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span>, and tracing the psychic consequences of that sensory entanglement. As <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span> crosses and co-implicates vision and sound, pinning each as an impossible point within
               the other field, the relatively tidy taxonomies established by Milbank, Noske, and
               Archambault tend to break down. I am interested in exploring these points of intersection
               without intersection.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">1. The Sound of the Gaze Beyond Panopticism</span></h2>
               <p>“Enchanting sounds!,” Hippolitus says, when he is told by Ferdinand that Julia secretly
                  loves him: “I could listen till I forgot I had a wish beyond them.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note20" id="Note20_return"><sup class="super">
                        (18)
                        </sup></a> Sounds, in this formulation, serve to obliterate one’s desire, even while one’s ability
                  to listen is understood to be an effect of that desire. This arrangement may seem
                  to facilitate an Oedipal plot, for which one would have to learn to forget one’s own
                  wishes. Yet the visual structure of supervision in this scene expands that paradigm
                  by constructing a whole series of triangulated relations around the “enchanting sounds”
                  to give them multiple and competing points of reference. Hippolitus asks Ferdinand
                  for some proof of Julia’s love, leading Ferdinand to report that he “saw her ineffectual
                  struggles to conceal” her feelings.<a class="note_back" href="#Note21" id="Note21_return"><sup class="super">
                        (19)
                        </sup></a> In this model, the “enchanting sounds” of Ferdinand’s report are guaranteed by Julia’s
                  feelings, which, although they cannot themselves be seen, become apparent in the attempt
                  to camouflage what is already invisible. Julia has gone into hiding, Ferdinand says,
                  not wanting to be seen in such a lovelorn state. She is invisible but audible: “I
                  have often heard her singing in some lonely spot,” Ferdinand says to Hippolitus, noting
                  that “your return produced a visible and instantaneous alteration” in her voice.<a class="note_back" href="#Note22" id="Note22_return"><sup class="super">
                        (20)
                        </sup></a> In sum, Ferdinand reports having watched Julia not being seen by hearing her singing,
                  which has made a spectacle of her invisible feelings. Although she is hidden from
                  view—even he does not seem to know where she is, as to him it is merely “some lonely
                  spot” or another—he could plainly see the change in her song once Hippolitus returned.</p>
               <p>This explanation raises a series of questions that are important throughout the novel:
                  how is it possible to locate something “visible” in a voice emanating from a hidden
                  place? And in what sense would the voyeur’s report of that discovery constitute a
                  “sound,” per se, rather than mere information? It is as if the jouissance of Julia’s
                  attachment to Hippolitus, something in excess of any possible sexual relationship
                  between them, crosses narrative levels. It first conveys itself into a song about
                  her love, which renders the love visible to auditors. It next becomes the excessive
                  part of Ferdinand’s report of that song. The excess jouissance then gets transmitted
                  back to Hippolitus, its original inspiration, in what he takes for simply “sounds.”
                  Finally, it gets subsumed within the novel’s narrativizing structures, through which
                  it gets ultimately and indirectly reported to the frame narrator and reader. It is
                  as if anything attached to Julia’s desire overspills the capacity in language for
                  communication, such that even reports of her desire necessarily carry with them this
                  excessive quality, turning information into sound. Throughout the novel, Julia tends
                  to convert incidental sounds (such as the rowing of oars in the water nearby the castle)
                  into songs (or what she calls “hymns”), so as to produce “holy enthusiasm” and a stolen
                  “sigh of exstacy.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note23" id="Note23_return"><sup class="super">
                        (21)
                        </sup></a> This is perhaps part of her general tendency—also a tendency of Radcliffe’s—to “transform
                  the utilitarian into the aesthetic.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note24" id="Note24_return"><sup class="super">
                        (22)
                        </sup></a> The central question for the other characters then becomes: how can one look at this
                  play of sound? Which is also to ask: how can we see someone hide from view, except
                  insofar as they do so “ineffectually,” and thus <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>hide from view? Ferdinand’s method is to watch by listening.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand’s report of sonic voyeurism folds back on itself because, all the while,
                  Julia is eavesdropping from a closet near the gallery, that quintessential parlor
                  of Romantic visuality. She crouches there, where she cannot be seen, because she is
                  afraid of being overheard: “She hardly dared to breathe, much less to move, . . .
                  lest the sound of her step should betray her.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note25" id="Note25_return"><sup class="super">
                        (23)
                        </sup></a> Fearful of being seen, she “moved softly,” but “the sound of her step alarmed the
                  count.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note26" id="Note26_return"><sup class="super">
                        (24)
                        </sup></a> Hearing the gentle footsteps, Hippolitus bursts into the closet to discover her;
                  mortified, she “hid her face in her robe.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note27" id="Note27_return"><sup class="super">
                        (25)
                        </sup></a> Ostrich-like, Julia signals her refusal to gaze rather than be seen: she is content
                  to be looked at but not, any longer, to inhabit a hidden point of auditory oversight.
                  Hippolitus responds with “expressive silence,” an oxymoronic state that suffices until
                  he can “[recover] . . . his voice.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note28" id="Note28_return"><sup class="super">
                        (26)
                        </sup></a> Throughout this complicated and multi-layered tableau, sight cannot be disentangled
                  from sound, and nor is either, as Milbank holds, particularly the domain of patriarchal
                  tyrants.<a class="note_back" href="#Note29" id="Note29_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>Julia, like her brother, is hiding so as not to be heard and is ashamed when her footsteps
                  are seen. To borrow from Slavoj Žižek, we might say that: <span class="quote">‘voice does not simply persist at a different level with regard to what we see, it

                  a marker of the impossible. These effects, most importantly, continue to cross levels
                  of narration: Julia is twice hidden from view here, first in “some lonely spot” and
                  then in the gallery, where she overhears the tale of her own hiddenness; her body,
                  hidden from tales of its own hiddenness, seems to emit sounds, constantly at both
                  levels, which render her visible. Here, as in Yael Shapira’s analysis of <span style="font-style:italic">The Italian</span>, “the ideology of the polite body and the challenges it presents to women are woven
                  into the very fabric of [Radcliffe’s] writing.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note31" id="Note31_return"><sup class="super">
                        (29)
                        </sup></a> There is something in these sounds, occurring simultaneously across the two levels
                  of narration, that speaks to Julia’s presence and yet seems far in excess of her status
                  as a subject. The mysterious capacities of sound, always disclosing more than Julia
                  intends, repeatedly interfere with her ability to remain hidden. Yet, it is Julia’s
                  continuing visibility, as she buries herself in her cloak in response to being unhidden,
                  that silences the man who has seen her.</p>
               <p>Such synesthetic situations characterize the first half of the novel. Julia, for instance,
                  spends a lot of time looking for sound, as when “their steps ran in whispering echoes
                  through the gallery, and often did Julia cast a fearful glance around.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note32" id="Note32_return"><sup class="super">

                  which led up to the south tower of the castle. Ferdinand paused to listen.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note33" id="Note33_return"><sup class="super">
                        (31)
                        </sup></a> Ferdinand, shortly after, finds that sound and vision work at cross-purposes but
                  simultaneously: “A faint sound died away along the passage, the windings of which
                  prevented his seeing the figure he pursued.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note34" id="Note34_return"><sup class="super">
                        (32)
                        </sup></a> The prepositional phrase “of which” retains a certain ambiguity here, as its syntax
                  could pertain equally to the passage or the sound; because of this ambiguity, the
                  passage inadvertently suggests that the windings of a sound are preventing Ferdinand
                  from seeing. Yet, although we are told that the sound “died away” as the sightline
                  vanishes, these are not presented as parallel effects—it’s not, for instance, <span style="font-style:italic">the shape of the passage blocked both the sightline and sound</span>—but as independent experiences each ending in sensory failure. When sight and sound
                  are presented in parallel, the link between them is defined (as in the previous passage)
                  by lack, absence, and exceptionality: “<span style="font-style:italic">Nothing met the eye</span> but beauty and romantic splendor;<span style="font-style:italic">the ear received no sounds</span> but those of mirth and melody,” the narrator says of a Mazzini family festival, as
                  if an overabundance of joyful sounds and sights would best be represented through
                  figures of lack failing.<a class="note_back" href="#Note35" id="Note35_return"><sup class="super">

                  a semicolon, the subjects of these clauses—i.e., “nothing” and “the ear”—are unexpectedly
                  not parallel. It is as if the ear is the equivalent instrument to the nothing that
                  meets the eye. Is this not also what Hippolitus discovers in the gallery closet? These
                  are the “strange contingenc[ies]” of lack in sound that characterize the gaze throughout
                  Radcliffe’s second novel.<a class="note_back" href="#Note36" id="Note36_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>This “nothing” discovered at the juncture of sight and sound radically complicates
                  any attempt to theorize the novel’s visual field. I am thinking especially of Michel
                  Foucault’s commentary on Radcliffe, which remains influential within studies of the
                  Gothic. Foucault characterizes the latter half of the eighteenth century as a campaign
                  against dark spaces; “the new political and moral order could not be established until
                  those places were eradicated.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note37" id="Note37_return"><sup class="super">
                        (35)

                  novels are composed of . . . imaginary spaces [that] are like the negative of the
                  transparency and visibility which it is aimed to establish.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note38" id="Note38_return"><sup class="super">

                  to operate justly and efficiently, secrets must be laid bare and people thoroughly
                  seen. It is a world organized by “an inspecting gaze” in search of “exact legibility,”

               <p>The novel does explore the relationship between panopticism and authority, for instance
                  when the evil Marquis tries to assure his retinue that the tower is “not haunted”
                  by swearing that “you shall see the whole of these buildings,” or when it insists

                  Emilia that we believe in ghosts because we believe in God—which means that if ghosts
                  do sometimes appear, it’s because God has authorized it: “be assured that there are

                  regimes. Yet the narrator—another form of all-seeing entity—immediately offers that

                     swept from the earth. ‘Thus,’ said I, ‘shall the present generation—he who now sinks

                     heart swelled with the reflection; and, as I turned from the scene with a sigh, I
                     fixed my eyes upon a friar, whose venerable figure, gently bending towards the earth,

                  imagined “voices” as a “picture” capable of “reflection.” The frame narrator, hearing
                  a visual spectacle, concludes that previous generations will be forgotten, despite
                  seeming to hear “voices” that would testify to exactly the opposite. In another twist,
                  the voices are not “real” but a mental extrapolation from the visual scene. The entire
                  story to follow would lead someone to precisely the opposite conclusion: the previous
                  generation may be repressed, but only incompletely; one’s ancestors remain very much
                  present and audible, even if out of view for a long time. Immediately the frame narrator
                  gets caught between written and oral histories, as the friar tries to convince the
                  frame narrator that further information is to be acquired in a manuscript “of which

                  reasons recounts the history of the castle to our frame narrator orally. From there,
                  it gets assembled into “abstracts” for the reader’s view, which give body to the “voices”

                  formal genres of print poetics than it resurfaces there.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note55" id="Note55_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>Although, throughout the novel and its narrative structure, voice refuses to be subsumed
                  into visual ways of knowing and, by extension, print media, a moment in the main narrative
                  turns this structure on its head. In a reversal of what will befall the frame narrator,
                  Julia and Madame de Menon find that they are seen as they look upon the same ruined
                  castle, and find themselves explaining their history to the abate’s predecessor. They,
                  too, find that voices—this time of Julia’s father’s spies—interfere with their visual
                  experience of the space: “As Julia gave a last look to the scene, she perceived two
                  men leaning upon a part of the ruin at some distance, in earnest conversation. As
                  they spoke, their looks were so attentively bent on her.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note56" id="Note56_return"><sup class="super">

                  at a conversation, especially one in which she finds herself the object of the discussants’
                  own looks? This is what Nina Sun Eidsheim would call a “sonic reduction”: that is,
                  the use of figural language to place a sound, in all of its unlimited multidimensionality,
                  within a meaningful register.<a class="note_back" href="#Note57" id="Note57_return"><sup class="super">

                  ones, so our tendency to treat it only auditorily amounts to a sustained, collective
                  act of figuration. Radcliffe, though, is experimenting here with a different sort
                  of sonic reduction, one that uses visual tropes to report on sound, and works through
                  negation and interruption: rightly fearful, the two women “walked swiftly through
                  the woods, … [and] were surprized to observe the distance to which they had strayed
                  from the monastery, whose dark towers were now obscurely seen rising among the trees

                  their <span style="font-style:italic">distance</span> from the towers rather than the towers directly. Yet they report having seen, however
                  “obscurely,” something that was “closed” from their perspective. They see the men
                  pursuing them but conclude, strangely, that it does not look like a pursuit: “On looking
                  back, they perceived the same men slowly advancing, without any appearance of pursuit,
                  but clearly as if observing the place of their retreat.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note59" id="Note59_return"><sup class="super">

               <h2><span class="head">2. The Sound of the Gaze Beyond Sartre’s Keyhole</span></h2>
               <p>Excerpts like these lead us to reexamine Foucault’s panopticon thesis. Certainly,
                  as Foucault suggests, this is a novel filled with secret passageways and dark forests
                  that could be improved through better lighting. But the anchor of the visual field—indeed,
                  across the novel, a substantial number of different visual fields—seems to be a spot
                  that cannot be synthesized into it, from which Julia, Ferdinand, or the frame narrator
                  can gaze. They frequently see things that are specifically closed to her view—not
                  by opening new avenues for sight, but precisely by remaining in the place where visibility
                  fails. Voice and sound seem to be the mechanisms by which this impossible point can
                  be sutured within the visual field—it is as if the entire visual field is constructed
                  around the excessive lack in the object voice. Because of this, we will need to seek
                  a theoretical model better equipped to think about the holes in the scene that cannot
                  be seen. Although the novel arguably displays a desire for total and full illumination
                  and disclosure, it positions its viewers somewhere that cannot be synthesized into
                  that panoptic fantasy. They can only “radically disidentify” with their environs and
                  foster “uncommon, illiberal sensibilities” expressed through silence.<a class="note_back" href="#Note60" id="Note60_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>Thus, it is significant that the secret passageways of Castle Mazzini are investigated
                  auditorily—which is far from saying that the experience is not visual. For instance:
                  <span class="quote">‘Ferdinand carefully sounded the wall which communicated with the southern buildings.
                     From one part of it a sound was returned, which convinced him there was something
                     less solid than stone. He removed the tapestry, and behind it appeared, to his inexpressible
                     satisfaction, a small door.<a class="note_back" href="#Note62" id="Note62_return"><sup class="super">

                  of Castle Mazzini by hearing one’s own sound “returned” by the castle itself: it is
                  as if Ferdinand’s desire is the desire of the Other, and so only through the “returned”
                  sound can Ferdinand recognize himself and feel “satisfaction.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note63" id="Note63_return"><sup class="super">

                  Lifting the tapestry, he confirms by sight the thing that he has heard. His satisfaction
                  in the discovery, though, remains “inexpressible”: it is the part that cannot be articulated
                  or mapped even at the point of the door’s discovery. What had seemed to be a satisfyingly
                  reciprocal call from the other side soon becomes excessive and autonomous: as Ferdinand
                  “stood gazing on the door, and inwardly lamenting, . . . a low hollow sound was heard
                  from beneath. Emilia and Julia seized his arm; and almost sinking with apprehension,
                  listened in profound silence. A footstep was distinctly heard.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note64" id="Note64_return"><sup class="super">

                  finds that even concrete sounds point to an excessive, inassimilable lack in the auditor.
                  Julia and Emilia endure Ferdinand’s efforts to open the secret door “in fearful silence,
                  but no sound disturbed the stillness of night”; they bravely “followed in silence”

               <p>Ed Pluth and Cindy Zeiher have called attention to Lacan’s early theorization of silences

                  1929 murders committed by Christine and Lea Papin, commentary which came three years
                  prior to his first iteration of the mirror stage. Pluth and Zeiher adopt this early
                  Lacan text as a way to think about imaginary relations through sound and silence,
                  rather than, as we might normally expect from Lacan, through sight and mirroring.<a class="note_back" href="#Note68" id="Note68_return"><sup class="super">

                  “meaningful” nor, as Lacan stresses, “empty”; rather, their violent act—killing their
                  employers by gauging out their eyes before bludgeoning and stabbing them to death,
                  and then retiring to bed together—was a way of interrupting a structural, enforced
                  silence that had pervaded their workplace, the victims’ home. As Pluth and Zeiher
                  indicate, this spectacular violence was an act of self-punishment at the level of
                  the imaginary, as the sisters, being their victims’ domestic maids, had come to feel
                  like doubles of their employers within the house. By gauging out their employers’
                  eyes and then remaining silent in court and to the press, the Papin sisters attacked
                  the very mechanism through which the identification had happened, offering their own
                  silence as a cut in what had been a visual circuit.<a class="note_back" href="#Note69" id="Note69_return"><sup class="super">

                  not empty, and that indicate the oppressive patriarchal structure governing Castle
                  Mazzini. Madame de Menon, for instance, in first telling Julia about her mother, fuses
                  surveillance and sound in telling Julia that Louisa “would steal to her harpsichord”

                  and Julia simply have dinner and then go right back to the story within in the same
                  paragraph, like nothing had happened. The reader is left with a bizarre narrative
                  interruption, bizarre because it doesn’t actually interrupt anything. The interruption,
                  rather, is registered at the level of narrative but felt at the level of the story,
                  as the sound makes conspicuous its own construction <span style="font-style:italic">après coup</span>. The narrator’s emphasis in telling us the story of Julia being told a story is on

                  Julia is not like Louisa in the sense that both play musical instruments in defiance
                  of patriarchal supervision, but rather they are linked by the way that this bond actually
                  severs that relation. We have found, here, a way to traverse “the strange loop, the
                  tie between inner and outer, the short circuit between the external contingency and
                  the intimate, the curious match of the click [or in this case, musical sound, which
                  has become a hollow knock] and the inner sexual arousal.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note73" id="Note73_return"><sup class="super">

                  by the subject of the story itself, as if the story’s content had managed to interrupt
                  its own narration, to ask for help in being discovered. The novel’s main plot is thus
                  made possible by the interruption of its backstory. Only through this interruption
                  can Julia be reunited with her mother, whose voice, Dolar reminds us, is often “the
                  first problematic connection to the other, the immaterial tie that comes to replace

               <p>These sounds are disruptive in their absence as much as in their presence. Radcliffe,
                  writes Anna Shajirat, chronicles the “irrevocable disruption” stemming from the “mundane
                  realities” of eighteenth-century women’s lives, and thereby theorizes “the trauma

                  void at the center of a void,” according to which the patriarchal legal frameworks

                  footsteps, seems largely defined by the absence of sound: “a melancholy stillness
                  reigned through the halls, and the silence of the courts . . . was for many hours

                  the silence is then interrupted by tales of silence, which are interrupted by further
                  routinized silences. This is perhaps why, as Madame de Manon implies, the ghosts are
                  an effect of silence and an aspect of the master’s gaze, and why the Real becomes,
                  as Lacan warns, in Julia “to a very great degree the accomplice of the drive.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note79" id="Note79_return"><sup class="super">

                  period, all while heeding the warning that “Lacan’s theory of the gaze suffers under
                  a certain degree of compartmentalization and manipulation” when adapted for literary

                  gaze: one looks at things, but is beheld by the gaze, and the relation between these
                  levels is vastly asymmetrical. The gaze happens, for instance, when Ferdinand and
                  Julia, hiding in a cave worthy of Plato, detect shadows disappearing behind a rock:
                  they feel themselves being seen from a point that they cannot see.<a class="note_back" href="#Note82" id="Note82_return"><sup class="super">
                        (80)
                        </sup></a> The gaze, in Lacan’s analysis, is not, then, merely the depersonalized exercise of
                  supervisory power; it is a traumatic point in a visual field that cannot be incorporated
                  or claimed but that cuts open the subject. Lacan developed his theory of the gaze
                  as a rejoinder to Jean-Paul Sartre, who had discussed the gaze in <span style="font-style:italic">Being and Nothingness</span>. Explains Lacan: <span class="quote">‘If you turn to Sartre’s own text, you will see that, far from speaking of the emergence
                     of this gaze as of something that concerns the organ of sight, he refers to the sound
                     of rustling leaves, suddenly heard while out hunting, to a footstep heard in a corridor.
                     And when are these sounds heard? At the moment when he has presented himself in the
                     action of looking through a keyhole. A gaze surprises him in the function of voyeur,
                     disturbs him, overwhelms him and reduces him to a feeling of shame. The gaze in question
                     is certainly the presence of others as such. But does this mean that originally it
                     is in the relation of subject to subject, in the function of the existence of others
                     as looking at me, that we apprehend what the gaze really is? <a class="note_back" href="#Note83" id="Note83_return"><sup class="super">

                  “no,” has clear implications for <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span>. We have seen how, for Ferdinand, silence guarantees a certain invisibility, and
                  how, further, a sound is “satisfying” to the extent that one’s “soundings” are returned
                  proportionately by the Other. We have also seen that, for Louisa in the narrative
                  of Madame de Menon, sound provides a cut in the structural conditions of Castle Mazzini.
                  In each case, the gaze sustains desire; it is not a map of the symbolic space that
                  the Marquis gets to monitor. Part of the operation of that gaze is how Julia’s desire
                  gains its form through a sonic interruption, rather than being contained by her father’s
                  supervisory apparatuses. The relation at work is not, as Lacan hints, “subject to
                  subject,” but rather in the asymmetrical experience of finding oneself in the invisible
                  hiding place of the Other, seeing oneself being seen from that impossible vantage.</p>
               <p>As Lacan suggests, Sartre’s “own text” is indeed very interesting in this regard,
                  for the insistent way that it crosses the registers of sound with sight. Sartre’s
                  first test case for the gaze focuses on the voice, when: “this voice which I hear
                  is that of a man and not a song on a phonograph.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note84" id="Note84_return"><sup class="super">

                  how “I,” with my enduring subjectivity, cannot so easily become a pure object like,
                  say, the grass, because, as he explains, “‘Being seen-by-the-Other’ is the truth of
                  ‘seeing-the-Other’” <a class="note_back" href="#Note85" id="Note85_return"><sup class="super">

                  Lacan’s interest: “Let us imagine that moved by jealousy, curiosity, or vice I have

                  something anatomically impossible: how can someone look through a keyhole with their

                  behind a tapestry, as in <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span>—“a spectacle is presented as ‘to be seen,’ a conversation as ‘to be heard’”; it is

               <p>Lacan emphasizes, with regard to the passage in Sartre, that the gaze is exercised
                  through sound rather than sight. The gaze is never one’s own activity, and it is not
                  as simple as one’s being-looked-at; rather, it is specifically the sound of one’s
                  being looked at. This is, I would say, a capable interpretation of the passage from
                  Sartre—an element of Sartre’s text that is present but not adequately factored into
                  his thinking. When sound becomes an element of one’s perverse enjoyment, attesting
                  to “the presence of others as such,” one experiences the gaze—which is always, it
                  seems, a humiliating ordeal. The gaze is the experience of hearing oneself being watched
                  while we are watching and listening. Lacan’s point is that the desiring subject is
                  created, even sustained, through such triangulation.<a class="note_back" href="#Note90" id="Note90_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>The knock resonating through Castle Mazzini is just such an event. It is a pure part
                  object, causing anxiety given its proximity to the partial drive. It is effectively
                  a voice (testifying to a human presence) but with no content—it actively<span style="font-style:italic">says nothing</span> rather than merely being unclear. Yet the knock is noteworthy, among the millions
                  of small sounds that surely bombard Julia and Ferdinand every day, for seeming to
                  carry a meaning: it seems to say something or at least request the opportunity to
                  do so. Yet it also, like any voice, seems “strangely recalcitrant to” meaning; it
                  is a “material element” of communication that “<span style="font-style:italic">does not contribute to making sense</span>” (Dolar 15, emphasis in the original). The knock is an exemplary case of “a voice
                  and nothing more,” as Dolar would say. It is <span class="quote">‘the grain of an inexplicable noise, a mysterious sound, which can appear even with
                     the tiniest click. At the origin of fantasy there is a traumatic kernel materialized
                     by the voice, the noise—we should allow full latitude here to a sonority not pertaining

                  gaze, arrives from a place in the castle yet outside the castle, or even beyond the
                  castle. It is in this sense that Julia, like Sartre’s voyeur, is being gazed at by
                  a sound. It is repeated at intervals in the story, and the intervals come and go in
                  intervals of their own: “The sounds were repeated, at intervals, for near an hour,
                  when silence returned . . . [for] the rest of the night.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note92" id="Note92_return"><sup class="super">

                  seem to epitomize both the “unspeakable” and “live burial” topoi, which Eve Kosofsky
                  Sedgwick argues are foundational to the genre. Much as Sedgwick affirms, these topoi
                  take on multiple resonances throughout the text, repeatedly connecting Julia to her
                  mother through a set of structural redundancies.<a class="note_back" href="#Note94" id="Note94_return"><sup class="super">

                  comically creates cases of mistaken identity: the fourth terrifying knock on the door
                  is actually just Ferdinand; Julia loves the song “Sonnet” but doesn’t know who sang
                  it; Ferdinand, having heard the sound through the hidden door, is afraid of his own

                  their shared refusal to find meaning in these object voices. Julia, after all, plays
                  the lute in a manner “which seem[s] to breathe a soul through the sound, and which
                  take[s] captive the heart of the hearer.” <a class="note_back" href="#Note97" id="Note97_return"><sup class="super">

                  of imprisonment turn on themselves and become complicit in that imprisonment. In effect,
                  Radcliffe here achieves at the figural level the same sort of twisted Moebius pattern
                  that she had achieved at the narratological level, just a few pages earlier, in the
                  narrative frame. Yet it is a figure not of connection but of a cut. Although Julia,
                  Louisa, and probably Hippolitus each play the lute, what they have in common is not
                  some sort of shared musicianship but the way that each relates, through the musical
                  note, to the surplus enjoyment causing them anxiety. What they have in common is how
                  this signifier, now barred from any signification, “compresses the enigma of the Other

                  is, as Lacan would say, “pouring [herself], as it were, along the veins through which

               <p>Early in <span style="font-style:italic">The Interpretation of Dreams</span>, Freud considers a problem encountered by his predecessor in dream-theorization,
                  F. W. Hildebrandt. Hildebrandt had, in the late nineteenth century, analyzed three
                  very different dreams of his own, each punctuated by a sharp sound which, it turns
                  out, was really him registering the sound of his alarm clock and attempting to incorporate
                  the interruption into the dream. Hildebrandt dreamed, in one case, of a church bell;
                  in another, of the jingle of a horse’s sleigh-bell; and in a third, of a kitchen-maid
                  loudly dropping a tall stack of dishes, in dread of the very same alarm clock. In
                  each case, the dreaming Hildebrandt responded to the jarring alarm clock with an attempt
                  to continue sleeping by incorporating the interruption into the narrative of his dream.<a class="note_back" href="#Note102" id="Note102_return"><sup class="super">
                        (100)
                        </sup></a> Freud asks: why would the mind make “the arbitrary decision” to assign the sound
                  to something else, when it knows an alarm clock lies in wait? Would not the dreamer’s
                  attempt to continue sleeping be more effective if he were to dream of an alarm clock
                  directly? Freud compares the situation to seeing a cow in a distant field and convincing
                  oneself, through the inadequacy of one’s vantage, that it is a horse.<a class="note_back" href="#Note103" id="Note103_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a> Breaking with Hildebrandt, Freud urges us to go beyond objective stimuli to understand
                  this phenomenon.<a class="note_back" href="#Note104" id="Note104_return"><sup class="super">

                  looking for sources of dreams inside the organism instead of outside it.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note105" id="Note105_return"><sup class="super">

                  and confined meanings stop having stable meanings once they have been introjected.
                  The cut is interior to the subject now, even while, as a fragment of the real, it
                  remains something forever excluded. “Where am I in relation to my desire?” is a more
                  relevant question in these cases than “what is that sound?”</p>
               <p><span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance </span>is, by the standards of an eighteenth-century novel, unexpectedly replete with alarm
                  clocks. Early in the novel, for instance, as Julia lies awake late at night reading,
                  she “was roused from her forgetfulness, by the sound of the castle clock, which struck
                  one.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note106" id="Note106_return"><sup class="super">

                  chime at 1:00 at night? She is jarred by its failure to interpellate her, which she
                  takes as a possible temporal misalignment between herself and her environs: not being
                  asleep, she cannot recognize herself as the proper subject of its rousing chime, which
                  is ironically why it rouses her into an important discovery. The sound leads her to
                  the window, where she sees for the first time, in the form of an inexplicable light,
                  the central mystery of the South tower. As she continues to watch, she finds herself
                  “survey[ing] the scene” as it “echoed the sounds of gaiety and gladness” at the marchioness’s
                  return.<a class="note_back" href="#Note107" id="Note107_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>The scenario recurs later in the novel, in a twist that will force the meaning of
                  the bell inward, into Julia, rather than into any external signifying system. This
                  time, inappropriately-timed sounds seem to beget further sounds, rather than sights,
                  which Julia finds disquieting: <span class="quote">‘Julia was awakened by the bell of the monastery. She knew it was not the hour customary

                  time of her lifespan rather than any objective, chrononormative time in the world,
                  which is to say that she seems to have traversed another Moebius strip of sorts: whereas
                  once she had feared that the clocks had slipped out of time, she now fears that <span style="font-style:italic">she herself </span>is slipping out of their regulatory mechanisms. Its ring now produces a “thrill” for
                  Julia, who is anxious about eloping with Hippolitus while “the silence of the place
                  remained undisturbed.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note111" id="Note111_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a> If, for Coleridge, sound is powerful because of its intrinsic ambiguity, for Radcliffe
                  sound is powerful because it can interrupt a state of uncertainty, and anchor meaning
                  through its very capacity for polysemy and repetition. Julia, who is on the verge
                  of a perilous attempt to escape from her prison-like existence with her illicit lover,
                  the attempt at which will, sadly, immediately cost him his life, comes to associate,
                  even in advance, the object-voice with life and its cessation with death. It is as
                  if she has internalized the sound of the clock and made it part of her own unconscious
                  aspiration toward stillness. In this sense, she embodies Freud’s analysis of Hildebrandt’s
                  alarm clock dreams: the important thing is no longer the external stimulus of the
                  alarm clock—when will it ring, and how will Julia react?—but in her own introjection
                  of its chime. As Žižek explains in another context: “Far more horrifying than to see
                  with our ears—to hear the vibrating life substance beyond visual representations,
                  this blind spot in the field of the visible—is to hear with our eyes, that is, to
                  see the absolute silence that marks the suspension of life.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note112" id="Note112_return"><sup class="super">

                  of her own jouissance returning to her as an object voice.</p>
               <p>Having traversed that loop across the first half of the novel, we can compare its
                  structure to a passage in Chapter 2, in which Julia is roused by a lovely song being
                  played outside her window. This is the night of the Mazzini family ball, after which,
                  we are told, she “retired to her apartment, but not to sleep”; as she fantasizes about
                  Hippolitus in a “state of entranced delight, she was awakened by the sound of music
                  immediately under her window.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note113" id="Note113_return"><sup class="super">

                  being awake, much as the bell in the previous chapter had done. She supposes, because
                  it is sung by “a voice of more than magic expression” accompanied by “a lute touched
                  by a masterly hand,” that Hippolitus must be courting her. This musical evidence,
                  despite her not knowing if Hippolitus can even sing or play the lute, “confirms” what
                  had previously been her mere belief that “she was loved by Hippolitus.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note114" id="Note114_return"><sup class="super">

                  the stanza form. One wonders: where and why did it get this title? Did Hippolitus
                  announce the title before playing it, or did Julia, with apparently limited knowledge
                  of verse forms, conclude that the title was appropriate? Or is it the work of the
                  frame narrator working from oral “abstracts”? Would a late-sixteenth-century Italian
                  like Julia recognize this rhyme scheme as the beginning of an English sonnet, even
                  without the final six lines? The song itself, in a cruel irony, proposes that “not

                        </sup></a> Neither Julia nor the narrator seems to note that she has been “awakened” from “not
                  . . . sleep” by a non-sonnet called “Sonnet” that recounts how the absence of sound
                  can pass through the silence. The scene in many ways presages the scene immediately
                  following—and already discussed above—in which Madame de Menon’s story about musical
                  sounds is interrupted by a musical sound. It is as if the novel must explore the topic
                  first with regard to interrupted silence before presenting an analogous case involving
                  interrupted tales of sound. While many people, myself included, would be irritated
                  to be awakened by someone singing about silence, Julia savors the return of her lost
                  jouissance in this impossible utterance: “she then perceived that love may produce
                  other sensations than those of delight.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note116" id="Note116_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>The voice in this case functions as an autonomous part object, a gap in the visual
                  field that constructs and sustains Julia’s desire. It “belongs” to Hippolitus only
                  in her fantasy, and links the lovers through the cut it enacts.<a class="note_back" href="#Note117" id="Note117_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a> That cut, we might say, is their only real sexual relation. Repeatedly, we find that
                  “the object voice emerges in counterpoint with the visible and the visual, it cannot
                  be disentangled from the gaze which offers its framework, so that both the gaze and
                  the voice appear as objects in the gaps as a result of which they never quite match.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note118" id="Note118_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a> Yet they, like Julia and Hippolitus, are made inseparable by this mismatch. The “strange
                  and alarming sounds” of <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span> impinge upon and contain traces of the visual register precisely because they are
                  the points excluded from that register, and around which that register has been constructed.<a class="note_back" href="#Note119" id="Note119_return"><sup class="super">

               <h2><span class="head">4. Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>Radcliffe hears lack as a positive presence in its own right, consistently crossing
                  the visual and sonic registers to highlight a multisensory ambiguity. The text attempts
                  recourse to sonic reduction, but can figure this ambiguity only as a lack in the listener.
                  This lack, appearing as a disquieting excess of sound-in-vision and vision-in-sound,
                  interferes even with the figural, formal, and narratological processes of the text.
                  Radcliffe subjects her characters to a sonic voyeurism that exceeds Foucauldian and
                  Sartrean models of the gaze. By staging silences that are not empty within gazes that
                  are not silent, and by allowing even the absence of sound to interrupt both the characters
                  and the narration, Radcliffe challenges emergent visual epistemologies of the eighteenth
                  century and reorganizes prevailing patterns of Enlightenment subjectivity. Lack, in
                  her account, is not something missing but something present and resonant.</p>
