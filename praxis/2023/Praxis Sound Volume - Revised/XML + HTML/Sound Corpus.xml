               <head>Introduction: Sound Studies in Romanticism</head>

                  <docAuthor>Michele Speitz</docAuthor>

               <p>This collection takes up two interrelated questions. One, how might the
                interdisciplinary field of sound studies change the way we engage with Romantic
                literature? Two, how can sound studies foment broader inquiries into a range of
                Romanticisms not exclusive to British Romanticism? Inspired by such thinking, the
                essays gathered here attest to how sound studies can uncover a multisensorial
                Romanticism steeped in narratives of experiential history not limited to Romantic
                literatures of just one place or people or time. As questions of multisensory
                meaning and experience arise as a red thread running across the volume, attendant
                questions pertaining to the stakes of human relationality both in a social sense and
                an environmental one become impossible to ignore. The volume stands as a fresh
                complement to 2008 <hi rend="italic">Praxis</hi> volume edited by Susan J. Wolfson
                and titled “<ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/praxis/soundings/index.html">Soundings of Things Done”: The Poetry and Poetics of Sound in the Romantic Ear
                    and Era</ref>. While those generative essays deal chiefly with “the sounding
                sense of Romantic poetry, both thematically (a poetics of sound) and
                sensually/phonically (the poetry of sound and the sound of poetry),” this volume
                studies sound through a wider cross-section of Romantic genres. This includes not
                poetry alone but also periodicals, drama, and the novel as well as governmental,
                musical, and scientific literature (1). And whereas the previous volume foregrounds
                Wordsworthian poetics and a smaller subset of authors of British Romanticism, these
                essays increase their reach to include a wider array of writers, German Romanticism,
                and extra-Romantic historical and contemporary documents on sound, voice, and
                song.</p>
               <p>This collection, then, begins to open up larger conversations for scholars and
                readers of Romantic-era literature and culture such that they might consider a wider
                assortment of representations of sounds, silences, voices, calls, quietudes,
                volumes, modes of listening, sensing, and interpreting sonic experiences, including
                human and nonhuman sound-bound relations. By so doing—in some small yet important
                way—these essays herald Dylan Robinson’s recent call to acknowledge “how writing
                allows certain moments of sonic experience to be heard while foreclosing upon
                others” and how a person’s “positionality guides the way [they] listen” (1). There
                is a politics to how we make sense of sound, how we mark sonic experiences, how we
                record practices of listening, voicing, sounding, hearing—as Steingo and Sykes
                remind us, nearly two decades ago Jonathan Sterne noted in the <hi rend="italic">Audible Past</hi> “that, in the West, the ‘differences between hearing and
                seeing’ … [are] <hi rend="italic">ideologically loaded</hi> (2 original
                emphasis).</p>
               <p>Sterne’s iconic essay, “Sonic Imagination” from <hi rend="italic">The Sound Studies
                    Reader</hi> (2012), defines sound studies as an interdisciplinary project “that
                takes sound as its analytical point of departure or arrival” (2). To “<hi rend="italic">think sonically</hi>” entails “analyzing both sonic practices and
                the discourses and institutions that describe them” (2). The task of the critic of
                sound studies, then, is to “redescribe what sound does in the human world, and what
                humans do in the sonic world,” to “always go beyond … common-sense categories” to
                uncover “what we don’t already know” (2). In keeping with Sterne’s definition, the
                essays appearing here attune readers to Romantic representations of human sonic
                worlds as well as more-than-human sonic worlds to underscore the key parts played
                therein by sound. Across the whole, the volume experiments with making sense of
                Romantic literature by way of sound studies. Consequently, and as this volume’s
                readers will learn for themselves, every one of these essays features questions of
                relationality. In this sense, the volume coheres in the manner of a chorus uniting
                voices of all sorts that in this instance cannot but sing of relationality because
                sound does not exist in a vacuum and because its histories are more contingently
                experiential than broadly universal. </p>
               <p>Each author demonstrates how sound studies alerts us to key dimensions of Romantic
                literatures and cultures that we didn’t already know. The collection moves from
                rethinking modes of lyric listening to discovering the role that sonic thinking and
                feeling plays in conceptualizing the Romantic power of the imagination. It registers
                the ways in which sonic terror operates in the gothic novel. It broadcasts how
                understanding sound not only in a narrow auditory sense but as a relational
                multisensory experience enables us to reconceive Romanticism’s models of
                epistemology, ecology, and aesthetics. Sound studies makes it impossible to <hi rend="italic">un</hi>hear Romantic literature’s preoccupation with ways of
                knowing and feeling that couple together this sensory mode with that, ultimately
                complicating simplistic accounts of the imperial, oppressive primacy of the
                visual.</p>
               <p>In homage to the original <hi rend="italic">Praxis</hi> volume on sound and its
                nuanced discussions of British Romantic lyric in particular, this volume’s opening
                essays stage a veritable dialogue on representations of sound in Samuel Taylor
                Coleridge’s classic poem “Frost at Midnight.” Mina Gorji’s and Elizabeth Weybright’s
                respective treatments of one poem, Coleridge’s “Frost at Midnight”(c. 1798),
                showcase how reading Romantic poetry in light of the sound studies turn can yield
                profuse interpretive futures for studies in Romanticism. </p>
               <p>Gorji’s “Lyric Listening” inquires into the place of sound and volume as well as
                listening – or the lack thereof - in lyric studies. Using Coleridge’s poem and lyric
                theory as key points of departure, Gorji notes how the word
                <hi rend="italic">volume </hi>“acquired an acoustic register in
                the late eighteenth century” and explains that the <hi rend="italic">OED</hi>’s
                first recorded use of the term bearing this new meaning is attributed to Byron’s
                <hi rend="italic">Werner </hi>(1822). Gorji contends
                that while “Frost at Midnight” does not use the term <hi rend="italic">volume</hi>
                itself, the poem bespeaks a Coleridgean “preoccup[ation] with how to represent
                sounds and especially volume, and that his imaginative interest in acoustics and in
                musical forms and notation informed the way he shaped sound into both aural patterns
                and visual language in his poetry." </p>
               <p>Gorji questions how lyric poetry might serve as “a container for sound” or as an
                “expression of volume” through a richly contextualized interpretation of “Frost at
                Midnight.” The essay grapples with how the poem “records a playful exploration of
                dynamics and of the various ways (graphic, rhythmic, linguistic and as an effect of
                tempo) in which sound and quiet could be represented to both eye and ear in the
                poem." Extending Susan Wolfson’s essay in particular from the previous
                <hi rend="italic">Praxis </hi>volume on sound, Gorji thickens
                her consideration of “Frost at Midnight” with other contemporary and later lyric
                poetry to offer “the state of listening, hearkening” after “something” as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> “poetic state” of Romantic lyric. Gorji gives readers new
                ways to think about “the significance of silence and quiet in Coleridge’s poems, and
                in Romantic lyric more widely,” with the essay ultimately calling for a “new kind of
                listening” and pushing “Lyric Studies [to expand] the range and frequency of its
                listening.”</p>
               <p>Gorji’s work on Coleridge dovetails with Elizabeth Weybright’s “Unquiet
                Romanticism,” which likewise engages with “Frost at Midnight” and Wolfson’s
                “Sounding Romantic.” Yet Weybright’s approach departs from Gorji’s by offering a
                comparative reading of the poem that takes into account related representations of
                sound—and furthermore, noise—in Wordsworth’s
                <hi rend="italic">Prelude </hi>and Percy Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">Mont Blanc.</hi> Weybright’s essay demonstrates how “Romantic
                literary representations of listening present noise as an underpinning of
                phenomenological experience and audition” (23). Noise, as Romantic literature frames
                it, is “as an essential (sometimes involuntary) activity through which human
                subjects enter into self-reflective reciprocity with elements of their social and
                natural worlds” (23). In this sense, noise is defined as a dynamic interaction, one
                prompting humanity to recognize itself as always already in necessary dialogue with
                the cultural and natural worlds within which they reside. Building on influential
                theorizations of noise, sound, and silence penned by the likes of Jacques Attali,
                John Cage, Michael Chion, Jean-Luc Nancy, David Novak, Jonathan Sterne, Shelley
                Trower, Salomé Voegelin, and more, Weybright’s contribution to this volume
                resoundingly testifies to the rich upwellings of thought that arise from a
                conceptual terrain sensitive to both sound studies and studies of Romanticism. </p>
               <p>Rather than reading “Frost at Midnight” from a musical perspective akin to Gorji’s
                project, Weybright centers her inquiry into Romantic lyric poetry around the
                question of “how sounds … far removed from anything like musical organization (or
                even the categories of tonal sound available at the turn of the nineteenth century)
                might be generative points of contact between the creative mind and the phenomenal
                world” (6-7). For Weybright, figurations of “‘quiet’ things made ‘unquiet’” become
                central to understanding sound as it relates to models of subjectivity in Romantic
                lyric, particularly as Romantic poets’ “approaches to quietly noisy sounds … refuse
                absolute epistemological or symbolic stability” (2, 3). Weybright argues “that for
                the Romantics, listening to unquiet noise is often both an active ‘straining’ to
                place oneself as a creative agent in relation to the world and—somewhat
                paradoxically—a compelled state of receptive embodiment” where noise is not
                understood “as a one-dimensionally overwhelming, distracting or painful thing, but
                rather was an ambiguous, sometimes baffling, and sometimes imaginatively provocative
                presence” (3, 4). </p>
               <p>David Sigler’s essay dismantles the binary that counterpoises sound against vision.
                In “The sound of the gaze in Ann Radcliffe’s <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian
                    Romance</hi>” Sigler troubles the simplistic formula that takes sound as the
                bearer of mystery and vision as the bringer of knowledge. In the end, Sigler
                deconstructs the gaze-as-bad/sound-as-good dichotomy extant within Radcliffe
                criticism, Gothic Studies, and Romantic Studies more generally. The essay notes that
                in Radcliff’s novel, “sound … asks to be seen” and “show[s] vision to be an aspect
                of sound,” all of which allows Sigler to unearth “the psychic consequences of that
                sensory entanglement” (1, 4). It is less that we cannot know sound in Sigler’s
                analysis of Radcliff’s gothic novel, and more that - like desire - sound yields an
                “excess of signification” that could never be fully determined. Thereby sound
                harbors the power to terrify with its potential to lead us into spaces of the
                unknown and indeterminate. Sigler’s approach pairs sound studies with psychoanalysis
                to demonstrate that by “thinking about sound through epistemologies of vision,
                Radcliff could respond to contemporary debates about gender, class, and privilege”
                (3). That is, sound has the capacity to play such a role in the novel precisely
                because “sound (including music, noise, and silence) had an important visual
                component in the eighteenth-century English culture, especially for the construction
                of gender” (4).</p>
               <p>Sigler’s analysis of
                <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian Romance </hi>confirms that
                “Radcliff hears lack as a positive presence in its own right, consistently crossing
                the visual and sonic registers to highlight a multisensory ambiguity” (28).
                Intriguingly, by thinking with sound studies approaches, Sigler unearths how
                “Radcliff subjects her characters to a sonic voyeurism that exceeds Foucauldian and
                Sartrean models of the gaze” (28). The essay offers a fresh understanding of the
                novel by conveying how “Radcliff challenges emergent visual epistemologies of the
                eighteenth century and reorganizes prevailing patterns of Enlightenment
                subjectivity” (28). Through a compelling assessment of the sonic contexts within
                which Radcliff’s characters are placed, Sigler stresses how “lack, in [Radcliff’s]
                account, is not something missing but something present and resonant” (28). 
            </p>
               <p>Joel Faflak’s contribution, “Shelley’s Sound Body,” turns upon questions of voice,
                vocal expression, and listening in Percy Shelley’s lyrical drama
                <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound </hi>to confront the ways
                in which sound challenges sense making even as it is derived of the senses. Faflak’s
                project “explore[s an] incompossibility between voice and the said” in Shelley’s
                lines (1). Akin to Sigler’s work, Faflak acknowledges that “Romanticism inherits
                from the Enlightenment a preoccupation with sight, visuality, and the gaze as both
                formative and troubling forms of how an emergent modernity increasingly comes to
                apprehend the world” (2). But at the same time, Faflak underscores that “in its
                preoccupation with voice and sound, however, Romanticism explores what this
                apprehension misses” (2). More to the point, Romanticism’s debates around voice and
                sound foreground compelling questions of human potential and right action, where the
                very act of listening assumes a political edge and bears great ontological weight.
                Such debates held across Romantic literature announce “that human potential ‘does
                not [necessarily] solidify in an object of fetish reverence’—the kind of reverence
                that [in <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound</hi>] guarantees tyranny as a symbol
                and method of prescribing what humans and thus the human itself can and should be”
                (2).</p>
               <p>For Faflak, “sound in Shelley’s poem seems to be merely the medium” but in a sort of
                Kittleresque fashion “at the same time [sound] facilitates a mode of relationality
                that is the matrix of meaning itself without making meaning present” (23). Because
                sound acts as both medium and never-fully-present message in <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound</hi>, “sound insists on its own opacity,” and thus Shelley’s
                thinking chimes with Édourard Glissant’s when the latter writes of “the ‘errantry’
                of ‘Totality’s imaginary [which] allows the detours that lead away from anything
                totalitarian’” (23). Faflak argues that
                <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound </hi>“asks us to listen
                without prejudice, as if that is ever possible” since counter to any “illusions of
                transparency … listening requires the implicit acknowledgement that we can never
                truly understand what we are listening for” (24). In keeping with this ethos, though
                the poem directs readers to listen as an intrinsic good and goes so far as to devote
                the “fourth Act [to] a staging of the act of listening itself … the poem doesn’t
                tell us what to listen <hi rend="italic">for</hi>” (25, author’s emphasis). Instead,
                and in light of its prescription to listen,
                <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound </hi>scripts for its
                readers yet another unpredictable scene, a scene to be played out beyond the pages
                of the poem: “confronted by the nothingness of sound from which meaning can or might
                or might not come, we are nonetheless compelled to speak again” (25).</p>
               <p>Offering the collection’s closing argument, Gabriel Stephen Trop surveys significant
                works of German Romanticism to discuss how within this body of literature sounding
                objects figure “a metaphysical drama in acoustic form” (2). Beginning with the
                examples of the clock and the wind that famously open Novalis' novel
                <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen </hi>(1802), Trop
                insists that readers not “reduce [such] objects, in traditional terms, to the
                function of setting—to background conditions against which an event takes place”
                (2). Instead, Trop argues, “they indicate tensions in the dynamic from which
                entities emerge, the domain the Romantics and post-Kantian philosophers called the
                    <hi rend="italic">unconditioned </hi>(<hi rend="italic">das
                    Unbedingte</hi>): the absolute as that to which no conditions can be attached”
                (2). As Trop notes, whereas “the window is typically a privileged speculative site,
                the opening onto a space at once visual and visionary, in Novalis “the first sensory
                organ to register the drama of the unconditioned in this instance is the ear” (2).
                The essay finds that within various works of German Romanticism “it is not just that sound indicates the absolute as that
                    which is unconditioned, but that it constructs the real as a material-ideal
                    system in the process of turning against itself, moving amidst the peaks and
                    troughs of waves, perpetually unconditioning itself and carrying all beings
                    along in its wake” (33). In this sense, then, a larger implication of Trop’s
                    project is that sound carries us all in its wake.</p>
               <p>Across an ambitious yet careful analysis of sound in key works of German Romanticism,
                Trop emphasizes how such texts articulate “the irreducible gap between real and
                ideal as the basis for a diabolic and extra-normative generativity” (3). Trop
                engages with not just Novalis’ novel but also his “scientific and philosophical
                fragments,” Shelling’s take on “sonority” from the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of
                    Music</hi>, Ørsted’s discussions of “sound as shock,” Ritter’s conception of
                sound “as an electrical virtuality of figuration,” Eichendorff’s “lyrical equation
                of contemplation with intoxication through the concept of rustling, <hi rend="italic">Rauschen,</hi>” as well as E. T. A. Hoffmann’s “electrical-musical
                aesthetics” (3). In these respective treatments of sound each work testifies to how
                “Material vibrations, waves, oscillations, collisions—all taking place below the
                threshold of conscious perception—can be amplified in Romantic thought into
                larger-scale domains: from language to the soul, from acoustics to physiology, from
                wave oscillations to the modification of human sensuous capacities” (2). The essay
                    uncovers how “sound discloses fundamental ontology as an oscillation of the real, the real <hi rend="italic">as </hi>
                    oscillation: a trembling of things that moves through all
                    individuated forms, material and spiritual” (33). Trop grapples with how “the
                    most intimate experiences of the world become the most alien” as the German
                    Romantics he studies undertake “their speculative philosophical and aesthetic
                    experiments with sound” (33). By these lights “we see that it is not sufficient
                    for the German Romantics to describe sound and its material or ideal basis;
                    rather, the latent dynamics emergent from the speculative and aesthetic
                    encounter with sound must be redirected back into the world: as an art of
                    unconditioning” (33).</p>
               <p>To round out the introduction by voicing one of the volume’s largest implications
                that might otherwise go unsung, I’ll turn once again to Sterne’s field-defining work
                on sound studies from <hi rend="italic">The Audible Past</hi>. There Sterne makes
                quick work of dispelling a persistent myth: that the telegraph, telephone,
                phonograph, and radio irrevocably altered “the nature, meaning, and practices of
                sound in the late nineteenth century” (1). Sterne calls out seductive narratives
                such as these for being “incomplete” given that “[m]any of the practices, ideas, and
                constructs associated with sound-reproduction technologies predated the machines
                themselves” (1). Extending Sterne’s thinking, I offer the lines of Romantic
                literature studied here and elsewhere as a valuable record of eighteenth- and
                nineteenth-century soundways. Romanticism’s literary records predate the likes of
                the telegraph or the radio and so comprise a sound-reproducing technology bearing
                sonic cultures and sonic histories and sonic theories. These are cultures,
                histories, and theories that are at risk of going unheard if we were to fail to take
                the time now to turn their pages, to tune in, and listen to them. </p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p>This essay examines representations of quiet in Coleridge’s “Frost
                        at Midnight” to ask broader questions about the ways Romantic lyric can register
                        and express volume and sound dynamics. It offers historical contexts for
                        understanding the poem including the development of musical and rhetorical
                        notation for volume as well as accounts of shifting reading practices in the
                        period. It demonstrates how “Frost at Midnight” offers a rich nexus for thinking
                        about the experience and the representation of volume, and of silence, in
                        Romantic lyric. The poem invites further thinking about the semiotics of sound
                        and silence through a playful interplay between eye and ear. Coleridge was
                        fascinated by visual codes for sound and the ways in which patterns of sound can
                        be seen as well as heard, and his poems are full of accounts of different kinds
                        of sound, which complicate the distinction between silent and vocalised
                        reading. Coleridge provides an especially interesting
                            case study not only because he was writing on what has been described as the
                            cusp between reading aloud and silent reading, and during an era of scientific
                            discovery and innovation in the realm of acoustics, but also because he was
                            deeply interested in musical forms and in the science and semiotics of
                            acoustics. The essay demonstrates how shifts in volume can be expressed and
                            experienced in a poem’s own acoustic, rhythmic and verbal textures and suggests
                            that the representation of sound and quiet in “Frost at Midnight” challenges and
                            extends what is understood by ‘silent’ reading. More broadly, it proposes that
                            volume, a term which acquired its current acoustic sense in the Romantic period,
                            is a significant figure in Lyric studies which has gone unacknowledged. It
                            proposes that volume was not only important to Romantic poets such as Coleridge,
                            who, as this essay shows, found subtle ways of modulating and expressing shifts
                            in volume in his poetry, but also that, more broadly, volume should be
                            understood as part of a critical discourse about genre. The essay explores the
                            ways in which volume is figured and expressed in Coleridge’s writing, and
                            especially in “Frost at Midnight,” and considers the critical language we might
                            use to describe volume and dynamics more generally. Arguing that Coleridge’s
                            lyric poetry has its own playful modes and codes for communicating degrees of
                            sound, the essay proposes that volume is a neglected but significant figure in
                            Lyric studies.

                  <p>What does it mean for sound to happen in Lyric? Culler’s claim invites questions
                about how we define Lyric, but also about the phenomenology of sound, its medium,
                and the relation between sound, print and poem. How is sound experienced by the
                reader – by the eye, the ear, the mind’s ear, when it is read aloud and read in
                silence, <hi rend="italic">in </hi>Lyric? The preposition “in”
                suggests that Lyric is a container for sound, a vessel, perhaps, an urn: 
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard</l>

            Where is sound happening in Keats’ lines? On the page? In our ears? “through the
                air”? In our mind’s ears? Is there a difference between the way it “happens” in our
                ears, when read out loud, and in the mind’s ear, during silent reading? And what of
                the sounds that are seen but not heard? Like the playful eye-rhyme suggested by
                “unheard” and “endear’d:” both words contain the word “ear,” but we only hear it
                sounded in “endear’d.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> As Susan Wolfson notes, in <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Companion to Keats,</hi> Glossary, xx. For a detailed

                The gaps and pauses? The moments of no sound and “no tone”? The quiet? The silence

                else, as a boy “hangs/ waiting for the owls to answer”? What of these silences? Are
                they heard or “unheard”? What of the many silences contained in and articulated by
                Lyric? The silence of the urn, this “silent form”? Are they "happening" in the same
                way as sound ‘happens’? And what of those eye rhymes we see and don’t hear, between
                “heard” and “endear’d”? Both contain the word “ear,” but it is not sounded in
                “heard,” seen not heard, silent. And what is <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> sound? In
                these lines, <hi rend="italic">soft</hi>, in the phrase “soft pipes”, suggests a
                quality of sound - timbre and volume. But do we experience different qualities of
                sound, and degrees of softness and loudness, when we read these lines silently? How
                does quietness “happen” in a poem? </p>
                  <p> The word “volume” acquired an acoustic register in the late eighteenth-century,
                according to <hi rend="italic">OED</hi>, a musical sense first recorded in Busby’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Complete dictionary of music</hi> (1786) referring to the tone
                and power of a human voice: “<hi rend="italic">Volume</hi>, a word applied to the
                compass of a voice from grave to acute: also to its tone, or power: as when we say,
                ‘such a performer possesses an extensive or rich volume of voice’.” (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>, 9a). The first recorded usage of the word volume as “Quantity, strength or power, combined mass, of sound”
                    (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>, 9b) occurs a little later, in 1822, and is attributed to Lord Byron in <hi rend="italic">Werner, </hi> (v.i. 134 I heard…, Distinct and keener far upon my ear Than the late cannon's 333) volume, this word—‘Werner!’). This new sense of the word registers a larger cultural and scientific curiosity about the nature and experience of sound in the period, a curiosity which also finds shape in poetry of the period. </p>
                  <p>The contemporary poet Alice Oswald is also interested in the expression of volume,
                and plays with different ways of suggesting quiet and silence through and around
                words, using space, measuring lines and fading ink to create a graphic code for
                calibrating sound and silence. In the last lines of her poem "Tithonus"
                (<hi rend="italic">Falling Awake, </hi>2016, 45-81), for
                example, there’s a moment of graphic quietening. The final letters of the poem fade
                into whiteness, so that the poem’s concluding word, “appearing” is almost invisible,
                printed in the very lightest shade of type, as dawn, and light, appear.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a discussion of Oswald’ playfulness in this passage, see Angela Leighton,
                            <hi rend="italic">Hearing Things.  The Work of Sound in Literature </hi>(Harvard, Harvard University Press, 2018), 249.</note> The fading font
                produces an aural effect, the suggestion of diminuendo, in the way that <hi rend="bold">bold</hi> or CAPITAL LETTERS, larger font size or <hi rend="italic">italics</hi> can suggest a louder volume. But, as we shall see, a poem can
                sound or produce the effect of quiet in other ways. </p>
                  <p>Coleridge, too, was intensely curious about the nature and experience of sound in the
                ear and in print. “Frost at Midnight”, written in Somerset in the winter of 1798,
                does not use the word “volume”, but records a playful exploration of dynamics and of
                the various ways (graphic, rhythmic, linguistic and as an effect of tempo) in which
                sound and quiet could be represented to both eye and ear in a poem. Like other
                Romantic poets, Coleridge was fascinated by visual codes and patterns for sound and
                marking emphasis. Julia S. Carlson has shown how Wordsworth drew on developments in
                cartography and rhetoric in his own shapings in and of sound on the page (Julia S.
                Carlson, <hi rend="italic">Romantic Marks and Measures: Wordsworth’s Poetry in
                    Fields of Print</hi>, 2016). Taking this yet further, I suggest that Coleridge
                was also preoccupied with how to represent sounds and especially volume, and that
                his imaginative interest in acoustics and in musical forms and notation informed the
                way he shaped sound into both aural patterns and visual language in his poetry.</p>

                  <p>Many of our critical terms for discussing lyric poetry are, of course, borrowed from
                music; for example, as Susan Stewart has explained: “we speak of such features as
                counterpoint, harmony, syncopation, stress, duration, and timbre” as some of the
                “ways in which sound is measured as if music and lyric were analogous” (<hi rend="italic">Stewart</hi>, 2002: 68). In music, however, there is a system of
                notation for marking dynamics on a musical score, differences in volume and also in
                the quality of the sound, <hi rend="italic">pp, f, piu p, poco a poco dim., molto
                    piano</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quasi niente</hi>, for example. The Romantic
                period witnessed the expansion of the range of musical notation marks for dynamics;
                for example, it was during the last decade of the eighteenth century, “that the
                convention of indicating a gradual increase or decrease of volume by terms such as
                ‘cresc’ or ‘dim.’, or by ‘hairpins’, became commonplace” (Clive
                Brown<hi rend="italic">, </hi> 1999: 62). </p>
                  <p> The expressive possibilities of volume became increasingly important to composers
                and performers in this period. In part, this was enabled by developments and
                innovations in musical instruments themselves: the <hi rend="italic">pianoforte</hi>, invented in the eighteenth century, allowed a much wider dynamic
                range than had been available to the harpsichord, for instance, and it was during
                the period 1750-1850 that various adjustments were made to stringed instruments
                which increased the range of volume they could express. Changes in the way sheet
                music was produced in the period may also have contributed to this interest in
                dynamics and its expression on the page as well as in performance: there was an
                increase in the publication of sheet music in the later eighteenth-century which
                meant, Brown argues, that the performance of music was no longer always in the
                direct acoustic control of the composer, since in the later period composers were no
                longer physically present to instruct performers how to alter dynamics. This is
                perhaps one reason why composers increasingly marked their scores to indicate these
                dynamic shifts. Moreover, “Many composers . . . came increasingly to regard accentuation
                and dynamic nuance as integral to the individuality of their conceptions and were
                unwilling to entrust this merely to the performer’s instinct” (62). For this reason, he suggests, during the nineteenth century there was “a
                proliferation of markings, designed to show finer grades or types of accents and
                dynamic effects, and performance instructions of all kinds were used ever more
                freely” (62). It is likely that it was a combination of factors
                to do with the production and performance of music as well as technological
                innovation in the dynamic range of instruments that led to the development and
                proliferation of dynamic notation in the period, and that this also registered a
                wider cultural interest in sound and its expression.</p>

                  <head>iii. Voicing and Volume.</head>
                  <p>A range of new terms emerged for indicating the dynamics of performance in music but
                also in the fields of literary performance and rhetoric. It was not only on musical
                scores that dynamic markers appeared: a number of eighteenth-century literary
                critics also annotated reading texts to indicate volume and dynamics, the levels or
                the qualities of quiet or loudness for performance; some adopted musical notation,
                others used different terms. Discussing reading aloud, late eighteenth-century
                critics of rhetoric such as James Beattie associated different volumes with
                different emotional states and intensities of feeling and indicated in their
                annotations how readers might vary the volume and intensity of their voices to best
                express the affective range and qualities of a piece of writing. Varying the
                dynamics of reading, reciting or speaking, he explains, could also engage the
                listener and be more persuasive. In <hi rend="italic">Dissertations Moral and
                    Critical</hi> (1783), Beattie argues that:
                
           <quote>In describing what is great, poets often employ sonorous language. This is suitable
                to the nature of human speech: for while we give utterance to that which elevates
                our imagination, we are apt to speak louder, and with greater solemnity, than at
                other times" (I, 629). </quote>
                
            The word “sonorous” here conveys a sense of volume as well as suggesting a particular
                style, meaning, “Of spoken or written style: using imposing language; having a full,
                rich sound; imposing, grand; harmonious” (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>, 3a). The first
                recorded instance of the word to describe language is recorded in 1650, and derives
                from an earlier usage of the word to mean, more generally, “That makes a loud or
                resonant sound; capable of producing a loud sound, esp. of a deep or ringing
                character” (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>, 1a). The concept of linguistic volume
                Beattie’s comment suggests invites further investigation: certain words might be
                considered “sonorous”, others quiet depending, perhaps, on semantic associations,
                others because of onomatopoeia. The possibility that writers of the period <hi rend="italic">volume</hi> of words when selecting and composing
                a poem, for example, and that readers were attuned to the possibility of linguistic
                dynamics opens up another dimension for literary critics.</p>
                  <p>The concept of volume also shaped how Beattie understood the rhythm of a poem or
                piece of dramatic writing. Readers should, he points out, attend closely to the
                rhythm of the writing, and this, he explains, could be understood in terms of
                loudness as well as duration, “The rhythm of sounds may be marked by the distinction
                of loud and soft, as well as that of long and short” (I, 283). It’s clear from Beattie’s account that volume was part of
                a critical vocabulary for understanding rhythm and conversely, as we shall see, in
                poetry, rhythm can express sound dynamics and volume.
                    <note place="foot" resp="author"> Beattie’s account of “loud and soft”
                            is contributing to a longer rhetorical tradition for describing vocal
                            performance, and especially the linguistic (and metrical) roles of
                            syllabic length and accent; but when Beattie uses the terms “loud and
                            soft” to describe rhythm, he is doing something slightly different,
                            referring to affective as well as rhythmical expression.

                  </p>
                  <p>Beattie was also concerned with the dynamics of performance, that is to say with how
                passages should best be read aloud to convey their mood and affective dynamics, and
                volume was an important aspect of this. He explains, for instance, that “Words of
                indignation pronounced with a soft voice and a smile. . . would be ridiculous”
                    (I, 241). When reading aloud, choosing the
                appropriate volume and modulating between degrees of loud and soft was considered
                essential to the successful performance of a poem<note place="foot" resp="author"> It’s interesting to note that whereas Cicero discusses the importance of
                            tone in his <hi rend="italic">Institutio Oratoria</hi>, he does not
                            discuss volume at any length or often, in the way that 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century rhetoricians do. This invites
                            further investigation. </note> In his <hi rend="italic">Art of
                    Speaking</hi>, for instance, James Burgh explained how a speaker’s <hi rend="italic">success</hi> with his audience” depends
                much upon his “<hi rend="italic">setting out</hi> in a proper key, and at a due
                pitch of <hi rend="italic">loudness</hi>. If he begins in too <hi rend="italic">high</hi> a tone, or sets out too
                <hi rend="italic">loud, </hi>how is he afterwards to rise to a
                    <hi rend="italic">higher note</hi>, or swell his voice <hi rend="italic">louder</hi>, as the more
                    <hi rend="italic">pathetic</hi> strains may require?” (emphasis original
                (12). Burgh turns to terms such as “proper key,” “due pitch,” “tone”
                and “note” here; these terms are firmly part of musical as well as rhetorical
                discourse. He draws on them again when describing how the different emotional states
                require different modes of expression in both facial features and gestures, but also
                in terms of the dynamics of voice. “Despair” for instance requires the “tone of the voice” to be
                “<hi rend="italic">loud </hi>and <hi rend="italic">furious</hi>” (17).
                Whereas “Shame” requires a voice that is “<hi rend="italic">weak</hi> and <hi rend="italic">trembling</hi>” as well as short sentences and drawn down eyebrows
                to convey its full expression (17). He marks a number of speeches and
                texts with symbols to indicate the quality of delivery, which includes volume, for
                example in a speech on “Horrors of War,” an extract from Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>. Certain lines, he indicates, are “to be spoken quick and loud,”
                others “to be spoken faintly, and with pity” or “to be spoken with a quivering
                voice” (16, 17). Recognising and performing the appropriate volume for
                particular literary passages when reading them aloud was key to their rhetorical
                expressiveness, and Burgh offered readers help in doing this by using descriptive
                language to indicate the appropriate dynamics. Other kinds of notation were also
                available. </p>
                  <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Elocution</hi>, Thomas Sheridan uses
                musical terms to distinguish between loud and soft, and high and low: “Loud and soft
                in speaking, is like the <hi rend="italic">forte</hi> and <hi rend="italic">piano</hi> in music, it only refers to the different degrees of force used in
                the same key whereas high and low imply a change of key” (83).

                    establishing the melody and measure of speech, to be expressed and perpetuated
                    by peculiar symbols</hi> stresses the importance of modulating the voice,
                and sets out symbols for accent and emphasis, loud and soft (24),
                which he applies to a number of literary examples, including a speech from <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> (40).</p>

                    Delivery</hi>, also uses symbols, including some musical notation such as
                the hairpin to indicate shifts in loudness as well as a number of other symbols,
                such as the zigzag line to indicate uniform loudness or forte, explained in “Symbols for Noting the Force and
                Rapidity or Interruption of the Voice in Delivery” (367). He advises
                readers and performers that these symbols were “to be marked in the margin near the
                commencement of the passage which they are to influence” (367).</p>

                  <p>It is important to note that this kind of notation was not usually deployed by poets
                themselves; it was added later to mark up a text for performance, to encourage
                emphasis for dramatic and rhetorical effect. There were perhaps stylistic cues in
                the writing itself which these notations and marginal indications were responding to
                and amplifying. It was not necessarily only the subject matter or emotional tone of
                a piece of writing that suggested a particular volume; it could also be an effect
                suggested in the rhythmic and linguistic texture of the poem itself. Lyric poetry has its own language and codes for
                communicating volume and dynamics, and these effects do not depend on performance or
                vocalisation, on the timbre and grain and pitch of a reader’s voice, but can be
                experienced even when we read a poem in silence.
                There are other ways that a poem might register and express shifts in volume, not
                just in performance, but also during silent reading. If onomatopoeia denotes a
                shared code or language to represent certain sounds, like a cat purring or a dog
                barking, what are the linguistic, formal and rhythmic codes and cues of quiet? <hi rend="italic">Shhhh, hush, </hi>ellipses . . . what else? </p>

                  <head>iv. Silent reading.</head>
                  <p>Coleridge was well known for reading his own poems aloud, and of course when a poem
                is voiced, the reader can vary the volume as well as the pitch and tone, but usually
                there is no direct <hi rend="italic">verbal</hi> cue or instruction for this in the
                poem itself (as there sometimes is, say, in a play script, which often gives the
                actor or reader performance and stage directions). When he read his own poems aloud,
                Coleridge could of course vary the volume as he thought fitting. But how could he
                communicate the appropriate dynamics to his readers? And might they experience these
                shifts in volume during silent reading? Although, as Lucy Newlyn has shown, “the
                practice of ‘reading aloud’” was “a
                thriving one at the end of the eighteenth century” (355), so too was silent reading. Laura Mandell
                points out that Romantic poets expected
                their poems to be read in silence, and that despite Wordsworth’s “love of
                reading-and-writing aloud and performing his poetry, nonetheless Wordsworth knew
                that most would encounter it as silent and graphic. Blake, too, could not mistake
                the essential noiselessness of his prints” (220). She goes on to
                argue that “their poems thematised their own soundlessness while offering
                compensatory images”(220). And yet the poems, read in silence, are not, perhaps, entirely
                soundless.</p>
                  <p>Effects or impressions of sound and volume can be experienced when a poem is read in
                silence. There is also the possibility of an imagined listening. Lyric poems can
                have their own inscripted codes and cues for volume and dynamics, ways of suggesting
                and registering shifts between loud and soft, sound effects which we experience even
                when we read in silence. And these differences in volume are expressed or suggested
                in various ways, in and through rhythm, vocabulary and lineation. The question of
                what volume means in relation to a poem is worth exploring further. If, according to
                the Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, certain colours were
                    “quiet” (313), perhaps a poet could also produce effects of quiet or loudness in words, rhythms, and spatial patterns on the printed
                    page. And this experience of sound puts pressure on the very idea of ‘silent reading’ itself.</p>
                  <p>The expansion of print, according to Walter Ong’s well-known thesis, produced a shift
                from oral reading aloud to quiet and then silent reading. Print, he claimed, was one
                factor in the creation of privacy in modern society, and, he argues, the production
                of books that were “smaller and more portable than those common in manuscript
                culture” set the stage “psychologically for solo reading in a quiet corner, and
                eventually for completely silent reading” (131). It should be noted
                that silent reading in the West long precedes the invention of print, and is
                recorded by 400 CE, in Augustine’s famous comments on Ambrose, archbishop of Milan,
                in <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi> 6.3.3. And that Ong’s description of print as
                a kind of silencing medium does not account for the various kinds of sound which
                print can embody. Perhaps, as Steven Connor suggests, “the move from sounded to
                silent reading” was not:
                
            <quote>simply a move from noise to quiet. Rather, perhaps, it is a move from one kind of
                sound to another … The increasing commonness of silent reading is to be regarded
                therefore, not as the simple turning down of sound, but as the creation of a more
                complex space of inner resounding. (106, 109) </quote>
                
            To push this further we might ask whether these “spaces of inner resounding” might
                vary according to genre. Perhaps Lyric enables and produces distinct kinds of aural
                and acoustic “spaces," distinct possibilities for inner resounding. We might ask
                whether Romantic lyric is quieter than other genres or sub-genres, than declamatory
                neoclassical lyric, say, or than epic or satire. Perhaps the intimate occasion of
                certain lyric poems itself implies a dynamic of performance, that it be read in a
                quieter voice than a poem in another genre. Lyric, I want to argue, invites a
                particular kind of listening, and in the Romantic period this listening was
                inflected by historical contingencies in musical notation, book publication, and
                reading practices. The way volume was heard, and indeed the volume of poetry was
                recognised and interpreted, changed in the Romantic period. And perhaps one reason
                for this was that during this period a historical juncture between oral and silent
                reading was especially significant and pronounced. </p>
                  <p>In <hi rend="italic">Discourse Networks 1800/1900</hi>, Friedrich Kittler
                famously suggested that reading after 1800 was shaped, Steven Connor explains, by
                the “principle of what might be called oralized writing,” (128)
                what Connor calls a “consensual hallucination, namely the capacity for a kind of
                ‘earsight’ or ‘hearsight’ that allows one to mistake writing for voice, to imagine
                that writing is everywhere suffused with the most intimate and expressive accents of
                the voice” (129). But if print could express, silently, the
                <hi rend="italic">accents </hi>of voice, it could also register
                the <hi rend="italic">dynamics</hi> of voice, and descriptions of sound in the poem
                itself. Dynamics are a feature of accent, but accent is not the only way dynamics
                are expressed. A printed poem can also convey shifts between loud and soft on the
                page, for example, such as a gradual quietening. And such shifts are not only
                descriptive but can also be mimetic of what is described. They can register effects
                of intimacy and musical and rhetorical patterns of expression. The question of how a
                poem might register these shifts and gradations in and of sound took particular
                inflection and emphasis in the Romantic period not only because of shifting reading
                practices but also because of a growing curiosity about the developing science and
                technologies of sound transmission, such as the stethoscope and microphone, and,
                later in the nineteenth century the phonograph, telephone and telegraph, as well as a fascination with the ways in which
                sound was codified in music, writing and in other visual forms, such as Chladni
                figures, the Phonautograph and the Eidophone, all part of what Coleridge was to call
                the “embryo Science of Acoustics<anchor type="commentRangeStart" n="23"/>”

                  <p>Coleridge was a great talker, musical, oracular, entrancing, and his eloquence has
                been rightly celebrated. At times, his talking could be challenging; he was not as
                sensitive perhaps as he might have been to his own listeners: Wordsworth could not understand “one syllable”
                of his friend’s oration despite listening attentively for two hours, according to
                Samuel Rogers’ report (308). There are
                many accounts of people listening to Coleridge, fewer of Coleridge himself as
                listener. And yet although he didn’t always attend enough to his listeners when he
                spoke, he was himself an acute and sensitive listener: his poems, as well as his
                notebooks, are full of great moments of listening. </p>
                  <p>Throughout Coleridge’s writing we find traces of this sensitivity in his “records of
                attentive listening,” as John Hollander has termed them. And often the sounds which
                drew his ear were quiet sounds. In these lines from a notebook entry, for
                instance:
                
            <quote>I hear only the Ticking of my Watch, in the Pen-place of my Writing Desk, &amp; the
                far lower note of the noise of the Fire— perpetual, yet seeming uncertain/it is the

           This is a subtle pitch of listening: to distinguish between the clock and the <hi rend="italic">lower note</hi> of the fire. ” Coleridge is drawing on a musical
                language, “low note”, to describe and distinguish between the sounds he hears. And
                he was curious about how these subtle variations of pitch and dynamics might be
                expressed in the texture of a poem.</p>
                  <p>Coleridge was writing on the cusp between reading aloud and silent reading. This is
                perhaps one reason that he was interested in the space between thought and address:
                in “Frost at Midnight,” for instance, he is addressing his babe, but in silence.
                This intimate occasion might also account for the poem’s interest in quiet sounds
                and sounding quiet. The volume of a poem perhaps depends on occasion as well as on
                genre, so that the intimate occasions of certain kinds of Romantic lyric poem might
                be productive of quiet, or at least be quieter than more declamatory or public
                modes. Like other Romantic poets Coleridge was thoughtful about the sound of poetry,
                and about shaping sound and silences—especially because he was writing in an age
                when poems were very often read in silence.</p>
                  <p>Writing in <hi rend="italic">Victorian Studies</hi>, Laura Mandell offers a specific
                technological explanation for a shift in reading practices, arguing that “Eighteenth-century changes in printing
                practices facilitated silent, rather than vocalized, reading of poetry.” (220)<note place="foot" resp="author">Celeste Langan and N. McClane have shown that the material medium of transmission is crucially important to interpretation (“The medium of romantic poetry”, in James Chandler and Maureen N. McClane (Cambridge, 2008), 239-262).</note>. She suggests that the typographical
                shift from the long "f"-like "s" to the “s”, for example, accompanied a shift from
                reading aloud to silent reading (the “f”-like “s” being associated with reading
                aloud). It’s interesting to note, as Mandell does, that in the 1798 edition of
                Wordsworth and Coleridge’s <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi>, both forms of “s”
                are used, and this, she suggests, “would have complicated silent reading” (220). Coleridge’s <hi rend="italic">Rime of the Ancient
                    Mariner</hi>, for instance, uses the “f” like “s,” and so calls for reading
                aloud. Mandell explains that this is because of different processes of reading
                associated with silent reading and reading aloud. You need to pronounce a word which
                contains an “f” like “s” to know whether it is an “f” or an “s,” she explains. But
                when an “s” form is used, you recognise it in a different way, which does not
                require pronouncing it or sounding it out. And yet, I would argue, this account of
                silent reading as a kind of visual decoding, a reading without sound, belies the
                complexity of the way sound operates and exists in the medium of print and in a
                poem.</p>
                  <p> Mandell’s notion of sound focusses on the idea of the voice and voicing; but poems
                offer other kinds of sounding and other patterns and articulations of sound.
                Coleridge understood poems to be musical forms, and his poems are full of accounts
                of other kinds of sound, which further complicate this distinction between silent or
                vocalised reading. Indeed, his poems seem to invite a play between eye and ear, not
                just by varying the typographic forms of letters such as the “s.” They invite us to
                think about the relation between seeing and hearing not only in terms of voice but
                also in terms of music and pattern. </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the need for further exploration of Mandell’s claim about the
                cognitive processes involved in reading aloud and reading silently, it is clear that
                poets writing in this period were keenly aware that reading practices were shifting,
                as Mandell and Newlyn have shown. It is also worth considering whether, and how,
                these and other cultural, technological and scientific changes might have shaped and
                influenced the representation of sound and dynamics in their poetry. Their poems
                invite further thinking about the semiotics of sound and of volume through a playful
                and dynamic interplay between eye and ear.</p>
                  <p>Writing elsewhere, Mandell examines Laurence Sterne’s play with visual and aural
                codes registered in his use of a sequence of four asterisks (****) to denote words
                which might offend readers in
                    <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy </hi>. The **** are difficult to voice, she explains, but the words they
                represent and obscure present a different challenge to those reading aloud to an
                audience; his use of **** thus engages with a shift in reading practices in a
                playful way, mindful that some would read the novel aloud, others in silence.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                  <p>Writing in his notebooks Coleridge expressed his frustration that he did not “have
                the language of music” (II: 2035). This
                could mean that he was unable to read a musical score, or that he did not feel he
                fully understood musical language. And yet perhaps he was being overly modest; he
                does, after all, analyse the prosody of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> in
                terms of a pattern of “fifteen breves”, which suggests some knowledge of musical
                terms (<hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi>, iv.
                603-4). And although there are no musical scores to be found in his notebooks, they
                do contain quite a few comments about his wide-ranging musical listening, to
                instruments such as the Eolian harp and Glass Harmonica as well as to a range of
                polite and popular musical forms; he notes, for instance, the superior song of the
                Ramsgate Muffin Man but also talks about enjoying Beethoven, Weber, Mozart and
                Cimarosa. In an essay in <hi rend="italic">The Friend</hi> he identifies a sense of
                ‘recognition’ in listening to music: 
                
            <quote>If we listen to a Symphony of Cimarosa, the present strain still seems not only to
                recall, but almost to renew, some past movement, another and yet the same! Each
                present movement bringing back, as it were, and embodying the spirit of some melody
                that had gone before, anticipates and seems trying to overtake something that is to
                come (<hi rend="italic">Notebooks</hi> ii. 2356).</quote>
                
           This sensitivity to the effects of musical repetition informs Coleridge’s own poetic
                composition and points to the importance of musical thinking to his own
                understanding of sound and its forms and effects in poetry. <note place="foot" resp="author"> For a discussion of this passage and

                  </p>
                  <p> Coleridge was keenly aware that poets did not use the “language of music” itself,
                and that included musical notation, to indicate the dynamics of a poem. And yet, as
                he instinctively understood, somehow certain poems or lines in poems can suggest
                different dynamic qualities, with some moments seeming louder or quieter than
                others. Coleridge’s poems are especially rich in dynamic effects. It is striking how
                many of his lyric ‘Conversation poems’ not only meditate on sounds heard, but
                themselves describe and also communicate changes in volume. Consider the following
                    shifts: from the owlet’s cry which
                comes “loud” (l.3) to the quieter sound of the fluttering soot on the grate (l.15)
                in “Frost at Midnight;” from the silence of the stream (l.6) to the happy song of
                nightingales in “The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem;” from “green and silent spot”
                (l.1) and “small and silent dell” (l.2) to the crescendo in Invasion’s “thunder and
                the shout,/ And all the crash” (l.36-37) in “Fears in Solitude;” from “the stilly
                murmur of the distant Sea,” that “Tells us of Silence” (ll.11-12), to the music of
                the breeze as it plays over the lute strings in “The Eolian Harp” (l.15). Coleridge offers a descriptive
                vocabulary to describe a range of dynamics, a shifting scale of volume from loud to
                quiet to silence. But his poems not only name and describe these dynamics but also
                perform these shifts in their verbal, acoustic and rhythmic textures. </p>
                  <p>The late critic Thomas Macfarland was attuned to dynamic shifts across Coleridge’s
                poetry. The opening lines of “The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem,” he suggests,
                have, “a quietness that is
                in stark contrast to the frenetic
                notes of the hysterical sublime” we hear in some of Coleridge’s earlier work
                (246). The word “quieter” suggests intimate, less declamatory; but
                his choice of word also conveys a sense of volume. I want to push this yet further
                and think about how this sound, this quiet is expressed:
                
                <lg type="stanza">

            How is a sense of quietness achieved in these lines? The language seems to be visual
                rather than aural here; the description begins by calling up to the eye what is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> seen, clouds, a slip of light, trembling hues. The
                repetition of “no” emphasises, by contrast, the solidity of the deictic “this” in
                the phrase “this mossy bridge”, and the simple affirmation “You see” in the next
                line, emphasising what the eye can see. This visual language is soundless in one
                sense, anticipating the soundlessness described when we reach ‘no murmuring’ and
                ‘silently’. But the language takes on a more complex sensory register when we reach “dim”, a word used in these lines to describe a visual phenomena, faintness of
                light (<hi rend="italic">OED </hi>1 a), but which also had
                currency as an acoustic term in this period, meaning “Of sound, and esp. of the
                voice: Indistinct, faint” (<hi rend="italic">OED,</hi> 5; curiously, the last
                citation in <hi rend="italic">OED </hi>for this sense of the
                word is in the Romantic period, in Shelley’s 1817 poem “Marianne’s dream”). The lines create an effect of <hi rend="italic">diminuendo</hi>
                in terms of visual description and also in sound, so that effects of eye and ear
                confirm and amplify one another. What else in the opening lines suggests quiet? That
                word “still” is important; it offers one way in to thinking about how a sense of
                quiet is expressed in these lines. The predominant meaning of “still” here is
                “motionless” (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>, 1). But for Coleridge’s first readers the
                word also had a sense relating to volume, “Of a voice, sounds, utterances: Subdued,
                soft, not loud (<hi rend="italic">OED,</hi> 2a). This sense of “Still”, according to
                    <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> is no longer current. I think that this correspondence
                between movement and volume offers one way to think about how poetry expresses sound
                dynamics in and through shifts in movement, tempo or pace. It is,
                after all, moving or vibration of matter, as Coleridge understood, that creates
                sound in the first place as in the strings of a lute or an Eolian harp. That word
                “trembling”, in the phrase “trembling hues”, amplifies the sense I’m referring to
                here: overtly it’s referring to a visual phenomenon but it calls a sense of gentle
                movement to mind, the gentle movement of a stringed instrument playing very quietly
                (trembling suggests a faint movement).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Thinking about the lute string vibrating into
                            sound as a metaphor for animated matter trembling into thought,
                            Coleridge had used the word “tremble” in his poem “Eolian Harp”, first
                            published 2 years
                            (<hi rend="italic">CW, Poetical Works I, </hi>ed.
                            J. C.C. Mays, ll.46).</note> There is something suggestive
                about using Coleridge’s use of the word “trembling” to describe <hi rend="italic">colour</hi>, something synaesthetic perhaps, which calls to mind a kind of
                quiet sound by association. But which also alerts us to the sound texture of these
                lines and the way in which they move: the repetition suggests a kind of trembling
                and also a kind of quietening. In the opening of “The Nightingale. A Conversation
                Poem, April 1798”, the thick texture of repetition of the word “no” (ll.1, 2, 3, 6) which is drawn out by the
                <hi rend="italic">o </hi>sound in “flows” (l.6) and “O’er”
                (l.7) creates a slowing effect, so that the sound is not modulating as freely as we
                might expect, not moving not progressing, and this slowing suggests a
                    quietening.</p>
                  <p> Coleridge was interested in how gradations of sound were experienced by the listener
                and also by the reader, and he was thoughtful about how that might be represented on
                the page and in a poem. His poems are often intensely musical and sensitive to
                acoustic shiftings. Changes in linguistic register, tense, shifts in metre, pauses,
                punctuation marks, and the sonic texture of a line, the distribution of phonemes,
                all contribute to how a poem shifts dynamics between loud and soft. Pitch and tempo,
                genre, pacing and tonal register can contribute to a poem’s dynamics and Coleridge
                takes full and subtle advantage of all those means. Here in these lines from the
                1796 version of “The Eolian Harp,” for instance Coleridge creates a quietening
                effect rhythmically, by slowing the pace of the poem: 
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                        <l> … How exquisite the scents </l>
                        <l>Snatched from yon bean-field! and the world <hi rend="italic">so</hi> hushed! </l>
                        <l>The stilly murmur of the distant Sea </l>
                        <l>Tells us of silence. (ll.9-12)</l>
                     </lg>
                    
            That italicized word <hi rend="italic">so</hi> stands out, typographically more
                emphatic, but not, somehow, <hi rend="italic">louder</hi>, than surrounding words.
                The word “so” (l.9) was italicized in the 1796 version of the poem (which appeared
                with the title “EFFUSION XXXV. COMPOSED <hi rend="italic">AUGUST</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1795, AT CLEVEDON, SOMERSETSHIRE”) and the word was also
                italicised in the version of the poem published in <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>
                (1803), entitled “Composed at Clevedon
                Somersetshire." We know that this emphasis was intended by
                Coleridge because he underlined the word (“<hi rend="underline">so</hi>”) in the
                manuscript version of the poem he sent to Cottle for publication in 1796 (Rugby MS).
                However, the version of the poem published <hi rend="italic">Sibylline Leaves</hi>
                in 1817 does not have the word “so”
                italicised. </p>
                  <p>The italicisation (or its omission) is significant in terms of how we hear the line,
                and also in how the line represents volume. The use of <hi rend="italic">italics</hi> can create shifts of vocal tone but it can also contribute to
                shifts of pace and rhythm, which in turn suggests a dynamic effect, in this case, a
                quietening. Here, the italicization alters the rhythm of the line so that instead of
                the iambic pattern of “the WORLD so HUSHED,” that word “so” gains a stress, to the
                WORLD SO HUSHED. These three stresses in a row slow us down and the change of pace
                creates a feeling of intimacy—drawing us in, as it slows us down: together these
                contribute to the effect of <hi rend="italic">diminuendo</hi>. There is a sense of
                quieting as we reach the word “hushed,” a slowing down which puts emphasis on the
                quiet it denotes, a quiet which fades to the silence of the white space at the end
                of the end-stopped line. The word “hushed” conveys the sense, still current, of
                “Reduced to silence; silenced, stilled, quieted” (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>): in
                slowing the pace of the line by emphasizing the word “<hi rend="italic">so,”</hi>
                Coleridge creates a stilling effect rhythmically, and this contributes to the
                quietening of volume described and enacted. </p>
                  <p>The rhythmic shift in the next line, sounded in the phrase “the stilly murmur,” with
                its return to an iambic pattern, contributes to a steadying which suggests a
                quietening effect. The rhythm of the line shifts in the phrase “of the distant sea,”
                so that the word “distant” is emphasized after two unstressed syllables (“of the”);
                this shift in perspective is also suggested semantically as we shift from the
                proximity suggested by “murmur,” suggesting the “low continuous sound of water” (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>, 2) but also a quiet speaking voice, “A word or sentence
                spoken softly or indistinctly; faint or barely audible speech” (<hi rend="italic">OED,</hi> 4).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a detailed exploration of sound and semiotics of
                            the murmur in Wordsworth and Romantic poetry, see Michele Speitz, ‘The
                            Wordsworthian Acoustic Imagination, Sonic Recursions, and ‘that dying

                        1500-1900, 55(3):621-646.</note> This “murmur” is a quiet voice we
                can hear only if we are close to the sound; a shift from this suggestion of
                proximity to “distant” produces a fading effect, a kind of diminuendo. Once again, a
                shift in pace and rhythm contributes to a quietening effect. There is a slowing of
                pace, suggested by the thickening acoustic texture of the lines with their
                alliterative clustering of <hi rend="italic">s </hi>sounds that
                concentrate in, and emphasise, the final word of the sentence, “silence”: “the <hi rend="italic">s</hi>tilly murmur of the di<hi rend="italic">s</hi>tant <hi rend="italic">s</hi>ea/ Tells u<hi rend="italic">s </hi>of
                    <hi rend="italic">silence.</hi>” This is an example of the kind of interplay
                between sound and semantic meaning which T.S. Eliot understood was key to the
                auditory imagination, that “feeling for syllable and rhythm, penetrating far below
                the conscious levels of thought and feeling, invigorating every word” (T.S. Eliot,
                ‘Matthew Arnold’, in
                <hi rend="italic">T. S. Eliot, The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism </hi>(London
                1933) p. 119). Coleridge creates acoustic shifts in and through rhythmic and verbal
                textures and contextures in many different ways, including the use of emphatic
                markings such as underlining or italicisation as well as through shifts of rhythm
                and pace, as he does in these lines.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                           He returns to the idea of a sound telling of silence in a notebook
                            entry for December 1803: “the waterfall at the
                            head of the vale…. The noise of waters everywhere/ something distant,
                            something near…Tis far off, &amp; yet very where/ and the pillar of
                            smoke/ the smooth winter fields- the <hi rend="italic">indistinct</hi>
                        <hi rend="underline">Shadows in the Lake</hi> [<hi rend="underline">are
                                all] eloquent of Silence]”</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The change in register in the line “the stilly murmur of the distant sea” also
                contributes to a sense of historical distance, and to a related sense of acoustic
                distancing or quietening, diminuendo. The line, “the stilly murmur of the distant
                sea,” sounds archaic with its balanced pairs of adjective and noun- <hi rend="italic">stilly</hi> murmur, <hi rend="italic">distant</hi> sea- in which
                the <hi rend="italic">st</hi> sounds chime with <hi rend="italic">stilly</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">distant</hi>. The word
                <hi rend="italic">stilly, </hi>in itself archaic, denotes not
                moving- and so the slowing down effect of the previous line,
                <hi rend="italic">the world so hushed, </hi>leads to this
                articulation of stilly-ness. A still sea, is, of course, a silent sea, and, as we
                might expect, another sense of the adverb “stilly”, recorded in <hi rend="italic">OED,</hi> bears this out; “In a still manner; silently, quietly; in a low
                voice; †secretly.” The sea is very quiet and therefore tells us of silence. It is an
                odd thing to say, that it tells us <hi rend="italic">of</hi> silence. That
                <hi rend="italic">of </hi>is intriguing. It’s not that the sea
                is silent, it tells us of – about - silence, a story of silence, perhaps. This is a
                playfully indirect- and perhaps we could say a <hi rend="italic">quieter</hi>
                way of telling us that the sea is silent, a syntactic distance opens up into a
                deeper silence.</p>
                  <p>In “The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem,” the play with sound and semiotics takes
                another form: the invitation to listen at the heart of the poem is not voiced, but
                silent, signed rather than said:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>My dear babe,</l>

                        <l>Mars all things with his imitative lisp</l>
                        <l>How he would place his hand beside his ear,<lb/>His little hand, the small forefinger
                up,<lb/>And bid us listen! (ll.91-6)</l>

            Here in these lines Coleridge is offering us the sign language of a pre-verbal baby,
                and inviting us to think about the silence of signs on the page. It is interesting
                to note that it was in the Romantic period that a new codified form of sign language
                for the deaf was developed in France (Jacobus: 2012, 84-88). Coleridge’s baby’s
                gesture can be better understood when placed in relation to some recent examples of
                sign language in the work of deaf poets Raymond Antrobus and Ilya Kaminsky as part
                of their own enquiries into the forms, dynamics and politics of signs and
                    silence.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                Antrobus’ poem “Two Guns in the Sky for Daniel Harris”, for example,
                commemorates the deaf man Daniel Harris killed after police officers, who had been
                chasing him for speeding, misinterpreted his use of sign language and shot him. The
                poem interrogates the difficulties of interpreting sign language; Antrobus was
                trained in British Sign language, which is different from American Sign. But a
                failure to understand sign can, as Antrobus points out in the poem, have tragic
                consequences. He examines the cruel irony that the ASL sign for <hi rend="italic">alive</hi> looks like two guns pointing up to the sky:

            Coleridge’s hand sign is not ambiguous and its clarity is part of its own expressive
                poignancy.</p>
                  <p> In “Frost at Midnight,” composed and published in the same year as “The Nightingale:
                A Conversation”, this interest in signs and sounds and their correspondences is
                richly played out, from the very opening lines:

                     </lg>
                
            The poem’s very first lines signal an interest in the relation between eye and ear in
                a visual rhyme, or ‘eye rhyme’ between “ministry” and “cry.” This silent eye rhyme
                is part of the poem’s play with the way sound is codified or represented in visual
                form, in the semiotics of sound in print. The sound of that “cry” is picked up later
                in the half-rhyme with “side” and later “life.” Perhaps it’s too much of a stretch
                to suggest that t the long <hi rend="italic">I</hi> sound, or “eye” rhyme, is
                registered to the eye but not to the ear in “live.” Nonetheless, in these lines
                Coleridge invites us, in different ways, to move in and out between eye and ear,
                between rhyme seen and rhyme heard. Throughout the poem eye and ear work together
                and askance in unexpected ways. </p>
                  <p>Another striking feature of these opening lines is the dramatic dynamic shift from
                the “loud” cry of the owlet outdoors to the quiet of the indoor scene, a shift which
                produces a sense of intimacy and interiority and the accompanying illusion of <hi rend="italic">diminuendo</hi>. That word “loud” primes our listening ears for a
                certain pitch of sound—which emphasizes in contrast the subsequent lines’ account of
                quiet. The poem’s shifts in dynamics depend on and produce shifts in intimacy as it
                records a shift from outside to inside, from loud noise to quiet. The word “secret”
                in the very first line suggests both quiet and intimacy, since “secret” carries the
                suggestion, now obsolete, but current when Coleridge was writing, of reticence, or
                quiet: “Of a person: †Reserved or reticent in conduct or conversation (obsolete);
                not given to indiscreet talking or the revelation of secrets; silent as to any
                matter, uncommunicative, close.” (<hi rend="italic">OED,</hi> 2 a). By giving the
                frost a curious sense of human agency, it “performs a secret ministry,” Coleridge
                draws out association of “secret” with quiet and closeness</p>
                  <p>The poem creates this sense of closeness dramatically, too, so that the reader feels
                as though we are standing with the poet, listening with him. That is expressed in
                the shift from the past tense “came loud” to the present tense “hark again!,” from
                the temporal distance of the past tense to the sense of immediacy suggested by HARK
                which instructs the reader, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, give ear, listen! The reader
                imaginatively is listening but also aware of being a reader, something of which the
                poem deliberately reminds us. </p>
                  <p> Since M.H. Abrams’s classic and influential account of the poem as one of the Great
                Romantic Lyrics, it has been understood in terms of vocal utterance, a Conversation
                poem (Abrams, 1965). Coleridge’s “Conversation Poems” play with the dynamics of
                sound and its representation in curious ways. Much has been made of the vocal
                quality of these poems; critics have
                focussed on their various forms of address and the cadences of familiar
                    conversation <note place="foot" resp="author"> See, for example, Fred Burwick, “Coleridge’s Conversation Poems: Thinking the Thinker”, <hi rend="italic">Romanticism</hi>, 14.2 (2008), 168-182; Susan Eilenberg, <hi rend="italic">Strang Powers of Speech. Wordsworth, Coleridge and

                            55.1, 2005, 51-57.</note>. And yet the poem itself places much
                emphasis on non-human sounds, sounds that are increasingly abstract and hard to
                imagine. The owl, the crackling fire, the fluttering speck, the dream (inaudible to
                another), the quiet shining of the quiet moon. Indeed, the model Coleridge chose to
                describe the poem was musical rather than vocal or dramatic: he conceived of the
                poem in musical terms, as a Rondo, a form which was extremely popular in the late
                eighteenth century. In an earlier draft, the poem ended with six lines which
                describe the baby’s response to the icicles. Explaining why he cut these lines,
                Coleridge wrote: ‘The last six lines I omit because they destroy the rondo, and
                return upon itself of the Poem. Poems of this kind &amp; length ought to lie coiled
                with its ‘tail round its’ head.” (<hi rend="italic">CC</hi>, 16.1.1, p.456n.).
                Coleridge had taken Charles Burney’s <hi rend="italic">General History of Music</hi>
                out of Bristol library a few months before he composed “Frost at Midnight” (in
                November 1797), and may well have read the account of the rondo in its pages
                (155). His interest in Burney’s book around the time he wrote “Frost
                at Midnight” suggests a rich and suggestive musical context for interpreting the
                poem’s sounds and silences.</p>
                  <p> Understood as a musical form rather than overheard speech, the poem invites a
                different kind of listening.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a rich perspective on Romantic poetry and music, see Adam Potkay’s essay on Wordsworth’s Poems on Music, <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/praxis/soundings/potkay/potkay.html">Romantic Circles</ref>

                its shifts between loud and soft in playful ways. New possibilities for
                interpretation open up if we think of it not in terms of its orality, as a
                Conversation poem, to use Abram’s term, but in terms of aurality, as a
                listening poem. A poem which meditates on the experience of listening not just to the sound of a
                voice, but to the sounds of the non-human, the owls, the fire, the quiet itself. And
                it creates the effects of quiet through particular codes and patterns of sound and
                meaning.</p>
                  <p>If we put pressure on the poem’s acoustic language, its imaginings and figurings of
                sound, and think not only of the vocal cadences but also other forms and shapes of
                sound, abstracted from a notion of voice, pattern takes on a new significance.
                According to Marjorie Levinson, attending to visual pattern is a neglected key to
                understanding the poem. In a recent study she “seeks to shift the sensory register
                of criticism of the poem from its traditional emphasis on the acoustic to a new
                appreciation of the visible” (“Parsing the Frost”, online version). She emphasizes the poems’ visuality, rather than the acoustic qualities and
                expression. I would push this further and argue that Coleridge is deeply interested
                in the <hi rend="italic">relation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">dynamics</hi>
                between the visual and the acoustic but also between the visual and the aural.
                Patterns can be heard as well as seen. Throughout the poem, Coleridge plays with the
                way visual and acoustic dimensions are intimately related. This is in part because
                the poem is written with a sense of its own mode of reception in mind: that is to
                say, Coleridge was keenly aware that it might be read in silence, and so was
                especially thoughtful about how sound might be represented in print patterns, on the
                page. </p>
                  <p>There is a curious play between eye and ear, for instance, in the poem’s concluding
                lines:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>[…] whether the eave-drops fall </l>
                        <l>Heard only in the trances of the blast, </l>
                        <l>Or if the secret ministry of frost </l>
                        <l>Shall hang them up in silent icicles, </l>
                        <l>Quietly shining to the quiet Moon. (ll. 70-74)</l>
                     </lg>
                    
            The beautiful and strange description of a moon shining quietly prompts a question,
                an imagining, of what a loud shining might sound like. On the one hand, the idea of
                a “quiet moon” is a folk idiom to describe a new moon, and indeed the poem was
                written at the time of the new moon. And yet the image is so much more suggestive.
                It is “quietly shining to the quiet moon”: that <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>
                repeated in <hi rend="italic">quietly</hi>, emphatically. An icicle can be silent by
                imagined contrast: its silence remembers the sound of dripping water before it has
                frozen into an icicle, or after it thaws. </p>
                  <p>Another example of Coleridge’s interests in the play between eye and ear is the
                visual analogy to musical form described by Levinson: the fluttering soot on the
                grate, she argues, and suggests visually (in her <hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 7,
                reproduced below), can be read as a visual representation of a stave with a musical
                note. And to take this further, it is the semiotics of music, the semiotics of
                sound, that interest Coleridge here. </p>

                  <p>“Frost at Midnight” is a poem which explores the edges of silence. Coleridge has, as
                Susan Wolfson notes, an “ear for such limits, of sound suspended” (Wolfson, 2008:
                para. 3). There is an intriguing richness and, at times, an opacity to the poem’s
                acoustic language which rewards attention, and which, in turn, invites new readings
                and imaginings of the poem itself, and new possibilities for thinking about the
                quietudes of Romantic Lyric<hi rend="italic">.</hi> The poem generates thinking
                about what it might it mean to shine “quietly”. And about how we might listen to the
                moon. And about the audibility and inaudibility of dreams. Setting the poem’s sonic
                and aural language in the context of Coleridge’s wider thinking about sound dynamics
                and acoustics and its imaginative possibilities, gives us some hints. </p>
                  <p>In 1827, Coleridge read Sir Charles Wheatstone’s “Experiments on Audition” and was
                struck by his account of the microphone, an instrument which, he explained,
                “rendered audible the weakest sounds” (70). Coleridge describes,
                in <hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi>, how it sparked a recognition of a “fond and
                earnest dream project of mine own …with sundry other imaginations in what might be
                effected in the only embryo Science of Acoustics” (197). The
                science of Acoustics, that “branch of physics concerned with the properties and
                phenomena of sound, sometimes esp. in relation to hearing or speech.” (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>,1), was just over 100 years old when Coleridge scribbled
                these words. As his marginal gloss suggests, <hi rend="italic">Coleridge’s</hi>
                fascination with acoustics was apparent years before he read of Wheatstone’s
                invention: we find an interest in the properties and phenomena of sound registered
                in numerous notebook entries and poems.</p>
                  <p>We know, for instance, that he was fascinated by the sound experiments of the
                musician and scientist Ernst Chladni (who was to publish the first textbook on
                acoustics in 1802), which seemed to show sound itself making shapes in iron
                    filings.<note place="foot" resp="author">On Chladni’s
                            contribution to acoustics see Viktoria Tkaczyk, “The Making of Acoustics

                     </note>
                Chladni drew a bow across the edge of a metal plate covered in sand before
                exclaiming, as legend has it: ‘The sound is painting!’ (quoted in Cox, 14).
                The significance of this experiment cannot be overstated: not only did it seem to
                reveal the material form of sound, but doing so Chladni proved that sound could
                travel through solid substances and could no longer “be subsumed under the ‘the
                science of air’ and could be considered a branch of physics in its own right”
                (Viktoria Tkaczyk, 27-56, 27). Chladni first published his acoustical figures
                in German in 1787, and gave a copy to the Royal Society in November of the same
                year. Coleridge may have read about the experiment in the
                <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine </hi>(3, May 1799,
                389-96) in which a translation of the Jena physics professor Johann Heinrich Voigt’s

                after Chladni had demonstrated the experiment (he had visited Gottingen between
                December 1792 and early 1793, https://monoskop.org/Ernst Chladni ). The experiment
                was to be popularised in London in 1800 when Thomas Young repeated the demonstration
                to an enthralled audience at The Royal Society. The Chladni figures were part of a
                wider culture of acoustic spectacle in the early nineteenth century. Edward Gillen
                explains that in “London’s fashionable West End . . . sonorous displays, especially
                those of a musical nature, combined with philosophical inquiry, provided mystifying
                and wondrous entertainment” (1). He argues
                that “Chladni’s acoustic plates provided a rich example of how specialist and
                non-specialist audiences alike could engage with new scientific ideas from the
                Continent”. While I am not suggesting that Coleridge’s poems of the 1790s
                were influenced directly by Chladni’s experiments, I want to propose that they too
                register a curiosity about what he was to describe as “the Embryo science of
                acoustics”, which was itself part of a culture of curiosity about sound in the
                Romantic period.<note place="foot" resp="author">For discussions

                  <p> Coleridge’s own interest in the semiotics of sound and its representation is figured
                in the Conversation poems and based on his wider interest in science during his stay
                in Somerset the 1790s. As Tim Fulford has explained, the Conversation poems were
                influenced by and part of a wider culture of scientific enquiry.
                Pushing Fulford’s argument yet further, we might understand Coleridge’s Conversation
                poems as articulations of a growing interest in and curiosity not only about the
                nature of air, but also about a relate field of enquiry, the science of acoustics,
                and in particular, the movement and materiality of sound. In “Frost at Midnight”
                this interest was perhaps modulated by his sense of the poems’ expected mode of
                reception: he knew that it was likely to be read in silence, heard only in the
                mind’s ear. But it is also framed by its occasion, spoken to a sleeping baby who
                cannot hear him, at least not consciously. </p>
                  <p> The poem’s concluding lines meditate on the sounds and silences of water drops and
                icicles in a way that puts pressure on the language of listening:
                <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>[…] whether the eve-drops fall </l>
                        <l>Heard only in the trances of the blast, </l>
                        <l>Or if the secret ministry of frost </l>
                        <l>Shall hang them up in silent icicles, </l>
                        <l>Quietly shining to the quiet Moon. (ll.70-74)</l>
                     </lg>
                
            The word “silent” invites our listening. Here, in these lines, or perhaps I should
                say through these lines, our ears become subtly tuned to the sounds of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> which shifts gently into <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>. The line “<hi rend="italic">quietly shining to the quiet moon,</hi>”
                picks up and resounds the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> of
                <hi rend="italic">silent icicles, </hi>recalling the sound of
                that <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> even as it suggests a different sound. It’s
                worth noting here that the phrase is not, as it might have been,
                <hi rend="italic">silently </hi>shining to
                the<hi rend="italic"> silent </hi>moon – but <hi rend="italic">quietly</hi> shining to the <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> moon<hi rend="italic">,</hi> and this difference suggests a thawing of <hi rend="italic">silence,</hi> since <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> can, but does not always or
                only, mean silent. Quiet can suggest a low or subdued sound (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi> 1A, a, <hi rend="italic">adj</hi>, “making little sound”; 2a, “making
                little or no noise”). That repeated word <hi rend="italic">quietly</hi> dims into a
                shorter <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>, drawing the ear to listen in, to the
                possibility of the moon’s quiet sound<hi rend="italic">.</hi> And the line has only
                4 stresses instead of the 5 stress iambic baseline of the poem, so we are left both
                with a sense of lack- and anticipation - listening out for the last stress. </p>
                  <p>There’s a sense of diminishing and <hi rend="italic">diminuendo</hi>, but also a
                feeling of completion as “quietly” turns to “quiet,” and as we move from “icicles”
                to the monosyllabic “moon”. This drawing in suggests both sonic diminuendo and
                intimacy, despite the great distance of the moon. The icicles are quiet because,
                unlike the water dropping from the eaves, they no longer splash and make a sound.
                There is a strange shift of scale and of distance here – one which prompts us to
                question how a moon might be quiet. That repeated word “quiet” suggests a kind of
                proximity —even, that it might be possible to hear the moon, that its sound might be
                quiet, even as are the nearby icicles. The quiet shining of the icicles <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the moon is imagined as a form of address, to the
                listening moon. These icicles are silent but eloquent: and yet their silence is not
                eloquent of the self in the way Salome Voegelin proposes. (83).
                Rather, it speaks of the presence of something greater. As Paul Magnuson puts it,
                “at the quietest moments of the year when the icicles are frozen in silence, there
                is a force in the world shining through the icicles.” <note place="foot" resp="author"> Coleridge may well have known that Robert Burns uses
                            the term “silent moon” (“While the silent moon shine clearly”) in the
                            last wooing and intimate verse of his Song <hi rend="italic">Westlin

                       These silences speak of intimacy and also of something far
                more greatly interfused- a force in the world.</p>

                  <head>viii. Conclusion</head>
                  <p>For Coleridge, the ability to listen was fundamental to being a poet. A great poet,
                he suggests, writing in July 1802 to his friend William Sotheby, should be able to
                listen with “the ear of a wild Arab list’ning in the silent Desart” (Coleridge, <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>: ii, 810). We know that the Arab is listening, in
                silence – but we do not know what it is he listens to or for. The state of
                listening, hearkening, for something is the poetic state. But silence also seems
                important: Coleridge’s test for the poet combines forms of privation – that
                emptiness, which shares the root ‘desert’: the dryness of deserts, the solitude of
                the deserted, and the soundlessness of silence. The wild Arab is alert for the
                slightest sound- listening FOR sound in silence. Coleridge’s words invite the reader
                too to listen - that word “listening” alerts us to the sound patterns instinct in
                the lines that follow. The poet, Coleridge goes on, should also be possessed of “the
                eye of a North American Indian tracing the footsteps of an Enemy upon the leaves
                that strew the forest, the <hi rend="italic">Touch</hi> of a blind man feeling the
                face of a darling Child” (810). Primed to listen, the reader might pick up a
                suggestion of sound in the word <hi rend="italic">footsteps</hi> (they are footsteps
                he is tracing, rather than the <hi rend="italic">footprints</hi> we might have
                expected) and the sound of these footsteps resounds in the <hi rend="italic">st</hi>
                sounds of <hi rend="italic">strew</hi> and <hi rend="italic">forest</hi>. It alerts
                us to the gentle pathos of that word
                <hi rend="italic">touch </hi>touching in <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> the <hi rend="italic">child</hi> as the blind man touches its face. </p>
                  <p> Thinking about different kinds of listening in a notebook entry a few months later,
                in September 1802, Coleridge returns to the blind man and the wild Arab as figures
                for sensory acuity. His choice of an Arab and a North American Indian as examples
                are striking and suggest, perhaps, a primitivist notion that such peoples had more
                acute senses than Europeans. Choosing these geographically remote listeners
                introduces a poignant distance between himself and the figure of the ideal listener,
                which in turn intensifies the dynamics of listening described. Here, the blind man
                and the Arab come together in the figure of “a <hi rend="italic">blind Arab</hi>
                list’ning in the wilderness” (Coleridge, <hi rend="italic">Notebooks</hi>, i. 1244):
                now the blindness of the listener intensifies his listening once again. And instead
                of the blind man feeling the face of the darling child we have, more painful, a
                different kind of listening, a listening which can never be satisfied, a “Mother
                listening for the <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> of a still-born child” (ibid.)
                Silence here comes to represent an extreme form of loss and absence – Coleridge’s
                examples move through degrees of privation - from the blind Arab in the desart to the
                poignant expectancy of the mother listening for a sound that she will never hear.<note place="foot" resp="author">To William Sotheby’, July 13, 1802, in L. Griggs

                  <p>To think about the representation and account of sound in these poems in relation to
                contemporary scientific instruments and innovations in acoustics, and also, as I
                have indicated, to a wider culture of curiosity about how sound could be represented
                and embodied on the page in music and in print opens up fresh thinking about the
                significance of silence and quiet in Coleridge’s poems, and in Romantic lyric more
                widely. What is needed is a new kind of listening, which includes attention to the
                dynamics of apostrophe, the cryptographic reading described by John Shoptaw, that,
                “listening for what familiar words and phrases the line echoes or calls to mind,” as

               <p>In the early lines of “Frost at Midnight,” Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s speaker asks the
                reader to listen with him. His brief description of “the owlet’s cry” which “came
                    loud”<note place="foot" resp="author">Samuel Taylor Coleridge, <hi rend="italic">Samuel Taylor Coleridge: The Major Works</hi>, ed. H. J.

                interrupted by the cry itself: “—and hark, again! loud as before.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., line 3.</note>(3). However, while its
                interruptive presence primes the reader to attend to sound, it is not this piercing
                cry which dominates the first stanza; instead, our attention is turned to the
                quietness it throws into relief. The speaker registers the strangeness of the
                evening’s “extreme silentness”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., line
                    10.</note>against the momentarily imperceptible din of “all the numberless
                goings on of life.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., line
                12.</note>Yet the silence in the cottage is not emptiness. The speaker
                self-consciously implies that those sounding things and bodies must still be
                somewhere stirring airwaves even while his human ear finds them “Inaudible as
                    dreams.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., line 13.</note>What’s
                more, their ‘vexing’ inaudibility seems to prompt him to listen more closely into
                the silence for signs of life nearby. He soon entrains himself to “the sole unquiet
                thing,” the “film” that “still flutters” on the grate.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., lines 15-16.</note>Whether the speaker actually <hi rend="italic">hears</hi> the film’s flutters is indeterminate at best, but the
                possibility that its unquietness has not only to do with visible motion but with
                motion-as-soundwaves is extremely suggestive. Faced with what he otherwise perceives
                as a calm so profound that it “disturbs / And vexes meditation,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., lines 8-9.</note>the speaker becomes attuned
                    multisensorially<note place="foot" resp="author"> Romantic audition
                    almost never occurs in complete isolation from the other senses, and it is very
                    often paired with sight (particularly in Wordsworth). In instances in which the
                    senses are more emphatically intertwined without being conflated with one
                    another (as in synaesthesia), I find the term ‘multisensorial’ to effectively
                    suggest a heightened awareness of multiple dimensions of embodied sensation.
                    Nina Sun Eidsheim asserts that sound transmission is necessarily multisensorial,
                    and argues that to think of it as such is necessary in order to “redirect
                    thinking about sound as object…toward a reconception of sound as event” (Nina
                    Sun Eidsheim, <hi rend="italic">Sensing Sound: Singing &amp; Listening as
                        Vibrational Practice</hi>, Sign, Storage, Transmission (Durham: Duke
                    University Press, 2015), 3.My aim here is to show how a Romantic poetics of
                    ‘unquiet’ noise works in that direction by emphasizing the play between
                    attention, perception, and subjective response to such sounding vibrations.
                </note>to the one thing disturbing the silence. Coleridge
                    seems to acknowledge that absolute silence (and, as such, absolute individual
                    seclusion) is an impossibility; as long as the subject is situated in a world
                    with energy and other bodies, the air will always be filled with sound vibration
                    and there will always be some noise.</p>
               <p>This essay posits an ‘unquiet’ Romanticism. I examine a
                    category of sonic moments in Romantic poetry in which the limits of audition are
                    stretched to acknowledge not only what and how we hear but also the significance
                    of sounds so low-decibel as to render the idea that they could be audible almost
                    absurd. The unlikeliness that Coleridge actually means the event of his
                perception of the film to be a clear case of audition, strictly speaking, is
                    precisely why I have chosen to begin this essay with
                    the example of “Frost at Midnight,” which I would hazard to call a less
                    obviously sonic poem than many I could have chosen. Dwelling on the film’s
                flutter as a sonic event accomplishes a few things that are central to this essay:
                1. It foregrounds sound’s radical materiality as a concept I argue was more
                ubiquitous in the Romantic intellectual milieu than has tended to be acknowledged,
                2. It explores the specific affordances of ‘unquiet’ noise as a generative category
                of sound, and 3. It toggles between sensory experience and the disembodied
                imagination, and therefore gets at quintessentially Romantic questions surrounding
                phenomenal experience and the creative subject. </p>
               <p>Though in general Romanticism is thick with
                    sounds<note place="foot" resp="author"> Susan Wolfson’s essay in the
                        2008<hi rend="italic">Romantic Circles: Praxis</hi> volume on sound shows us
                    just how variegated an array of Romantic sounds we might place together. Like
                    many others, Wolfson places particular emphasis on William Wordsworth’s ear, but
                    she also highlights Coleridge’s deep interest in sound. See Susan J. Wolfson,
                    “Sounding Romantic: The Sound of Sound,” in <hi rend="italic">95240</hi>, ed.
                    Susan J. Wolfson, Romantic Circles Praxis Series: Apr (College Park, MD:
                    University of Maryland Press, 2008),
                    https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-35973-1_795. By starting with such a quiet
                    moment in Coleridge, I hope to search beneath the sounds that tend to catch our
                    attention in order to understand Romantic writing as more sonically rich than we
                    have tended to appreciate.</note>and certainly not
                    short on noises that fit this category, I will limit my reading here to a few
                    prime examples of ‘quiet’ things made ‘unquiet’ in poetry of the period. In each
                    case, the Romantic power of the imagination is made resonant with material sound
                    objects that elude its absolute grasp. These sounds often emerge into the field
                    of hearing such that they seem always to have been there awaiting perception,
                    their temporal and spatial indeterminacy contributing an abstract type of
                    vastness and raising questions about perception, receptivity, and attention, as
                    the listener oscillates between agential attunement and induced receptivity. In
                    these passages, expansive movements of the mind prompted by even the gentlest
                    sonic vibrations blur the lines between pleasure and fearful awe, and between
                    imaginative empowerment and vulnerability. They
                    likewise expand the boundaries of aesthetic categories of sublimity and beauty
                    to encompass qualities of disorganization not traditionally regarded as properly
                    aesthetic at all. Such ‘unquiet’ sounds draw attention to a material
                    understanding of acoustics that would become increasingly popularized throughout
                    the nineteenth century. They represent silence and quietness as sensorially
                potent and listening as an emphatically embodied perceptive mode which nonetheless
                involves the imagination in a process of knowledge production centered on
                self-conscious subjectivity. As sound theorist Salome Voegelin writes, “Sound
                narrates, outlines and fills, but it is always ephemeral and doubtful. Between my
                heard and the sonic object/phenomenon I will never know its truth but can only
                invent it, producing a knowing for me.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                Jean-Luc Nancy’s articulation, “To be listening will always. . . be to be straining

                and Nancy, I suggest that for the Romantics, listening to unquiet noise is often
                both an active ‘straining’ to place oneself as a creative agent in relation to the
                world and—somewhat paradoxically—a compelled state of receptive embodiment. In their
                approaches to quietly noisy sounds that refuse absolute
                    epistemological or symbolic stability, the examples I explore thus suggest
                a gray area between a solitary Romantic subjectivity
                    dependent on the strength of the autonomous
                    imagination and a (just as fundamentally Romantic) sensorially contingent
                    conception of self.</p>

                destructive force. R. Murray Schafer’s<hi rend="italic">The Soundscape

                studies, centers on modernity’s transition from a pre-industrial “hi-fi” soundscape
                to a “lo-fi” soundscape in which individual sounds are more difficult to distinguish
                from a higher density of ambient sound. Schafer focuses on environmental and
                humanist concern for how our ability to gather information (and, indeed, pleasure)
                from our acoustic environment has degraded with the proliferation of noise
                pollution. The discourse surrounding silence and noise to which I wish to attend,
                however, concerns itself with an awareness that true, absolute silence has never
                existed. It explores noise not as a one-dimensionally overwhelming, distracting or
                painful thing, but rather as an ambiguous, sometimes baffling, and sometimes
                imaginatively provocative presence. </p>
               <p>Coleridge’s fluttering film, the residue of a coal fire, encodes a relationship to
                industry and an associated atmosphere of urban loudness, so that the “numberless
                goings on of life / Inaudible as dreams,” and consequently contexts of social,

                quietness. But it is also invoked in the poem in the context of nostalgia and
                anticipation made possible by an active imagination. Coleridge progresses from the
                memory of his own disappointed childhood longings brought forth by his fixation on
                the stranger to a projected vision of a future in which his son, whose “gentle
                breathings, heard in this deep calm” eventually replace the flutter as the dominant
                noise in his ear and “Fill up the interspersed vacancies / And momentary pauses of
                the thought,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Coleridge,"Frost at
                    Midnight," lines 45-47.</note>will live amongst the gently nurturing noises of
                the country’s quietude. The poem therefore acknowledges coexisting but contradictory
                relationships with noise; it can be fraught, overpowering, painful, or destructive,
                but it can also be beguiling, compelling, calming, or imaginatively animating.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Coleridge also makes an intriguing statement
                    about the anticipating mind’s ability to make meaning from noise:“Even when we
                    are broad awake, if we are in anxious expectation, how often will not the most
                    confused sounds of nature be heard by us as articulate sounds? for instance, the
                    babbling of a brook will appear for a moment, the voice of a Friend , for whom
                    we are waiting, calling out our own names.” Samuel Taylor Coleridge, “Christmas

               <p>Coleridge approaches what might seem like silence as instead a thicker atmosphere
                that is populated by the film’s flutter. In this way, he anticipates John Cage’s
                famous refutation of silence as emptiness. In 1937, Cage began the lecture that
                would eventually become the “credo” on “the future of music” at the front of essays
                collected under the title <hi rend="italic">Silence </hi>(1961) with a now-famous
                statement of sonic reality: “Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise. When we
                ignore it, it disturbs us. When we listen to it, we find it fascinating…We want to
                capture and control these sounds, to use them not as sound effects but as musical
                    instruments.<note place="foot" resp="author"> John Cage, <hi rend="italic">Silence: 50th Anniversary Edition</hi>, ed. Kyle Gann
                    (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 2011), 3.</note>Cage implies
                that, in literal terms, true silence is an impossibility. In the field of sound
                studies, Cage’s words have been taken up time and again in efforts at grappling with
                the awareness that sound must be a constant presence with which we interact, whether
                we attend to it or not. They have also been used to unravel the concept of noise as
                a stable or objectively classifiable sub-category of sound. Cage’s emphasis on how
                attention to noise can shift it from a ‘disturbance’ to an object of fascination
                foregrounds subjectivity in listening, whereas many theorizations of noise center on
                the social by examining how it can only be defined aesthetically in comparison with
                other sounds on the basis of culturally dictated ideals of aesthetic value.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Jacques Attali famously discussed the
                    organization of sounds into music as cultural power and “noise control” as
                    “cultural repression” and defined noise as a relationally constructed category
                    explicitly in the context of sociopolitical and economic power. See Jacques

                ongoing interrogation of how we define noise can be enriched by a consideration of
                how pre-phonograph literary writing (and Romantic lyric poetry in particular) might
                be approached as a kind of sound recording technology that necessarily emphasizes
                what Michel Chion calls the ‘auditum,’ sound as heard.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Michel Chion, <hi rend="italic">Sound: An Acoulogical

                        (New York: Continuum, 2012).</note>I consider how poetic
                representations of noises offering a hushed counterpoint to the thunderous
                sublime—sounds that treads a line between audible and not—might help us to rethink
                the relationships between Romantic representations of listening, early information
                about acoustic physics, and theorizations of noise and silence that followed. While
                the “unquiet” noises that interest me appear across vastly different poetic
                settings, I hope to explore consistencies in their understanding of noise—and,
                adjacently, the aesthetic qualities of a sound—as a concept rooted in the
                self-reflexive experience of listening. To do so is to understand the Romantic
                imagination to have been interested not only in the implications of living with and
                contributing to an increasingly noisy world, but also in how sounds so far removed
                from anything like musical organization (or even the categories of tonal sound
                available at the turn of the nineteenth century) might be generative points of
                contact between the creative mind and the phenomenal world. </p>
               <p>Coleridge’s fluttering film can be called noise precisely because of how the speaker
                reflects on his perception of it. Calling the film “unquiet” does not explicitly
                identify its motion as audible, but at the same time it does not exclude its erratic
                oscillations from noise as a class of sonic vibrations. If we are meant to
                understand that the speaker hears the film’s flutter, it is because the absence of
                louder noises allows for a heightened awareness of small ones.<note place="foot" resp="author"> It bears consideration, too, that listening and hearing are
                    not mutually exclusive. One can listen without managing to hear anything, and
                    vice versa. I suggest that Romanticism frames listening, whether or not it
                    results in the definitiveperception of an audible tone, as a mode of vibrational
                    aurality.</note>If not, the movement of the film is nonetheless registered as a
                movement of the air with a profound capacity to engage the speaker’s mind. Tiny and
                questionably audible as it is, the flutter is made sonorous. </p>
               <p>Contemplating the film once it becomes present to his notice, the speaker begins to
                self-consciously examine the reasons behind its emergent significance:

                behind it and the film itself as an object of frustrated anticipation in Coleridge’s
                memory. Its motion is therefore often aligned more closely with the ‘vexing’ silence
                than with Hartley’s breath, which is typically read as a source of imaginative
                rejuvenation and hopeful projection.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See
                    for example Tim Fulford’s reading aeration in the poem in his challenge to
                    readings of the conversation poems as “attempt[s] to transcend materiality.” For
                    Fulford, the weakness of the flutter of the grate in otherwise “static” air is
                    ‘under-stimulating’ and so recalls moments of similarly fitful desire for mental
                    arousal, and it is not until Coleridge is “revived by Hartley’s breathings” that
                    he becomes “mentally lively” enough to envision “a future harmony between self,
                    world, and God.” Fulford, “Science and Poetry in 1790s Somerset: The

                    uses the flutter’s “extreme frailty” to find precarity behind the visionary

                restlessness as the primary animating force behind the film’s liveliness, I am
                interested in considering how a sonic reading of the film might help us to regard
                its material activity as mentally provoking, without exaggerating the volume of its
                force. In exploring apparent silence as inclusive of ‘unquiet’ noise which is
                imaginatively stimulating, I follow from Nancy Yousef’s reading of “Frost and
                Midnight.” Yousef frames the poem as exploring a “generative silence”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Nancy Yousef, <hi rend="italic">Romantic

                she identifies as its echo in the speaker’s image of his child “fluttering” in his

                    meditation”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., 122.</note>Coleridge
                explores in the poem arises from a particular kind of Romantic intimacy resting on
                the presence, without distraction, of an other. I wish to cast sonic materiality as
                a constitutive dimension of the conditions of meditation she describes. Yousef
                writes:
                
            <quote>What is marked as extraordinary here is precisely not silence as opposed to sound but
                    <hi rend="italic">this</hi> silence as compared to other, more familiar, less
                intense experiences of silence. But what constitutes this estranging excess? What is
                so disquieting in this midnight calm? Thought is neither arrested nor agitated in
                the lines that follow. On the contrary, the self-conscious, alert but by no means
                anxious, reflections inspired by the film fluttering on the grate, ‘making it a
                companionable form,’ seem to follow the mind at play.</quote>

            One answer to the question above might be Coleridge’s awareness in this moment that
                the silence in the cottage is thick with inaudible sound. Reading the film’s flutter
                sonically complicates the idea that the speaker simply projects his own liveliness
                onto an inanimate object. If on a molecular level, sounds, as vibrations, move us
                whether we hear them or not, Coleridge’s attunement to the flutter might not be
                ‘animating’ so much as attentive to how even the smallest sonic encounters engage us
                in a self-reflexive and materially reciprocal relationship with the world and others
                around us. Coleridge’s imagined ‘sympathy’ with the film upon attuning to its
                flutter gestures toward vibrational reciprocity, something that sound studies
                theorists argue makes sonic perception unique.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Jonathan Sterne’s “audiovisual litany” is a useful primer on the most
                    typically rehearsed distinctions between sight and sound. The shift from
                    subject-object (looking) to a reciprocal subject-subject dynamic (listening) is
                    of immense importance to theorists interested in distinguishing audition as a
                    unique sensorial mode. SeeJonathan Sterne, <hi rend="italic">The Audible Past:

               <p>That sound vibration is material, and that we encounter it in embodied modes in
                excess of the tones we can perceive aurally, was a fact of increasing interest
                during the Romantic period. Late-eighteenth-century investigations of the
                physiological and cognitive significance of vibration as a more general
                phenomenon—most notably David Hartley’s theory of vibratory associationism—have been well-canvassed, but I would like to draw out some

            <quote>The vibration of the air agitated by the sounding body disturbs the eardrum. This
                moves the small bones in the cavity, which act on one another as levers. The base of
                the stirrup imprints these vibrations on the gelatinous fluid that fills the whole
                labyrinth, by means of the oval window. The vibrations of the eardrum also disturb
                the air contained in the cavity, which transmits these impulses to the round window,
                so that the impression is handled in two ways at the same time. The auditory nerve,
                the substance of which is widespread in the whole labyrinth, transmits these
                impressions to the brain, as the common center of all sensation.</quote>

           Chladni’s emphasis on the final transmission of vibration to the brain isolates
                hearing as a unique sense, but he is also careful to frame multisensory embodiment
                as a necessary premise for audition and, indeed, for cognition. </p>
               <p>Where Chladni hit an epistemological impasse, and where I argue poetically rendered
                ‘unquiet’ sounds in Romanticism explore productive ambiguities, was in noise.
                Chladni began to identify how a tone behaves as both a discrete external entity and
                a psychophysiological phenomenon, beginning his monograph by drawing a definitional
                line between sound and noise: “A sufficiently rapid vibratory motion that is strong
                enough to affect the hearing organ is a <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>. If the
                vibrations of a sounding body are distinguishable, both in their frequency and in

                    (emphasis in original).</note>While Chladni notes that noise necessarily
                accompanies those tones we <hi rend="italic">can </hi>distinguish, and even vaguely
                anticipates Herman von Helmholtz’s enormously influential mid-nineteenth-century
                work on partial overtones by suggesting that additional frequencies contribute to
                the timbre of sound in music,<note place="foot" resp="author"> Chladni, <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Acoustics</hi> 30.</note>it is clear that at the
                turn of the nineteenth century, the new field of acoustic physics was not yet ready
                to confront noise mathematically. He effectively throws his hands up, writing, “In
                distinct sound, the vibrations of a sounding body or of its parts are carried out at
                the same time, and all the vibrations are of equal duration; but one cannot say the
                same thing about noise, the nature of which is still not known.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid.</note>In doing so, he gestures toward some of the
                epistemological problems facing acoustic scientists at the time as well as (more
                obliquely) the ontological challenges inherent in an understanding that every body
                inhabits a reciprocal relationship with the vibrating world of noise. </p>
               <p>Edmund Burke uses similar language to Chladni’s in his description of a sonic
                sublimity dependent the cumulative effect of a repeated “simple sound” causing the
                ear “to be struck by a single pulse of the air, which makes the ear-drum and the
                other membranous parts vibrate.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Edmund

            Apart from sheer force of volume, then, disorganized noise has no place in Burke’s
                aesthetics. </p>
               <p>What Burke and Chladni dismiss as neither epistemologically nor aesthetically stable
                is precisely what I refer to when I discuss “unquiet” noises in Romantic poetry.
                Rather than coming to an intellectual dead end in the face of noise, however, I
                argue that Romantic poets explored how the imagination might participate in the
                perception of both beauty and sublimity in quiet noise. In “Frost at Midnight,” to
                return to Coleridge, ‘indistinguishable’ sound is imbued with experiential and
                psychological significance. Coleridge emphasizes the flutter’s extreme quietness and
                frames it, as an event in the space of the cottage, as atmospherically insignificant
                apart from the speaker’s attunement to it, which makes it an object of absorbing
                meditation. In this way, he models Voegelin’s definition of noise as a participatory
                event between the mind and an external vibration: “Noise,” she writes, “does not
                have to be loud, but it has to be exclusive. . . This can be achieved through tiny sounds
                that grab my ear and make my listening obsessive and exclusive. . . Sound is noisy when
                it deafens my ears to anything but itself.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

               </p>
               <p>Thus Coleridge’s loud, piercing, unquestionably audible owlet’s cry and the ambiguous
                audibility of the fluttering film might both be approached as noise in the poem on
                the basis of the speaker’s focused attunement to them. Coleridge shows attention to
                be grabbed, but then also directed toward the ‘unquiet’ noise object. He
                demonstrates how willed attunement can shift a sound from an unwelcome irritation to
                a familiar friend, a shift upon which Zadie Smith reflects in her essay on
                attunement. She recounts having hummed a tune that was newly resonating with her in
                the “vast silence of a valley” at Tintern Abbey and describes the complex affinity
                she felt for it, “not yet conscious of the transformation she had undergone” as it
                became something significant to her memory and her conception of self.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Zadie Smith, “Some Notes on Attunement: A

                flutter. While the owlet’s loudness initially compels his attention, the film on the
                grate almost resists it until it takes on outsize importance, initiating the first
                major movement of the mind in the poem when the speaker is swept back to his
                schoolboy days and the longing he felt then for his

            Once he attunes to it, the film is made resonant in the poem. Its softly noisy
                movement is rendered in the onomatopoeic quality of its description and mingles with
                the remembered “music” of bells, themselves meaningful both in general aesthetic
                terms for their deliberate, tuned harmonies, but in this case also for the “wild
                pleasure” they had inspired. The poem enacts what Nina Sun Eidsheim calls a
                “vibrational practice,” which she writes “relates a sound not to an a priori
                definition but to transmission.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Eidsheim,
                        <hi rend="italic">Sensing Sound</hi>, 19.</note> The ‘transmission’ of
                vibrational energy between the film and the speaker activates memory, imagination,
                and aesthetic pleasure. Eidsheim’s is a corrective approach to the musical
                aesthetics Chladni and Helmholtz strove to explain mathematically, calling for a
                transition “from thinking about music as a knowable aesthetic object to thinking
                about it as transferrable energy. <hi rend="italic">Transferable energy</hi> here
                denotes energy pulsating through and across material and transforming as it adapts
                to and takes on various material qualities; it is at the crux of thinking about
                music in the dimensions of transmission and vibrational realizations in
                material-specific and dynamic contexts.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Ibid., 16.</note> Eidsheim’s vibrational practice is fundamentally active
                entrainment. I argue that understanding such a practice to lie at the basis of
                listening may help us to think through Romanticism’s consistent conflation of the
                concepts of music and noise, particularly in the cases I have pointed out, where
                noise is not loud, but instead a gentle chaos of vibrations and more likely to be
                approached as ‘sweet’ or musical.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Though it
                    lies beyond the scope of this essay, the embrace of the possibility of finding
                    beauty and meaning in noise is perhaps most commonly presented in the Romantic
                    affinity for the æolian lyre as a model for creative activity; though tuned with
                    musical intention, the sound patterns wind harps produce are more or less
                    random, and their effect can often be harmonically jumbled, a quality Percy
                    Shelley seems to acknowledge when he notes in <hi rend="italic">A Defence of
                        Poetry </hi>that in contrast with the “ever-changing melody” of a lyre, the
                    human mind produces “an internal adjustment of the sound or motions thus excited
                    to the impressions which excite them” (page 511).</note>The evident “nonfixity”
                of these noises invites imaginative attention, but it also makes them elusive to it,
                tempting evocative verbal emphasis on their intriguing material qualities and
                suggesting an opportunity for imaginative projection that appeals to a Romantic
                interest in the creative power of a poetic mind. As such, appreciating them as
                creatively and cognitively provocative requires specific kinds of active imaginative
                openness.</p>
               <p>For Voegelin and for Coleridge, ‘noise’ has less to do with measurable properties of
                a sound as a material object than it does with attention and the behavior of the
                mind in perceiving it. To be engaged by noise is to be complicit in giving oneself
                up to an embodied sonic experience rather than to practice the “apprehending
                listening” dictated by musical aesthetic philosophies organized around identifiable
                    tones.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Voegelin, <hi rend="italic">Listening to Noise and Silence</hi>, 53.</note> Another way to put this
                might be to say that entering a frame of mind in which noise is imaginatively
                provocative is a form of Keats’s negative capability, “when man is capable of being
                in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &amp;
                    reason.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> John Keats, <hi rend="italic">Selected Letters</hi>, ed. Robert Gittings and Jon Mee, Oxford World’s
                    Classics (Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 41–42.</note> Of
                course, Keats goes on to criticize Coleridge for an incapability of achieving such a
                frame of mind. But in a reading of “Frost at Midnight” emphasizing the speaker’s
                willingness to follow the movements of thought and indeterminate anticipations
                prompted by his attunement to such an uncertain signal as the unquiet film, might we
                not see evidence of such a capacity?</p>
               <p>Because the noises I am classing as “unquiet” in Romanticism are not immediately
                legible in terms of aesthetic quality or meaning—personal, natural, social, or
                otherwise—they draw the mind of the hearer out to become an actively engaged
                listener involved in encountering them as aesthetic objects rather than simply
                material phenomena. As such, they enfold a distinctly Romantic interest in how the
                creative imagination extends itself into the sensuously stimulating world. As the
                Coleridge example I have been revisiting emphasizes, these are very often persistent
                sounds. Their low volume, and in some cases their lack of characteristic or
                distinguishing tones, means that they can sometimes waft through the air undetected,
                reaching the ears without alerting the mind. Once the listener seeks them out or
                they ‘grab the ears,’ to borrow terminology from Voegelin, however, ‘unquiet’ noises
                tend to re-echo in imaginative memory. It is in that mental amplification that they
                take on greater resonance, though very often this is a ‘silent’ process. The
                meditative mood that follows Coleridge’s attention to the fluttering film, for
                example, bears similarity to Wordsworth’s speaker listening to the “homeless voice
                of waters” rising through the “breach” in “vapour” atop Mount Snowdon in <hi rend="italic">The Prelude,</hi>

                from the others in many ways, each features a sublime imaginative expansion in the
                mind’s striving effort of listening for or to noises that I would call ‘unquiet,’
                whose power lies not in their volume, but in their indeterminacy. Rather than
                focusing on the heard sound object per se, these passages focus instead what
                Eidsheim above calls “transferable energy,” which is to be located <hi rend="italic">both</hi> within the heard noise itself and in the listener’s internalization
                of some impression of the acoustic encounter. They call to mind Jean-Luc Nancy’s
                description of the difference between hearing and listening: “If ‘to hear’ is to
                understand the sense (either in the so-called figurative sense, or in the so-called
                proper sense: to hear a siren, a bird, or a drum is already each time to understand
                at least the rough outline of a situation, a context if not a text), to listen is to
                be straining toward a possible meaning, and consequently one that is not immediately
                    accessible.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Nancy, <hi rend="italic">Listening</hi>, 6.</note> Listening, then, does involve the subject to
                relinquish a certain degree of intellectual control. For Nancy, in fact, truly
                “immersed” listening, “with all [one’s] being”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., 4.</note> for the “the sound that is musically listened to, that
                is gathered and scrutinized for itself. . . as a resonant meaning, a meaning whose <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> is supposed to be found in resonance and only in
                resonance” places one “always on the edge of meaning.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., 7.</note> Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley each
                place their listening subjects into such an immersed, striving mode, but they do so
                without fully abandoning imaginative autonomy. </p>
               <p>To be “on the edge of meaning” is a state that Wordsworth in particular explores
                through his representations of listening. Sound, more often than not the sound of
                various waters, runs as a current throughout <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi>,
                often in relation the poet-speaker’s striving desire to feel fellowship with a
                creative force in nature and to reciprocally meet its voices with his own. I would
                like to focus my attention on two instances of especially chaotic but not
                necessarily loud Wordsworthian noise. The first is the “voice / Of mountain
                    torrents”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Wordsworth, <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi>, bk 5 lines 408-9.</note> in “There was a boy,” and the
                second is the similarly distant “homeless voice of waters”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Wordsworth, <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi>, bk 13 line
                    63.</note> Wordsworth recounts hearing from from atop Mount Snowdon. </p>
               <p>As in “Frost at Midnight,” the noise in question in “There was a boy” is preceded by
                undeniably loud owls. The boy stands calling out to the birds, confident that his
                mimicry will be rewarded with a response. At first, Wordsworth confirms the boy’s
                conceit: In return to the boy’s calls the owls 
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                     <l>would shout </l>
                     <l>Across the wat’ry vale, and shout again, </l>
                     <l>Responsive to his call, with quivering peals </l>
                     <l>And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud, </l>
                     <l>Redoubled and redoubled—concourse wild </l>
                     <l>Of mirth and jocund din.</l>

            The disorderly tumult of disembodied voices emanates from the trees reverberates. Yet
                this is not what leaves an impression on the boy. That kind of deeply affecting
                power emanates instead from the distant noise of waters:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                     <l>And when it chanced</l>
                     <l>That pauses of deep silence mocked his skill,</l>
                     <l>Then sometimes in that silence, while he hung</l>
                     <l>Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprize</l>
                     <l>Has carried far into his heart the voice</l>
                     <l>Of mountain torrents . . . </l>
                     <note place="foot" n="59"> Ibid., bk 5 lines
                    404-409</note>
                  </lg>
                    
            It is important to note that the boy’s ability to hear the torrents depends on his
                own silence, but also that his listening is only “sometimes” met with the affecting
                shock of the watery “voice”; ultimately, neither natural sound can be unequivocally
                commanded. As Michele Speitz has pointed out, “sound simply cannot be possessed for
                the Wordsworthian human subject; sound can be felt and felt again but only to be
                lost and lost again”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Speitz, “The
                    Wordsworthian Acoustic Imagination, Sonic Recursions, and ‘That Dying Murmur,’”
                    623.</note> In order to hear the torrents, the boy must shift from his assumed
                position of power over nature and its voices to a more open reciprocal state,
                responding to nature’s sonic refusal of his control by silently listening for
                whatever sounds might reach him.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Adam
                    Potkay, hearing is an ethical counterpoint to seeing in Wordsworth. “Before we
                    can be ethically open to other humans, responsive to them in their alterity,” he
                    writes, “we need first to open ourselves to idling and inhuman things in a way
                    that habituates us to asymmetrical sympathy. To do this, in turn, we need to be
                    attuned to languages that are not ‘articulate,’ that is, literally, composed of
                    distinctive, serial sounds.” See Potkay, <hi rend="italic">Wordsworth’s
                        Ethics</hi>, 97. </note>Following Geoffrey Hartman’s reading, the abrupt
                shift from the boy’s listening pause to information of his early death has often
                been read as an example of traumatic incompletion,<note place="foot" resp="author"> Hartman, Geoffrey H., <hi rend="italic">Wordsworth’s Poetry

                on the metrically accentuated pause in “Listening,” the moment of audition in which
                the poem freezes him is nonetheless one of expansive affective and cognitive depth. </p>
               <p>Wordsworth’s encounter with distant torrents from the slopes of Mount Snowdon later
                in <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi> finds similar depth in noise. After the
                poet-speaker and his trailing companions emerge into moonlight in a “flash of
                light,” he describes a standing before a “huge sea of mist”:<note place="foot" resp="author"> Wordsworth,<hi rend="italic">The Prelude, </hi>bk 13 line

                    Rohrbach identifies mist as “central…to [Wordsworth’s] poetic self-reflection”
                    (3) in the Snowdon passage. Her theorization of an “anticipatory” temporality in
                    Romanticism locates in the concept of mist “epistemological uncertainty” and
                    Keatsian negative capability similar to that which I am attaching to the concept
                    of unquiet noise. Rohrbach, <hi rend="italic">Modernity’s Mist: British

            The chasm’s visual void contrasts with the flash of light at the beginning of the
                passage, but it is filled with sound which in a way draws Wordsworth by the ear back
                into the mist out of which, as Emily Rohrbach reminds us, he had emerged into the
                light. A simplified reading might find a metaphorical refutation of enlightenment as
                a paradigmatically visual concept; not in the visual vista, but in the
                indistinguishably mingled, endlessly radiating vibrations of the water’s sound does
                Wordsworth locate “The soul, the imagination of the whole.” At the very least,
                Wordsworth’s shift from viewer to listener is generatively humbling. In his
                description of the waters’ mingled “voice,” the verse gives way to chaotically sonic
                language, evoking the uncommunicable quality of the sound’s ‘roaring’ power. And
                yet, for all its sublimity, the volume of the sound is ambiguous. It fills the air
                and verse once noticed, but before then the passage feels utterly silent. Whether
                the noise of the real torrents Wordsworth heard was actually loud seems irrelevant;
                in the poem, it is powerfully unquiet. </p>
               <p>Wordsworth reflects on the lingering impression of the scene atop Snowdon in one his
                most forceful statements of imaginative power. As he remains on the “lonely
                    mountain,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., bk 13, line 67</note>
                deprived of sight by night, he meditates on the ability to “build up greatest things
                / From least suggestion”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., bk 13,
                    lines 98-99.</note> in those with such power of mind that

            Some of nature’s sublime sounds, Wordsworth asserts, “even the grossest minds must
                see and hear, / And cannot chuse but feel,”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Ibid., bk 13, lines 85-86.</note> but to find resonance in less imposing ones
                requires the creative power of a poetic mind which listens for them but also abides
                with some of their uncertainty. </p>
               <p>To a certain extent, Percy Shelley’s address to another mountain at the close of
                “Mont Blanc” recalls Wordsworth’s contemplation of the “perfect image of a mighty
                    mind”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., bk 13, line 69.</note> in
                the wake of his encounter with the torrents’ sonic sublimity made quiet by distance.
                Sound in “Mont Blanc” is emphatically material.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Critics have frequently contemplated how “Mont Blanc” embodies in
                    aurally evocative verse the experience that inspired it. As Susan Wolfson puts
                    it, “Shelley takes [Wordsworth’s scene in ‘The Solitary Reaper’] of boundless
                    audition to the Alps, and replays it with a sense of poetry aspiring, not to
                    tame, but to run wild with antiphony and metrical disorder.” See Wolfson,
                    “Sounding Romantic: The Sound of Sound,”32. In William Keach’s oft-recalled
                    reading, “Rhyme in <hi rend="italic">Mont Blanc</hi> is one important way in
                    which Shelley’s verbal imagination structures and shapes, without giving a
                    closed or determinate pattern to, an experience which defies structuring and
                    shaping.” William Keach, <hi rend="italic">Shelley’s Style</hi> (New York:
                    Methuen, 1984), 196. </note>Shelley insists not only on the ‘ceaselessness’ of
                the noise, but also on the way in which it travels through its environment. In his
                multisensorial evocation of the ravine, he conceives of a physical and metaphysical
                acoustics which later underlies the thick silence of the poem’s close. Within such
                an acoustics is layered not only the noise of such a powerfully loud place, but the
                image of human thoughts traveling outward as well:

            Shelley’s poetic attention to his imagined brook’s “sound but half its own” as a
                material correlative to “human thought” emphasizes how its noise is not cancelled
                out, but made resonant with louder sounds. I understand such a co-amplification to
                follow from Anne McCarthy’s reading of “a sublime aesthetics of contingency in “Mont
                Blanc” that does not seek to escape the discontinuities and confusions of the
                material world through an identification with infinite reason.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Anne C. McCarthy, “The Aesthetics of Contingency in the

                    355-375, 358.</note> “Shelley,” McCarthy argues, “renders a sublime that
                consists in the power to suspend the distinction between the dominant and the
                    dominated.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid.</note> And so,
                confronted with the loud sublimity of the Ravine of Arve, the poetic imagination and
                its “legion of wild thoughts”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Shelley,
                    “Mont Blanc,” line 41.</note> which Shelley projects as though physically
                floating through the air neither quiets nor is completely quieted by the thunderous
                sounds that have materially moved him. </p>
               <p>Like Wordsworth’s lingering contemplation of the “roar of waters” heard at a distance
                from atop Mount Snowdon, the resonance of the mountain’s noisy vibrations in a mind
                that strives, listening ‘on the edge meaning,’ fills the silence of “Mont Blanc’s”
                close. In the last stanza of the poem, the speaker zooms out, and the sensorial
                chaos of the poem dwindles. The close of the poem reaches a contemplative quiet
                which is nonetheless ‘unquiet’ in an address to the mountaintop’s serene aspect:

           The human mind and the power of nature are less tumultuously intertwined here than in
                the earlier stanzas, acknowledging the literal distance between body and mountain,
                so that the mind’s “unremitting interchange / With the clear universe of things
                    around”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., lines 39-40.</note>
                might seem to have been cut off by the shift away from the sensorially immersive
                sublimity Shelley had previously evoked. And yet, the sound of the lines, a softly
                winding dominance of sibilants mimicking the whistling winds we would expect to hear
                at Mont Blanc’s heights, achieves an effect that is calmed but still unquiet. “Mont
                Blanc,” like the other examples I have considered, contemplates a tension between
                what we can hear, what we cannot, and how an imagination attuned to noise fills the
                space of what only seems like silence, without overpowering the auditory body’s
                sense of situatedness within it. </p>
               <p>I would like to close with a brief reflection on our own ‘unquiet’ moment. I happened
                to finish drafting this essay during the world’s most hushed period in recent
                history, as lockdown measures responding to the novel coronavirus pandemic slowed
                the industrial and social activities that normally constitute the racket of
                humanity. Apart from the frequent, piercing sound of sirens, Brooklyn, NY was eerily
                quiet—to the point that it ‘vexed meditation,’ to borrow from Coleridge. But in late
                spring, 2020, public attention began to attend to certain unquiet sounds in a
                proliferation of news about how some things had become unusually audible amidst the
                ‘extreme silentness.’ One <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> piece offered an
                audio guide highlighting birdsong that would normally be out of earshot: “The birds
                have always been here,” the guide observed; “This spring, we can hear them.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Antonio de Luca, Dave Taft, and Umi Syam,

                Such encouragement to take advantage of a restored hi-fi soundscape seemed
                desperately grateful for the smallest glimmers of beauty we could find in our
                defamiliarized local atmospheres. But more than that, it was implicitly
                introspective and forward-looking. It seemed to suggest not only that attuning to
                small sounds might offer some psychological respite, but as well that this was an
                opportunity for us to reintroduce ourselves our ambient soundscape and to consider
                afresh how our noise impacts the environment. In late July, scientists reported that
                seismic reverberation of “anthropogenic noise” had diminished to such a degree that
                we are in “the longest and most coherent global seismic noise reduction in recorded
                    history.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Thomas Lecocq et al., “Global
                    Quieting of High-Frequency Seismic Noise Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown

                been able to detect previous drowned-out signals, gathering information could have a

                and to volcanic activity.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid.</note> This
                newly invigorated attention to sonic activity is a divergence from typical recent

                how a low hum pervading an Arizona man’s suburban home and its vicinity had slowly
                come to his attention and eventually agonized him to such an extent that he felt
                subject to (in his terms) "an acoustic attack."<note place="foot" resp="author"> Bianca Bosker, “Why Everything Is Getting Louder,” <hi rend="italic">The
                        Atlantic</hi>, November 2019 Issue.</note> The essay alternates between
                accounting for the rising din of late capitalist noise pollution and contemplating
                the psychology behind habits of aural fixation. The noise turned out to be the sound
                of chiller units maintaining data center equipment, droning at a frequency that
                happens to be especially irritating to human ears but which nonetheless is projected
                at decibels low enough that activists had a difficult time fighting for
                intervention. Though it possibly supported any number of creatively generative
                endeavors online, the hum drove many of the people living nearby out of their minds
                with distraction. Bosker’s piece was of course published online, its print title
                offering a dramatic assessment of the environmental fate it thus did its small part
                to ensure: “The End of Silence.” </p>
               <p>An “end of silence” is precisely what I would argue Romantic writers knew had always
                already come to pass. Stretching the boundaries of their contemporary aesthetic
                categories, Romantic literary representations of listening present noise as an
                underpinning of phenomenological experience and audition as an essential (sometimes
                involuntary) activity through which human subjects enter into self-reflexive
                reciprocity with elements of their social and natural worlds. This, they show us,
                offers both sensorial and creative richness, but it comes with inherent
                vulnerabilities as well. The Romantics could not have imagined the particular
                noisiness of the world we live in now, but they did presciently consider the
                significance of sound’s constant vibrational presence and how faint unquiet noises
                lie undetected until we notice them. Now, in our own tumultuous moment, we too are
                finding new ways of listening, “on the edge of meaning,” perhaps, ourselves.</p>

               <p> The terrifying mystery in Ann Radcliffe’s second novel, <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian
                   Romance</hi> (1790), is a sound. <note place="foot" resp="author"> This research was supported by the Social Sciences and

                    so perceptively.</note> Julia Mazzini hears a distinct knock coming through the
                wall of a supposedly vacant part of Castle Mazzini, and spends the novel trying to
                understand how something like that could arise with no one to produce it. The knock,
                predecessor to terrifying sounds encountered in later texts by Thomas de Quincey and
                Charlotte Brontë, seems to be what psychoanalysts would call an “object voice,” a
                sound “fully unfastened from phonemization,” which marks a void in the castle
                architecture through its menacing excess to signification.<note place="end"> Slavoj Žižek, “‘I Hear You with My Eyes’; or, the Invisible

               </p>
               <p>To the extent that the sound in this novel asks for anything, it asks to be seen. Julia and her comrades, in concerted acts of
                synesthesia, frequently look around for sounds and listen for sights. The characters
                constantly attempt to keep a lookout for the sound: “For the remainder of this night
                they resolved to watch.” <note place="foot" resp="author"> Ann Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian Romance</hi>, ed. Alison Milbank (Oxford: Oxford
                    University Press, 2008), 35.</note> The mystery of the knock (as buttressed by
                other associated sounds, like footsteps or a groan) first manifests as a visual
                sign, a light in the tower seen and then “seen no more,” with all of the narrator’s
                emphasis placed on “what she [in this case, Madame de Menon] had seen.”<note place="end" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 8.</note> Radcliffe consistently presents sound as an excessive
                    aspect of vision, and visuality as something lacking in sound, and thus
                repeatedly encourages the reader to contemplate the relationship between sound
                and vision, just as David Bowie recommends. Julia’s brother Ferdinand, the narrator
                assures us, “ had himself witnessed the sounds.” <note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe,
                        49.</note> Certainly, it is possible to
                    witness something auditorily, but the term, in 1790 as now, especially pertains
                    to visual phenomena.<note place="foot" resp="author"> “Witness, v.,” in <hi rend="italic">OED Online</hi>

                        http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/229714. The <hi rend="italic">OED </hi>moves
                        between acts of seeing and hearing in its relevant entry for “witness, v.,”
                        but with especial emphasis on the former: To be a witness, spectator, or auditor
                            of (something of interest, importance, or special concern); to
                            experience by personal (esp. ocular) observation; to be present as an
                            observer at; to see with one’s own eyes. In early use said mainly of the
                            eyes or the ears. (In loose writing often used merely as a synonym of
                            ‘see’.) </note>
               </p>
               <p> Inspired by this strange synesthesia, this essay will
                resort to theories of the gaze in an attempt to think through the novel’s
                frightening maternal sound. First, I consider Michel Foucault’s comments in “The Eye
                of Power,” an interview in which he considers the ways that Radcliffe’s castle
                spaces seek illumination, to better herald the arrival of a gaze exercised
                pervasively. I suggest that sound in <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian Romance</hi>
                complicates that model, given how, on the one hand, both the ruins of the castle (in
                the narrative frame) and the castle itself (in the main narrative) remain inundated
                by sounds and silences that interfere with the operation of power, and how, on the
                other hand, the sound through the wall tends to disperse and diffuse the patriarchal
                authority of Castle Mazzini with a maternal counterpoint. Second, I connect this

                    <hi rend="italic">The Four Fundamental Concepts of
                    Psychoanalysis</hi>: as Lacan engages with and attempts to challenge Jean-Paul
                Sartre’s theory of the gaze, he notes that the gaze has to do with sound rather than
                sight directly. This sonic facet of the gaze will help us understand the role sound
                plays in Julia’s protestations of love for Hippolitus. Third, I consider Sigmund
                Freud’s discussion of alarm clock dreams in <hi rend="italic">The Interpretation of
                    Dreams</hi>, in which he contemplates how the same stimulus, and the same
                dreamer, can produce a diversity of dream images. Freud’s consideration of F. W.
                Hildebrandt’s alarm clock dreams complicates any attempt to understand the “meaning”
                of the knocking sound in Radcliffe’s novel or confine it to its seemingly obvious
                Oedipal resonances. Sending sound beyond any patent relation to signification, the
                bells of Castle Mazzini, like the knocks that emanate from within, position Julia as
                their true agent, as if the plot were bent on undoing her subjectivity rather than,
                as it may at first appear, asserting her right to make her own sexual decisions.</p>
               <p>In thinking about sound through epistemologies of vision, Radcliffe could respond to
                contemporary debates about gender, class, and privilege. It has often been noted
                that vision was increasingly presumed, over the eighteenth century, to be the basis
                of all knowledge and the instrument of subjectivity.<note place="foot" resp="author"> David Levin, <hi rend="italic">The Opening of Vision:

                yet existing criticism on Radcliffe has seldom considered sight and sound at once.
                Milbank finds sight and sound to be dichotomous in Radcliffe’s early fiction, with

                    Romance</hi> crosses and co-implicates vision and sound, pinning each as an
                impossible point within the other field, the relatively tidy taxonomies established
                by Milbank, Noske, and Archambault tend to break down. I am interested in exploring

                  <p>“Enchanting sounds!,” Hippolitus says, when he is told by Ferdinand that Julia
                secretly loves him: “I could listen till I forgot I had a wish beyond them.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>,
                    50–51.</note> Sounds, in this formulation, serve to obliterate one’s desire,
                even while one’s ability to listen is understood to be an effect of that desire.
                This arrangement may seem to facilitate an Oedipal plot, for which one would have to
                learn to forget one’s own wishes. Yet the visual structure of supervision in this
                scene expands that paradigm by constructing a whole series of triangulated relations
                around the “enchanting sounds” to give them multiple and competing points of
                reference. Hippolitus asks Ferdinand for some proof of Julia’s love, leading
                Ferdinand to report that he “saw her ineffectual struggles to conceal” her
                    feelings.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 51.</note> In this
                model, the “enchanting sounds” of Ferdinand’s report are guaranteed by Julia’s
                feelings, which, although they cannot themselves be seen, become apparent in the
                attempt to camouflage what is already invisible. Julia has gone into hiding,
                Ferdinand says, not wanting to be seen in such a lovelorn state. She is invisible
                but audible: “I have often heard her singing in some lonely spot,” Ferdinand says to
                Hippolitus, noting that “your return produced a visible and instantaneous
                alteration” in her voice.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe,
                    51.</note> In sum, Ferdinand reports having watched Julia not being seen by
                hearing her singing, which has made a spectacle of her invisible feelings. Although
                she is hidden from view—even he does not seem to know where she is, as to him it is
                merely “some lonely spot” or another—he could plainly see the change in her song
                once Hippolitus returned.</p>
                  <p>This explanation raises a series of questions that are important throughout the
                novel: how is it possible to locate something “visible” in a voice emanating from a
                hidden place? And in what sense would the voyeur’s report of that discovery
                constitute a “sound,” per se, rather than mere information? It is as if the
                jouissance of Julia’s attachment to Hippolitus, something in excess of any possible
                sexual relationship between them, crosses narrative levels. It first conveys itself
                into a song about her love, which renders the love visible to auditors. It next
                becomes the excessive part of Ferdinand’s report of that song. The excess jouissance
                then gets transmitted back to Hippolitus, its original inspiration, in what he takes
                for simply “sounds.” Finally, it gets subsumed within the novel’s narrativizing
                structures, through which it gets ultimately and indirectly reported to the frame
                narrator and reader. It is as if anything attached to Julia’s desire overspills the
                capacity in language for communication, such that even reports of her desire
                necessarily carry with them this excessive quality, turning information into sound.
                Throughout the novel, Julia tends to convert incidental sounds (such as the rowing
                of oars in the water nearby the castle) into songs (or what she calls “hymns”), so
                as to produce “holy enthusiasm” and a stolen “sigh of exstacy.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 58.</note> This is perhaps part of her general
                tendency—also a tendency of Radcliffe’s—to “transform the utilitarian into the
                    aesthetic.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Adam Miller, “Ann
                    Radcliffe’s Scientific Romance,” <hi rend="italic">Eighteenth-Century

                    38/ecf.28.3.527.</note> The central question for the other characters then
                becomes: how can one look at this play of sound? Which is also to ask: how can we
                see someone hide from view, except insofar as they do so “ineffectually,” and thus
                    <hi rend="italic">not </hi>hide from view? Ferdinand’s method is to watch by
                listening.</p>
                  <p>Ferdinand’s report of sonic voyeurism folds back on itself because, all the while,
                Julia is eavesdropping from a closet near the gallery, that quintessential parlor of
                Romantic visuality. She crouches there, where she cannot be seen, because she is
                afraid of being overheard: “She hardly dared to breathe, much less to move, . . .
                lest the sound of her step should betray her.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 50.</note> Fearful of being
                seen, she “moved softly,” but “the sound of her step alarmed the count.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 51.</note> Hearing the gentle
                footsteps, Hippolitus bursts into the closet to discover her; mortified, she “hid
                her face in her robe.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe,
                    51.</note> Ostrich-like, Julia signals her refusal to gaze rather than be seen:
                she is content to be looked at but not, any longer, to inhabit a hidden point of
                auditory oversight. Hippolitus responds with “expressive silence,” an oxymoronic
                state that suffices until he can “[recover] . . . his voice.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 51.</note> Throughout this complicated and
                multi-layered tableau, sight cannot be disentangled from sound, and nor is either,
                as Milbank holds, particularly the domain of patriarchal tyrants.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Milbank, “Ways of Seeing,” 89.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Julia, like her brother, is hiding so as not to be heard and is ashamed when her
                footsteps are seen. To borrow from Slavoj Žižek, we might say that:
                
            <quote>voice does not simply persist at a different level with regard to what we see, it
                rather points toward a gap in the field of the visible, toward the dimension of what
                eludes our gaze. In other words, their relationship is mediated by an impossibility:
                    <hi rend="italic">ultimately, we hear things because we cannot see
                    everything</hi>.<note place="foot"> Žižek, “I Hear You,”
                    93.</note>
                     </quote>
                
            Voice, with its capacity to present the disquieting excess found in lack, thus
                becomes a marker of the impossible. These effects, most importantly, continue to
                cross levels of narration: Julia is twice hidden from view here, first in “some
                lonely spot” and then in the gallery, where she overhears the tale of her own
                hiddenness; her body, hidden from tales of its own hiddenness, seems to emit sounds,
                constantly at both levels, which render her visible. Here, as in Yael Shapira’s
                analysis of <hi rend="italic">The Italian</hi>, “the ideology of the polite body and
                the challenges it presents to women are woven into the very fabric of [Radcliffe’s]
                    writing.”<note place="foot"> Yael Shapira, “Where the
                    Bodies Are Hidden: Ann Radcliffe’s ‘Delicate’ Gothic,” <hi rend="italic">Eighteenth Century Fiction</hi> 18, no. 4 (September 28, 2006): 454,
                    https://doi.org/10.1353/ecf.2006.0068.</note> There is something in these
                sounds, occurring simultaneously across the two levels of narration, that speaks to
                Julia’s presence and yet seems far in excess of her status as a subject. The
                mysterious capacities of sound, always disclosing more than Julia intends,
                repeatedly interfere with her ability to remain hidden. Yet, it is Julia’s
                continuing visibility, as she buries herself in her cloak in response to being
                unhidden, that silences the man who has seen her.</p>
                  <p>Such synesthetic situations characterize the first half of the novel. Julia, for
                instance, spends a lot of time looking for sound, as when “their steps ran in
                whispering echoes through the gallery, and often did Julia cast a fearful glance
                    around.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 40.</note> When Ferdinand sees stairs, he oddly listens to
                them: “whence rose a winding stair-case, which led up to the south tower of the
                castle. Ferdinand paused to listen.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Radcliffe, 40.</note> Ferdinand, shortly after, finds that sound and vision work
                at cross-purposes but simultaneously: “A faint sound
                died away along the passage, the windings of which prevented his seeing the figure
                he pursued.”<note place="foot"> Radcliffe, 45.</note> The
                prepositional phrase “of which” retains a certain ambiguity here, as its syntax
                could pertain equally to the passage or the sound; because of this ambiguity, the
                passage inadvertently suggests that the windings of a sound are preventing Ferdinand
                from seeing. Yet, although we are told that the sound “died away” as the sightline
                vanishes, these are not presented as parallel effects—it’s not, for instance, <hi rend="italic">the shape of the passage blocked both the sightline and
                sound</hi>—but as independent experiences each ending in sensory failure. When sight
                and sound are presented in parallel, the link between them is defined (as in the
                previous passage) by lack, absence, and exceptionality: “<hi rend="italic">Nothing
                    met the eye</hi> but beauty and romantic splendor;<hi rend="italic"> the ear
                    received no sounds</hi> but those of mirth and melody,” the narrator says of a
                Mazzini family festival, as if an overabundance of joyful sounds and sights would
                best be represented through figures of lack failing.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 18.</note> Even when sight and sound are
                presented in parallel, and kept separate by, for instance, a semicolon, the subjects
                of these clauses—i.e., “nothing” and “the ear”—are unexpectedly not parallel. It is
                as if the ear is the equivalent instrument to the nothing that meets the eye. Is
                this not also what Hippolitus discovers in the gallery closet? These are the

                  <p>This “nothing” discovered at the juncture of sight and sound radically complicates
                any attempt to theorize the novel’s visual field. I am thinking especially of Michel
                Foucault’s commentary on Radcliffe, which remains influential within studies of the
                Gothic. Foucault characterizes the latter half of the eighteenth century as a
                campaign against dark spaces; “the new political and moral order could not be
                established until those places were eradicated.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Michel Foucault, Jean-Pierre Barou, and Michelle Perrot, “The Eye of

                landscapes of Ann Radcliffe’s novels are composed of . . . imaginary spaces [that]
                are like the negative of the transparency and visibility which it is aimed to

                  <p> The novel does explore the relationship between panopticism and authority, for
                instance when the evil Marquis tries to assure his retinue that the tower is “not
                haunted” by swearing that “you shall see the whole of these buildings,” or when it
                insists that Julia and Emilia “had never passed the boundaries of their father’s
                    domains.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 79, 6.</note> Radcliffe sometimes plays with multiple and
                divergent meanings of Foucauldian words like “observe,” as in the sentence: “She

                Yet, as David Collings rightly notes, “the Gothic makes possible a direct refutation

                metafictional passage, Madame de Menon advises Julia and her sister Emilia that we
                believe in ghosts because we believe in God—which means that if ghosts do sometimes
                appear, it’s because God has authorized it: “be assured that there are no beings who
                act unseen by him.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 36.</note> This would seem to be a
                quintessential example of Radcliffe’s enthusiasm for panoptic regimes. Yet the

                sounds disturbed them for that time.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Radcliffe, 36.</note> The implication is that God sees everything because we
                hear nothing. But Ferdinand reverses that logic in the next paragraph, when he
                suggests that the absence of sound must mean that we cannot be seen! “He very
                readily consented to watch with his sisters in Julia’s apartment; . . . there would
                be some difficulty in passing unobserved to her’s [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. It

                  <p>In a similar vein, the novel opens with our frame narrator seeing voices, a device
                which quickly gets embedded into the general fiction through which the story of <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian Romance </hi>is told. In the narrative frame, the ruins
                of the castle are specifically something “to be seen.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 1.</note> Yet the frame narrator insists that he
                or she hears it: they fantasize about bygone times
                
            <quote>when the halls . . . resounded
                    with the voices of those whom death had long since swept from the earth. ‘Thus,’
                    said I, ‘shall the present generation—he who now sinks in misery—and he who now
                    swims in pleasure, alike pass away and be forgotten.’ My heart swelled with the
                    reflection; and, as I turned from the scene with a sigh, I fixed my eyes upon a
                    friar, whose venerable figure, gently bending towards the earth, formed no
                    uninteresting object in the picture.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 1.</note>
                     </quote>
                
            This is an intensely ironic passage, and not only because the narrator describes
                imagined “voices” as a “picture” capable of “reflection.” The frame narrator,
                hearing a visual spectacle, concludes that previous generations will be forgotten,
                despite seeming to hear “voices” that would testify to exactly the opposite. In
                another twist, the voices are not “real” but a mental extrapolation from the visual
                scene. The entire story to follow would lead someone to precisely the opposite
                conclusion: the previous generation may be repressed, but only incompletely; one’s
                ancestors remain very much present and audible, even if out of view for a long time.
                Immediately the frame narrator gets caught between written and oral histories, as
                the friar tries to convince the frame narrator that further information is to be
                acquired in a manuscript “of which I could, perhaps, procure you a sight.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 1.</note> Yet the friar
                introduces the frame narrator to his boss, the abate, who for unknown reasons
                recounts the history of the castle to our frame narrator orally. From there, it gets
                assembled into “abstracts” for the reader’s view, which give body to the “voices”
                that had been initially imagined.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                the “phonemanography of response to the silent babel of text,” according to which
                “voice is no sooner subsumed to the formal genres of print poetics than it

                history.</p>
                  <p> Although, throughout the novel and its narrative structure, voice refuses to be
                subsumed into visual ways of knowing and, by extension, print media, a moment in the
                main narrative turns this structure on its head. In a reversal of what will befall
                the frame narrator, Julia and Madame de Menon find that they are seen as they look
                upon the same ruined castle, and find themselves explaining their history to the
                abate’s predecessor. They, too, find that voices—this time of Julia’s father’s
                spies—interfere with their visual experience of the space: “As Julia gave a last
                look to the scene, she perceived two men leaning upon a part of the ruin at some
                distance, in earnest conversation. As they spoke, their looks were so attentively
                bent on her.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 126.</note> She watches the people who are watching her look
                at the scene. Yet how does one “look” at a conversation, especially one in which she
                finds herself the object of the discussants’ own looks? This is what Nina Sun
                Eidsheim would call a “sonic reduction”: that is, the use of figural language to
                place a sound, in all of its unlimited multidimensionality, within a meaningful
                    register.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Nina Sun Eidsheim, <hi rend="italic">Sensing Sound: Singing and Listening as Vibrational

                Eidsheim argues, bears haptic, tactile dimensions, and even visual and olfactory
                ones, so our tendency to treat it only auditorily amounts to a sustained, collective
                act of figuration. Radcliffe, though, is experimenting here with a different sort of
                sonic reduction, one that uses visual tropes to report on sound, and works through
                negation and interruption: rightly fearful, the two women “walked swiftly through
                the woods, … [and] were surprized to observe the distance to which they had strayed
                from the monastery, whose dark towers were now obscurely seen rising among the trees
                that closed the perspective.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe,
                        <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 126.</note> Seeing towers that, we are
                assured, could not be seen from their vantage, they “observed” their <hi rend="italic">distance</hi> from the towers rather than the towers directly. Yet
                they report having seen, however “obscurely,” something that was “closed” from their
                perspective. They see the men pursuing them but conclude, strangely, that it does
                not look like a pursuit: “On looking back, they perceived the same men slowly
                advancing, without any appearance of pursuit, but clearly as if observing the place
                of their retreat.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 126.</note>
                Once again, Julia is looked at from within a space that cannot be seen and is caught
                looking at other people’s voices. Lack becomes the extimate point that governs the
                visual scene as it gets, here and there, converted into sonic reduction.</p>

                  <head>2. The Sound of the Gaze Beyond Sartre’s Keyhole</head>
                  <p>Excerpts like these lead us to reexamine Foucault’s panopticon thesis. Certainly, as
                Foucault suggests, this is a novel filled with secret passageways and dark forests
                that could be improved through better lighting. But the anchor of the visual
                field—indeed, across the novel, a substantial number of different visual
                fields—seems to be a spot that cannot be synthesized into it, from which Julia,
                Ferdinand, or the frame narrator can gaze. They frequently see things that are
                specifically closed to her view—not by opening new avenues for sight, but precisely
                by remaining in the place where visibility fails. Voice and sound seem to be the
                mechanisms by which this impossible point can be sutured within the visual field—it
                is as if the entire visual field is constructed around the excessive lack in the
                object voice. Because of this, we will need to seek a theoretical model better
                equipped to think about the holes in the scene that cannot be seen. Although the
                novel arguably displays a desire for total and full illumination and disclosure, it
                positions its viewers somewhere that cannot be synthesized into that panoptic
                fantasy. They can only “radically disidentify” with their environs and foster
                “uncommon, illiberal sensibilities” expressed through silence.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Chuh, <hi rend="italic">The Difference</hi>, xii.</note>
                Sound (including silence) is the cut in this visual field that, to everyone’s shame
                and horror, authorizes subjectivity only as “a rupture at the core of
                    self-presence.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dolar, <hi rend="italic">A Voice</hi>, 42.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, it is significant that the secret passageways of Castle Mazzini are
                investigated auditorily—which is far from saying that the experience is not visual.
                For instance:
                
            <quote>Ferdinand carefully sounded the wall which communicated
                    with the southern buildings. From one part of it a sound was returned, which
                    convinced him there was something less solid than stone. He removed the tapestry, and behind it appeared, to his inexpressible
                    satisfaction, a small door.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>,
                    39.</note>
                     </quote>
                
            This passage suggests a satisfying reciprocity of sound:
                    one discovers the secrets of Castle Mazzini by hearing one’s own sound
                    “returned” by the castle itself: it is as if Ferdinand’s desire is the desire of
                    the Other, and so only through the “returned” sound can Ferdinand recognize
                    himself and feel “satisfaction.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lacan, <hi rend="italic">Seminar
                        XI</hi>, 235.</note> Hence “sounding” is both
                    the name of Ferdinand’s action and the object of that action. Lifting the
                    tapestry, he confirms by sight the thing that he has heard. His satisfaction in
                    the discovery, though, remains “inexpressible”: it is the part that cannot be
                    articulated or mapped even at the point of the door’s discovery. What had seemed
                    to be a satisfyingly reciprocal call from the other side soon becomes excessive
                    and autonomous: as Ferdinand “stood gazing on the door, and inwardly lamenting,
                    . . . a low hollow sound was heard from beneath. Emilia and Julia seized his
                    arm; and almost sinking with apprehension, listened in profound silence. A
                    footstep was distinctly heard.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 39.</note> Here again,
                    Ferdinand finds himself looking at a sound, and “uncertain sounds of strange and
                    fearful import” to boot.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 46.</note> The
                    sounds are a figure of lack (associated with something “hollow” situated
                    “beneath,” and promoting silence); yet it is the lack of that lack that causes
                    the most anxiety of all: “though the night passed without further disturbance,
                    their fears were very little abated.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 39.</note> Ferdinand begins to fear the sound of his own footsteps,
                    as if the haunting supernatural sound were actually a figure for the mysterious
                    invisible excess in the investigating party.
                    Coleridge would be amazed at the sublime indeterminacy in sound, but Radcliffe
                    finds that even concrete sounds point to an excessive, inassimilable lack in the
                    auditor. Julia and Emilia endure Ferdinand’s efforts to open the secret door “in
                    fearful silence, but no sound disturbed the stillness of night”; they bravely
                    “followed in silence” once the door is pried open, presenting this new silence
                    as the interruption of the previous silence, which had been caused by a dread of
                    more silence.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 40.</note> Silence is a
                    condition of the house and is not in any way separate from or opposite to
                    groans, which are characterized repeatedly by their hollowness.</p>
                  <p>Ed Pluth and Cindy Zeiher have called attention to Lacan’s early theorization of
                silences that are “not empty.” They point us toward Lacan’s little-known commentary
                on the 1929 murders committed by Christine and Lea Papin, commentary which came
                three years prior to his first iteration of the mirror stage. Pluth and Zeiher adopt
                this early Lacan text as a way to think about imaginary relations through sound and
                silence, rather than, as we might normally expect from Lacan, through sight and
                    mirroring.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ed Pluth and Cindy Zeiher,

                “meaningful” nor, as Lacan stresses, “empty”; rather, their violent act—killing
                their employers by gauging out their eyes before bludgeoning and stabbing them to
                death, and then retiring to bed together—was a way of interrupting a structural,
                enforced silence that had pervaded their workplace, the victims’ home. As Pluth and
                Zeiher indicate, this spectacular violence was an act of self-punishment at the
                level of the imaginary, as the sisters, being their victims’ domestic maids, had
                come to feel like doubles of their employers within the house. By gauging out their
                employers’ eyes and then remaining silent in court and to the press, the Papin
                sisters attacked the very mechanism through which the identification had happened,
                offering their own silence as a cut in what had been a visual circuit.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Pluth and Zeiher, 27–28.</note> Radcliffe’s silences, I will suggest, are similarly “not
                    empty,” and constitute attempts to sever manifold structural crises fundamental
                    to the patriarchy.</p>
                  <p>As with the case of the Papin sisters, narrative meaning in
                   <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian Romance </hi> is cut by interruptions (both of silence and of sound)
                    that, though mysterious, are not empty, and that indicate the oppressive
                    patriarchal structure governing Castle Mazzini. Madame de Menon, for
                instance, in first telling Julia about her mother, fuses surveillance and sound in
                telling Julia that Louisa “would steal to her harpsichord” “when she thought herself
                    unobserved.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 30.</note> Yet her tale of maternal
                musicianship is “interrupted” by “the horn . . . [that] sounded the signal for dinner”—a
                semi-musical sound that interrupts, as with a Lacanian short session, a tale of
                amateur musicianship.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 31.</note>
                We have, then, a tale of sound interrupting the silence that was interrupted by
                another sound. What interests me is that there is no formal reason for the novel to
                include this horn; it doesn’t delay the exposition by any more than four sentences.
                Madame and Julia simply have dinner and then go right back to the story within in
                the same paragraph, like nothing had happened. The reader is left with a bizarre
                narrative interruption, bizarre because it doesn’t actually interrupt anything. The
                interruption, rather, is registered at the level of narrative but felt at the level
                of the story, as the sound makes conspicuous its own construction <hi rend="italic">après coup</hi>. The narrator’s emphasis in telling us the story of Julia being
                told a story is on Julia’s hearing<hi rend="italic"/>of it, not the content, as
                if the story of the mother were itself an aural interruption into Julia’s own
                routine of playing the lute.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe,
                    34.</note> That is, one’s mother’s harpsichord “interrupts” her own routine of
                musicianship: Julia is not like Louisa in the sense that both play musical
                instruments in defiance of patriarchal supervision, but rather they are linked by
                the way that this bond actually severs that relation. We have found, here, a way to
                traverse “the strange loop, the tie between inner and outer, the short circuit
                between the external contingency and the intimate, the curious match of the click
                [or in this case, musical sound, which has become a hollow knock] and the inner
                sexual arousal.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dolar, <hi rend="italic">A
                        Voice</hi>, 132.</note> The situation thus finds a new iteration immediately
                to follow, when “madame, who was then speaking, was
                    interrupted by a low hollow sound, which arose from beneath the apartment, and
                    seemed like the closing of a door.” <note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 35.</note> The story is
                    now interrupted, not by the horns of official castle timekeeping, but by the
                    subject of the story itself, as if the story’s content had managed to interrupt
                    its own narration, to ask for help in being discovered. The novel’s main plot is
                    thus made possible by the interruption of its backstory. Only through this interruption can Julia be reunited with
                    her mother, whose voice, Dolar reminds us, is often “the first problematic
                connection to the other, the immaterial tie that comes to replace the umbilical
                    cord.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dolar, <hi rend="italic">A
                        Voice</hi>, 39.</note> That voice is actually quite like a narrative
                umbilical cord, in the sense that Julia only gains a mother once the story of that
                motherhood is cut.</p>
                  <p>These sounds are disruptive in their absence as much as in
                    their presence. Radcliffe, writes Anna Shajirat, chronicles the
                “irrevocable disruption” stemming from the “mundane realities” of
                eighteenth-century women’s lives, and thereby theorizes “the trauma of the ordinary
                for women.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Anna Shajirat, “‘Bending Her

                organized around the “double horror” of “an unimaginable void at the center of a
                void,” according to which the patriarchal legal frameworks and unchecked domestic
                violence prove, in the end, more horrifying than any ghost.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Shajirat, 385–87.</note> If read in this way, Castle
                Mazzini, for all of its musical performances and unaccountable footsteps, seems
                largely defined by the absence of sound: “a melancholy stillness reigned through the
                halls, and the silence of the courts . . . was for many hours together
                    undisturbed.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 5.</note> Silence reigns at Castle Mazzini
                because the silence is structural rather than incidental; the silence is then
                interrupted by tales of silence, which are interrupted by further routinized
                silences. This is perhaps why, as Madame de Manon implies, the ghosts are an effect
                of silence and an aspect of the master’s gaze, and why the Real becomes, as Lacan
                warns, in Julia “to a very great degree the accomplice of the drive.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lacan, <hi rend="italic">Seminar XI</hi>,

                was an “attempt to trace the philosophical precursors of Lacan’s theory of the gaze”
                in the Romantic period, all while heeding the warning that “Lacan’s theory of the
                gaze suffers under a certain degree of compartmentalization and manipulation” when
                adapted for literary analysis.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Langbehn,
                    “The Lacanian Gaze,” 613.</note> Very much unlike Foucault, Lacan rigorously
                distinguishes between the look and the gaze: one looks at things, but is beheld by
                the gaze, and the relation between these levels is vastly asymmetrical. The gaze
                happens, for instance, when Ferdinand and Julia, hiding in a cave worthy of Plato,
                detect shadows disappearing behind a rock: they feel themselves being seen from a
                point that they cannot see.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 150.</note> The gaze, in Lacan’s analysis, is
                not, then, merely the depersonalized exercise of supervisory power; it is a
                traumatic point in a visual field that cannot be incorporated or claimed but that
                cuts open the subject. Lacan developed his theory of the gaze as a rejoinder to
                Jean-Paul Sartre, who had discussed the gaze in <hi rend="italic">Being and
                    Nothingness</hi>. Explains Lacan:
            <quote>If you turn to Sartre’s own text, you will see that, far from speaking of the
                emergence of this gaze as of something that concerns the organ of sight, he refers
                to the sound of rustling leaves, suddenly heard while out hunting, to a footstep
                heard in a corridor. And when are these sounds heard? At the moment when he has
                presented himself in the action of looking through a keyhole. A gaze surprises him
                in the function of voyeur, disturbs him, overwhelms him and reduces him to a feeling
                of shame. The gaze in question is certainly the presence of others as such. But does
                this mean that originally it is in the relation of subject to subject, in the
                function of the existence of others as looking at me, that we apprehend what the
                gaze really is? <note place="foot" resp="author">Lacan, <hi rend="italic">Seminar XI</hi>, 84.</note>
                     </quote>
                
            The rhetorical question that Lacan finally poses, with its implied answer of an
                ambiguous “no,” has clear implications for <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian
                Romance</hi>. We have seen how, for Ferdinand, silence guarantees a certain
                invisibility, and how, further, a sound is “satisfying” to the extent that one’s
                “soundings” are returned proportionately by the Other. We have also seen that, for
                Louisa in the narrative of Madame de Menon, sound provides a cut in the structural
                conditions of Castle Mazzini. In each case, the gaze sustains desire; it is not a
                map of the symbolic space that the Marquis gets to monitor. Part of the operation of
                that gaze is how Julia’s desire gains its form through a sonic interruption, rather
                than being contained by her father’s supervisory apparatuses. The relation at work
                is not, as Lacan hints, “subject to subject,” but rather in the asymmetrical
                experience of finding oneself in the invisible hiding place of the Other, seeing
                oneself being seen from that impossible vantage.</p>
                  <p> As Lacan suggests, Sartre’s “own text” is indeed very interesting in this regard,
                for the insistent way that it crosses the registers of sound with sight. Sartre’s
                first test case for the gaze focuses on the voice, when: “this voice which I hear is
                that of a man and not a song on a phonograph.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Jean-Paul Sartre, <hi rend="italic">Being and Nothingness: An Essay on

                to another’s look, noting how “I,” with my enduring subjectivity, cannot so easily
                become a pure object like, say, the grass, because, as he explains, “‘Being
                seen-by-the-Other’ is the truth of ‘seeing-the-Other’” <note place="foot" resp="author"> Sartre, 257.</note>. Yet passersby, he argues, are
                thoroughly objects for “me.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Sartre,
                    252–53.</note> Faced with this incongruity, he proposes the thought experiment
                that would catch Lacan’s interest: “Let us imagine that moved by jealousy,
                curiosity, or vice I have just glued my ear to the door and looked through a
                    keyhole.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Sartre, 259.</note> It is
                important for our purposes to note that Sartre, here, presents voyeurism as
                something anatomically impossible: how can someone look through a keyhole with their
                ear to the door? Behind that door, argues Sartre—and I picture a small door hidden
                behind a tapestry, as in <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian Romance</hi>—“a spectacle is
                presented as ‘to be seen,’ a conversation as ‘to be heard’”; it is “a sight” and “a
                spectacle” given meaning by my jealousy.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Sartre, 259.</note> Sartre is very clear that eavesdropping is an aspect of the
                gaze. He imagines the scene, then, interrupted: “But all of a sudden I hear
                footsteps in the hall. Someone is looking at me! What does this mean?”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Sartre, 260.</note> In Sartre’s vignette,
                then, one hears oneself being looked at when one is looking and listening illicitly,
                and in the act of being thus interrupted one comes into being within a triangulated
                structure of relations mediated by the semi-permeable door. He begins to reckon with
                the shame of being seen at the keyhole.</p>
                  <p>Lacan emphasizes, with regard to the passage in Sartre, that the gaze is exercised
                through sound rather than sight. The gaze is never one’s own activity, and it is not
                as simple as one’s being-looked-at; rather, it is specifically the sound of one’s
                being looked at. This is, I would say, a capable interpretation of the passage from
                Sartre—an element of Sartre’s text that is present but not adequately factored into
                his thinking. When sound becomes an element of one’s perverse enjoyment, attesting
                to “the presence of others as such,” one experiences the gaze—which is always, it
                seems, a humiliating ordeal. The gaze is the experience of hearing oneself being
                watched while we are watching and listening. Lacan’s point is that the desiring
                subject is created, even sustained, through such triangulation.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lacan, <hi rend="italic">Seminar XI</hi>, 85.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> The knock resonating through Castle Mazzini is just such an event. It is a pure part
                object, causing anxiety given its proximity to the partial drive. It is effectively
                a voice (testifying to a human presence) but with no content—it actively<hi rend="italic">says nothing</hi> rather than merely being unclear. Yet the knock
                is noteworthy, among the millions of small sounds that surely bombard Julia and
                Ferdinand every day, for seeming to carry a meaning: it seems to say something or at
                least request the opportunity to do so. Yet it also, like any voice, seems
                “strangely recalcitrant to” meaning; it is a “material element” of communication
                that “<hi rend="italic">does not contribute to making sense</hi>” (Dolar 15,
                emphasis in the original). The knock is an exemplary case of “a voice and nothing
                more,” as Dolar would say. It is
                
            <quote>the grain of an inexplicable noise, a mysterious sound, which can appear even with
                the tiniest click. At the origin of fantasy there is a traumatic kernel materialized
                by the voice, the noise—we should allow full latitude here to a sonority not
                pertaining to language.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dolar, <hi rend="italic">A Voice</hi>, 133.</note>

            The knock, in its function as a part object that calls into being the point of the
                gaze, arrives from a place in the castle yet outside the castle, or even beyond the
                castle. It is in this sense that Julia, like Sartre’s voyeur, is being gazed at by a
                sound. It is repeated at intervals in the story, and the intervals come and go in
                intervals of their own: “The sounds were repeated, at
                    intervals, for near an hour, when silence returned . . . [for] the rest of the
                    night.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                and “live burial” topoi, which Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argues are foundational to the
                genre. Much as Sedgwick affirms, these topoi take on multiple resonances throughout
                the text, repeatedly connecting Julia to her mother through a set of structural
                    redundancies.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick,

                signification. Sound, across this novel, comically creates cases of mistaken
                identity: the fourth terrifying knock on the door is actually just Ferdinand; Julia
                loves the song “Sonnet” but doesn’t know who sang it; Ferdinand, having heard the

                is only through their shared refusal to find meaning in these object voices. Julia,
                after all, plays the lute in a manner “which seem[s] to
                    breathe a soul through the sound, and which take[s] captive the heart of the
                    hearer.” <note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Radcliffe, 4–5.</note> Julia, in this
                    metaphor, becomes both her mother and her father, insofar as the lute, in her
                    hands, is both the agent of imprisonment and the barely-audible breath attesting
                    to a life imprisoned. It is as if the novel’s metaphorical proxies for its own
                    metaphors of imprisonment turn on themselves and become complicit in that
                    imprisonment. In effect, Radcliffe here achieves at the figural level the same
                    sort of twisted Moebius pattern that she had achieved at the narratological
                    level, just a few pages earlier, in the narrative frame. Yet it is a figure not
                    of connection but of a cut. Although Julia, Louisa, and probably Hippolitus each
                    play the lute, what they have in common is not some sort of shared musicianship
                    but the way that each relates, through the musical note, to the surplus
                    enjoyment causing them anxiety. What they have in common is how this signifier,
                    now barred from any signification, “compresses the enigma of the Other
                while being simultaneously the telltale sign of the excess in the subject.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dolar, <hi rend="italic">A Voice</hi>,
                    135.</note> Instead of establishing a circuit of displaced meaning, as Sedgwick
                would have it, it moves only through the shared experience of interruption. Lack,
                treated as a positive property, is what the characters have in common.</p>
                  <p>Dolar, analyzing one of Freud’s cases, notes that a small sound can be “a structural
                moment when something which upsets and interrupts the course of desire toward its
                fulfillment actually defines and drives the desire itself.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dolar, 132.</note> The two generations discover themselves
                in the other through their mutual experience of interruption rather than alliance.
                Indeed, as Ruth Beinstock Anolik argues in a semi-Lacanian key, “the absence of the
                mother [is] a requirement for the narratable deviance necessary for narrative to
                    occur.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ruth Beinstock Anolik, “The

                we have seen, Louisa’s absence must be accounted for through frequent acts of inset
                narration as well, and these stories, too, must be interrupted if Julia is to find
                her way through the secret passages that sustain her as a desiring subject. She is,
                as Lacan would say, “pouring [herself], as it were, along the veins through which
                the domain of vision has been integrated into the field of desire,” that is,
                    acoustically.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lacan, <hi rend="italic">Seminar XI</hi>, 85.</note>

                  <head>3. The Sound of the Gaze Beyond Signification</head>
                  <p>Early in <hi rend="italic">The Interpretation of Dreams</hi>, Freud considers a
                problem encountered by his predecessor in dream-theorization, F. W. Hildebrandt.
                Hildebrandt had, in the late nineteenth century, analyzed three very different
                dreams of his own, each punctuated by a sharp sound which, it turns out, was really
                him registering the sound of his alarm clock and attempting to incorporate the
                interruption into the dream. Hildebrandt dreamed, in one case, of a church bell; in
                another, of the jingle of a horse’s sleigh-bell; and in a third, of a kitchen-maid
                loudly dropping a tall stack of dishes, in dread of the very same alarm clock. In
                each case, the dreaming Hildebrandt responded to the jarring alarm clock with an
                attempt to continue sleeping by incorporating the interruption into the narrative of
                his dream.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Sigmund Freud, <hi rend="italic">The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of
                        Sigmund Freud</hi>, trans. James Strachey (London: Hogarth Press, 1964), 4:
                    27-28.</note> Freud asks: why would the mind make “the arbitrary decision” to
                assign the sound to something else, when it knows an alarm clock lies in wait? Would
                not the dreamer’s attempt to continue sleeping be more effective if he were to dream
                of an alarm clock directly? Freud compares the situation to seeing a cow in a
                distant field and convincing oneself, through the inadequacy of one’s vantage, that
                it is a horse.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Freud, 4:29.</note>
                Breaking with Hildebrandt, Freud urges us to go beyond objective stimuli to
                understand this phenomenon.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Freud,
                    4:30.</note> Despite the external stimulus causing the dream, he says, we should
                be “engaged in looking for sources of dreams inside the organism instead of outside
                    it.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Freud, 4:34.</note> I take from
                this that even symbols, such as alarm clocks, with relatively stable and confined
                meanings stop having stable meanings once they have been introjected. The cut is
                interior to the subject now, even while, as a fragment of the real, it remains
                something forever excluded. “Where am I in relation to my desire?” is a more
                relevant question in these cases than “what is that sound?”</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian Romance </hi>is, by the standards of an
                eighteenth-century novel, unexpectedly replete with alarm clocks. Early in the
                novel, for instance, as Julia lies awake late at night reading, she “was roused from
                her forgetfulness, by the sound of the castle clock, which struck one.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>,
                    9.</note> The sound startles her because it comes so late: why, she wonders,
                would the clock chime at 1:00 at night? She is jarred by its failure to interpellate
                her, which she takes as a possible temporal misalignment between herself and her
                environs: not being asleep, she cannot recognize herself as the proper subject of
                its rousing chime, which is ironically why it rouses her into an important
                discovery. The sound leads her to the window, where she sees for the first time, in
                the form of an inexplicable light, the central mystery of the South tower. As she
                continues to watch, she finds herself “survey[ing] the scene” as it “echoed the
                sounds of gaiety and gladness” at the marchioness’s return.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 15.</note> Seeing the sound rather than either
                hearing it or seeing a visual phenomenon is, in this passage, reassuring for Julia.
                But repetition will render its effects uncanny.</p>
                  <p>The scenario recurs later in the novel, in a twist that will force the meaning of the
                bell inward, into Julia, rather than into any external signifying system. This time,
                inappropriately-timed sounds seem to beget further sounds, rather than sights, which
                Julia finds disquieting:
                
            <quote>Julia was awakened by the bell of the monastery. She knew it was not the hour
                customary for prayer, and she listened to the sounds, which rolled through the deep
                silence of the fabric, with strong surprise and terror. Presently she heard the
                doors of several cells creak on their hinges, and the sound of quick footsteps in
                the passages.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 135.</note>
                     </quote>
                
            Archambault, interpreting the castle “bells as instruments of
                    behavior control,” suggests that their ringing at the wrong time signals the
                    breakdown of social order. <note place="foot" resp="author"> Archambault, “The Function of Sound,” para.
                    37.</note> Yet the bells frighten Julia even when they ring as scheduled:
                
            <quote>The castle clock struck twelve. The sound seemed to shake the pile. Julia felt it
                thrill upon her heart. “I hear you,” sighed she, “for the last time.” The stillness
                of death succeeded. She continued to listen; but no sound met her ear.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>,
                    66.</note>
                     </quote>
                
            This version of the “alarm clock” disturbs Julia because it seems to mark the
                subjective time of her lifespan rather than any objective, chrononormative time in
                the world, which is to say that she seems to have traversed another Moebius strip of
                sorts: whereas once she had feared that the clocks had slipped out of time, she now
                fears that <hi rend="italic">she herself </hi>is slipping out of their regulatory
                mechanisms. Its ring now produces a “thrill” for Julia, who is anxious about eloping
                with Hippolitus while “the silence of the place remained undisturbed.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 67.</note> If, for Coleridge,
                sound is powerful because of its intrinsic ambiguity, for Radcliffe sound is
                powerful because it can interrupt a state of uncertainty, and anchor meaning through
                its very capacity for polysemy and repetition. Julia, who is on the verge of a
                perilous attempt to escape from her prison-like existence with her illicit lover,
                the attempt at which will, sadly, immediately cost him his life, comes to associate,
                even in advance, the object-voice with life and its cessation with death. It is as
                if she has internalized the sound of the clock and made it part of her own
                unconscious aspiration toward stillness. In this sense, she embodies Freud’s
                analysis of Hildebrandt’s alarm clock dreams: the important thing is no longer the
                external stimulus of the alarm clock—when will it ring, and how will Julia
                react?—but in her own introjection of its chime. As Žižek explains in another
                context: “Far more horrifying than to see with our ears—to hear the vibrating life
                substance beyond visual representations, this blind spot in the field of the
                visible—is to hear with our eyes, that is, to see the absolute silence that marks
                the suspension of life.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Žižek, “I Hear
                    You,” 94.</note> What Julia hears, having traversed her fantasy of failed
                interpellation, is the sound of her own jouissance returning to her as an object
                voice.</p>
                  <p>Having traversed that loop across the first half of the novel, we can compare its
                structure to a passage in Chapter 2, in which Julia is roused by a lovely song being
                played outside her window. This is the night of the Mazzini family ball, after
                which, we are told, she “retired to her apartment, but not to sleep”; as she
                fantasizes about Hippolitus in a “state of entranced delight, she was awakened by
                the sound of music immediately under her window.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 23.</note> This is an
                interesting passage because Julia is awakened from a state of already being awake,
                much as the bell in the previous chapter had done. She supposes, because it is sung
                by “a voice of more than magic expression” accompanied by “a lute touched by a
                masterly hand,” that Hippolitus must be courting her. This musical evidence, despite
                her not knowing if Hippolitus can even sing or play the lute, “confirms” what had
                previously been her mere belief that “she was loved by Hippolitus.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 24.</note> The eight-line song
                rhyming <hi rend="italic">abab cdcd</hi>, she somehow knows, is titled “Sonnet,”
                despite her being Italian and its not being a sonnet. She takes it as a sign of
                love, despite the elegiac energies implied by the stanza form. One wonders: where
                and why did it get this title? Did Hippolitus announce the title before playing it,
                or did Julia, with apparently limited knowledge of verse forms, conclude that the
                title was appropriate? Or is it the work of the frame narrator working from oral
                “abstracts”? Would a late-sixteenth-century Italian like Julia recognize this rhyme
                scheme as the beginning of an English sonnet, even without the final six lines? The
                song itself, in a cruel irony, proposes that “not a lonely sound / Steals through
                the silence of this dreary hour.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Radcliffe, 23.</note> Neither Julia nor the narrator seems to note that she has
                been “awakened” from “not . . . sleep” by a non-sonnet called “Sonnet” that recounts
                how the absence of sound can pass through the silence. The scene in many ways
                presages the scene immediately following—and already discussed above—in which Madame
                de Menon’s story about musical sounds is interrupted by a musical sound. It is as if
                the novel must explore the topic first with regard to interrupted silence before
                presenting an analogous case involving interrupted tales of sound. While many
                people, myself included, would be irritated to be awakened by someone singing about
                silence, Julia savors the return of her lost jouissance in this impossible
                utterance: “she then perceived that love may produce other sensations than those of
                    delight.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, 24.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The voice in this case functions as an autonomous part object, a gap in the visual
                field that constructs and sustains Julia’s desire. It “belongs” to Hippolitus only
                in her fantasy, and links the lovers through the cut it enacts.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Little wonder that Hippolitus is a “near and much-valued
                    relation” to the Marquis de Lomelli, whose name is so reminiscent of Lacan’s
                    mythological lamella, that organ of the drive.Radcliffe, 48; Lacan, <hi rend="italic">Seminar XI</hi>, 205–6.</note> That cut, we might say, is
                their only real sexual relation. Repeatedly, we find that “the object voice emerges
                in counterpoint with the visible and the visual, it cannot be disentangled from the
                gaze which offers its framework, so that both the gaze and the voice appear as
                objects in the gaps as a result of which they never quite match.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dolar, <hi rend="italic">A Voice</hi>,
                    67.</note> Yet they, like Julia and Hippolitus, are made inseparable by this
                mismatch. The “strange and alarming sounds” of <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian Romance</hi> impinge upon and contain traces of the
                visual register precisely because they are the points excluded from that register,
                and around which that register has been constructed.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Sicilian</hi>, 45.</note> We
                cannot easily speak of either its visual or sonic field as having a meaning apart
                from the “nothing” that Julia, Hippolitus, or Ferdinand have, with a measure of
                shame, introjected.</p>

                  <head>4. Conclusion</head>
                  <p>Radcliffe hears lack as a positive presence in its own right, consistently crossing
                the visual and sonic registers to highlight a multisensory ambiguity. The text
                attempts recourse to sonic reduction, but can figure this ambiguity only as a lack
                in the listener. This lack, appearing as a disquieting excess of sound-in-vision and
                vision-in-sound, interferes even with the figural, formal, and narratological
                processes of the text. Radcliffe subjects her characters to a sonic voyeurism that
                exceeds Foucauldian and Sartrean models of the gaze. By staging silences that are
                not empty within gazes that are not silent, and by allowing even the absence of
                sound to interrupt both the characters and the narration, Radcliffe challenges
                emergent visual epistemologies of the eighteenth century and reorganizes prevailing
                patterns of Enlightenment subjectivity. Lack, in her account, is not something
                missing but something present and resonant.</p>

               <p>Can we ever hear the sound of our own voice? When as a child I was asked by my
                mother, “Do you hear yourself?!”, I would think to myself, “Well, no. But you do. Or
                do you?” Mladen Dolar calls the voice “the material support of bringing about
                meaning, yet it does not contribute to it itself. It is, rather, something like the
                vanishing mediator” that “makes the utterance possible, but . . . disappears in
                    it.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Mladen Dolar,<hi rend="italic">A
                        Voice and Nothing More</hi> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006), 15.</note>
                What “persists,” Dolar argues, is the “object voice,” which “does not go up in smoke
                in the conveyance of meaning, and does not solidify in an object of fetish
                    reverence.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dolar, 4.</note> Hence a
                paradox: although “voices are the very texture of the social, as well as the
                intimate kernel of subjectivity,” the voice “is <hi rend="italic">what does not
                    contribute to making sense.</hi>”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dolar,
                    14, 15 (original emphasis).</note> Voice “is the material element recalcitrant
                to meaning,” for “if we speak in order to say something, then the voice is precisely

                    15.</note> I want to explore this incommensurability between voice and the said
                in Percy Shelley’s lyrical drama, <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound </hi>(1820).
                If the materiality of voice and sound mediates and grounds meaning and the human,
                more often than not in Romantic verse (think of Keats’ nightingale) they remain
                “recalcitrant to meaning,” opening a fissure within human being. This vanishing
                potential makes transformation possible while at the same time challenging notions
                of “a unified self-representation.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

            Romanticism inherits from the Enlightenment a preoccupation with sight, visuality,
                and the gaze as both formative and troubling forms of how an emergent modernity
                increasingly comes to apprehend the world. In its preoccupation with voice and
                sound, however, Romanticism explores what this apprehension misses as that which
                necessarily <hi rend="italic">remains </hi>missing such that human potential “does
                not solidify in an object of fetish reverence” – the kind of reverence that
                guarantees Jupiter’s tyranny as a symbol and method of prescribing what humans and
                thus the human itself can and should be.</p>
               <p>In Act One of Shelley’s poem, Prometheus implores the Earth and her elements to
                recall to him the “many-voiced Echoes” (1.60)<note place="foot" resp="author"> All references to Shelley’s writing are from<hi rend="italic">Shelley’s

                curse against Jupiter, who has pinned Prometheus to a rock in the Indian Caucasus
                for daring to defy the tyrant’s authority. Whatever plot the poem has, this, as well
                as the transforming energy of Asia’s desire, constitutes its single driver, apart
                from its concrete result, relegated to a stage direction at the opening of Act
                Three, Scene Three: “Hercules unbinds Prometheus, who descends” (259). But the poem
                enacts no straightforward feat of recall. For one thing, Shelley’s is not “the
                individual Mind that keeps her own / Inviolate retirement,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> William Wordsworth, Preface to<hi rend="italic">The
                        Excursion</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Poetical Works</hi>, ed. Thomas
                    Hutchinson; rev. ed. Ernest de Selincourt (Oxford: Oxford University Press,
                    1988), lines<hi rend="italic"/>19-20.</note> grounded in its ability to
                reclaim the past within the present and thus gain purchase on the future. Shelley
                draws his imagery “from the operations of the human mind” (Preface to <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound</hi>, 207) as a reflection of “different
                modifications of the one mind” (“On Life,” 508). But whereas for an earlier
                criticism the “one mind” signalled a movement from Shelley’s early skepticism toward
                the metaphysics of “postmortal transcendence,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Earl Wasserman,<hi rend="italic">Shelley: A Critical Reading
                    </hi>(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971), ix.</note> so much of
                his verse explores a mind rarely at one with itself. Symptomatic of this unbound and
                unbinding nature is the fact that Prometheus’ curse has gone viral in the
                environment. There it remains, ready to haunt, if not return, a “voice” which is
                both “contagion to the world” (2.3.10) and “an awakening sound” (3.3.14). That the
                Mountains, Springs, Air, and Whirlwinds echo back the “dread words” (1.99) of the
                curse indicates a rather more distributed cognition.<note place="foot" n="13"> This term is usually attributed to Edwin Hutchins, a
                    general signifier for cognition as both embodied and an extension of our lived
                    environments, hence my use of sound as the matrix of a viral terrain. See Edwin
                        Hutchins,<hi rend="italic">Cognition in the Wild </hi>(Cambridge, MA: MIT
                    Press, 1995). See also David J. Chalmers, <hi rend="italic">The Conscious Mind:
                        In Search of a Fundamental Theory </hi>(Oxford: Oxford University Press,
                    1996); and Andy Clark, <hi rend="italic">Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment,
                        Action, and Cognitive Extension</hi> (Oxford: Oxford University Press,
                    2011). </note> Recalling the curse itself is beside the point, for “words are
                quick and vain” (1.303). What matters instead is “the voice / Which [Prometheus]
                gave forth” (1.112-13). He has less forgotten the curse than he wants to recall the
                sound of his – its – defiance at the moment of its saying. But again, this is not
                merely to summon the voice of this defiance. More complexly, it is both to express
                and to register the autonomous affect of resistance as the vanishing mediator of any
                attempt to renovate a devastated world.</p>
               <p>Hence to recall the curse is not to return to any origin or first principle in order
                to advance toward some eventual or anticipated <hi rend="italic">telos</hi>. The
                poem’s complex movement back to its own future, its relentless pursuit of “the
                gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present” (<hi rend="italic">A Defence
                    of Poetry</hi>, 535), tracks the primal scene of an experience that can never be
                recalled but that remains as the habitual performance of its absence. As Fred Moten
                argues, “It’s the ongoing repression of the primal scene of subjection that one
                wants to guard against and linger in. . . . the <hi rend="italic">conjunction
                </hi>of reproduction and disappearance is performance’s condition of possibility,
                its ontology and its mode of production.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                In this delicate balance between submitting again to the sound of punishment and
                keeping alive the voice of resistance, what, then, does Prometheus hear, or want to
                hear, or need to hear? Something to do with the sound <hi rend="italic">of
                    </hi>sound,<note place="foot" resp="author"> I borrow this phrase from
                    Susan J. Wolfson, “Introduction,” in<hi rend="italic">‘Soundings of Things

                    Susan J. Wolfson, <hi rend="italic">Romantic Circles Praxis</hi> (April 2008):
                    par. 3.</note> the activity of its occurrence, provides the answer, which is why
                echoes come to signify at once the failure of recall and its insistent possibility.
                In Shelley’s lyrical drama, a voice, like Echo herself, is nothing more than sound
                cursed to repeat what it hears, wasted by the desire she can never express for the
                astonishing beauty of another she can never have. But unlike Narcissus’ perpetually
                redirected inwardness, that the voice is nothing more means it also has the queerly
                powerful potential to release itself from the gaze of the other. </p>
               <p>Eventually I want to argue that this potential resides with the capacity to listen
                and to be heard as nearly impossible markers of what it means to be human. Listening
                is the literal act of a possible communication between individuals. Yet at the same
                time speaking with and to others is less to listen for and hear the content of what
                is being said, the grounding of a human relationality, than it is to register what
                risks getting lost in translation. Listening is facilitated by the materiality of
                sound, but it transpires as and results in the immaterial or ideational affect and
                effect of what is possibly being heard. We can, that is, differentiate between
                hearing and listening. To hear and be heard is to indicate a certain transmission of
                meaning. To listen is to remain open to the possibility <hi rend="italic">of
                </hi>meaning, not as its crystallization but as what cannot be conscripted into
                meaning, as what takes us always already beyond ourselves. Prometheus listens more
                than hears and listens for more than he hears. In doing so, listening moves the poem
                perpetually along the non-human trajectory of what Chris Washington calls
                Romanticism’s post-apocalyptic future.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See

               <p>At the opening of Act One, Prometheus asks the Earth, “have not the mountains felt?”
                (1.24), “yon Heaven – the all-beholding Sun, / Has it not seen?” and “The Sea, in
                storm or calm / Heaven’s ever-changing Shadow, spread below – / Have its deaf waves
                not heard my agony?” (1.26-29). Feeling, sight, sound. The poem seems to avoid
                prioritizing one over the other, though it’s not as simple as that. When he
                encounters the Furies Mercury sends to harrow his soul, Prometheus states, “Whilst I
                behold such execrable shapes, / Methinks I grow like what I contemplate / And laugh
                and stare in loathsome sympathy” (1.449-51). Here the ominous fixity of the gaze
                orchestrates the scene of Romantic sympathy. The Furies anatomize what Panthea calls
                “A woeful sight – a youth / With patient looks nailed to a crucifix” (584-85). This
                image marks the nightmare of iconography and thus of the visual to supersede and
                thus oppress all other senses. Or as Blake writes in <hi rend="italic">The Marriage
                    of Heaven and Hell </hi>(1790-1793), “man has closed himself up, till he sees
                all things thro’ narrow chinks of his cavern.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> William Blake,<hi rend="italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>,

                “This wonderful organ [the eye] may be considered as the sentinel which guards the

                the time of the First Reform Bill the enduring post-Enlightenment hegemony of the
                visual. Yet one of Brewster’s examples is the Spectre of the Brocken, an atmospheric
                phenomenon by which our shadows, cast upon mist, both magnify and distort the human
                form. The Spectre reflects the spectral nature of vision itself, the way in which
                reality passes into consciousness via a logic beyond comprehension, like the

                    Confessions of a Justified Sinner </hi>(1824) or Thomas De Quincey’s opium

                visual as the mirror or “ever-changing Shadow” of Heaven “spread below,” where
                Prometheus’ “agony” falls on “deaf” ears. Glen O’Malley has explored this
                transitional space between sight and sound as part of Shelley’s synesthetic
                aesthetic. Synaesthesia suggests how the neuronal pathways of the poem’s sensorium –
                the “vitally metaphorical” way in which the transferences of figurative language
                embody a poem’s experience as it unfolds <hi rend="italic">in medias res</hi> –
                produce a kind of involuntary interconnectedness in which subjects hear sight or see
                    sound.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Glen O’Malley,<hi rend="italic">Shelley and Synesthesia </hi>(Evanston, IL: Northwestern UP,
                    1964). William Keach calls Shelley’s style “the work of an artist whose sense of
                    the unique and unrealized potential in language was held in unstable suspension
                    with his sense of its resistances and limitations.” William Keach, <hi rend="italic">Shelley’s Style </hi> (xvi).</note> Such capacity radicalizes
                the perceptual juxtapositions of what Blake calls the “Ratio of the five
                    senses.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Blake,<hi rend="italic">The

                synaesthete will tell you, all senses firing involuntarily at once brings its own
                form of hell, a kind of perceptual deluge that overwhelms and suspends the self, as
                if to open a fissure within human being. Addressing the capacity of images to compel
                and fascinate our notice, W. J. T. Mitchell asks “What do pictures want?”<note place="foot" resp="author"> See W. J. T. Mitchell, <hi rend="italic">What Do Pictures Want? The Lives and Loves of Images </hi>(Chicago:
                        University of Chicago Press, 2005).</note> Asking how and why the visual
                arrests our attention is to account for the lack that mobilizes this mutual desire
                in the first place, one for which neither we nor the picture can account. In a
                similar way, Shelley’s poem both desires and demands our attention without any
                guarantee that we will be able to make sense of its felt environment. </p>
               <p>The poem thus implicitly differentiates between making sense and the making <hi rend="italic">of </hi>sense, between what we imagine the result of sense-making
                to mean and the perceptual actions that make meaning possible in the first place,
                but on which we can gain no objective purchase. Sound signals this paradoxical
                embeddedness, what in a somewhat different context Jacques Lacan calls the
                “filigree” in which we “feel the presence of the gaze” even when “any representation
                of the human figure is absent.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Jacques

                way, sound in <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound </hi>confronts us with a
                subjectivity without subjects, what one might call a transferential subject or
                subject <hi rend="italic">of </hi>transference. And in this sense, sound suggests a
                mode of survival that survives the visual. At the end of Act Three the Spirit of the
                Earth recounts to Asia that he has heard the “voice to be accomplished” as a “long
                long sound, as it would never end” (3.4.57). In Act One Ione asks where the Chorus
                of Spirits that bring the sound of the future from “the dim caves of human thought”
                (1.658) have “fled” (1.801). Panthea replies: “Only a sense / Remains of them, like
                the Omnipotence / Of music when the inspired voice and lute / Languish, ere yet the
                responses are mute” (1.802-5). Something about the loss of sound registers as the
                enduring sound of loss, the ineluctable transference between invincibility and
                expiration. Or as Jean-Luc Nancy writes,<hi rend="italic"/>the “visual persists
                until its disappearance,” while “the sonorous appears and fades away into its
                    permanence.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Jean-Luc Nancy,<hi rend="italic">Listening</hi>, trans. Charlotte Mandell (New York: Fordham

               <p>The resonantly disastrous sonic effects of Prometheus’ curse denude the earth and
                dehumanize its inhabitants. They also indicate what Steve Goodman calls “the less

                of post- or para-human life. In Act Three Earth feels these effects as a “touch”
                that “runs down / Even to the adamantine central gloom / Along those marble nerves”
                (3.3.85-87). At first, however, the sound of Prometheus’ curse seems to echo
                Jupiter’s oppression, resonating as a sound within Jupiter’s hearing that confirms
                his power. The “Mountains” and “ice Springs” “vibrated to hear” Prometheus’ curse
                “and then crept / Shuddering through India” (63-65). The sound of the curse was like
                that of an “Earthquake’s couch” over which the Mountains “stood,” and like “men
                convulsed with fears / We trembled in our multitude” (1.75-77). This traumatic sonic
                vibration registers as the involuntary and inarticulate affective vocabulary of
                groans: “rending groan” (1.85), “the groans of pining slaves” (1.128), “groans and
                blood” (1.332), “groans half heard, and blood untasted” (1.529), “low yet dreadful
                groan” (1.578). As Panthea says, revisiting the effects of Jupiter’s curse on earth
                and throughout history, “those groans are grief enough” (1.593). They manifest what
                Goodman calls “sonic warfare.” In 2005 the Israeli military used “sound bombs” in
                the Gaza Strip, “the high-volume, deep-frequency effect of low-flying jets traveling
                faster than the speed of sound.” The “objective was to weaken the morale of a
                civilian population by creating a climate of fear through a threat that was
                preferably nonlethal yet possibly as unsettling as an actual attack.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Goodman, xiii-xiv.</note> Such a traumatic
                deployment indicates how “sound can modulate mood,” for the “intense vibration
                literally threatens not just the traumatized emotional disposition and physiology of
                the population, but also the very structure of the built environment.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Goodman, xiv.</note> Part of Prometheus’
                desire to recall his curse against Jupiter in Act One, then, is to risk
                re-instantiating voice and sound for their purely material and thus violent effect
                and affect.</p>
               <p>Yet Prometheus short-circuits this “affectively contagious radiation of sonic
                    events”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Goodman, xix.</note> in order
                to re-sound sound as the potentiality of a less traumatizing experience. He thus
                pushes against the deployment of sonic trauma as the “<hi rend="italic">activity of
                    the future in the present,</hi> and therefore a portal into the operative logic
                of fear within the emergent paradigm of preemptive power,” what Brian Massumi calls
                the future affect of terror.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Goodman, xviii

                see, and fire; and canst hear groans: / Worse things unheard, unseen, remaind
                behind” (1.617-18). If the sound of grief is felt along the pulses, it also heralds
                another “unheard, unseen” materiality that here signals an ominous future but, as we
                later see, is also a redemptive sonic possibility. The Fury’s negative formation
                embeds its inverse as the “happy sounds” of Earth that remain to this point like the
                “inarticulate people of the dead” (1.188, 183). Asking to hear the sound of the
                voice he “gave forth,” Prometheus hears “an awful whisper” that “rises up,” the
                “inorganic voice” of a “Spirit” that Prometheus feels “art moving near” (1.132-36).
                That this voice is “scarce like sound” (1.133) suggests the weakening resonance of
                Prometheus’s curse that he would re-amplify in order to dismiss. Yet the phrasing
                also indicates a potentiality that “connects every separate entity in the cosmos,
                organic or inorganic.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Goodman, xiv.</note>
                This “production, transmission, and mutation of affective tonality” signals a
                “non-representational ontology of vibrational force,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Goodman, xv.</note> not sound’s representation <hi rend="italic">as </hi>sound but its dynamic motion through time and space. As
                avatars carrying the sonic effect of this movement to Asia in Act Two, Ione and
                Panthea see the voice as “A Shape, a throng of sounds” (1.226). But this “Shape” is
                at the same time “awful <hi rend="italic">like</hi> the sound” (1.233; emphasis
                added), indicating a metonymic or sideways movement or force that the Phantasm of
                Jupiter hears as “unaccustomed sounds . . . hovering on my lips” (1.242-43), as if
                to anticipate their decentering power to overthrow the tyrant. More pointedly,
                Prometheus in turn hears the voice of the Phantasm as “empty” (1.249), as if to
                signal it as now void of meaning, just as Prometheus, upon hearing the curse,
                famously responds, “It doth repent me: words are quick and vain” (1.1.303).</p>
               <p>But “empty” also foreshadows within the plenitude of sound the vanishing mediator of
                voice that is, as Dolar notes, the matrix of sound itself, one that by Act Four will
                drown out all other voices. Tellingly, when the Fury finally vanishes and the
                “sights with which [Jupiter] torturest gird [Prometheus’] soul / With new endurance”
                (1.643-44), Prometheus then says, “There are two woes: / To speak and to behold;
                thou spare me one” (1.646-47). This spared woe I take to be the sound of words
                themselves. Earlier Prometheus says, pondering the sacrificial image or “emblem” he
                might become to “heap / Thousand-fold torment” (1.595-96) on humankind, “Thy name I
                will not speak, / It hath become a curse” (1.603-5). He is thus spared succumbing to
                the fixed sound of his original curse, so that its traumatic sonic effects can be
                released into its more productive vibratory movement. At this point the Earth calls
                upon a chorus of spirits to voice what “they behold / Beyond that twilight realm, as
                in a glass” (1.661-62), but a glass darkly that is the mirror stage of sound through
                which Prometheus and Asia will pass. And what they bear/speak is the sound of “The
                future” (1.663): “One sound – above, around, / One sound beneath, around, above /
                Was moving” (1.703-5). Through this medium, as Ione states, “despair” is “Mingled
                with love, and then dissolved in sound,” which in turn stops up words altogether. As
                Panthea responds, “Canst thou speak, sister? all my words are drowned” (1.758), and
                the Spirits having fled, they hear “Only a sense” of their presence, but one that
                “Like echoes through long caverns, wind and roll” (1.806). Here the echoes that
                earlier in the Act threatened to die out now resonate with a startling and complex
                materiality as sound bends (“wind and roll”) through a space that is at once
                physical, natural, psychological, spiritual, and cosmic.</p>
               <p>This resonance, at once material and metaphysical, drives Act Two. Here Asia, long
                parted from Prometheus in the Indian Caucasus, now occupies the “scene of her sad
                exile” (1.827), patiently awaiting his return. Yet their impending reunion, meant to
                signal the rebirth of the world released from the effects of Jupiter’s curse, is
                less the <hi rend="italic">hieros gamos </hi>of two identities than their mutual
                submersion in sound as their very mode of being. Panthea enters with the knowledge
                of two dreams, the sound of which carries her and Asia to the realm of Demogorgon.
                One heralds the imminent liberation of Prometheus from Jupiter’s tyranny, a gradual
                transformation Panthea witnesses while asleep in Ione’s arms in Act One, enacted in
                Act Three’s stage direction. That dream carries Panthea in Act Two as “the wind /
                Which fails beneath the music that I bear” (2.1.50-51), which is the “wordless
                converse” (2.1.52) already transpiring between Asia and Prometheus since Act One.
                Asia reads the psychic interiority of Prometheus in Panthea’s face, now a site of
                potential recognition and communication between Asia and Prometheus: “Lift up thine
                eyes, / And let me read thy dream” (2.2.55-56).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Rajan these scenes construct a dialogic “model” that presents
                    “reading as a psychological and not just a semiological process” (<hi rend="italic">The Supplement of Reading: Figures of Understanding in
                        Romantic Theory and Practice</hi> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press,
                    1990], 308).</note> Finding Panthea’s “words / Are as the air. I feel them not”
                (2.1.109), Asia then implores her to “lift / Thine eyes that I may read his written
                soul!” (2.1.109-10). Yet their transference suggests neither entrapment within the
                gaze of the visual nor the prison house of language; instead it does the felt work
                of reading through the medium of sound. The Norton Editors tell us that Panthea’s
                second dream – which, tellingly, she “remember[s] not” (2.1.610) – is of “the Spirit
                of Hours that are to usher in the fall of Jupiter and the release of Prometheus, and
                to the course of necessity” (238n2). I would argue that the purpose of this second
                dream is to manifest sound as what “has no hidden face; it is all in front, in back,
                and outside inside, <hi rend="italic">inside-out</hi> in relation to the most
                general logic of presence as appearing, as phenomenality or as manifestation, and
                thus as the visible face of a presence subsisting in self.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Nancy, 13-14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This subjectivity without subjects gradually emerges as the poem’s <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi>. The second Dream tells Asia and Panthea to “Follow,
                follow!” (2.1.132), then “disappears” (2.132) and “passes now into [the] mind”
                (2.133) of Panthea, who echoes its sound: “<hi rend="italic">O follow, follow!</hi>”
                (2.141). As Panthea speaks the sound of her “words / Fill, pause by pause [Asia’s]
                own forgotten sleep / With shapes” (2.141-43) that in turn echo the Dream’s sound at
                lines 153 (“<hi rend="italic">Follow, O follow!</hi>”), 159 (“<hi rend="italic">O
                    follow, follow, follow me!</hi>”), and 162 (“<hi rend="italic">follow,
                    follow</hi>”), what she hears as the “clinging music” of “Low, sweet, faint
                sounds, like the farewell of ghosts” (2.1.157, 158). This <hi rend="italic">menage-a-trois </hi>of sound signifies the tangled transference between
                Panthea, Asia, and Prometheus that then resounds in the Echo of the Dream – “Follow,
                follow!” (2.1.162) – and yet again in “<hi rend="italic">unseen</hi>” Echoes who
                announce, “Echoes we – listen! / We cannot stay / As dew-stars glisten / Then fade
                away” (2.1.166-69). Here, as throughout the poem, Shelley’s syntax is maddeningly
                opaque. Although sound cannot be seen, it nonetheless announces its presence “as the
                visible face of a presence subsisting in self.” Like Heideggerian<hi rend="italic">Schein, </hi>in which<hi rend="italic"/>being is at once revelatory and
                illusory, it <hi rend="italic">appears</hi>, as in the phrase “We are echoes,” a
                performative speech act that implores Asia and Panthea to “listen” before this
                presence fades. At the same time, the echoes carry the sounds of this listening and
                thus do the work of listening itself. As Asia and Panthea approach Demogorgon’s
                realm, they hear a sound that “Satiates the listening wind, continuous, vast, /
                Awful as silence” (2.3.35-36). We might ask how wind can listen, but then we need to
                ask what a sound might be with no wind to carry – to hear – it? </p>
               <p>At the end of Act Two, after her descent to the Cave of Demogorgon, where she finds
                that “the deep truth is imageless” (2.4.116), Asia, hearing only the sound of her
                thought echoed back by Demogorgon, is told instead simply to “Behold!” (2.4.128).
                The exclamation is less an injunction to <hi rend="italic">see </hi>than to <hi rend="italic">feel </hi>and thus <hi rend="italic">hear </hi>what the future
                holds. Or rather, if it is to see, it’s to see what cannot be seen, to see the sound
                of the future as the picture of what sound might look like. The Spirit of the Hour
                arrives to transport Asia to her reunion with Prometheus in Act Three. Seeing the
                change in Asia’s presence, Panthea cannot “endure the radiance of [her] beauty”
                (2.5.17-18), like the synaesthete unable to withstand all senses firing at will: “I
                feel, but see thee not” (2.5.17). Yet at the same time this perceptual crisis
                heralds the emergence of a greater immersive sonic environment, the “sounds i’ the
                air which speak the love / Of all articulate beings” (2.5.35-36) and sing of Asia as
                the “Life of Life” (2.5.48) and “Child of Light” (2.5.54). Immersed in this music,
                Panthea experiences the abandonment of and by sight as the pre-existing condition
                for transformation by the feeling of sound: “all feel, yet see thee never / As I
                feel now, lost forever!” (2.5.64-65). At this point Asia, “by the instinct of sweet

               <p>In Act Three Ione announces both what sound prophecies and the sound <hi rend="italic">of </hi>prophecy itself. Implored by Prometheus, she takes “that
                curved shell, which Proteus old / Made Asia’s nuptial boon, breathing within it / A
                voice to be accomplished” (3.3.65-67), as if the sound emanates at once from Ione’s
                breath <hi rend="italic">and</hi> autonomously from the shell itself. Similarly, the
                resulting “sound must be at once both sweet and strange” (3.3.75), familiar and
                alien, one whose timbre is pitched ambiguously between present and future as well as
                past. “Must” signals variously as ‘it must be this way,’ ‘it must take this form,’
                but also it ‘must already be this way,’ at once given, imperative, and
                prognostication. As Prometheus announces, Ione will “chant fragments of sea-music”
                (3.3.27) that signal a “Mutability” from which “man” cannot “hide” (3.3.25), while
                Asia and Prometheus, “unchanged,” “will sit and talk of time and change / As the
                world ebbs and flows” (3.3.23-24). Moreover, they shall “Weave harmonies divine yet
                ever new, / From difference sweet where discord cannot be” (3.3.38-39). This vision
                is of things “though unimagined, yet to be” (3.3.56). This “voice to be
                accomplished” suggests a blank utopian future that might never be realized, a
                sterile ‘no-place’ of only ever potential action. But it also suggests Frederic
                Jameson’s reading of utopia as an “imaginary enclave within the real social space,”
                one whose “very possibility . . . is itself the result of spatial and social
                differentiation” born of two “contradictory features.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Frederic Jameson,<hi rend="italic">Archaeologies of the
                        Future: The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions</hi> (New York:

                forces of social change” is the product of the agitations of transitional historical
                moments, like the effects of Jupiter’s tyranny or Prometheus’ curse. But it also
                marks a “distance . . . from practical politics, on the basis of a zone of the
                social totality which seems eternal and unchangeable,” like the cave to which
                Prometheus and Asia repair at the end of Act Three.</p>
               <p>We can thus read Jameson’s two “contradictory features” in terms of how <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound</hi> wrestles with the uncanny connection
                between tyranny/oppression and liberation/transformation. The poem’s utopianism only
                makes sense by virtue of its emergence both within and apart from the space of
                discord that is the occasion of Prometheus wanting to remember his curse against
                Jupiter in the first place. Yet this paradox, as I have explored it to this point,
                is to map a space of listening negotiation based, not in “discord” but in a
                “difference” that does not at the same time produce identity. Just at the moment
                that the Chorus of Spirits announces the song of the Promethean in Act Four, the
                Chorus of Hours, whose temporality signals the movement of social transition,
                announces, “Break the dance, and scatter the song; / Let some depart and some
                remain” (4.159-60). As Kandice Chuh notes, borrowing from Fred Moten, this ‘break’
                in sound, which is also an invitation “‘into the break,’” indicates a “radical
                aesthetics that undermines the privileged position of visual representation and its
                attendant processes of subjectification/subjection.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Kandice Chuh,<hi rend="italic">The Difference Aesthetics
                        Makes: On the Humanities “After Man” </hi>(Durham, NC: Duke University
                    Press, 2019), 61.</note> As Ione says to Panthea, “Even whilst we speak / New
                notes arise . . . What is that awful sound?” (4.184-85). Like Demogorgon’s realm,
                “Awful as silence,” this sound cannot be understood or turned into meaning. Instead
                it must be felt as part of the subject’s immersion in the matrix of her own coming
                to being. </p>
               <p>This absorption is less to trap the subject between oppression and transformation,
                which Shelley seems to recognize as an unavoidable capture, than it is to mark a
                “pocket of stasis” in which a subjectivity without subjects registers a rather more
                fluid and dynamic possibility. At this point Ione and Panthea “Listen” for “The
                Ocean-like inchantment of strong sound / Which flows intenser, keener, deeper yet /
                Under the ground and through the windless air” (4.203-5). This tonal motion heralds
                the “Two visions of strange radiance” (4.202) whose “path of melody” (4.198) carries
                the “lovely grief” of “sweet sad thoughts” (4.201). Again, the ambiguity of
                Shelley’s phrasing indicates the lived experience of listening itself as both active
                attunement and submission to the act of listening. As the Earth says when in Act
                Three Prometheus heralds the “thunder mingled with clear echoes,” “I hear – I feel”
                (3.3.84). Sound and voice but more importantly <hi rend="italic">listening </hi>to
                either indicates a sensory intake that is itself constitutive of the poem’s
                revolutionary movement. This agitation within the social space of a world reeling
                from both the tyrant’s oppression and defeat that instantiates the very moment of
                political practice itself as a lived utopian gesture. As Chuh notes, “sound can
                interrupt the social order more immediately, perhaps more effectively, than can
                visual representation.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Chuh, 61.</note>
                Such disruptive potential also speaks to the fact that Shelley’s text seems more
                than aware of itself <hi rend="italic">as </hi>sound, more importantly an aesthetics
                of “sound, as sound.” Put another way, one engages in listening yet can never
                anticipate what will be heard. As Glissant states, “The power to experience the
                shock of elsewhere is what distinguishes the poet.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Glissant, 29-30.</note> And what will be heard, once materialized as
                sound, immediately vanishes into the sonorousness of this materialization. </p>
               <p>It’s not the case, then, that sound takes priority over sight. Instead, “listening .
                . . is the sense that touches upon and stimulates at once all bodily senses, as well
                as that other sense-making faculty that has been variously called ‘mind,’ ‘spirit,’
                or ‘soul.’”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Adrienne Janus, “Listening:

                envelope the listener.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Janus, 189.</note>
                One might say all of Act One, indeed the entire poem, is engaged in active listening
                for the synaesthetic good vibrations that signal “the new world of man” that, as the
                Chorus of Spirits and Hours in Act Four foretell, “shall be called the Promethean”
                (4.158). This “awakening sound” “shall be / As thunder mingled with clear echoes”
                (3.3.81-82), yet not in the sense that the echoes themselves provide a clarity of
                sound for they are “mingled” with the sound of the thunder itself. The poem attends
                to a rather more complex “loud and whirlwind harmony” (4.237) that is “the deep
                music of the rolling world / Kindling within the strings of the waved air / Æolian
                modulations” (4.186-88). Listening, that is to say, is neither an easy nor isolated
                and solitary task. As Ione says in Act Four, one must “Listen too, / How every pause
                is filled with under-notes, / Clear, silver, icy, keen, awakening tones / Which
                pierce the sense and live within the soul / As the sharp stars pierce Winter’s
                chrystal air / And gaze upon themselves within the sea” (4.188-93). Goodman speaks
                of the “unactualized nexus of rhythms and frequencies within audible
                    bandwidths,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Goodman, xx.</note> like
                the unheard melodies resonating from Keats’ Grecian urn. Goodman calls this the “<hi rend="italic">not yet audible</hi>” or “<hi rend="italic">unsound,</hi>” silence
                as “sound in potential, unactualized.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Goodman, 191.</note> An as yet unactualized potential both of and within sound
                at the same time constitutes the sonic’s capacity for mobilizing, orchestrating, and
                reorganizing pluralistic and relational rather than totalizing or atomizing
                environments.</p>
               <p>Listening thus constitutes the profoundly political dimension of Shelley’s text as a
                gesture beyond the political. In <hi rend="italic">Noise</hi>: <hi rend="italic">The
                    Political Economy of Music</hi>, Jacques Attali unfolds a cultural
                historiography of music as the prophetic herald of change, “a way of perceiving the
                world” and a “tool of understanding,”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                what Shelley in “Ode to a West Wind” calls “The trumpet of a prophecy” (69). Music
                is the orchestration of sound as noise: “With noise is born disorder and its
                opposite: the world. With music is born power and its opposite: subversion.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Attali, 6.</note> As the political
                unconscious of music, noise is an especially potent idea in a world of capital and
                the fetishization of music as commodity and spectacle, in a “society of repetition

                Theodor Adorno associates this fetishization with the “pseudoactivity” and
                “deconcentration” of an “atomized” or “regression of listening,” which misses
                hearing “the possibility of a different and oppositional music” and collapses the
                differentiating force of sound into a mere diversion from the autocracy of
                    sameness.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Theodor Adorno, “On the

                “concentrated listening,” in Attali’s terms, “heralds the emergence of a formidable

                and the fantasies of men in power: to listen, to memorize – this is the ability to

               <p>Jupiter’s tyranny is sustained by his capacity to incite hate in those he oppresses;
                their curse against him is a sign of his power <hi rend="italic">to</hi> oppress. He
                listens for it; he yearns to hear it, though like Oedipus confronted by Tiresias, he
                cannot hear what is being said. When the Car of the Hour bearing Demogorgon arrives
                at the opening of Act Three, Jupiter demands, “Awful Shape, what art thou? Speak!”
                (3.1.51). Demogorgon responds, “Eternity – demand no direr name” (3.1.52), which
                short circuits the master/slave dialectic whose words no longer have power as both
                “conqueror and the conquered” sink “into the bottomless void” (3.1.78, 76). This
                pointed, almost traumatically abbreviated exchange symbolizes the absurdly fragile
                nature of power and its ideological labour. Like Dorothy in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Wizard of Oz </hi>pulling aside the Wizard’s curtain to reveal the farce of a
                utopian wish that has misguided her journey toward a future divorced from reality,
                the scene performs in political time the paradox of what in Act Two the empty throne
                in Demogorgon’s cave stages in metaphysical time: the effects of power are
                all-too-real, but power itself functions in a vacuum. At this point we realize what
                makes Prometheus’ desire to hear the curse repeated, only to refute its words, so
                potent (again, as Prometheus earlier notes, “how vain is talk”). This is to bring
                the two “contradictory features” of Frederic Jameson’s understanding of utopia into
                sharp relief as a potentiality at once embedded within yet separate from the very
                sociopolitical and historical reality that makes it possible. Prometheus invokes the
                words themselves not even to refute, but merely to dismiss their power as
                “unregarded now” (3.4.179) in order simultaneously to mark and to efface their
                potency. Put another way, because Prometheus refuses to memorize the curse, he
                signals instead another form of active listening to the sound of music and the music
                of sound.</p>
               <p>As Panthea enters bringing news of Prometheus’ transformation, Asia asks, apparently
                rhetorically, “hear I not / The Æolian music of her sea-green plumes / Winnowing the
                crimson dawn?” (2.1.25-27). The phrasing at once affirms and renders ambiguous the
                potentiality of sound, a hypostasis that may or may not transpire. In a seminal
                essay D. J. Hughes explored the poem’s potentiality as its means of “cleansing the
                ontological situation, restoring our sense of the potential, turning, through a
                series of verbal strategies, the actual back upon itself,” such that the “world at
                the end of the poem is a virtual one, with the seeds of decline checked, themselves
                remaining in potency.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> D. J. Hughes,

                skeptical of Hughes’ positivity, however. As Timothy Webb is careful to note,
                “[w]hether we enact and perpetuate a Promethean revolution depends on us; we have

               <p>Untelling and the untold resonate with the notion of the narrator’s “thoughts which
                must remain untold” in Shelley’s final poem (21). Again, that word “must” troubles
                us. Leaving something “untold” points to a deliberate self-suppression.
                Acknowledging “thoughts” to which the subject has no access is another matter. This
                is to confront us with modernity’s pursuit of the unthought, what is at once
                “exterior” and “indispensable to [man],” the “shadow cast by man as he emerged in
                the field of knowledge” and “the blind stain by which it is possible to know him” as
                we find ourselves “straining to catch its endless murmur.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Michel Foucault,<hi rend="italic">The Order of Things</hi>:

                possible “symbolisation.” We might say, then, that Prometheus, as the avatar of
                Shelley’s most difficult poem, figures the “perilous act” of listening for this
                “endless murmur.” But to listen is not necessarily to capture the meaning of what it
                hears. This would be, as Foucault says of “the phenomenological project,” to
                “resolve[ ] itself into a description . . . of actual experience, and into an
                ontology of the unthought that automatically short-circuits the primacy of the ‘I

                the interminable process – murmur – of thought itself in the process of thinking the
                unthought, which is to unthink thought itself in the process of its formation, an
                unthinking that is, paradoxically, constitutive of thought and being in the first
                place. As Michele Speitz explores in Wordsworth’s verse, echoes and murmurs trade on
                “loss and rupture,” not as a counterpose to its restorative nature, but by
                “revealing . . . the epitaphic nature of sound itself.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Michele Speitz, “The Wordsworthian Acoustic Imagination,

                they register within “poetry’s inexorably elegiac acoustic remains” its “promise of
                a sometimes vaguely discernible, sometimes illegible yet still audible collective
                foundation” and thus “draw out a recursive wave of the otherwise broken sonic life

                    622, 641, 642. Whereas Speitz is talking about the possibility of an
                    “individuated” Wordsworthian subject, I would argue that Shelley’s poem moves us
                    far beyond any sense of such individuation.</note> The sense of thought as
                thoughts themselves vanish “Remains” as the materiality of thought itself in the
                process of its manifestation. Or as Forest Pyle writes of what Jerrold Hogle calls
                Shelley’s process, “if an aesthetic experience makes us feel <hi rend="italic">as if
                </hi>we are gaining knowledge, then when the experience of a radical aestheticism
                ‘bursts’ upon us, it makes us feel as if we knew anything or, perhaps, <hi rend="italic">anything else but this</hi>.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Forest Pyle,<hi rend="italic">Art’s Undoing: In the Wake of a Radical
                        Aestheticism</hi> (New York: Fordham University Press, 2014), 10. See
                    Jerrold E. Hogle, <hi rend="italic">Shelley’s Process: Radical Transference and
                        the Development of His Major Works </hi>(New York: Oxford University Press,
                    1988). Hogle reads the nomadic principle of Shelley's aesthetic as “a rootless
                    passage between different formations,” a “primordial, preconscious shift,
                    intimated in the movement of perception, feeling, and language, always already
                    becoming a different enactment of itself at another time and in conjunction with
                    other elements” (15). For Hogle, Shelley’s Prometheus represents “the
                    transitional and disruptive actions of the Titan in his previous [mythic]
                    forms,” which “shifts make him very nearly the activity of transference
                    incarnate” (172). In my reading sound both enacts and undoes this
                    process.</note> In this way listening signifies listening for what can never be
                heard as the constitutive act and moment of listening itself.</p>

                evokes a self that manifests outside of “dichotomies traditionally associated with
                subjectivity: presence-absence, surface-depth. Rather, this self – as the space of
                the ‘corps sonore’ (sonorous or resonant body) through which and around which the
                    <hi rend="italic">renvoi </hi>of sense takes place – has to be described

                subject – really more of a resonant subjectivity – is also a “listening subject, if

                elements of self and world that might otherwise be termed ‘objects.’”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Janus, 194.</note> This listening subject at
                once emanates from and constitutes the warp and woof of sound, as when in Act Four
                the Chorus of Spirits and Hours move to “weave the web of the mystic measure”
                (4.129), such that the “Spirits of the human mind” are “wrapt in sweet sound’”
                (4.81-82). </p>
               <p>Nancy’s idea of resonance informs transactions of meaning in Shelley’s lyrical drama,
                which give equal priority to the visual and the auditory as forms of restraint and
                release, a way of visualizing sound that does not reify its meaning. Differentiating
                narrative from lyric in Romantic writing, Tilottama Rajan argues that the former
                evokes a “kind of mirror stage in which the [latter's] search for a unified
                self-representation is enacted and called into question,” “the displacement of the

                Karen Weisman associates this de-idealized lyric utterance with transference, which

                third ear,’ a way of thinking the unthought of ideology, of listening for both the
                oppressive and liberatory effects and potentiality of its deep resonance. Shelley’s
                “Sea profound of ever-spreading sound” thus figures a mode of critical listening,
                the mood of which is inherently revolutionary.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Here I am indebted to Ryan Shuvera’s notion of listening to Indigenous
                    music as a form of conciliation rather than reconciliation, which presupposes
                    the return to some pre-existing harmony. Reconciliation entails the just state
                    as a kind of blank utopian notion that implicitly elides the situational and the
                    everyday and thus any<hi rend="italic">sense </hi>of social justice. Such a
                    utopia is distinctly at odds with the ‘sense of sound’ that makes the poem’s

               <p>Sound in Shelley’s poem seems to be merely the medium that carries the poem’s
                message. Yet at the same time it facilitates a mode of relationality that is the
                matrix of meaning itself without making meaning present. As such, sound insists on
                its own opacity, the “errantry” of “Totality’s imaginary [which] allows the detours
                that lead away from anything totalitarian.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                broader network because they exist in its midst as both its products and generators.
                Sound, like feeling, sustains the poem’s atmosphere as part of what I would call a
                global sonic ecology. This ecology indicates not just the transfer between subjects
                and the world, but the vibratory transference that is the very mode and matrix of
                their (co-)existence. Goodman notes that “<hi rend="italic">We do not yet know what

                as its latent possibility and, like Mladen Dolar’s account of the voice, the
                constitutive possibility of human sound that is at the same time incommensurable
                with the human itself. Perhaps this is why Demogorgon, implored by the Chorus of all
                voices in Act Four to “Speak” so that “thy strong words may never pass away”
                (4.553), warns us that words are only “spells by which to reassume / An empire o’er
                the disentangled Doom” (4.568-69), even as they sound and re-sound within the
                environment. As the echoes that carry Panthea and Asia to Demogorgon, “In the world
                unknown / Sleeps a voice unspoken” (2.1.190-91). Yet the sound of what remains
                unspoken <hi rend="italic">un</hi>nerves us. </p>
               <p>In an article for <hi rend="italic">New York Review of Books</hi> Fintan O’Toole
                notes the spirit of mourning and restoration that informed the 2020 Presidential
                race, in the Biden-Harris camp fueled by sorrow rather than anger over what has been
                lost since 2016, in the Trump-Pence camp by revisiting the nostalgia of 2016 when
                Trump (like Reagan before him) promised to return America to its former glory. In
                either case, as O’Toole rather trenchantly remarks, “the point of genuine mourning
                is that the thing you are grieving for cannot be restored. The grief is an
                acceptance that the loss is irreparable,” and so what is needed is a “hard, sad,
                relentless reckoning with the knowledge that much of what [America] has been should
                be allowed to die.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Fintan O’Toole, “Night
                    and Day,”<hi rend="italic">New York Review of Books</hi> (24 September
                    2020).</note> I take O’Toole’s Freudian primer on the psychology of our
                political moment as a reflection of Prometheus’ insistence on hearing his curse
                against Jupiter: he wants – needs – to know that it’s dead. In this case it’s not
                ocular proof, as Othello demands of Desdemona’s alleged adultery, not the verbal
                sign of the words themselves, but the sound of their rage. In this sense the curse
                itself dies, but the affective resonance that sustains its utterance doesn’t. It
                thus falls to that transformational, even transmogrifying process to carry
                Prometheus, Asia, and Co., indeed the entire cosmos, toward their collective future.
                If elections are waged and won by emotion, then we see in <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound </hi>that sound literally as well as figuratively carries
                the day. The poem asks us to listen without prejudice, as if that is ever possible.
                For listening requires the implicit acknowledgement that we can never truly
                understand what we are listening for. I mean this in the sense of Glissant’s “right
                to opacity”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Glissant, 189.</note> against
                the illusions of transparency. So here's the rub: Shelley’s poem tells us how to
                listen, or at least <hi rend="italic">that </hi>we should listen, which makes of its
                fourth Act a staging of the act of listening itself, brought to a close only through
                the <hi rend="italic">deus ex machina </hi>of Demogorgon’s arrival. Beyond that,
                however, the poem doesn’t tell us what to listen <hi rend="italic">for</hi>.
                Confronted by the nothingness of sound from which meaning can or might or might not
                come, we are nonetheless compelled to speak again. Yet <hi rend="italic">what
                </hi>for? Or as I now imagine responding to my mother, “I hear you . . . I

                  <p>The opening sentences of one of the paradigmatic novels of German Romanticism,
                Novalis’ <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi> (1802), are infused with
                the rhythms of an unlikely dyad: the wind and the clock. The wind and the clock,
                working with and against one another, represent the initial conditions of a Romantic
                experiment in which a restless desire is awakened within the confines of the
                bourgeois household:
                
            <quote>The parents were already sleeping, the clock on the wall beat its monotonous tact,
                before the rattling windows whistled the wind; and the chamber was lit in
                alternation from the shimmer of the moon. The youth lay restless in his bed and
                recalled the stranger [<hi rend="italic">des Fremden</hi>] and his stories.<note place="foot" resp="author">

           What follows is well known to readers of German Romantic literature: the walls of the
                room dissolve into a phantasmagoria of infinite distances, oceanic depths, caves and
                cliffs, death and rebirth, dreams within dreams, and somehow, impossibly, a peculiar
                clarity and distinction, and then: the erotic blue flower, simultaneously woman and
                plant, sexuated and hermaphroditic. This room is no mere room, but a womb, a matrix
                of emergence for a way of feeling and thinking that is fundamentally alien, at odds
                with the intelligibility of everyday life. Heinrich, pondering his attraction to the
                blue flower, declares: “No one can and no one will understand this.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 1:195. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us linger with the wind and the clock in the first sentence. Caught up in a
                narrative momentum driven towards the oneiric revelation of the blue flower, it is
                easy to overlook the function of these initial objects as figures in an acoustic
                drama, or rather, as indices of a metaphysical drama in acoustic form. One is
                tempted to reduce these two objects, in traditional terms, to the function of
                setting—to background conditions against which an event takes place. Not only are
                wind and clock not mere background conditions; rather, they indicate privileged
                points of entry into the very metaphysical matrix of becoming from which entities
                emerge, the domain the Romantics and post-Kantian philosophers called the
                    <hi rend="italic">unconditioned </hi>(<hi rend="italic">das
                    Unbedingte</hi>): the absolute as that to which no conditions can be attached.
                While the window is typically a privileged speculative site, the opening onto a
                space at once visual and visionary, the first sensory organ to register the drama of
                the unconditioned in this instance is the ear.</p>
                  <p>Material vibrations, waves, oscillations, collisions—all taking place below the
                threshold of conscious perception—can be amplified in Romantic thought into
                larger-scale domains: from language to the soul, from acoustics to physiology, from
                wave oscillations to the modification of human sensuous capacities. In the words of
                a fragment from
                Novalis’<hi rend="italic"> Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia</hi>
                (1799): “Couldn’t every sculptural formation, from crystals up until man, be
                explained in an <hi rend="italic">acoustic manner</hi> by means of arrested
                    motion?”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia
                            (Das allgemeine Brouillon</hi>), trans. and
                            ed. David W. Wood (Albany: SUNY P, 2007), 56.</note> Novalis
                bases these upward scaling chains of sound figuration on “chemical acoustics.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, 56.</note> The designation is
                remarkable, not least because Novalis at times prioritizes chemical processes that
                tend toward form-dissolution, in line with the Romantic chemical quest for a
                universal solvent; the chemical principle “is contrary to the
                <hi rend="italic">figure-making </hi>principle—it destroys
                    figures.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, 45.</note> Chemical acoustics, if it
                is to function as a model of formation or figuration, must therefore counteract the
                tendency toward dissolution. As Daniel Lancereau writes, unstructured force requires
                constraints—what Novalis calls “inhibited motion”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 3:308.</note> (<hi rend="italic">gehemte Bewegung</hi>)—in order to become productive, to generate forms.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lancereau, Daniel B., “Leibniz, Novalis, Gödel. Balistique du romantisme allemande,” in 
                        <hi rend="italic">Arts et sciences du romantisme
                            allemande</hi>, eds. Daniel Lancereau and
                            Andre Stanguennec (Rennes: Presses Universitaires de Rennes, 2018),

                    </note> There nevertheless remains something intrinsically chaotic about
                processes of figuration grasped through chemical acoustics, where chaos is
                understood as the primordial (and non-sublatable) presence of unstructured force or
                non-directed motion. </p>
                  <p>The paradigm of acoustics thus elaborated indicates a vibrating and metastable
                ontological field—in the form of an oscillating material substratum—that can be
                scaled upward by Romantic thought and poetry as a symbolic resource to <hi rend="italic">uncondition</hi> forms of life. Unconditioning sound embeds
                entities in an infinite process of emergence that knows neither limit nor bound,
                thereby disrupting the material and normative conditions of existence that govern
                the intelligibility of everyday life. This essay examines paradigmatic instances of
                Romantic thought experiments with unconditioning sound: in the intersection between
                acoustic phenomena and the operations of the unconditioned absolute in Novalis’
                scientific and philosophical fragments; in <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von
                    Ofterdingen</hi>, where sound harnesses and sublimates violence and
                revolutionary energy while still maintaining a relation to the subterranean forces
                that constitute the source of this energy; in Schelling’s concept of sonority in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Music</hi>, which simultaneously celebrates the
                transgressive potential of rhythm just as it attempts to critique and delimit this
                potential; in naturephilosophical conceptions of sound as shock (Ørsted) and as an electrical virtuality of figuration
                (Ritter); in Eichendorff’s lyrical equation of contemplation with intoxication
                through the concept of rustling, <hi rend="italic">Rauschen</hi>;<note place="foot" resp="author"> The concept of rustling, <hi rend="italic">Rauschen</hi>, has been a central focus of research on Eichendorff; already Theodor Adorno had philosophically interpreted rustling as indicative of a distance from meaning—thus non-musical (in the idealistic sense of <hi rend="italic">meaningful</hi> tone)—and desubjectivized. See Theodor Adorno, <hi rend="italic">Notes to Literature</hi>, vol. 1, trans. Shierry Weber Nicholsen (New
                            York: Columbia UP, 1991), 68-69.</note> and finally, in E.T.A.
                Hoffmann’s electrical-musical aesthetics that does not posit an ineffable ideal as
                the telos of Romantic poiesis, but seeks to permanently hold the ideal at bay,
                indeed, to ontologically secure the irreducible gap between real and ideal as the
                basis for a diabolic and extra-normative generativity.</p>
                  <p>In each of these instances, sound constitutes a privileged site in which the
                potentially agonistic forces of the unconditioned can be intensified, harnessed, and
                redirected. In his philosophical fragments, Novalis posits the unconditioned as the
                endpoint of an impossible desire. The first of his fragments in the collection
                    <hi rend="italic">Pollen </hi>(<hi rend="italic">Blüthenstaub</hi>) reads: “We seek everywhere the unconditioned, and always
                find only things.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 2:413.</note> Thus, in the first
                sentence of <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>, the wind and the clock
                are <hi rend="italic">only things</hi>. At the same time, they are things of a
                special sort, as they disclose the desire for the unconditioned in their
                organization and disorganization of the sensible. The clock brings appearances into
                an acoustic schema of regularity and unity: it sounds in regular beats, in <hi rend="italic">tact</hi>, and its acoustic-formal principle is uniformity
                (monotony), in German, <hi rend="italic">einförmig</hi>. The acoustic-formal
                principle of the wind is stochastic; it does not beat, but swishes (<hi rend="italic">saust</hi>), rattling against the speculative frame (the window).
                The two objects represent two opposing paradigms of acoustic organization, although
                to a certain extent, they depend on one another: the stochastic noise of the wind
                appears as a disruption of the order and regularity of the clock, just as the beat
                of the clock (as tact) allows the chaotic energy of the wind to be registered.</p>
                  <p>If there is something like an absolute, then, it is to be found not in a thing (wind
                or clock), but in a circulation of desire between things, in the <hi rend="italic">unconditioning</hi> of symbolic bearers of ontological order, where
                unconditioning means: 1) the capacity to manifest a process of organization to which
                no condition or limit can be ascribed; 2) the incapacity of any singular thing to
                manifest this process absolutely. The clash or dissonance between these two
                percussive acoustic events, an oscillation between order and disorder, establishes
                the ontological field of the Romantic aesthetic experiment—an experiment that
                ultimately provides the framework in which the protagonist of the novel is propelled
                out of the normalizing constraints of bourgeois desire. </p>
                  <p>Significant is nevertheless that <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>
                opens with a sensorium operating at the level of base materiality: sound rather than
                sonority. The differentiation of sonority (<hi rend="italic">Klang</hi>) from sound
                    (<hi rend="italic">Schall</hi>) is one of the central conditions in the
                construction of sound as an epistemic phenomenon at this time; in Ernst Florens
                Friedrich Chladni’s <hi rend="italic">Discoveries in the Theory of Sound</hi>
                (1784), sonority emerges “when an elastic body makes simultaneous and audible
                    oscillations.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni,

                    </note> Through the simultaneity of oscillations, sound becomes sonority; in
                the case of the Chladni plate, drawing the bow of a violin makes dust particles
                strewn on surfaces settle into distinctive and multiple geometric patterns. The
                Chladni plate brings invisible processes of figuration into view: the figuration of
                figuration itself.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                  <p>Oscillation, even within the mechanical (elastic) paradigm articulated by Chladni
                (rather than the dynamic, force-based paradigm that would become central to
                Romanticism), constitutes a foundational operation of Romantic thought, a paradigm
                of movement simultaneously material, conceptual, and ontological. Oscillatory
                movements suffuse both mind and matter, bringing these domains into a zone of
                indifferentiation (the establishment of such indifference points between mind and
                matter constitutes one of the main operations of Romantic <hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie</hi>). In his studies on Fichte, for example, Novalis
                characterizes the back-and-forth swaying motion (<hi rend="italic">Schweben</hi>)
                between extremes—referring in this context to Fichte’s concept of the productive
                imagination—as “the source, the mother of all reality, reality itself.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                Oscillation, either in material acoustic form, as <hi rend="italic">Schwingung</hi>,
                or in its correlative form in consciousness, as <hi rend="italic">Schweben</hi>,
                represents an operation of fundamental ontology in Romantic thought. To approach
                reality through oscillation between extremes—i.e. between subject and object,
                regularity and disorder, clock and wind—is thus to approach the real immanently. At
                the same time, the real is inconsistent with itself, turns back upon itself; the
                movement of oscillation indexes this inconsistency.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        An important strand in scholarship on Novalis is
                            dedicated to the question of whether or not his concept of the real is
                            constitutive or merely regulative (a Kantian “idea of reason”); the
                            latter has been cogently defended in Manfred Frank,

                Novalis thus writes of an “acoustics of the soul,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, 186.</note> of “harmonious—and
                disharmonious vibrations.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, 186.</note> While Novalis (along with
                Johann Wilhelm Ritter) considers the word to be originally tone, he does not cast
                this primordial musicality of language as tantamount to a pure idealization of the
                word, linking it to something mystically ineffable or disembodied. On the contrary,
                primordial speech as tone sets into motion a physiological spiritualization: the
                surrounding air becomes a Chladni plate upon which the human breath calls forms (as
                words) into being. Novalis writes: “Vowels are strings of sound or <hi rend="italic">batons of air</hi>. The lungs are a <hi rend="italic">bow in motion</hi>.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, 36.</note> Novalis often associates
                the vowel with poetry (openness, floating) and the consonant with prose (limitation,
                retardation); the two working in tandem generate a higher-order poetic figuration,
                the poetry of poetry and prose, already prefigured physiologically in the manner in
                which human beings articulate sound. </p>
                  <p>Novalis also includes the deformation of acoustic matter—sounds with a diminished
                capacity for figuration—within his horizon of inquiry; the “inflexion of sound”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, 54.</note> [<hi rend="italic">Inflexion des Schalls</hi>] includes “<hi rend="italic">painful
                noise</hi>—scratching on a plate etc. Piercing sound.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> 54.</note>
                Such noise would not have been generative or figurative for Chladni, as it is not
                sonorous. Novalis is nevertheless attracted to the non-generative as an essential
                part of the aesthetic exercise; noise thus resurfaces at critical points in Romantic
                projects of transfiguration, and not merely as that which must be rejected, but as
                an expansion of aesthetic possibility. According to Bettine Menke, the Romantic
                paradigm destabilizes the dominant trajectories of western musical and poetic
                systems that ascend from sound to tone to speech, instead bringing hearers into a
                relation of “infinite approximation” to noise.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                wind and clock approaches acoustic phenomena in this manner, oscillating between an

                stochastic and noisy material substratum
                (<hi rend="italic">swishing </hi>and <hi rend="italic">rattling</hi>). However, the Romantic experiment of the novel goes farther than
                merely foregrounding the metaphysical and ontological significance of acoustic
                phenomena; it <hi rend="italic">amplifies</hi> this acoustic material, diffuses it
                in the very shape of the mythemes and forms of life in social and political

                physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter, acoustic symbols that stand in for absolute
                material dynamics can be led back to a more primordial substratum, a form of
                silence, whose adequate representation would require “nothing less than the

                facilitates processes of individuation (albeit, as we have seen, in a manner that
                depends upon processes of dissolution), expands into sensuous, poetic, and
                mathematical domains, ultimately providing the material basis for the
                world-transfiguring scope of poetry. Poetry, as that field of activity through which
                the “world must be romanticized,”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 2: 545.</note> invokes a vibrating
                multiplicity of encounters as integral to the construction of reality. Novalis
                writes: “Poetry [<hi rend="italic">Poësie</hi>] is the truly absolute real. This is

                operations of poetry and its disruptive, utopian energy. Novalis approaches
                oscillations, waves, and vibrations—which come into perceptual presence upon
                amplification—through a science of touch founded on the exploration of “active and
                passive tangents,”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                and multiple lines that radiate outward from contact with a curve. This geometry can

                unexpected encounters, each of which in turn can generate their own tangential
                radiations. </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>, as we have seen, begins with the
                acoustic problem of touch, of tact. The concept of tact (<hi rend="italic">Takt</hi>), according to Anders Engberg-Pedersen, encompasses two different
                paradigms of order in the Romantic period: an order of regularity, of arrangement
                (tact as <hi rend="italic">taxis</hi>); and a subjective inner sense deriving from
                the sense of touch (tact as <hi rend="italic">tangere</hi>).<note place="foot" resp="author">

                The clock at the outset of the narrative—already an ironic anachronism for a tale
                that takes place in the Middle Ages (an <hi rend="italic">ana-chronistic</hi>
                clock)—establishes a tact that monotonously individuates forms and thus is
                associated more with <hi rend="italic">taxis </hi>than <hi rend="italic">tangere</hi>. The ticking of the clock organizes acoustic material
                as something uni-form (<hi rend="italic">einförmig</hi>). One of the central
                problems of the novel confronts initial conditions that are uniform and seeks to
                differentiate them, to individuate in a way that multiplies difference. The
                condition of the clock, of regular time, of uni-formity, must be <hi rend="italic">unconditioned</hi>. </p>
                  <p>The novel disrupts the regularity of tact (<hi rend="italic">taxis</hi>) by exploring
                tangential notions of rhythm (<hi rend="italic">tangere</hi>), or rhythm as it spins
                off into unexpected directions in worldly encounters. It must be noted that Novalis
                sees the concept of world as imbricated with rhythm, as
                <hi rend="italic">essentially </hi>rhythmical: “If we take away
                the rhythm of the world—then the world also disappears.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> 57.</note>
                Poetry, which brings the world of thought into contact with “strange oscillations”

                uniformity of the world by excavating Orphic powers of figuration slumbering <hi rend="italic">in potentia</hi> in subterranean depths; it is precisely this

                  <p>The aestheticization of sound as <hi rend="italic">music</hi> gives rise to strange
                oscillations, or sound catastrophically amplified into other mediated forms,
                ultimately encompassing the totality of social, erotic, and political relations.
                Novalis explores these oscillations as part of an aesthetic experiment: how can one
                <hi rend="italic">de-form </hi>the world in such a way that new
                rhythms emerge? And where can one find an experimental space in which strange
                oscillations can reshape everyday life? </p>
                  <p>Novalis finds this space for the transfiguration of the rhythm of the world, and
                hence of the world itself, in the operations of the fairy tale.<note place="foot" resp="author">For Novalis’ fairy tale politics (<hi rend="italic">Märchenpolitik</hi>), see John Gill, <hi rend="italic">Wild Politics: Political

                <hi rend="italic">The Novices at Sais </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>)—the fairy tale punctuates the
                forward motion of narrative time, suspending the logic of the prosaic world and
                producing something dramatically different. In his theoretical writings, Novalis
                hints that the fairy tale can be approached acoustically. Novalis writes: “The fairy
                tale is entirely <hi rend="italic">musical</hi>.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> 174.</note>
                It is musical not merely thematically, as a form that privileges sound—when music is
                coaxed from a lyre and the fields of ice and the cliffs ring in resonant response
                (as happens in Klingohr’s fairy tale in <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von
                    Ofterdingen</hi>)—but musical in its very being, in the way it establishes
                contact with the vibration of the real before organized differentiation imposes
                order on the world. The musicality of the fairy tale indicates a world “devoid of
                all coherence,”<note place="foot" resp="author">Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> 171.</note>

                into sensuous form. Novalis writes: “Nothing is more contrary to the spirit of a
                fairy tale—than a moral destiny—a lawful relation.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> 158.</note>
                The fairy tale functions as a source of romanticizing practices inasmuch as it
                participates in an anarchic freedom prior to the differentiation of law; it is this
                participation in anarchic primordiality that facilitates the emergence of a future
                both generative and unpredictable (chaotic) as well as rational (as it has passed
                <hi rend="italic">through </hi>the law). The central function
                of the fairy tale is thus to establish a zone of indifference between reason and
                chaos that culminates in the potentiation of both domains (reason and chaos):
                “<hi rend="italic">rational </hi>chaos—chaos suffused with
                itself—inside and outside of itself—<hi rend="italic">chaos</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Such is the purpose of the fairy tale as described in Novalis’

                the fairy tale told by Klingsohr, seem to belie this theory. Commentators and
                critics have noted that the Klingsohr fairy tale in particular appears
                overdetermined, almost allegorical, consciously constructed and ultimately
                restorative in intent rather than anarchic and contingent.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Benjamin Specht, <hi rend="italic">Physik als Kunst: Die Poetisierung

                It seems to culminate in an order approximating a moral destiny. </p>
                  <p>Uncovering the chaotic substratum of the fairy tale demands an attentive ear, an ear
                attuned to conditions of emergence that fold the stability of an apparent
                <hi rend="italic">telos </hi>into a vortex of becoming.
                Attending to the musicality of the fairy tale can bring its latent anarchic dynamics
                into presence; submerged acoustic fields destabilize the operations of political
                restoration at the very moment in which they seem to reach their apotheosis. An
                exoteric (outwardly directed) reparation of the wounded political body is thus
                accompanied by an esoteric (internally present) process of unconditioning. </p>
                  <p>If the fairy tale is “entirely musical,” then the final note of Klingsohr’s fairy
                tale—and along with it, the telos of acoustic figuration—seems to re-establish the
                stability of monarchical governance after an explosion of revolutionary violence.
                The notoriously complex fairy tale unfolds through a series of crises that overturn
                domestic (familial) and political (monarchical) orders in an upheaval unleashed by
                subterranean forces, led by a figure known only as the Writer: a paradoxical figure
                inasmuch as he is equated in Novalis’ notes with the understanding (<hi rend="italic">der Verstand</hi>), although his revolutionary energy is
                conspicuously fueled by resentment and hatred (or perhaps this is not paradoxical,
                but historical: the sleep of reason produces monsters). The power of Fable,
                personified as the ostensible protagonist of the tale, overwhelms the subterranean
                forces (the Fates) led by the Writer and brings the tale to a close by weaving the
                previously wounded community together in a spinning song. The fairy tale ends with a
                scene of political rapprochement between a newly crowned monarchical pair and the
                multitude, each reconciled to the other through sympathetic resonance: after the
                king embraces [<hi rend="italic">umarmt</hi>] the queen, “one heard nothing except
                tender names and the whispering of kisses”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 1: 315.</note> circulate among the
                crowd. This scene of erotic reconciliation nevertheless conceals an esoteric
                symbolic and political revolution; the dynastic continuity of the monarchy has been
                contaminated by integrating a member of a lower order (<hi rend="italic">Eros</hi>,
                born from the domestic realm and transplanted into the astral, monarchical realm)
                into its chain of succession. Any political restoration is thus fundamentally
                impure. </p>
                  <p>The impurity of the final scene can also be deduced from its acoustic conditions; the
                purported symbolic fulfillment takes place in contact with sonic material that is
                more erotic noise than intelligible <hi rend="italic">logos</hi>. The emergence of
                the new political-social regime culminates in two different sonic modes at the end
                of the fairy tale: erotic whispering (<hi rend="italic">Kußgeflüster</hi>) and the
                spinning song. The disindividuated crowd is bound together by noise on the threshold
                of audibility (<hi rend="italic">Geflüster</hi>), while individuated symbolic
                figures (Fable, Sophie, Phoenix) stand out against this thrumming ground—in Fable’s
                case, as <hi rend="italic">song</hi> (organized sound) rather than <hi rend="italic">murmur</hi> (undifferentiated noise).<note place="foot" resp="author">The whispering or murmuring of the crowd represents an acoustic event appropriate to the transient appearance of an undifferentiated mass, gathered together (<hi rend="italic">Ge-flüster</hi>) momentarily in political-erotic union; while thus different in tonality than the romantic <hi rend="italic">murmur </hi>of English lyric—which, as Michele Speitz has argued in reference to Wordsworth’s poetry, indexes transience and loss even in its most purportedly ideal forms—the affect and its corresponding acoustic form captures and seeks to arrest a form of communal organization on the verge of transition into noise (chaos). See Michele Speitz, “The Wordsworthian Acoustic Imagination, Sonic Recursions, and ‘that dying murmur,’” <hi rend="italic">Studies in English Literature
                            1500-1900</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> 55:3</hi> (2015): 621-646.</note>
                Sonic modes at the end of the fairy tale thus correspond to a relation between
                individuated figure and a non-differentiated ground. However, Fable is not merely
                singing; she is also <hi rend="italic">spinning</hi>, generating social-symbolic
                threads. The threads that she spins are drawn from her own body; when a hero
                (Perseus) gives her the gift of a spindle in gratitude for this restoration of
                order, he exclaims: “In your hands this spindle shall make us eternally rejoice, and
                out of yourself you shall spin an unbreakable golden thread.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 1: 314.</note> Fable’s own being
                constitutes an inexhaustible energetic resource, ultimately realized in song.</p>
                  <p>Fable’s song sings of eternity and eternalization, of grounding, reconciliation, and
                an overcoming of the ephemerality of pain. However, at the moment of its
                enunciation, the song is accompanied by the rotary motion of the spindle:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Fable spun diligently and sang with a clear voice:</l>
                        <l>Founded (<hi rend="italic">gegründet</hi>) is the realm of eternity,</l>
                        <l>In love and peace conflict ends,</l>
                        <l>Gone the long dream of pain, </l>

                     </lg>
         
           The promise of reconciliation that takes place within the song cannot be isolated
                from the spinning source of its genesis, a source that folds all stabilizing
                operations of grounding into the gyrations of becoming. Spinning is, in a certain
                sense, Fable’s basic operation, and this final gesture must be considered
                motivically in relation to other instances of rotary motion, as repetitions or
                resignifications of these instances; earlier in the tale, Fable draws upon the
                spinning song as a source of (counter-) revolutionary violence, in the musical form
                of the tarantella: “During [Fable’s] song, from all sides, tarantulas appeared, they
                drew a shining net over the blades of grass, and they moved themselves to the beat
                    [<hi rend="italic">nach dem Takte</hi>] on their threads.... Her strings never
                rested, and the tarantulas followed the enchanting sounds on fast-woven
                    threads.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 1: 307.</note> In this instance,
                Fable’s song summons threads that transmit rhythms and micro-oscillations, making
                the world into a resonance chamber, one in which the slightest movement can be
                detected by the sensitive organs of the spider: the monotonous
                <hi rend="italic">tact </hi>of the clock at the beginning of
                the novel is thus transformed into a different regime of acoustic transmission in
                the fairy tale (the only other appearance of <hi rend="italic">Takt</hi> in the
                novel). This form of tact becomes a channel for a release of energy: a destructive
                tendency that must either exhaust itself (dissipate) or be sublimated into form. It
                is this latter function that Fable’s song seeks to realize.</p>
                  <p>In the discourse of tarantism, which was the subject of extensive debate in Diderot’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi>, for example, music played the role of a

                According to the account as popularized by Athanasius Kircher, the musical notes and
                the whirling bodies in the dance are supposed to counteract the poison coursing
                through the body. The tarantella of Fable’s song positions itself obliquely to this
                tradition. Fable’s spinning song does not seek to expel or dispel poison, but to
                conjure it forth and harness its power; Fable’s poetic activity revolves around an
                acoustically generated pharmakon that simultaneously wounds and heals. </p>
                  <p>Fable’s song ensnares the agents of revolutionary violence (the Fates, the Writer) in
                a web that they themselves bring about (it is in fact the Writer who demands the oil
                of the tarantulas in the first place as fuel for his revolutionary ambitions). Fable
                disarms the subterranean revolt by overwhelming them in the orgiastic rhythms of the
                tarantella: “[Fable’s] pursuers rushed impetuously into the web of the tarantulas,
                which took vengeance on them with innumerable bites. The whole crowd began to dance
                frantically, to which Fable played a merry tune.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 1: 308.</note> It is implied that the
                Writer is among these pursuers, or at least that the pursuers are his
                representatives; in any case, the Writer has become dis-individuated in the spinning
                of the dance. </p>
                  <p>Fable is thus responsible for two forms of spinning songs: the orgiastic-destructive
                song of tarantism, and the restorative song of the weaver. These songs are not
                oppositional, but complementary (or at least complementary in their oppositionality,
                a problem that Nietzsche would later seek to solve in
                <hi rend="italic">The Birth of Tragedy </hi>by reconciling
                Apollonian figuration with Dionysian dissolution). Novalis frames Romantic writing—a
                form of writing indicated by the ultimate fate of the Writer—in relation to these
                two primordial musical paradigms. It is significant that precisely at the moment in
                which Romantic writing fulfills its highest ambitions—as unconditioning writing—the
                Writer simply disappears (or seems to disappear) from the tale, a detail emphasized

                a transformation of writing has taken place, but it has become ubiquitous, absolute,
                atmospheric, everywhere visible and non-localizable. Indeed, the Writer has not been
                repressed, but unconditioned and <hi rend="italic">amplified</hi> into absolute
                song; the dissipation of revolutionary violence and the dis-individuation of its
                central figure (the figure of the Writer) becomes form-generating in the “merry
                tune” of Fable itself, woven by her spindle (rather than a weaving loom, which the
                Writer was supposed to become in Novalis’ notes). This possibility coheres with a
                central feature of Romantic poiesis: to extract a generative emergence from
                tendencies toward disindividuation and to channel chaotic energy back into form.</p>
                  <p>This pattern of Romantic poiesis can be found in other episodes in the fairy tale,
                for example, when the subterranean Fates, operating in league with the Writer, find
                themselves caught in the throes of the tarentella. The Fates are degraded to buzzing
                flies and finally consumed by the tarantulas; they are “sucked to the marrow.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 1: 309.</note> The Fates, however, do
                not dissipate into song, but crystallize, transforming into statues that appear at
                the end of the fairy tale as “caryatides of dark porphyry.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Novalis,<hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 1: 315.</note> In the words of the
                fairy tale, the “lifeless” Fates have been once again “ent-souled”;<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 1: 310.</note> they have been
                de-potentiated into inorganic matter. The depotentiation of something already
                depotentiated (the Fates as sheer non-productive, revolutionary rage) becomes the
                source of a genesis (negation of the negative as positive). The subterranean powers,
                now stabilizing structures, support the head of the marriage bed that will mark the
                consummation of the utopian scene of social and political reconciliation. However,
                the caryatides are not merely figures of stabilization; they integrate their
                previously chaotic power in such a way that the erotic stage is uplifted, now
                swaying in the air. The statues of the Fates, whose revolutionary energy has been
                brought to a standstill, set the erogenous zone of reconciliation (the bed) into
                relation with the ground, but in such a way that the ground itself is made to hover:
                “so that the earth floats once again and does not lie on chaos.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 1: 310.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Romantic unconditioning of the world—making the solidity of the earth sway in
                relation to chaotic forces of disruption held at a distance—takes place through the
                transformation of acoustic phenomena. Recall Novalis’ dictum that “sculpture is
                nothing else but the figuristics of music.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, 57.</note> In this transformation of
                subterranean and anarchic entities into sculptural figures, the solidity of the base
                is constructed by the waves, oscillations, and vibrations from which it grew. The
                movement of these originally acoustic vibrations has been arrested only partially,
                frozen in order to better bring the world into a hovering relation to the ground.
                Although the transformation of the Writer into a loom does not take place explicitly
                in the fairy tale, there remains nevertheless the spindle that gathers the threads
                of Fable’s own being as part of a new collective order. In the self-generation of
                this order, the spindle (<hi rend="italic">Spindel</hi>) spins, repeats the whirling
                dance, duplicates its movements. The Writer, if he is still a latent and invisible
                presence, has become a pure spinning movement—a tarantella of the
                understanding—accompanied by the song of a fable that holds itself swaying at a
                distance from the now subdued chaotic source, still drawing on its ineliminable and
                disruptive energy. </p>

                  <p>A significant source for the Romantic ontology of sound in relation to operations of
                absolute unconditioning can be found in Schelling’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of
                    Art</hi>. Based on notes from lectures that Schelling held twice (1802/3 and
                1804/5), the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi> formulates its central task as
                follows: “<hi rend="italic">the presentation in the ideal medium of the real element
                    inherent in art</hi>.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Friedrich Schelling, <hi rend="italic">The Philosophy of Art</hi>, ed. and trans. Douglas Stott (Minneapolis:

                describes as presentation in an “ideal medium” is nothing other than the generic
                definition of philosophy itself, one in which the absolute must be constructed.
                Construction—the name of the philosophical method Schelling utilizes in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>—brings what would otherwise remain as
                latent archetypal patterns into discursive presence.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                construct is not merely to represent, but to transform and transfigure the real; it
                produces a way of looking at entities (the real) as products of an infinite,
                absolute process, subject to a becoming without conditions. When regarded as such,
                objects are extracted from their local contexts of significance and recast as
                paradigms of ontological and cosmological form-generation: the philosophy of art
                does not analyze this or that work, but “<hi rend="italic">the universe in the form
                    of art</hi>.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 16.</note> A physics of art comes to

                  <p>What Schelling calls the “first dimension”<note place="foot" resp="author">Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 109.</note>—indeed, the beginning of
                the entire construction of the philosophy of art through which the materiality of
                the real expresses itself in the ideality of form—is that of
                    <hi rend="italic">sonority </hi>(<hi rend="italic">Klang</hi>). If music represents the “lowest” of the arts in the architectonics
                of Schelling’s construction, it is also closest to nature in its primordial state,
                to that first event through which “art breaks through into the world of
                    representation.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Schelling accordingly describes sonority as the maximal presentation of the real, of
                non-conscious matter, as registered within the world of sense and sentience: an
                exteriority that lies at the core of interiority, approximating what Lacan would
                call <hi rend="italic">extimacy</hi>. Schelling describes this concept of sonority,
                one in which the body/mind (real/ideal) distinction is simultaneously produced and
                suspended (in-differentiated), as the “intuition of the soul of the body
                    itself.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art, 108.</hi>
                     </note> Sonority is the form
                through which the body manifests itself as a necessary ontological zone of
                emergence, hence as <hi rend="italic">soul </hi>of the body. </p>
                  <p>The soul here does not belong to a subject, but designates an impersonal process of
                idealization. As such, music, which emerges from sonority, is not an art particular
                to human beings; indeed, music does not require humanity for its realization. Music
                belongs to the cosmos, even in its inorganic forms. The ear, then, becomes a
                privileged (and paradoxical) organ of the inorganic, or that part of the human being
                most consonant with inorganic modes of appearance. Schelling writes: “the roots of
                the sense of hearing reside within anorganic nature, within magnetism. The hearing
                organ itself is merely magnetism that has developed to organic perfection.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 109.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Schelling’s notion of the ear as a magnetic organ is predicated upon a paradigm shift
                from mechanistic to dynamic theories of hearing; Chladni, for example, linked the
                form-generation made visible on plates to oscillating elasticity (and hence
                mechanics) rather than the play of forces (dynamics). The dynamic theory of hearing
                as it surfaces in the
                <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art </hi>had been prepared by
                Schelling’s earlier works of naturephilosophy (<hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie</hi>).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        For Schelling as an innovator in the conceptualization of sound through dynamics rather than mechanics, see Steven P. Lydon, “Signatura rerum: Chladni’s Sound Figures in Schelling, August Schlegel, and Brentano,” <hi rend="italic">The Germanic

                the central problem of nature itself: nature as it steps out of static equilibrium,
                out of a condition of absolute rest, and into movement and productivity. Ian Biddle,
                drawing on Schelling’s earlier naturephilosophical texts, ascribes a disruptive and
                ungrounding force to the magnetism of the ear in this section of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, since magnetism occupies a “dark corner of
                the system” of naturephilosophy that Schelling sometimes seems to approach with
                    uncertainty.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                do not merely hear the simple tone itself. Rather, we hear clothed, as it were, or
                imbedded in it a whole array of tones, and we hear them such that the consonant ones
                predominate, instead of the dissonant ones.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                self-affirmation of nature as an infinite process; the oppositional account of
                individuation characteristic of Schelling’s earlier naturephilosophy (individuated
                forms as emergent from a disequilibrium in a conflict of forces, or form as indexing
                the aberrant nature of appearances) has been supplanted in favor of the affirmative
                account of individuation characteristic of his later identity philosophy
                (individuated forms as emergent from the desire of nature to affirm itself).<note place="foot" resp="author">

                  <p>The residue of an agonistic and dissonant ontology of individuation can nevertheless
                still be detected in Schelling’s account of sound. Uncovering this residue requires
                a closer examination of the distinction between two concepts of sound used by
                Schelling: <hi rend="italic">resonance </hi>(<hi rend="italic">Schall</hi>) and <hi rend="italic">sonority </hi>(<hi rend="italic">Klang</hi>). Resonance (<hi rend="italic">Schall</hi>) designates
                the generic operation of sound generation, and dissonance belongs essentially to one
                of its possibilities. A body resonates when it conducts (“all resonance... is
                    conduction”<note place="foot" resp="author">Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 108.</note>). Resonance [<hi rend="italic">Schall</hi>] manifests itself as noise when it generates acoustic
                data that disintegrate into incoherence, when “sound does not allow the unity in
                multiplicity to be recognized clearly.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi> 108.</note> Sonority supersedes this
                entropic pull toward disintegration through its power of internal coherence, in
                which case multiplicity discloses itself as “a multiplicity that affirms
                    itself.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 108.</note> However, at the most
                primordial level of individuation, resonance—or the power by which sound can reach
                out and touch each thing (as something <hi rend="italic">conducted</hi>)—constitutes
                a field in which both dissonance and affirmation, incommensurable multiplicity and
                harmonious cohesion, are contained as latent possibilities. </p>
                  <p>Starting from sound as the presentation of the inorganic within the organic,
                Schelling constructs a series of bifurcations in which the dissonance of the real is
                progressively filtered out: from resonance (in which dissonance still inheres as a
                possibility); to sonority (in which consonance is generated and overcomes a
                still-present dissonance); to music (in which consonance becomes a symbolic
                generator, “potence and symbol”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 109.</note> of the absolute producing
                itself through rhythm, harmony, and melody). Music, as symbol of the absolute,
                becomes that form in which the generative dynamic of the absolute in the modality of
                the real—productive material unconditioning—is brought into sensuous presence. The
                progressive transfiguration of sound into sonority and then music corresponds to an
                increase in the mythopoetic generativity of sound, or sound as a thought experiment
                connected to other domains of existence: cosmological, religious, political. </p>
                  <p>Absolute sound, in the form of music, is propulsive; in its most basic symbolic form,
                it is more rhythmic than harmonious. Schelling thus describes rhythm as “the music
                within music,”<note place="foot" resp="author">Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 111.</note> calling rhythm the
                “predominating potence in music,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 112.</note> which distills the
                function of music to its fundamental operation: to generate enough regularity to
                recognize units, or discrete elements appearing
                <hi rend="italic">as </hi>discrete elements; but also to
                generate enough multiplicity and variety such that these units of sound never become
                monotonous and are constantly producing difference. As the sensuous manifestation
                that most closely brushes up against the contingency of sheer givenness, rhythm
                models the breakthrough of sense from non-sense, “the transformation of an
                essentially meaningless succession into a meaningful one.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 112.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A close examination of the specifically naturephilosophical aesthetics of music,
                however, reveals that the symbolic dimension of music—or music as <hi rend="italic">unconditioning</hi> sound—is more expansive than stabilizing, more productive
                of difference than of unity. Music is not limited to the human arts; drawing on
                Pythagoras, Schelling notes that cosmic bodies (planets, stars) are ontologically
                homologous with music: not inasmuch as they produce music in their spinning, but
                inasmuch as they <hi rend="italic">are </hi>music in their very
                manner of being, in the forces with which they are identical. Schelling writes: “The
                cosmic bodies float on the wings of harmony and rhythm. That which one calls
                centripetal and centrifugal force is nothing other than harmony and rhythm,
                respectively. Elevated by the same wings, music floats in space to weave an audible
                universe from the transparent body of sound and tone.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi> 117.</note> Rhythm is thus <hi rend="italic">naturalized</hi>—belonging to nature as self-producing process
                (rather than in the sense of being taken as self-evident)—as force. Schelling
                associates rhythm in particular with centrifugal force, or an expansiveness that in
                naturephilosophical terms corresponds to an overcoming of boundaries. Schelling
                correlates harmony with centripetal force, or the yearning for coherence, translated
                into sound. When Schelling claims that the predominating potence of music is
                rhythm—that rhythm is the music within music—he thus locates the specific force of
                music in a propulsive energetics. </p>
                  <p>Music—its generative and propulsive force—will be everywhere present, latent in every
                being, in every form of art and in every movement of discourse. Music also inheres
                in political and collective bodies; or rather, collective bodies disclose their
                internal tendencies musically. Every gathering of human beings produces a musical
                form that expresses its inner tendencies. Music that is predominantly harmonic
                rather than rhythmic, as the “expression of striving and yearning,”<note place="foot" resp="foot"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 115.</note> tends toward restorative
                collective forms, exemplified above all by the Church, which produces a “striving to
                view oneself within the absolute as one with everyone else.”<note place="foot" resp="foot"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 115.</note> Schelling associates
                harmonic tendencies—best exemplified in polyphonic sacred music—with a yearning for
                coherence that can be devitalizing and contractive. In contrast to the music of the
                Church, that of the Greek polis is rhythmical and expansive: “one in which a pure
                collectivity, the species or type itself, had developed completely into a particular
                unto itself and <hi rend="italic">was </hi>that

                <hi rend="italic">music </hi>of the Greek polis is expressed as
                energetic, daring, productive of multiplicity, as “the expression of satisfaction
                and of vigorous passion.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 115.</note> In a culture of modernity
                predominantly characterized by harmony (which seeks the center and is restorative),
                Schelling seeks to cultivate an ear attuned to the rhythms of antiquity (which flees
                the center and is energetic) to awaken a countertendency of expansive force in
                musical form.</p>
                  <p>Schelling’s philosophy of music thereby harnesses a primordial tendency toward
                difference and multiplicity in a form of art (music) that stands in for the event of
                art itself, for the breakthrough of meaning against a background of meaninglessness.
                The emergence of art is characterized by a fundamental ambivalence. It brings to the
                surface a dissonant and incomprehensible real only to suppress this form of the real
                through progressive potentiation (resonance, sonority, music). At the same time,
                sound comprises the central medium through which the momentum of centrifugality—a
                transgressive and difference-generating expansion—achieves symbolic elevation,
                seeping into material and discursive forms. Philosophical construction itself, in
                its production of the absolute, must also be rhythmic in this manner. Novalis writes
                in reference to Fichte: “Fichte has done nothing else than discover the rhythm of
                philosophy, and expressed it in a verbal acoustic manner.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, 57.</note> While the expansive
                momentum of rhythmic antiquity could function as an antidote to the overwhelmingly
                stabilizing harmonic collective forms of modernity (the
                <hi rend="italic">polis </hi>as counterforce to the Church;
                Nietzsche would take this insight further in <hi rend="italic">The Birth of
                    Tragedy</hi>), another speculative possibility can be drawn from Schelling’s
                philosophy of music: a collective form whose musical expression would produce a
                harmonic and centripetal counterforce capable of counteracting the violent potential
                in the expansive and assimilative propulsion of rhythm, but without producing an
                overcontraction into homogeneous communal groupings. The form of the collective that
                could or would produce such music as an ontological expression of its internal
                tendencies remains unthematized by Schelling. Such would be the unspoken melodic
                (equally rhythmic <hi rend="italic">and </hi>harmonic) utopian
                form of Schelling’s philosophy of music. </p>

                  <p>The shift from a mechanical to a dynamic concept of sound—from wave oscillation
                produced through the collision and elasticity of bodies (Chladni) to oscillation as
                a result of magnetic or electrical forces (Ritter and 
                    Ørsted)—enlarges the field of auditory sensibility as well as the
                discursive and aesthetic potentiality of sound. Central to this expansion of
                possibilities in the idea of electrical acoustics is the phenomenon of shock. For
                Hans Christian
                Ørsted, sound generated by contact gives rise to a mechanical-dynamic feedback loop of shock intensification through electricity: 
                
            <quote>The compression and the consequent expansion which take place in every soundwave
                produce ... [an] electrical alternation. Such an alternation between electrical
                states must also take place in the ear, but each transition from one electrical
                state to another produces a shock, however weak it may be. Each sound is accompanied
                by a great many such shocks one following the other.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Hans Christian Ørsted, “Experiments on Acoustic Figures (1810),” in <hi rend="italic">Selected Scientific

            The constant intensification of shock infinitely stimulates
                    the ear; the ear expands the domain of sensibility by virtue of the
                    imperceptible shocks that it constantly receives, as “frequent alternation

           The figure-generating potentiality of tone—which locates the generation of form at
                the event of excitation itself rather than as the result of an excitation—becomes at
                one and the same time a natural ontological ground as well as a domain to which the
                human being can relate itself as it would to a foreign daemonic power. The
                figurative power of tone, once it is scaled upwards into other domains, enters into
                proximity (if not identity) with human beings themselves and simultaneously
                indicates a power external to them: as human consciousness

                acoustic domain into speculative horizons of subjective, erotic, political and
                religious experimentation, Ritter and Ørsted transform the
                    nature of hearing itself, which thenceforth exposes the human being to capacious
                    and experimental ways of being in the world: as the transcendence of shock for
                    Ørsted, or as the continuous electrical production of shapes and figures for
                    Ritter.</p>
                  <p>Romantic lyric and narrative forms, albeit with different resources at their disposal, equally explore the ramifications of unconditioning sound. One of the most prominent examples of this experimental practice can be found in the lyric of Joseph von Eichendorff. An early poem composed by Eichendorff in 1808 (“Sestime”) constructs a conceptual Romantic sixfold—flowing, rustling, dreams, sky, stars, songs—in the repeating, shifting constellation dictated by the form of the sestina. Eichendorff’s “Sestime” is modeled on the medieval sestina, a form in which words at the ends of lines are repeated according to a system of rules (the last end-word of one stanza becomes the first end-word of the following one; the first end-word becomes the second end-word in the next stanza; and so forth). In a reading of Arnaut Daniel’s sestina “Lo ferm voler qu’el cor m’intra,” Giorgio Agamben claims that the sestina (and lyric more generally) discloses a different form of temporality than that of everyday succession or progression: messianic time, “the time that the poem takes to come to an end,”<note place="foot" resp="author">Giorgio Agamben, <hi rend="italic">The Time that Remains: A Commentary

                as manifested in the particular temporal lyric constellations structured by recall and anticipation. </p>
                  <p>If Eichendorff’s sestina, like Arnaut’s, participates in this constellated temporality, it nevertheless virtualizes the nesting of temporal echoes such that the very notion of an end is retemporalized, or temporalized beyond its internal system of correspondences, beyond the resonant unfolding of end-words in anticipation and remembrance. In Eichendorff’s sestina, lyric temporality oscillates between a singular punctuation of time, the repetition of a succession, and the index of an eternal nunc stans: “Always
                    will I be kneeling under this sky / That with eternal Lent seeks to flow to
                    me.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                At the precise moment when the most sonically
                    overdetermined end-word of Eichendorff’s poem—the sheer noise of rustling
                    (Rauschen),
                    which already implicitly includes intoxication (Rausch) within
                    it—becomes more explicitly associated with inebriation (Berauschen), Eichendorff collapses the abstract contemplation of beauty and ecstatic unknowing:

            Eichendorff, often accused of using formulas, repetitions
                    and generalities to the point where meaning becomes incidental to the lyric act,
                    does not so much evacuate semantic and conceptual determinacy as place it on a
                    continuum with the musical rustling of things.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Eichendorff’s lyric thus approaches what Barthes describes as follows: “language would not thereby abandon a horizon of meaning: meaning, undivided, impenetrable, unnamable, would however be posited in the distance like a mirage, making the vocal exercise into a double landscape, furnished with a ‘background’; but instead of the music of the phonemes being the ‘background’ of our messages (as happens in our poetry), meaning would now be the vanishing point of delectation.” Roland Barthes, “The Rustle of Language,” in <hi rend="italic">The Rustle of Language,</hi> trans. Richard Howard (Oxford: Basil Blackwell,
                            1986), 78. </note>
                If, however, for Schelling, music (qua rhythm) represents
                    the “transformation of an essentially meaningless succession into a
                meaningful one,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 112.</note> Eichendorff makes sonorous
                transformation in the context of the lyric into a reversible oscillation, one in
                which the lyric act can be rhythmically de-semanticized and conceptually
                re-semanticized. </p>
                  <p>Eichendorff’s lyric semantically potentiates and depotentiates itself at every
                moment: stars, moons, and flowers can be imaginatively called forth in their
                conceptual referentiality, just as they can tend toward rhythm—although never
                <hi rend="italic">pure </hi>rhythm, since some conceptuality
                will remain, at least as a residue. In a peculiar inversion, it is the
                <hi rend="italic">concept </hi>that constitutes the
                ineliminable remainder of Eichendroff’s lyric rather than noise; the concept (or
                semantic determinacy) forms the background against which noise emerges, rather than
                the other way around. In the sestina, Eichendorff couples
                    the philosophical ideal of the concept (i.e. the intellectual contemplation of
                    forms) with an ecstatic loss of awareness—bringing contemplation and rapture
                    into a zone of indistinction—at the precise instance in which the strict
                    identity of the sestina’s form is loosened, when intoxication (
                    Berauschen: more precisely, the infinitive as substantive, and thus the act of intoxicating made into a concept) supplants rustling (rauschen: gazing at the sweet intoxication of such beauty(Betrachtend solcher
                    Schöne süß’ Berauschen). When
                    rustling becomes inebriation, rauschen becomes Berauschen, it is not beauty in its eternal form that is contemplated, but rather, its intoxicating effect. The purely formal-intellectual nature of beauty is thus unconditioned by sensuous, semantic and phonic displacements in the shift from rauschen to berauschen.</p>
                  <p>If Eichendorff’s lyric experimentation with unconditioning
                    sound nevertheless maintains itself in orbit around the ideal, a divergent and
                    more perverse form of acoustic unconditioning can be found in the work of E.T.A.
                    Hoffmann, himself a composer and known for his characterization of Beethoven’s
                    music as the “the realm of the tragic and illimitable.”

                        Quarterly</hi> 3.1 (1917): 128. The final paradigm of unconditioning sound considered here concerns his novella The Fermata, a work in
                    which Hoffmann does not ascend to the ineffability of music, but descends into
                    its molecular and material basis in order to conjure forth its deviant power.
                    The narrative experiment begins, as in Novalis’
                Heinrich von Ofterdingen, in a sort of crucible, in the confinement of a provincial
                    town, where every “foreign appearance”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                (Zauberschlag), using musical polarities to jolt him out of a complacent fit with his normative system up until that point. The two musicians make the narrator into a conductor for an electrical (simultaneously musical and erotic) current passing back and forth, alternating between aesthetic paradigms as if between the plus and minus of a voltaic pile: Lauretta and Teresina (the two musicians), representing respectively artifice and nature, ornament and simplicity, surface and depth, opera buffa and tragic opera. Each of these will, and each in their turn, embody an ideal that produces an aesthetic attunement to the world for the narrator. However, the story does not establish the ideal and fix it in place. On the contrary, it describes the means whereby the ideal (or the vacillation between multiple ideals) is perpetually dislodged; it discharges
                singular entities or beings as bearers of symbolic significance. What comes to light in Hoffmann’s tale, then, is the disruption of the ideal as a new, second-order concept of ontological
                    order.</p>
                  <p>The discharging of the ideal takes place at a moment of
                    particular temporal significance in the story indicated by the title: in the
                    fermata. The fermata is not just a motif, but an ontological operation, indeed,
                    a space of religious redemption; in the fermata, a woman is represented as
                    singing a cadenza “with a gaze directed towards the heavens.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Hoffmann, <hi rend="italic">Die Serapions-Brüder</hi>, 72.</note>
                Following Agamben’s suggestion in his analysis of the sestina’s messianic time, the thrust of time in the fermata seems teleologically laden as it moves towards its end, a moment of fulfillment when regular temporality, a
                    tempo, is restored and the orchestra—the tutti, all individuals as a collective form—rejoins the individual. </p>
                  <p>However, in the redemptive momentum of the fermata there lies a significant potential for deviation, and it is this disruptive power that fascinates Hoffmann. If, for Schelling, rhythm is the music of music and hence the means by which it produces itself as the absolute, the function of the fermata is to suspend rhythmic regularity and predictability: it places the beat (tact) in abeyance, pausing and extending the flow of time in such a way that unexpected sound figures come into appearance. The fermata—above all in the context of the narrative—makes possible a space of individuation outside the dictates of the collective (the orchestral tutti) and a temporality outside universal time (it is not a
                    tempo). Drawing on the etymology of the fermata from fermare: it stops the beat. </p>
                  <p>The threshold signaling the restoration of temporal and collective order is generally marked by the trill of the soloist, at which point the conductor must guide the orchestra to enter at precisely the right moment, in the <hi rend="italic">kairos</hi> of a temporal suspension brought to fulfillment. Hoffmann’s
                    narrative reflects this logic: the trill anticipating the end of the fermata is
                    described as the “highest moment,” the one “that would set everyone into
                    amazement [<hi rend="italic">staunen</hi>].”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Hoffmann, <hi rend="italic">Die Serapions-Brüder</hi>, 83.</note>
                The trill is a significant symbolic operator; in the
                    context of the naturephilosophical materialism of sound, the trill is nothing
                    other than the explicit enactment of the structure of sound itself as
                    oscillation. The latent ontological dynamic of sound—what Ørsted grasped as
                    continually alternating electrical shocks in rapid succession between
                    polarities—finds its most apt representational form in the trill. The
                    restoration of order, the moment when suspended time is supposed to rejoin
                    regular time, occurs in tandem with the symbolization of sound in its basic
                    ontological structure.</p>
                  <p>In the work of Hoffmann, however, it is messianic time that must be disrupted at all costs. Everything must go wrong. The scene is described as follows, described from the perspective of the narrator who is accompanying the soloist (Lauretta) as she intends to bring her cadenza to a conclusion in the fermata: 
            <quote>We came to the last <hi rend="italic"> fermata</hi>. Lauretta exerted all her skill and art; she warbled trill after trill like a nightingale, executed sustained notes, then long elaborate roulades—a whole <hi rend="italic">solfeggio</hi>. In fact, I thought she was almost carrying the thing too far this time; I felt a soft breath on my cheek; Teresina stood behind me. At this moment Lauretta took a good start with the intention of swelling up to a ‘harmonic shake’ and so passing back into <hi rend="italic">a tempo.</hi> The devil entered into me; I jammed down the keys with both
                    hands; the orchestra followed suit; and it was all over with Lauretta’s trill,
                    just at the supreme moment when she was to excite everyone’s
                    astonishment.<note place="foot" resp="author"> E.T.A. Hoffmann, “The Fermata,” <hi rend="italic">Weird Tales by E.T.A.

                  </p>
                  <p>If the trill is nothing other than the order of sound made explicit, another type of oscillation comes to the foreground in this scene: the moment at which one figure of symbolic mediation falls out of ideality and is transferred to another. In the wake of this event, an erotic and aesthetic transference takes place in the narrator from Lauretta to Teresina; Teresina appears at the precise moment of disruption and is thus correlated with the interruption of the auspicious moment, the misfire of the <hi rend="italic">kairos</hi>. What is
                    eternalized and made generative in Hoffmann’s tale is precisely not the
                    restoration of order as the supreme aesthetic moment, but the interruption that
                    makes this second-order deviant oscillation of things into the very source of
                    aesthetic power. In accordance with an ontology in which the ideal itself must
                    be made present only in order to be deposed—discharged so that another charge
                    can take its place—Teresina too will fall out of ideality, as will, perhaps, the
                    narrator himself.</p>
                  <p>The fermata—and its disruption—repeats itself in different forms, different mediated channels, throughout the narrative. It becomes its own aesthetic-ontological archetype and is infinitely generative, disclosing an absolute process of signification. It can be found in the painting <hi rend="italic">The Fermata </hi>(1814) by Johann Erdmann Hummel, the viewing of which is the occasion for telling the tale itself (the fermata thus produces the tale of its own production, <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi>).<note place="foot"> The narrator sees the painting and recognizes in the representation a scene that took place in his own life.</note> 
                Moreover, the paining, through the representation of yet <hi rend="italic">another</hi> fermata diabolically ruined, fixes this failure in place—making the interruption of the fermata into a second-order fermata by extending its temporal scope into eternity. Visually fixed in place, the fermata can never be brought to completion. When the painting appears in the story, it too conducts an electrical charge, striking its viewer with yet another magic blow, a <hi rend="italic">Zauberschlag</hi>. The
                    electrical conduction of this charge is the primary purpose of Hoffmann’s
                    fermata, both within the story and as the story itself. The burst of energy
                    released in the failure of the redemptive moment is not traumatic, but the
                    condition itself of a form of unconditioning art—an art that nourishes itself
                    not from the presence of the ideal, but from its malfunction.</p>
                  <p>For significant strands of the German Romantic tradition, sound discloses fundamental ontology as an oscillation of the real, the real <hi rend="italic">as</hi> oscillation: a trembling of things that moves through all
                    individuated forms, material and spiritual. In their speculative philosophical
                    and aesthetic experiments with sound, the most intimate experiences of the world
                    become the most alien. It is not just that sound indicates the absolute as that
                    which is unconditioned, but that it constructs the real as a material-ideal
                    system in the process of turning against itself, moving amidst the peaks and
                    troughs of waves, perpetually unconditioning itself and carrying all beings
                    along in its wake. When Novalis develops chemical acoustics as a power of
                    figuration dependent upon the inhibition of the tendency toward dissolution;
                    when he seeks in the music of the fairy tale a vertiginous art capable of
                    creating a semi-stable, hovering relation to a chaotic ground; when Schelling
                    claims a power of affirmation over negation in the potentiation of sound from
                    noise to sonority to music, culminating in the manner in which collectives
                    produce musical forms—<hi rend="italic">are</hi> themselves musical forms—that reveal their internal developmental tendencies; when Ørsted grasps sound as the perpetuation of a continually intensifying shock; when Ritter understands tone as electrical figuration (nature writing itself) moving through human consciousness in a manner that is foreign to it; when Eichendorff posits a field of rustling intoxication (<hi rend="italic">Rauschen</hi>
                / <hi rend="italic">Berauschen</hi>) that oscillates between noise and concept, intoxication and intellection; and when Hoffmann develops an electrical aesthetics to maintain beings in a constant state of perverse non-identity with the ideal—we see that it is not sufficient for the German Romantics to describe sound and its material or ideal basis; rather, the latent dynamics emergent from the speculative and aesthetic encounter with sound must be redirected back into the world: as an art of unconditioning. </p>
