            <p>In the early lines of “Frost at Midnight,” Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s speaker asks the
                reader to listen with him. His brief description of “the owlet’s cry” which “came
                    loud”<note place="foot" resp="author">Samuel Taylor Coleridge, <hi
                        rend="italic">Samuel Taylor Coleridge: The Major Works</hi>, ed. H. J.

                    2008).</note>at some unspecified point anterior to the listening moment is
                interrupted by the cry itself: “—and hark, again! loud as before.”<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., line 3.</note>(3). However, while its
                interruptive presence primes the reader to attend to sound, it is not this piercing
                cry which dominates the first stanza; instead, our attention is turned to the
                quietness it throws into relief. The speaker registers the strangeness of the
                evening’s “extreme silentness”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., line
                    10.</note>against the momentarily imperceptible din of “all the numberless
                goings on of life.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., line
                12.</note>Yet the silence in the cottage is not emptiness. The speaker
                self-consciously implies that those sounding things and bodies must still be
                somewhere stirring airwaves even while his human ear finds them “Inaudible as
                    dreams.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., line 13.</note>What’s
                more, their ‘vexing’ inaudibility seems to prompt him to listen more closely into
                the silence for signs of life nearby. He soon entrains himself to “the sole unquiet
                thing,” the “film” that “still flutters” on the grate.<note 
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., lines 15-16.</note>Whether the speaker actually <hi
                    rend="italic">hears</hi> the film’s flutters is indeterminate at best, but the
                possibility that its unquietness has not only to do with visible motion but with
                motion-as-soundwaves is extremely suggestive. Faced with what he otherwise perceives
                as a calm so profound that it “disturbs / And vexes meditation,”<note 
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., lines 8-9.</note>the speaker becomes attuned
                    multisensorially<note place="foot" resp="author"> Romantic audition
                    almost never occurs in complete isolation from the other senses, and it is very
                    often paired with sight (particularly in Wordsworth). In instances in which the
                    senses are more emphatically intertwined without being conflated with one
                    another (as in synaesthesia), I find the term ‘multisensorial’ to effectively
                    suggest a heightened awareness of multiple dimensions of embodied sensation.

                    seems to acknowledge that absolute silence (and, as such, absolute individual
                    seclusion) is an impossibility; as long as the subject is situated in a world
                    with energy and other bodies, the air will always be filled with sound vibration
                    and there will always be some noise.</p>
                
            <p>This essay posits an ‘unquiet’ Romanticism. I examine a
                    category of sonic moments in Romantic poetry in which the limits of audition are
                    stretched to acknowledge not only what and how we hear but also the significance
                    of sounds so low-decibel as to render the idea that they could be audible almost
                    absurd. The unlikeliness that Coleridge actually means the event of his
                perception of the film to be a clear case of audition, strictly speaking, is
                    precisely why I have chosen to begin this essay with
                    the example of “Frost at Midnight,” which I would hazard to call a less
                    obviously sonic poem than many I could have chosen. Dwelling on the film’s
                flutter as a sonic event accomplishes a few things that are central to this essay:
                1. It foregrounds sound’s radical materiality as a concept I argue was more
                ubiquitous in the Romantic intellectual milieu than has tended to be acknowledged,
                2. It explores the specific affordances of ‘unquiet’ noise as a generative category
                of sound, and 3. It toggles between sensory experience and the disembodied
                imagination, and therefore gets at quintessentially Romantic questions surrounding
                phenomenal experience and the creative subject. </p>

                    many others, Wolfson places particular emphasis on William Wordsworth’s ear, but
                    she also highlights Coleridge’s deep interest in sound. See Susan J. Wolfson,

                    https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-35973-1_795. By starting with such a quiet
                    moment in Coleridge, I hope to search beneath the sounds that tend to catch our
                    attention in order to understand Romantic writing as more sonically rich than we
                    have tended to appreciate.</note>and certainly not
                    short on noises that fit this category, I will limit my reading here to a few
                    prime examples of ‘quiet’ things made ‘unquiet’ in poetry of the period. In each
                    case, the Romantic power of the imagination is made resonant with material sound
                    objects that elude its absolute grasp. These sounds often emerge into the field
                    of hearing such that they seem always to have been there awaiting perception,
                    their temporal and spatial indeterminacy contributing an abstract type of
                    vastness and raising questions about perception, receptivity, and attention, as
                    the listener oscillates between agential attunement and induced receptivity. In
                    these passages, expansive movements of the mind prompted by even the gentlest
                    sonic vibrations blur the lines between pleasure and fearful awe, and between
                    imaginative empowerment and vulnerability. They
                    likewise expand the boundaries of aesthetic categories of sublimity and beauty
                    to encompass qualities of disorganization not traditionally regarded as properly
                    aesthetic at all. Such ‘unquiet’ sounds draw attention to a material
                    understanding of acoustics that would become increasingly popularized throughout
                    the nineteenth century. They represent silence and quietness as sensorially
                potent and listening as an emphatically embodied perceptive mode which nonetheless
                involves the imagination in a process of knowledge production centered on
                self-conscious subjectivity. As sound theorist Salome Voegelin writes, “Sound
                narrates, outlines and fills, but it is always ephemeral and doubtful. Between my
                heard and the sonic object/phenomenon I will never know its truth but can only
                invent it, producing a knowing for me.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                and Nancy, I suggest that for the Romantics, listening to unquiet noise is often
                both an active ‘straining’ to place oneself as a creative agent in relation to the
                world and—somewhat paradoxically—a compelled state of receptive embodiment. In their
                approaches to quietly noisy sounds that refuse absolute
                    epistemological or symbolic stability, the examples I explore thus suggest
                a gray area between a solitary Romantic subjectivity
                    dependent on the strength of the autonomous
                    imagination and a (just as fundamentally Romantic) sensorially contingent

                studies, centers on modernity’s transition from a pre-industrial “hi-fi” soundscape
                to a “lo-fi” soundscape in which individual sounds are more difficult to distinguish
                from a higher density of ambient sound. Schafer focuses on environmental and
                humanist concern for how our ability to gather information (and, indeed, pleasure)
                from our acoustic environment has degraded with the proliferation of noise
                pollution. The discourse surrounding silence and noise to which I wish to attend,
                however, concerns itself with an awareness that true, absolute silence has never
                existed. It explores noise not as a one-dimensionally overwhelming, distracting or
                painful thing, but rather as an ambiguous, sometimes baffling, and sometimes
                imaginatively provocative presence. </p>
                
            <p>Coleridge’s fluttering film, the residue of a coal fire, encodes a relationship to
                industry and an associated atmosphere of urban loudness, so that the “numberless
                goings on of life / Inaudible as dreams,” and consequently contexts of social,

                quietness. But it is also invoked in the poem in the context of nostalgia and
                anticipation made possible by an active imagination. Coleridge progresses from the
                memory of his own disappointed childhood longings brought forth by his fixation on
                the stranger to a projected vision of a future in which his son, whose “gentle
                breathings, heard in this deep calm” eventually replace the flutter as the dominant
                noise in his ear and “Fill up the interspersed vacancies / And momentary pauses of
                the thought,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Coleridge,"Frost at
                    Midnight," lines 45-47.</note>will live amongst the gently nurturing noises of
                the country’s quietude. The poem therefore acknowledges coexisting but contradictory
                relationships with noise; it can be fraught, overpowering, painful, or destructive,
                but it can also be beguiling, compelling, calming, or imaginatively animating.<note
                     place="foot" resp="author"> Coleridge also makes an intriguing statement
                    about the anticipating mind’s ability to make meaning from noise:“Even when we
                    are broad awake, if we are in anxious expectation, how often will not the most
                    confused sounds of nature be heard by us as articulate sounds? for instance, the
                    babbling of a brook will appear for a moment, the voice of a Friend , for whom
                    we are waiting, calling out our own names.” Samuel Taylor Coleridge, “Christmas

            <p>Coleridge approaches what might seem like silence as instead a thicker atmosphere
                that is populated by the film’s flutter. In this way, he anticipates John Cage’s
                famous refutation of silence as emptiness. In 1937, Cage began the lecture that
                would eventually become the “credo” on “the future of music” at the front of essays
                collected under the title <hi rend="italic">Silence </hi>(1961) with a now-famous
                statement of sonic reality: “Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise. When we
                ignore it, it disturbs us. When we listen to it, we find it fascinating…We want to
                capture and control these sounds, to use them not as sound effects but as musical
                    instruments.<note place="foot" resp="author"> John Cage, <hi

                that, in literal terms, true silence is an impossibility. In the field of sound
                studies, Cage’s words have been taken up time and again in efforts at grappling with
                the awareness that sound must be a constant presence with which we interact, whether
                we attend to it or not. They have also been used to unravel the concept of noise as
                a stable or objectively classifiable sub-category of sound. Cage’s emphasis on how
                attention to noise can shift it from a ‘disturbance’ to an object of fascination
                foregrounds subjectivity in listening, whereas many theorizations of noise center on
                the social by examining how it can only be defined aesthetically in comparison with
                other sounds on the basis of culturally dictated ideals of aesthetic value.<note

                    organization of sounds into music as cultural power and “noise control” as
                    “cultural repression” and defined noise as a relationally constructed category
                    explicitly in the context of sociopolitical and economic power. See Jacques

                ongoing interrogation of how we define noise can be enriched by a consideration of
                how pre-phonograph literary writing (and Romantic lyric poetry in particular) might
                be approached as a kind of sound recording technology that necessarily emphasizes
                what Michel Chion calls the ‘auditum,’ sound as heard.<note

                representations of noises offering a hushed counterpoint to the thunderous
                sublime—sounds that treads a line between audible and not—might help us to rethink
                the relationships between Romantic representations of listening, early information
                about acoustic physics, and theorizations of noise and silence that followed. While
                the “unquiet” noises that interest me appear across vastly different poetic
                settings, I hope to explore consistencies in their understanding of noise—and,
                adjacently, the aesthetic qualities of a sound—as a concept rooted in the
                self-reflexive experience of listening. To do so is to understand the Romantic

                contributing to an increasingly noisy world, but also in how sounds so far removed
                from anything like musical organization (or even the categories of tonal sound
                available at the turn of the nineteenth century) might be generative points of

            <p>Coleridge’s fluttering film can be called noise precisely because of how the speaker
                reflects on his perception of it. Calling the film “unquiet” does not explicitly
                identify its motion as audible, but at the same time it does not exclude its erratic
                oscillations from noise as a class of sonic vibrations. If we are meant to
                understand that the speaker hears the film’s flutter, it is because the absence of
                louder noises allows for a heightened awareness of small ones.<note 
                    place="foot" resp="author"> It bears consideration, too, that listening and hearing are
                    not mutually exclusive. One can listen without managing to hear anything, and
                    vice versa. I suggest that Romanticism frames listening, whether or not it
                    results in the definitiveperception of an audible tone, as a mode of vibrational
                    aurality.</note>If not, the movement of the film is nonetheless registered as a
                movement of the air with a profound capacity to engage the speaker’s mind. Tiny and

                    Fulford, the weakness of the flutter of the grate in otherwise “static” air is
                    ‘under-stimulating’ and so recalls moments of similarly fitful desire for mental
                    arousal, and it is not until Coleridge is “revived by Hartley’s breathings” that
                    he becomes “mentally lively” enough to envision “a future harmony between self,

                the lines that follow. On the contrary, the self-conscious, alert but by no means

            One answer to the question above might be Coleridge’s awareness in this moment that
                the silence in the cottage is thick with inaudible sound. Reading the film’s flutter
                sonically complicates the idea that the speaker simply projects his own liveliness
                onto an inanimate object. If on a molecular level, sounds, as vibrations, move us
                whether we hear them or not, Coleridge’s attunement to the flutter might not be
                ‘animating’ so much as attentive to how even the smallest sonic encounters engage us
                in a self-reflexive and materially reciprocal relationship with the world and others
                around us. Coleridge’s imagined ‘sympathy’ with the film upon attuning to its
                flutter gestures toward vibrational reciprocity, something that sound studies
                theorists argue makes sonic perception unique.<note place="foot"

            <p>Where Chladni hit an epistemological impasse, and where I argue poetically rendered
                ‘unquiet’ sounds in Romanticism explore productive ambiguities, was in noise.
                Chladni began to identify how a tone behaves as both a discrete external entity and
                a psychophysiological phenomenon, beginning his monograph by drawing a definitional
                line between sound and noise: “A sufficiently rapid vibratory motion that is strong
                enough to affect the hearing organ is a <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>. If the
                vibrations of a sounding body are distinguishable, both in their frequency and in

                turn of the nineteenth century, the new field of acoustic physics was not yet ready
                to confront noise mathematically. He effectively throws his hands up, writing, “In
                distinct sound, the vibrations of a sounding body or of its parts are carried out at
                the same time, and all the vibrations are of equal duration; but one cannot say the

                inhabits a reciprocal relationship with the vibrating world of noise. </p>

            Apart from sheer force of volume, then, disorganized noise has no place in Burke’s
                aesthetics. </p>
                
            <p>What Burke and Chladni dismiss as neither epistemologically nor aesthetically stable
                is precisely what I refer to when I discuss “unquiet” noises in Romantic poetry.
                Rather than coming to an intellectual dead end in the face of noise, however, I
                argue that Romantic poets explored how the imagination might participate in the
                perception of both beauty and sublimity in quiet noise. In “Frost at Midnight,” to
                return to Coleridge, ‘indistinguishable’ sound is imbued with experiential and
                psychological significance. Coleridge emphasizes the flutter’s extreme quietness and
                frames it, as an event in the space of the cottage, as atmospherically insignificant
                apart from the speaker’s attunement to it, which makes it an object of absorbing
                meditation. In this way, he models Voegelin’s definition of noise as a participatory
                event between the mind and an external vibration: “Noise,” she writes, “does not
                have to be loud, but it has to be exclusive. . . This can be achieved through tiny sounds
                that grab my ear and make my listening obsessive and exclusive. . . Sound is noisy when
                it deafens my ears to anything but itself.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

            <p>Thus Coleridge’s loud, piercing, unquestionably audible owlet’s cry and the ambiguous
                audibility of the fluttering film might both be approached as noise in the poem on
                the basis of the speaker’s focused attunement to them. Coleridge shows attention to
                be grabbed, but then also directed toward the ‘unquiet’ noise object. He
                demonstrates how willed attunement can shift a sound from an unwelcome irritation to
                a familiar friend, a shift upon which Zadie Smith reflects in her essay on
                attunement. She recounts having hummed a tune that was newly resonating with her in
                the “vast silence of a valley” at Tintern Abbey and describes the complex affinity
                she felt for it, “not yet conscious of the transformation she had undergone” as it
                became something significant to her memory and her conception of self.<note

                flutter. While the owlet’s loudness initially compels his attention, the film on the
                grate almost resists it until it takes on outsize importance, initiating the first
                major movement of the mind in the poem when the speaker is swept back to his
                schoolboy days and the longing he felt then for his

            Once he attunes to it, the film is made resonant in the poem. Its softly noisy
                movement is rendered in the onomatopoeic quality of its description and mingles with
                the remembered “music” of bells, themselves meaningful both in general aesthetic
                terms for their deliberate, tuned harmonies, but in this case also for the “wild
                pleasure” they had inspired. The poem enacts what Nina Sun Eidsheim calls a
                “vibrational practice,” which she writes “relates a sound not to an a priori
                definition but to transmission.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Eidsheim,
                        <hi rend="italic">Sensing Sound</hi>, 19.</note> The ‘transmission’ of
                vibrational energy between the film and the speaker activates memory, imagination,
                and aesthetic pleasure. Eidsheim’s is a corrective approach to the musical
                aesthetics Chladni and Helmholtz strove to explain mathematically, calling for a
                transition “from thinking about music as a knowable aesthetic object to thinking
                about it as transferrable energy. <hi rend="italic">Transferable energy</hi> here
                denotes energy pulsating through and across material and transforming as it adapts
                to and takes on various material qualities; it is at the crux of thinking about
                music in the dimensions of transmission and vibrational realizations in
                material-specific and dynamic contexts.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Ibid., 16.</note> Eidsheim’s vibrational practice is fundamentally active
                entrainment. I argue that understanding such a practice to lie at the basis of
                listening may help us to think through Romanticism’s consistent conflation of the
                concepts of music and noise, particularly in the cases I have pointed out, where
                noise is not loud, but instead a gentle chaos of vibrations and more likely to be
                approached as ‘sweet’ or musical.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Though it
                    lies beyond the scope of this essay, the embrace of the possibility of finding
                    beauty and meaning in noise is perhaps most commonly presented in the Romantic
                    affinity for the æolian lyre as a model for creative activity; though tuned with
                    musical intention, the sound patterns wind harps produce are more or less
                    random, and their effect can often be harmonically jumbled, a quality Percy
                    Shelley seems to acknowledge when he notes in <hi rend="italic">A Defence of
                        Poetry </hi>that in contrast with the “ever-changing melody” of a lyre, the
                    human mind produces “an internal adjustment of the sound or motions thus excited
                    to the impressions which excite them” (page 511).</note>The evident “nonfixity”
                of these noises invites imaginative attention, but it also makes them elusive to it,
                tempting evocative verbal emphasis on their intriguing material qualities and
                suggesting an opportunity for imaginative projection that appeals to a Romantic
                interest in the creative power of a poetic mind. As such, appreciating them as
                creatively and cognitively provocative requires specific kinds of active imaginative
                openness.</p>
                
            <p>For Voegelin and for Coleridge, ‘noise’ has less to do with measurable properties of
                a sound as a material object than it does with attention and the behavior of the
                mind in perceiving it. To be engaged by noise is to be complicit in giving oneself
                up to an embodied sonic experience rather than to practice the “apprehending
                listening” dictated by musical aesthetic philosophies organized around identifiable
                    tones.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Voegelin, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Listening to Noise and Silence</hi>, 53.</note> Another way to put this
                might be to say that entering a frame of mind in which noise is imaginatively
                provocative is a form of Keats’s negative capability, “when man is capable of being
                in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &amp;
                    reason.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> John Keats, <hi rend="italic"

                course, Keats goes on to criticize Coleridge for an incapability of achieving such a
                frame of mind. But in a reading of “Frost at Midnight” emphasizing the speaker’s
                willingness to follow the movements of thought and indeterminate anticipations
                prompted by his attunement to such an uncertain signal as the unquiet film, might we
                not see evidence of such a capacity?</p>
                
            <p>Because the noises I am classing as “unquiet” in Romanticism are not immediately
                legible in terms of aesthetic quality or meaning—personal, natural, social, or
                otherwise—they draw the mind of the hearer out to become an actively engaged
                listener involved in encountering them as aesthetic objects rather than simply
                material phenomena. As such, they enfold a distinctly Romantic interest in how the
                creative imagination extends itself into the sensuously stimulating world. As the
                Coleridge example I have been revisiting emphasizes, these are very often persistent
                sounds. Their low volume, and in some cases their lack of characteristic or
                distinguishing tones, means that they can sometimes waft through the air undetected,
                reaching the ears without alerting the mind. Once the listener seeks them out or
                they ‘grab the ears,’ to borrow terminology from Voegelin, however, ‘unquiet’ noises
                tend to re-echo in imaginative memory. It is in that mental amplification that they
                take on greater resonance, though very often this is a ‘silent’ process. The
                meditative mood that follows Coleridge’s attention to the fluttering film, for
                example, bears similarity to Wordsworth’s speaker listening to the “homeless voice
                of waters” rising through the “breach” in “vapour” atop Mount Snowdon in <hi

                mind’s striving effort of listening for or to noises that I would call ‘unquiet,’
                whose power lies not in their volume, but in their indeterminacy. Rather than
                focusing on the heard sound object per se, these passages focus instead what
                Eidsheim above calls “transferable energy,” which is to be located <hi rend="italic"
                    >both</hi> within the heard noise itself and in the listener’s internalization
                of some impression of the acoustic encounter. They call to mind Jean-Luc Nancy’s
                description of the difference between hearing and listening: “If ‘to hear’ is to
                understand the sense (either in the so-called figurative sense, or in the so-called
                proper sense: to hear a siren, a bird, or a drum is already each time to understand
                at least the rough outline of a situation, a context if not a text), to listen is to
                be straining toward a possible meaning, and consequently one that is not immediately
                    accessible.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Nancy, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Listening</hi>, 6.</note> Listening, then, does involve the subject to
                relinquish a certain degree of intellectual control. For Nancy, in fact, truly
                “immersed” listening, “with all [one’s] being”<note place="foot"
                    resp="author"> Ibid., 4.</note> for the “the sound that is musically listened to, that
                is gathered and scrutinized for itself. . . as a resonant meaning, a meaning whose <hi
                    rend="italic">sense</hi> is supposed to be found in resonance and only in
                resonance” places one “always on the edge of meaning.”<note 
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., 7.</note> Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley each
                place their listening subjects into such an immersed, striving mode, but they do so
                without fully abandoning imaginative autonomy. </p>
                
            <p>To be “on the edge of meaning” is a state that Wordsworth in particular explores
                through his representations of listening. Sound, more often than not the sound of
                various waters, runs as a current throughout <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi>,
                often in relation the poet-speaker’s striving desire to feel fellowship with a
                creative force in nature and to reciprocally meet its voices with his own. I would
                like to focus my attention on two instances of especially chaotic but not
                necessarily loud Wordsworthian noise. The first is the “voice / Of mountain
                    torrents”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Wordsworth, <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Prelude</hi>, bk 5 lines 408-9.</note> in “There was a boy,” and the
                second is the similarly distant “homeless voice of waters”<note 
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Wordsworth, <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi>, bk 13 line
                    63.</note> Wordsworth recounts hearing from from atop Mount Snowdon. </p>
                
            <p>As in “Frost at Midnight,” the noise in question in “There was a boy” is preceded by
                undeniably loud owls. The boy stands calling out to the birds, confident that his
                mimicry will be rewarded with a response. At first, Wordsworth confirms the boy’s
                conceit: In return to the boy’s calls the owls 
                
                <lg type="stanza">
            <l>would shout </l>
            <l>Across the wat’ry vale, and shout again, </l>

            <l>And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud, </l>

                </lg>
                
            The disorderly tumult of disembodied voices emanates from the trees reverberates. Yet
                this is not what leaves an impression on the boy. That kind of deeply affecting
                power emanates instead from the distant noise of waters:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
            <l>And when it chanced</l>
            <l>That pauses of deep silence mocked his skill,</l>
            <l>Then sometimes in that silence, while he hung</l>
            <l>Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprize</l>
            <l>Has carried far into his heart the voice</l>
            <l>Of mountain torrents . . . </l><note place="foot" n="59"> Ibid., bk 5 lines
                    404-409</note>
                </lg>
                    
            It is important to note that the boy’s ability to hear the torrents depends on his
                own silence, but also that his listening is only “sometimes” met with the affecting
                shock of the watery “voice”; ultimately, neither natural sound can be unequivocally
                commanded. As Michele Speitz has pointed out, “sound simply cannot be possessed for
                the Wordsworthian human subject; sound can be felt and felt again but only to be
                lost and lost again”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Speitz, “The
                    Wordsworthian Acoustic Imagination, Sonic Recursions, and ‘That Dying Murmur,’”
                    623.</note> In order to hear the torrents, the boy must shift from his assumed
                position of power over nature and its voices to a more open reciprocal state,
                responding to nature’s sonic refusal of his control by silently listening for
                whatever sounds might reach him.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Adam
                    Potkay, hearing is an ethical counterpoint to seeing in Wordsworth. “Before we
                    can be ethically open to other humans, responsive to them in their alterity,” he
                    writes, “we need first to open ourselves to idling and inhuman things in a way
                    that habituates us to asymmetrical sympathy. To do this, in turn, we need to be
                    attuned to languages that are not ‘articulate,’ that is, literally, composed of

            The chasm’s visual void contrasts with the flash of light at the beginning of the
                passage, but it is filled with sound which in a way draws Wordsworth by the ear back
                into the mist out of which, as Emily Rohrbach reminds us, he had emerged into the
                light. A simplified reading might find a metaphorical refutation of enlightenment as
                a paradigmatically visual concept; not in the visual vista, but in the
                indistinguishably mingled, endlessly radiating vibrations of the water’s sound does
                Wordsworth locate “The soul, the imagination of the whole.” At the very least,
                Wordsworth’s shift from viewer to listener is generatively humbling. In his
                description of the waters’ mingled “voice,” the verse gives way to chaotically sonic
                language, evoking the uncommunicable quality of the sound’s ‘roaring’ power. And
                yet, for all its sublimity, the volume of the sound is ambiguous. It fills the air
                and verse once noticed, but before then the passage feels utterly silent. Whether
                the noise of the real torrents Wordsworth heard was actually loud seems irrelevant;
                in the poem, it is powerfully unquiet. </p>
                
            <p>Wordsworth reflects on the lingering impression of the scene atop Snowdon in one his
                most forceful statements of imaginative power. As he remains on the “lonely
                    mountain,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., bk 13, line 67</note>
                deprived of sight by night, he meditates on the ability to “build up greatest things

            Some of nature’s sublime sounds, Wordsworth asserts, “even the grossest minds must
                see and hear, / And cannot chuse but feel,”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Ibid., bk 13, lines 85-86.</note> but to find resonance in less imposing ones
                requires the creative power of a poetic mind which listens for them but also abides
                with some of their uncertainty. </p>
                
            <p>To a certain extent, Percy Shelley’s address to another mountain at the close of
                “Mont Blanc” recalls Wordsworth’s contemplation of the “perfect image of a mighty
                    mind”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., bk 13, line 69.</note> in
                the wake of his encounter with the torrents’ sonic sublimity made quiet by distance.
                Sound in “Mont Blanc” is emphatically material.<note place="foot"
                   resp="author"> Critics have frequently contemplated how “Mont Blanc” embodies in
                    aurally evocative verse the experience that inspired it. As Susan Wolfson puts
                    it, “Shelley takes [Wordsworth’s scene in ‘The Solitary Reaper’] of boundless
                    audition to the Alps, and replays it with a sense of poetry aspiring, not to
                    tame, but to run wild with antiphony and metrical disorder.” See Wolfson,
                    “Sounding Romantic: The Sound of Sound,”32. In William Keach’s oft-recalled
                    reading, “Rhyme in <hi rend="italic">Mont Blanc</hi> is one important way in
                    which Shelley’s verbal imagination structures and shapes, without giving a
                    closed or determinate pattern to, an experience which defies structuring and
                    shaping.” William Keach, <hi rend="italic">Shelley’s Style</hi> (New York:
                    Methuen, 1984), 196. </note>Shelley insists not only on the ‘ceaselessness’ of
                the noise, but also on the way in which it travels through its environment. In his
                multisensorial evocation of the ravine, he conceives of a physical and metaphysical
                acoustics which later underlies the thick silence of the poem’s close. Within such
                an acoustics is layered not only the noise of such a powerfully loud place, but the
                image of human thoughts traveling outward as well:

            Shelley’s poetic attention to his imagined brook’s “sound but half its own” as a
                material correlative to “human thought” emphasizes how its noise is not cancelled
                out, but made resonant with louder sounds. I understand such a co-amplification to
                follow from Anne McCarthy’s reading of “a sublime aesthetics of contingency in “Mont
                Blanc” that does not seek to escape the discontinuities and confusions of the
                material world through an identification with infinite reason.”<note

                    dominated.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid.</note> And so,
                confronted with the loud sublimity of the Ravine of Arve, the poetic imagination and

                    “Mont Blanc,” line 41.</note> which Shelley projects as though physically

                sounds that have materially moved him. </p>
                
            <p>Like Wordsworth’s lingering contemplation of the “roar of waters” heard at a distance
                from atop Mount Snowdon, the resonance of the mountain’s noisy vibrations in a mind
                that strives, listening ‘on the edge meaning,’ fills the silence of “Mont Blanc’s”
                close. In the last stanza of the poem, the speaker zooms out, and the sensorial
                chaos of the poem dwindles. The close of the poem reaches a contemplative quiet
                which is nonetheless ‘unquiet’ in an address to the mountaintop’s serene aspect:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
            <l>[. . .] Winds contend</l>

            <l>The voiceless lightning in these solitudes</l>
            <l>Keeps innocently, and like vapour broods</l>

            <l>And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea,</l>

                </lg>
                    
           The human mind and the power of nature are less tumultuously intertwined here than in
                the earlier stanzas, acknowledging the literal distance between body and mountain,
                so that the mind’s “unremitting interchange / With the clear universe of things
                    around”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ibid., lines 39-40.</note>
                might seem to have been cut off by the shift away from the sensorially immersive
                sublimity Shelley had previously evoked. And yet, the sound of the lines, a softly
                winding dominance of sibilants mimicking the whistling winds we would expect to hear
                at Mont Blanc’s heights, achieves an effect that is calmed but still unquiet. “Mont
                Blanc,” like the other examples I have considered, contemplates a tension between
                what we can hear, what we cannot, and how an imagination attuned to noise fills the
                space of what only seems like silence, without overpowering the auditory body’s
                sense of situatedness within it. </p>
                
            <p>I would like to close with a brief reflection on our own ‘unquiet’ moment. I happened
                to finish drafting this essay during the world’s most hushed period in recent
                history, as lockdown measures responding to the novel coronavirus pandemic slowed
                the industrial and social activities that normally constitute the racket of
                humanity. Apart from the frequent, piercing sound of sirens, Brooklyn, NY was eerily
                quiet—to the point that it ‘vexed meditation,’ to borrow from Coleridge. But in late
                spring, 2020, public attention began to attend to certain unquiet sounds in a
                proliferation of news about how some things had become unusually audible amidst the
                ‘extreme silentness.’ One <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> piece offered an
                audio guide highlighting birdsong that would normally be out of earshot: “The birds
                have always been here,” the guide observed; “This spring, we can hear them.”<note

                Such encouragement to take advantage of a restored hi-fi soundscape seemed
                desperately grateful for the smallest glimmers of beauty we could find in our
                defamiliarized local atmospheres. But more than that, it was implicitly
                introspective and forward-looking. It seemed to suggest not only that attuning to
                small sounds might offer some psychological respite, but as well that this was an
                opportunity for us to reintroduce ourselves our ambient soundscape and to consider
                afresh how our noise impacts the environment. In late July, scientists reported that
                seismic reverberation of “anthropogenic noise” had diminished to such a degree that
                we are in “the longest and most coherent global seismic noise reduction in recorded

                accounting for the rising din of late capitalist noise pollution and contemplating
                the psychology behind habits of aural fixation. The noise turned out to be the sound
                of chiller units maintaining data center equipment, droning at a frequency that
                happens to be especially irritating to human ears but which nonetheless is projected
                at decibels low enough that activists had a difficult time fighting for
                intervention. Though it possibly supported any number of creatively generative
                endeavors online, the hum drove many of the people living nearby out of their minds
                with distraction. Bosker’s piece was of course published online, its print title
                offering a dramatic assessment of the environmental fate it thus did its small part
                to ensure: “The End of Silence.” </p>
                
            <p>An “end of silence” is precisely what I would argue Romantic writers knew had always
                already come to pass. Stretching the boundaries of their contemporary aesthetic
                categories, Romantic literary representations of listening present noise as an
                underpinning of phenomenological experience and audition as an essential (sometimes
                involuntary) activity through which human subjects enter into self-reflexive
                reciprocity with elements of their social and natural worlds. This, they show us,
                offers both sensorial and creative richness, but it comes with inherent
                vulnerabilities as well. The Romantics could not have imagined the particular
                noisiness of the world we live in now, but they did presciently consider the
                significance of sound’s constant vibrational presence and how faint unquiet noises
                lie undetected until we notice them. Now, in our own tumultuous moment, we too are
                finding new ways of listening, “on the edge of meaning,” perhaps, ourselves.</p>
