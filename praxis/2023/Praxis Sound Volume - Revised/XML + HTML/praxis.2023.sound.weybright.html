            </header><br/><p>In the early lines of “Frost at Midnight,” Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s speaker asks
               the reader to listen with him. His brief description of “the owlet’s cry” which “came
               loud”<a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                     (1)

               itself: “—and hark, again! loud as before.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                     (2)
                     </sup></a>(3). However, while its interruptive presence primes the reader to attend to sound,
               it is not this piercing cry which dominates the first stanza; instead, our attention
               is turned to the quietness it throws into relief. The speaker registers the strangeness
               of the evening’s “extreme silentness”<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                     (3)
                     </sup></a>against the momentarily imperceptible din of “all the numberless goings on of life.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                     (4)
                     </sup></a>Yet the silence in the cottage is not emptiness. The speaker self-consciously implies
               that those sounding things and bodies must still be somewhere stirring airwaves even
               while his human ear finds them “Inaudible as dreams.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                     (5)
                     </sup></a>What’s more, their ‘vexing’ inaudibility seems to prompt him to listen more closely
               into the silence for signs of life nearby. He soon entrains himself to “the sole unquiet
               thing,” the “film” that “still flutters” on the grate.<a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                     (6)
                     </sup></a>Whether the speaker actually <span style="font-style:italic">hears</span> the film’s flutters is indeterminate at best, but the possibility that its unquietness
               has not only to do with visible motion but with motion-as-soundwaves is extremely
               suggestive. Faced with what he otherwise perceives as a calm so profound that it “disturbs
               / And vexes meditation,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                     (7)
                     </sup></a>the speaker becomes attuned multisensorially<a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                     (8)
                     </sup></a>to the one thing disturbing the silence. Coleridge seems to acknowledge that absolute
               silence (and, as such, absolute individual seclusion) is an impossibility; as long
               as the subject is situated in a world with energy and other bodies, the air will always
               be filled with sound vibration and there will always be some noise.</p>
            <p>This essay posits an ‘unquiet’ Romanticism. I examine a category of sonic moments
               in Romantic poetry in which the limits of audition are stretched to acknowledge not
               only what and how we hear but also the significance of sounds so low-decibel as to
               render the idea that they could be audible almost absurd. The unlikeliness that Coleridge
               actually means the event of his perception of the film to be a clear case of audition,
               strictly speaking, is precisely why I have chosen to begin this essay with the example
               of “Frost at Midnight,” which I would hazard to call a less obviously sonic poem than
               many I could have chosen. Dwelling on the film’s flutter as a sonic event accomplishes
               a few things that are central to this essay: 1. It foregrounds sound’s radical materiality
               as a concept I argue was more ubiquitous in the Romantic intellectual milieu than
               has tended to be acknowledged, 2. It explores the specific affordances of ‘unquiet’
               noise as a generative category of sound, and 3. It toggles between sensory experience
               and the disembodied imagination, and therefore gets at quintessentially Romantic questions
               surrounding phenomenal experience and the creative subject. </p>
            <p>Though in general Romanticism is thick with sounds<a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                     (9)
                     </sup></a>and certainly not short on noises that fit this category, I will limit my reading
               here to a few prime examples of ‘quiet’ things made ‘unquiet’ in poetry of the period.
               In each case, the Romantic power of the imagination is made resonant with material
               sound objects that elude its absolute grasp. These sounds often emerge into the field
               of hearing such that they seem always to have been there awaiting perception, their
               temporal and spatial indeterminacy contributing an abstract type of vastness and raising
               questions about perception, receptivity, and attention, as the listener oscillates
               between agential attunement and induced receptivity. In these passages, expansive
               movements of the mind prompted by even the gentlest sonic vibrations blur the lines
               between pleasure and fearful awe, and between imaginative empowerment and vulnerability.
               They likewise expand the boundaries of aesthetic categories of sublimity and beauty
               to encompass qualities of disorganization not traditionally regarded as properly aesthetic
               at all. Such ‘unquiet’ sounds draw attention to a material understanding of acoustics
               that would become increasingly popularized throughout the nineteenth century. They
               represent silence and quietness as sensorially potent and listening as an emphatically
               embodied perceptive mode which nonetheless involves the imagination in a process of
               knowledge production centered on self-conscious subjectivity. As sound theorist Salome
               Voegelin writes, “Sound narrates, outlines and fills, but it is always ephemeral and
               doubtful. Between my heard and the sonic object/phenomenon I will never know its truth
               but can only invent it, producing a knowing for me.<a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                     (10)
                     </sup></a>In Jean-Luc Nancy’s articulation, “To be listening will always. . . be to be straining
               toward or in an approach to the self.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
                     (11)
                     </sup></a>Thinking with Voegelin and Nancy, I suggest that for the Romantics, listening to unquiet
               noise is often both an active ‘straining’ to place oneself as a creative agent in
               relation to the world and—somewhat paradoxically—a compelled state of receptive embodiment.
               In their approaches to quietly noisy sounds that refuse absolute epistemological or
               symbolic stability, the examples I explore thus suggest a gray area between a solitary
               Romantic subjectivity dependent on the strength of the autonomous imagination and
               a (just as fundamentally Romantic) sensorially contingent conception of self.</p>
            <p>Very often, when we talk about noise, it is in the context of industrial capitalism’s
               destructive force. R. Murray Schafer’s<span style="font-style:italic">The Soundscape </span>(initially published in 1977),<a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">
                     (12)
                     </sup></a>a foundational text for the field of sound studies, centers on modernity’s transition
               from a pre-industrial “hi-fi” soundscape to a “lo-fi” soundscape in which individual
               sounds are more difficult to distinguish from a higher density of ambient sound. Schafer
               focuses on environmental and humanist concern for how our ability to gather information
               (and, indeed, pleasure) from our acoustic environment has degraded with the proliferation
               of noise pollution. The discourse surrounding silence and noise to which I wish to
               attend, however, concerns itself with an awareness that true, absolute silence has
               never existed. It explores noise not as a one-dimensionally overwhelming, distracting
               or painful thing, but rather as an ambiguous, sometimes baffling, and sometimes imaginatively
               provocative presence.</p>
            <p>Coleridge’s fluttering film, the residue of a coal fire, encodes a relationship to
               industry and an associated atmosphere of urban loudness, so that the “numberless goings
               on of life / Inaudible as dreams,” and consequently contexts of social, economic,
               and political life,<a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">
                     (13)
                     </sup></a>are sounded in the lyric description of the cottage’s un-silent quietness. But it
               is also invoked in the poem in the context of nostalgia and anticipation made possible
               by an active imagination. Coleridge progresses from the memory of his own disappointed
               childhood longings brought forth by his fixation on the stranger to a projected vision
               of a future in which his son, whose “gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm” eventually
               replace the flutter as the dominant noise in his ear and “Fill up the interspersed
               vacancies / And momentary pauses of the thought,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">
                     (14)
                     </sup></a>will live amongst the gently nurturing noises of the country’s quietude. The poem
               therefore acknowledges coexisting but contradictory relationships with noise; it can
               be fraught, overpowering, painful, or destructive, but it can also be beguiling, compelling,
               calming, or imaginatively animating.<a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">
                     (15)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>Coleridge approaches what might seem like silence as instead a thicker atmosphere
               that is populated by the film’s flutter. In this way, he anticipates John Cage’s famous
               refutation of silence as emptiness. In 1937, Cage began the lecture that would eventually
               become the “credo” on “the future of music” at the front of essays collected under
               the title <span style="font-style:italic">Silence </span>(1961) with a now-famous statement of sonic reality: “Wherever we are, what we hear
               is mostly noise. When we ignore it, it disturbs us. When we listen to it, we find
               it fascinating…We want to capture and control these sounds, to use them not as sound
               effects but as musical instruments.<a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">
                     (16)
                     </sup></a>Cage implies that, in literal terms, true silence is an impossibility. In the field
               of sound studies, Cage’s words have been taken up time and again in efforts at grappling
               with the awareness that sound must be a constant presence with which we interact,
               whether we attend to it or not. They have also been used to unravel the concept of
               noise as a stable or objectively classifiable sub-category of sound. Cage’s emphasis
               on how attention to noise can shift it from a ‘disturbance’ to an object of fascination
               foregrounds subjectivity in listening, whereas many theorizations of noise center
               on the social by examining how it can only be defined aesthetically in comparison
               with other sounds on the basis of culturally dictated ideals of aesthetic value.<a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">
                     (17)
                     </sup></a>As such, we might see noise as affording a great deal of imaginative flexibility as
               well as cultural potency. I wish to suggest that this ongoing interrogation of how
               we define noise can be enriched by a consideration of how pre-phonograph literary
               writing (and Romantic lyric poetry in particular) might be approached as a kind of
               sound recording technology that necessarily emphasizes what Michel Chion calls the
               ‘auditum,’ sound as heard.<a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">
                     (18)
                     </sup></a> Romantic writers approached noise as ontologically and aesthetically ambiguous material,
               drawing on contemporaneous theories of acoustic science but ultimately surpassing
               them to explore its vibrational force and the ways in which listening to noise could
               constitute a relationship to self and to the world.</p>
            <p>Literary scholarship has begun to question what it might mean to regard sound as more
               primary to the Romantic imagination than has previously been acknowledged;<a class="note_back" href="#Note19" id="Note19_return"><sup class="super">
                     (19)
                     </sup></a>I consider how poetic representations of noises offering a hushed counterpoint to
               the thunderous sublime—sounds that treads a line between audible and not—might help
               us to rethink the relationships between Romantic representations of listening, early
               information about acoustic physics, and theorizations of noise and silence that followed.
               While the “unquiet” noises that interest me appear across vastly different poetic
               settings, I hope to explore consistencies in their understanding of noise—and, adjacently,
               the aesthetic qualities of a sound—as a concept rooted in the self-reflexive experience
               of listening. To do so is to understand the Romantic imagination to have been interested
               not only in the implications of living with and contributing to an increasingly noisy
               world, but also in how sounds so far removed from anything like musical organization
               (or even the categories of tonal sound available at the turn of the nineteenth century)
               might be generative points of contact between the creative mind and the phenomenal
               world.</p>
            <p>Coleridge’s fluttering film can be called noise precisely because of how the speaker
               reflects on his perception of it. Calling the film “unquiet” does not explicitly identify
               its motion as audible, but at the same time it does not exclude its erratic oscillations
               from noise as a class of sonic vibrations. If we are meant to understand that the
               speaker hears the film’s flutter, it is because the absence of louder noises allows
               for a heightened awareness of small ones.<a class="note_back" href="#Note20" id="Note20_return"><sup class="super">
                     (20)
                     </sup></a>If not, the movement of the film is nonetheless registered as a movement of the air
               with a profound capacity to engage the speaker’s mind. Tiny and questionably audible
               as it is, the flutter is made sonorous.</p>
            <p>Contemplating the film once it becomes present to his notice, the speaker begins to
               self-consciously examine the reasons behind its emergent significance: </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Methinks, its motion in this hush of nature</div>
               <div class="l">Gives it dim sympathies with me who live,</div>
               <div class="l">Making it a companionable form,</div>
               <div class="l">Whose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit</div>
               <div class="l">By its own moods interprets, every where</div>

            <p> In part because the fluttering stranger’s material motion is so dramatically weak,<a class="note_back" href="#Note22" id="Note22_return"><sup class="super">

                     </sup></a>criticism often regards the poetic mind is as the primary animating force behind it
               and the film itself as an object of frustrated anticipation in Coleridge’s memory.
               Its motion is therefore often aligned more closely with the ‘vexing’ silence than
               with Hartley’s breath, which is typically read as a source of imaginative rejuvenation
               and hopeful projection.<a class="note_back" href="#Note23" id="Note23_return"><sup class="super">
                     (23)
                     </sup></a> Rather than reading Coleridge’s intellectual or social restlessness as the primary
               animating force behind the film’s liveliness, I am interested in considering how a
               sonic reading of the film might help us to regard its material activity as mentally
               provoking, without exaggerating the volume of its force. In exploring apparent silence
               as inclusive of ‘unquiet’ noise which is imaginatively stimulating, I follow from
               Nancy Yousef’s reading of “Frost and Midnight.” Yousef frames the poem as exploring
               a “generative silence”<a class="note_back" href="#Note24" id="Note24_return"><sup class="super">
                     (24)

               as its echo in the speaker’s image of his child “fluttering” in his mother’s arms
               in the 1798 version of the poem. For Yousef, the “lyric meditation”<a class="note_back" href="#Note25" id="Note25_return"><sup class="super">
                     (25)
                     </sup></a>Coleridge explores in the poem arises from a particular kind of Romantic intimacy
               resting on the presence, without distraction, of an other. I wish to cast sonic materiality

               the silence in the cottage is thick with inaudible sound. Reading the film’s flutter
               sonically complicates the idea that the speaker simply projects his own liveliness
               onto an inanimate object. If on a molecular level, sounds, as vibrations, move us
               whether we hear them or not, Coleridge’s attunement to the flutter might not be ‘animating’
               so much as attentive to how even the smallest sonic encounters engage us in a self-reflexive
               and materially reciprocal relationship with the world and others around us. Coleridge’s
               imagined ‘sympathy’ with the film upon attuning to its flutter gestures toward vibrational
               reciprocity, something that sound studies theorists argue makes sonic perception unique.<a class="note_back" href="#Note27" id="Note27_return"><sup class="super">

            <p>That sound vibration is material, and that we encounter it in embodied modes in excess
               of the tones we can perceive aurally, was a fact of increasing interest during the
               Romantic period. Late-eighteenth-century investigations of the physiological and cognitive
               significance of vibration as a more general phenomenon—most notably David Hartley’s
               theory of vibratory associationism—have been well-canvassed, but I would like to draw

            <p>Where Chladni hit an epistemological impasse, and where I argue poetically rendered

               phenomenon, beginning his monograph by drawing a definitional line between sound and
               noise: “A sufficiently rapid vibratory motion that is strong enough to affect the
               hearing organ is a <span style="font-style:italic">sound</span>. If the vibrations of a sounding body are distinguishable, both in their frequency

               its parts are carried out at the same time, and all the vibrations are of equal duration;

            <p>Edmund Burke uses similar language to Chladni’s in his description of a sonic sublimity
               dependent the cumulative effect of a repeated “simple sound” causing the ear “to be

            <p>What Burke and Chladni dismiss as neither epistemologically nor aesthetically stable
               is precisely what I refer to when I discuss “unquiet” noises in Romantic poetry. Rather
               than coming to an intellectual dead end in the face of noise, however, I argue that
               Romantic poets explored how the imagination might participate in the perception of
               both beauty and sublimity in quiet noise. In “Frost at Midnight,” to return to Coleridge,
               ‘indistinguishable’ sound is imbued with experiential and psychological significance.
               Coleridge emphasizes the flutter’s extreme quietness and frames it, as an event in
               the space of the cottage, as atmospherically insignificant apart from the speaker’s
               attunement to it, which makes it an object of absorbing meditation. In this way, he
               models Voegelin’s definition of noise as a participatory event between the mind and
               an external vibration: “Noise,” she writes, “does not have to be loud, but it has
               to be exclusive. . . This can be achieved through tiny sounds that grab my ear and
               make my listening obsessive and exclusive. . . Sound is noisy when it deafens my ears
               to anything but itself.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note41" id="Note41_return"><sup class="super">

            <p>Thus Coleridge’s loud, piercing, unquestionably audible owlet’s cry and the ambiguous
               audibility of the fluttering film might both be approached as noise in the poem on
               the basis of the speaker’s focused attunement to them. Coleridge shows attention to
               be grabbed, but then also directed toward the ‘unquiet’ noise object. He demonstrates
               how willed attunement can shift a sound from an unwelcome irritation to a familiar
               friend, a shift upon which Zadie Smith reflects in her essay on attunement. She recounts
               having hummed a tune that was newly resonating with her in the “vast silence of a
               valley” at Tintern Abbey and describes the complex affinity she felt for it, “not
               yet conscious of the transformation she had undergone” as it became something significant
               to her memory and her conception of self.<a class="note_back" href="#Note42" id="Note42_return"><sup class="super">

                     </sup></a>Coleridge similarly drifts into resonance with the film’s flutter. While the owlet’s
               loudness initially compels his attention, the film on the grate almost resists it
               until it takes on outsize importance, initiating the first major movement of the mind
               in the poem when the speaker is swept back to his schoolboy days and the longing he

            <p> Once he attunes to it, the film is made resonant in the poem. Its softly noisy movement
               is rendered in the onomatopoeic quality of its description and mingles with the remembered
               “music” of bells, themselves meaningful both in general aesthetic terms for their
               deliberate, tuned harmonies, but in this case also for the “wild pleasure” they had
               inspired. The poem enacts what Nina Sun Eidsheim calls a “vibrational practice,” which
               she writes “relates a sound not to an a priori definition but to transmission.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note44" id="Note44_return"><sup class="super">

               memory, imagination, and aesthetic pleasure. Eidsheim’s is a corrective approach to
               the musical aesthetics Chladni and Helmholtz strove to explain mathematically, calling
               for a transition “from thinking about music as a knowable aesthetic object to thinking
               about it as transferrable energy. <span style="font-style:italic">Transferable energy</span> here denotes energy pulsating through and across material and transforming as it
               adapts to and takes on various material qualities; it is at the crux of thinking about

               and dynamic contexts.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note45" id="Note45_return"><sup class="super">

               understanding such a practice to lie at the basis of listening may help us to think
               through Romanticism’s consistent conflation of the concepts of music and noise, particularly
               in the cases I have pointed out, where noise is not loud, but instead a gentle chaos
               of vibrations and more likely to be approached as ‘sweet’ or musical.<a class="note_back" href="#Note46" id="Note46_return"><sup class="super">

               a Romantic interest in the creative power of a poetic mind. As such, appreciating
               them as creatively and cognitively provocative requires specific kinds of active imaginative
               openness.</p>
            <p>For Voegelin and for Coleridge, ‘noise’ has less to do with measurable properties
               of a sound as a material object than it does with attention and the behavior of the
               mind in perceiving it. To be engaged by noise is to be complicit in giving oneself
               up to an embodied sonic experience rather than to practice the “apprehending listening”
               dictated by musical aesthetic philosophies organized around identifiable tones.<a class="note_back" href="#Note47" id="Note47_return"><sup class="super">

                     </sup></a> Another way to put this might be to say that entering a frame of mind in which noise
               is imaginatively provocative is a form of Keats’s negative capability, “when man is
               capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching
               after fact &amp; reason.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note48" id="Note48_return"><sup class="super">

                     </sup></a> Of course, Keats goes on to criticize Coleridge for an incapability of achieving
               such a frame of mind. But in a reading of “Frost at Midnight” emphasizing the speaker’s
               willingness to follow the movements of thought and indeterminate anticipations prompted
               by his attunement to such an uncertain signal as the unquiet film, might we not see
               evidence of such a capacity?</p>
            <p>Because the noises I am classing as “unquiet” in Romanticism are not immediately legible
               in terms of aesthetic quality or meaning—personal, natural, social, or otherwise—they
               draw the mind of the hearer out to become an actively engaged listener involved in
               encountering them as aesthetic objects rather than simply material phenomena. As such,
               they enfold a distinctly Romantic interest in how the creative imagination extends
               itself into the sensuously stimulating world. As the Coleridge example I have been
               revisiting emphasizes, these are very often persistent sounds. Their low volume, and
               in some cases their lack of characteristic or distinguishing tones, means that they
               can sometimes waft through the air undetected, reaching the ears without alerting
               the mind. Once the listener seeks them out or they ‘grab the ears,’ to borrow terminology
               from Voegelin, however, ‘unquiet’ noises tend to re-echo in imaginative memory. It
               is in that mental amplification that they take on greater resonance, though very often
               this is a ‘silent’ process. The meditative mood that follows Coleridge’s attention
               to the fluttering film, for example, bears similarity to Wordsworth’s speaker listening
               to the “homeless voice of waters” rising through the “breach” in “vapour” atop Mount

               for or to noises that I would call ‘unquiet,’ whose power lies not in their volume,
               but in their indeterminacy. Rather than focusing on the heard sound object per se,
               these passages focus instead what Eidsheim above calls “transferable energy,” which
               is to be located <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> within the heard noise itself and in the listener’s internalization of some impression
               of the acoustic encounter. They call to mind Jean-Luc Nancy’s description of the difference
               between hearing and listening: “If ‘to hear’ is to understand the sense (either in
               the so-called figurative sense, or in the so-called proper sense: to hear a siren,

               an immersed, striving mode, but they do so without fully abandoning imaginative autonomy.</p>
            <p>To be “on the edge of meaning” is a state that Wordsworth in particular explores through
               his representations of listening. Sound, more often than not the sound of various
               waters, runs as a current throughout <span style="font-style:italic">The Prelude</span>, often in relation the poet-speaker’s striving desire to feel fellowship with a creative
               force in nature and to reciprocally meet its voices with his own. I would like to
               focus my attention on two instances of especially chaotic but not necessarily loud
               Wordsworthian noise. The first is the “voice / Of mountain torrents”<a class="note_back" href="#Note56" id="Note56_return"><sup class="super">
                     (56)
                     </sup></a> in “There was a boy,” and the second is the similarly distant “homeless voice of
               waters”<a class="note_back" href="#Note57" id="Note57_return"><sup class="super">
                     (57)

            <p>As in “Frost at Midnight,” the noise in question in “There was a boy” is preceded
               by undeniably loud owls. The boy stands calling out to the birds, confident that his
               mimicry will be rewarded with a response. At first, Wordsworth confirms the boy’s
               conceit: In return to the boy’s calls the owls </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">would shout </div>
               <div class="l">Across the wat’ry vale, and shout again, </div>

            <p> The disorderly tumult of disembodied voices emanates from the trees reverberates.
               Yet this is not what leaves an impression on the boy. That kind of deeply affecting
               power emanates instead from the distant noise of waters: </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">And when it chanced</div>

            <p> It is important to note that the boy’s ability to hear the torrents depends on his
               own silence, but also that his listening is only “sometimes” met with the affecting
               shock of the watery “voice”; ultimately, neither natural sound can be unequivocally
               commanded. As Michele Speitz has pointed out, “sound simply cannot be possessed for
               the Wordsworthian human subject; sound can be felt and felt again but only to be lost
               and lost again”<a class="note_back" href="#Note60" id="Note60_return"><sup class="super">

               over nature and its voices to a more open reciprocal state, responding to nature’s
               sonic refusal of his control by silently listening for whatever sounds might reach
               him.<a class="note_back" href="#Note61" id="Note61_return"><sup class="super">

            <p>Wordsworth’s encounter with distant torrents from the slopes of Mount Snowdon later
               in <span style="font-style:italic">The Prelude</span> finds similar depth in noise. After the poet-speaker and his trailing companions
               emerge into moonlight in a “flash of light,” he describes a standing before a “huge

            <p> The chasm’s visual void contrasts with the flash of light at the beginning of the
               passage, but it is filled with sound which in a way draws Wordsworth by the ear back
               into the mist out of which, as Emily Rohrbach reminds us, he had emerged into the
               light. A simplified reading might find a metaphorical refutation of enlightenment
               as a paradigmatically visual concept; not in the visual vista, but in the indistinguishably
               mingled, endlessly radiating vibrations of the water’s sound does Wordsworth locate
               “The soul, the imagination of the whole.” At the very least, Wordsworth’s shift from
               viewer to listener is generatively humbling. In his description of the waters’ mingled
               “voice,” the verse gives way to chaotically sonic language, evoking the uncommunicable
               quality of the sound’s ‘roaring’ power. And yet, for all its sublimity, the volume
               of the sound is ambiguous. It fills the air and verse once noticed, but before then
               the passage feels utterly silent. Whether the noise of the real torrents Wordsworth
               heard was actually loud seems irrelevant; in the poem, it is powerfully unquiet.</p>
            <p>Wordsworth reflects on the lingering impression of the scene atop Snowdon in one his
               most forceful statements of imaginative power. As he remains on the “lonely mountain,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note65" id="Note65_return"><sup class="super">

            <p> Some of nature’s sublime sounds, Wordsworth asserts, “even the grossest minds must

               mind which listens for them but also abides with some of their uncertainty.</p>
            <p>To a certain extent, Percy Shelley’s address to another mountain at the close of “Mont

               the thick silence of the poem’s close. Within such an acoustics is layered not only
               the noise of such a powerfully loud place, but the image of human thoughts traveling

               follow from Anne McCarthy’s reading of “a sublime aesthetics of contingency in “Mont

            <p>Like Wordsworth’s lingering contemplation of the “roar of waters” heard at a distance
               from atop Mount Snowdon, the resonance of the mountain’s noisy vibrations in a mind
               that strives, listening ‘on the edge meaning,’ fills the silence of “Mont Blanc’s”
               close. In the last stanza of the poem, the speaker zooms out, and the sensorial chaos
               of the poem dwindles. The close of the poem reaches a contemplative quiet which is
               nonetheless ‘unquiet’ in an address to the mountaintop’s serene aspect: </p>

               winding dominance of sibilants mimicking the whistling winds we would expect to hear
               at Mont Blanc’s heights, achieves an effect that is calmed but still unquiet. “Mont
               Blanc,” like the other examples I have considered, contemplates a tension between
               what we can hear, what we cannot, and how an imagination attuned to noise fills the
               space of what only seems like silence, without overpowering the auditory body’s sense
               of situatedness within it.</p>
            <p>I would like to close with a brief reflection on our own ‘unquiet’ moment. I happened
               to finish drafting this essay during the world’s most hushed period in recent history,
               as lockdown measures responding to the novel coronavirus pandemic slowed the industrial
               and social activities that normally constitute the racket of humanity. Apart from
               the frequent, piercing sound of sirens, Brooklyn, NY was eerily quiet—to the point
               that it ‘vexed meditation,’ to borrow from Coleridge. But in late spring, 2020, public
               attention began to attend to certain unquiet sounds in a proliferation of news about
               how some things had become unusually audible amidst the ‘extreme silentness.’ One
               <span style="font-style:italic">New York Times</span> piece offered an audio guide highlighting birdsong that would normally be out of
               earshot: “The birds have always been here,” the guide observed; “This spring, we can
               hear them.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note77" id="Note77_return"><sup class="super">

               grateful for the smallest glimmers of beauty we could find in our defamiliarized local
               atmospheres. But more than that, it was implicitly introspective and forward-looking.
               It seemed to suggest not only that attuning to small sounds might offer some psychological
               respite, but as well that this was an opportunity for us to reintroduce ourselves
               our ambient soundscape and to consider afresh how our noise impacts the environment.
               In late July, scientists reported that seismic reverberation of “anthropogenic noise”
               had diminished to such a degree that we are in “the longest and most coherent global

               online, the hum drove many of the people living nearby out of their minds with distraction.
               Bosker’s piece was of course published online, its print title offering a dramatic
               assessment of the environmental fate it thus did its small part to ensure: “The End
               of Silence.”</p>
            <p>An “end of silence” is precisely what I would argue Romantic writers knew had always
               already come to pass. Stretching the boundaries of their contemporary aesthetic categories,
               Romantic literary representations of listening present noise as an underpinning of
               phenomenological experience and audition as an essential (sometimes involuntary) activity
               through which human subjects enter into self-reflexive reciprocity with elements of
               their social and natural worlds. This, they show us, offers both sensorial and creative
               richness, but it comes with inherent vulnerabilities as well. The Romantics could
               not have imagined the particular noisiness of the world we live in now, but they did
               presciently consider the significance of sound’s constant vibrational presence and
               how faint unquiet noises lie undetected until we notice them. Now, in our own tumultuous
               moment, we too are finding new ways of listening, “on the edge of meaning,” perhaps,
               ourselves.</p>

               and it is very often paired with sight (particularly in Wordsworth). In instances
               in which the senses are more emphatically intertwined without being conflated with
               one another (as in synaesthesia), I find the term ‘multisensorial’ to effectively
               suggest a heightened awareness of multiple dimensions of embodied sensation. Nina
               Sun Eidsheim asserts that sound transmission is necessarily multisensorial, and argues
               that to think of it as such is necessary in order to “redirect thinking about sound
               as object…toward a reconception of sound as event” (Nina Sun Eidsheim, <span style="font-style:italic">Sensing Sound: Singing &amp; Listening as Vibrational Practice</span>, Sign, Storage, Transmission (Durham: Duke University Press, 2015), 3.My aim here
               is to show how a Romantic poetics of ‘unquiet’ noise works in that direction by emphasizing
               the play between attention, perception, and subjective response to such sounding vibrations.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Susan Wolfson’s essay in the 2008<span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Circles: Praxis</span> volume on sound shows us just how variegated an array of Romantic sounds we might
               place together. Like many others, Wolfson places particular emphasis on William Wordsworth’s
               ear, but she also highlights Coleridge’s deep interest in sound. See Susan J. Wolfson,
               “Sounding Romantic: The Sound of Sound,” in <span style="font-style:italic">95240</span>, ed. Susan J. Wolfson, Romantic Circles Praxis Series: Apr (College Park, MD: University
               of Maryland Press, 2008), https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-35973-1_795. By starting
               with such a quiet moment in Coleridge, I hope to search beneath the sounds that tend
               to catch our attention in order to understand Romantic writing as more sonically rich
               than we have tended to appreciate.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               verse the experience that inspired it. As Susan Wolfson puts it, “Shelley takes [Wordsworth’s
               scene in ‘The Solitary Reaper’] of boundless audition to the Alps, and replays it
               with a sense of poetry aspiring, not to tame, but to run wild with antiphony and metrical
               disorder.” See Wolfson, “Sounding Romantic: The Sound of Sound,”32. In William Keach’s
               oft-recalled reading, “Rhyme in <span style="font-style:italic">Mont Blanc</span> is one important way in which Shelley’s verbal imagination structures and shapes,
               without giving a closed or determinate pattern to, an experience which defies structuring
               and shaping.” William Keach, <span style="font-style:italic">Shelley’s Style</span> (New York: Methuen, 1984), 196.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note70_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
