               <h2><span class="head">I. The Wind and the Clock</span></h2>
               <p>The opening sentences of one of the paradigmatic novels of German Romanticism, Novalis’
                  <span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</span> (1802), are infused with the rhythms of an unlikely dyad: the wind and the clock.
                  The wind and the clock, working with and against one another, represent the initial
                  conditions of a Romantic experiment in which a restless desire is awakened within
                  the confines of the bourgeois household: <span class="quote">‘The parents were already sleeping, the clock on the wall beat its monotonous tact,
                     before the rattling windows whistled the wind; and the chamber was lit in alternation
                     from the shimmer of the moon. The youth lay restless in his bed and recalled the stranger
                     [<span style="font-style:italic">des Fremden</span>] and his stories.<a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a>’</span> What follows is well known to readers of German Romantic literature: the walls of
                  the room dissolve into a phantasmagoria of infinite distances, oceanic depths, caves
                  and cliffs, death and rebirth, dreams within dreams, and somehow, impossibly, a peculiar
                  clarity and distinction, and then: the erotic blue flower, simultaneously woman and
                  plant, sexuated and hermaphroditic. This room is no mere room, but a womb, a matrix
                  of emergence for a way of feeling and thinking that is fundamentally alien, at odds
                  with the intelligibility of everyday life. Heinrich, pondering his attraction to the
                  blue flower, declares: “No one can and no one will understand this.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                        (2)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>Let us linger with the wind and the clock in the first sentence. Caught up in a narrative
                  momentum driven towards the oneiric revelation of the blue flower, it is easy to overlook
                  the function of these initial objects as figures in an acoustic drama, or rather,
                  as indices of a metaphysical drama in acoustic form. One is tempted to reduce these
                  two objects, in traditional terms, to the function of setting—to background conditions
                  against which an event takes place. Not only are wind and clock not mere background
                  conditions; rather, they indicate privileged points of entry into the very metaphysical
                  matrix of becoming from which entities emerge, the domain the Romantics and post-Kantian
                  philosophers called the <span style="font-style:italic">unconditioned </span>(<span style="font-style:italic">das Unbedingte</span>): the absolute as that to which no conditions can be attached. While the window is
                  typically a privileged speculative site, the opening onto a space at once visual and
                  visionary, the first sensory organ to register the drama of the unconditioned in this
                  instance is the ear.</p>
               <p>Material vibrations, waves, oscillations, collisions—all taking place below the threshold
                  of conscious perception—can be amplified in Romantic thought into larger-scale domains:
                  from language to the soul, from acoustics to physiology, from wave oscillations to
                  the modification of human sensuous capacities. In the words of a fragment from Novalis’<span style="font-style:italic">Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia</span> (1799): “Couldn’t every sculptural formation, from crystals up until man, be explained
                  in an <span style="font-style:italic">acoustic manner</span> by means of arrested motion?”<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                        (3)
                        </sup></a> Novalis bases these upward scaling chains of sound figuration on “chemical acoustics.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                        (4)
                        </sup></a> The designation is remarkable, not least because Novalis at times prioritizes chemical
                  processes that tend toward form-dissolution, in line with the Romantic chemical quest
                  for a universal solvent; the chemical principle “is contrary to the <span style="font-style:italic">figure-making </span>principle—it destroys figures.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                        (5)
                        </sup></a> Chemical acoustics, if it is to function as a model of formation or figuration, must
                  therefore counteract the tendency toward dissolution. As Daniel Lancereau writes,
                  unstructured force requires constraints—what Novalis calls “inhibited motion”<a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                        (6)
                        </sup></a> (<span style="font-style:italic">gehemte Bewegung</span>)—in order to become productive, to generate forms.<a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                        (7)
                        </sup></a> There nevertheless remains something intrinsically chaotic about processes of figuration
                  grasped through chemical acoustics, where chaos is understood as the primordial (and
                  non-sublatable) presence of unstructured force or non-directed motion.</p>
               <p>The paradigm of acoustics thus elaborated indicates a vibrating and metastable ontological
                  field—in the form of an oscillating material substratum—that can be scaled upward
                  by Romantic thought and poetry as a symbolic resource to <span style="font-style:italic">uncondition</span> forms of life. Unconditioning sound embeds entities in an infinite process of emergence
                  that knows neither limit nor bound, thereby disrupting the material and normative
                  conditions of existence that govern the intelligibility of everyday life. This essay
                  examines paradigmatic instances of Romantic thought experiments with unconditioning
                  sound: in the intersection between acoustic phenomena and the operations of the unconditioned
                  absolute in Novalis’ scientific and philosophical fragments; in <span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</span>, where sound harnesses and sublimates violence and revolutionary energy while still
                  maintaining a relation to the subterranean forces that constitute the source of this
                  energy; in Schelling’s concept of sonority in the <span style="font-style:italic">Philosophy of Music</span>, which simultaneously celebrates the transgressive potential of rhythm just as it
                  attempts to critique and delimit this potential; in naturephilosophical conceptions
                  of sound as shock (Ørsted) and as an electrical virtuality of figuration (Ritter);
                  in Eichendorff’s lyrical equation of contemplation with intoxication through the concept
                  of rustling, <span style="font-style:italic">Rauschen</span>;<a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                        (8)
                        </sup></a> and finally, in E.T.A. Hoffmann’s electrical-musical aesthetics that does not posit
                  an ineffable ideal as the telos of Romantic poiesis, but seeks to permanently hold
                  the ideal at bay, indeed, to ontologically secure the irreducible gap between real
                  and ideal as the basis for a diabolic and extra-normative generativity.</p>
               <p>In each of these instances, sound constitutes a privileged site in which the potentially
                  agonistic forces of the unconditioned can be intensified, harnessed, and redirected.
                  In his philosophical fragments, Novalis posits the unconditioned as the endpoint of
                  an impossible desire. The first of his fragments in the collection <span style="font-style:italic">Pollen </span>(<span style="font-style:italic">Blüthenstaub</span>) reads: “We seek everywhere the unconditioned, and always find only things.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                        (9)
                        </sup></a> Thus, in the first sentence of <span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</span>, the wind and the clock are <span style="font-style:italic">only things</span>. At the same time, they are things of a special sort, as they disclose the desire
                  for the unconditioned in their organization and disorganization of the sensible. The
                  clock brings appearances into an acoustic schema of regularity and unity: it sounds
                  in regular beats, in <span style="font-style:italic">tact</span>, and its acoustic-formal principle is uniformity (monotony), in German, <span style="font-style:italic">einförmig</span>. The acoustic-formal principle of the wind is stochastic; it does not beat, but swishes
                  (<span style="font-style:italic">saust</span>), rattling against the speculative frame (the window). The two objects represent
                  two opposing paradigms of acoustic organization, although to a certain extent, they
                  depend on one another: the stochastic noise of the wind appears as a disruption of
                  the order and regularity of the clock, just as the beat of the clock (as tact) allows
                  the chaotic energy of the wind to be registered.</p>
               <p>If there is something like an absolute, then, it is to be found not in a thing (wind
                  or clock), but in a circulation of desire between things, in the <span style="font-style:italic">unconditioning</span> of symbolic bearers of ontological order, where unconditioning means: 1) the capacity
                  to manifest a process of organization to which no condition or limit can be ascribed;
                  2) the incapacity of any singular thing to manifest this process absolutely. The clash
                  or dissonance between these two percussive acoustic events, an oscillation between
                  order and disorder, establishes the ontological field of the Romantic aesthetic experiment—an
                  experiment that ultimately provides the framework in which the protagonist of the
                  novel is propelled out of the normalizing constraints of bourgeois desire.</p>
               <p>Significant is nevertheless that <span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</span> opens with a sensorium operating at the level of base materiality: sound rather than
                  sonority. The differentiation of sonority (<span style="font-style:italic">Klang</span>) from sound (<span style="font-style:italic">Schall</span>) is one of the central conditions in the construction of sound as an epistemic phenomenon
                  at this time; in Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni’s <span style="font-style:italic">Discoveries in the Theory of Sound</span> (1784), sonority emerges “when an elastic body makes simultaneous and audible oscillations.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                        (10)
                        </sup></a> Through the simultaneity of oscillations, sound becomes sonority; in the case of
                  the Chladni plate, drawing the bow of a violin makes dust particles strewn on surfaces
                  settle into distinctive and multiple geometric patterns. The Chladni plate brings
                  invisible processes of figuration into view: the figuration of figuration itself.<a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
                        (11)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>Oscillation, even within the mechanical (elastic) paradigm articulated by Chladni
                  (rather than the dynamic, force-based paradigm that would become central to Romanticism),
                  constitutes a foundational operation of Romantic thought, a paradigm of movement simultaneously
                  material, conceptual, and ontological. Oscillatory movements suffuse both mind and
                  matter, bringing these domains into a zone of indifferentiation (the establishment
                  of such indifference points between mind and matter constitutes one of the main operations
                  of Romantic <span style="font-style:italic">Naturphilosophie</span>). In his studies on Fichte, for example, Novalis characterizes the back-and-forth
                  swaying motion (<span style="font-style:italic">Schweben</span>) between extremes—referring in this context to Fichte’s concept of the productive
                  imagination—as “the source, the mother of all reality, reality itself.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">
                        (12)
                        </sup></a> Oscillation, either in material acoustic form, as <span style="font-style:italic">Schwingung</span>, or in its correlative form in consciousness, as <span style="font-style:italic">Schweben</span>, represents an operation of fundamental ontology in Romantic thought. To approach
                  reality through oscillation between extremes—i.e. between subject and object, regularity
                  and disorder, clock and wind—is thus to approach the real immanently. At the same
                  time, the real is inconsistent with itself, turns back upon itself; the movement of
                  oscillation indexes this inconsistency.<a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>Sound as emergent from a field constituted by force and counterforce—dissolution and
                  cohesion, for example—constitutes a domain that ramifies into other thought experiments
                  with formation, both individual and collective.<a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">
                        (14)
                        </sup></a> Novalis thus writes of an “acoustics of the soul,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">
                        (15)

                        (16)
                        </sup></a> While Novalis (along with Johann Wilhelm Ritter) considers the word to be originally
                  tone, he does not cast this primordial musicality of language as tantamount to a pure
                  idealization of the word, linking it to something mystically ineffable or disembodied.
                  On the contrary, primordial speech as tone sets into motion a physiological spiritualization:
                  the surrounding air becomes a Chladni plate upon which the human breath calls forms
                  (as words) into being. Novalis writes: “Vowels are strings of sound or <span style="font-style:italic">batons of air</span>. The lungs are a <span style="font-style:italic">bow in motion</span>.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">
                        (17)
                        </sup></a> Novalis often associates the vowel with poetry (openness, floating) and the consonant
                  with prose (limitation, retardation); the two working in tandem generate a higher-order
                  poetic figuration, the poetry of poetry and prose, already prefigured physiologically
                  in the manner in which human beings articulate sound.</p>
               <p>Novalis also includes the deformation of acoustic matter—sounds with a diminished
                  capacity for figuration—within his horizon of inquiry; the “inflexion of sound”<a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">
                        (18)
                        </sup></a> [<span style="font-style:italic">Inflexion des Schalls</span>] includes “<span style="font-style:italic">painful noise</span>—scratching on a plate etc. Piercing sound.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note19" id="Note19_return"><sup class="super">
                        (19)
                        </sup></a> Such noise would not have been generative or figurative for Chladni, as it is not
                  sonorous. Novalis is nevertheless attracted to the non-generative as an essential
                  part of the aesthetic exercise; noise thus resurfaces at critical points in Romantic
                  projects of transfiguration, and not merely as that which must be rejected, but as
                  an expansion of aesthetic possibility. According to Bettine Menke, the Romantic paradigm
                  destabilizes the dominant trajectories of western musical and poetic systems that
                  ascend from sound to tone to speech, instead bringing hearers into a relation of “infinite
                  approximation” to noise.<a class="note_back" href="#Note20" id="Note20_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>In <span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</span>, the initial encounter between wind and clock approaches acoustic phenomena in this
                  manner, oscillating between an excess of regularity in differentiation (<span style="font-style:italic">tact</span>) and a stochastic and noisy material substratum (<span style="font-style:italic">swishing </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">rattling</span>). However, the Romantic experiment of the novel goes farther than merely foregrounding
                  the metaphysical and ontological significance of acoustic phenomena; it <span style="font-style:italic">amplifies</span> this acoustic material, diffuses it in the very shape of the mythemes and forms of
                  life in social and political experiments. As Jocelyn Holland shows in reference to
                  the works of Romantic physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter, acoustic symbols that stand
                  in for absolute material dynamics can be led back to a more primordial substratum,
                  a form of silence, whose adequate representation would require “nothing less than
                  the construction of the human.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note21" id="Note21_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>In a fragment written around the time of his work on <span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</span>, Novalis places acoustics in proximity to a branch of knowledge centered around touch
                  (<span style="font-style:italic">Berührungskunde</span>).<a class="note_back" href="#Note22" id="Note22_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a> Touch, as Siarhei Biareishyk argues, lies at the center of Novalis’ concept of individuation,
                  one in which the individual is a “composite unity in perpetual activity”<a class="note_back" href="#Note23" id="Note23_return"><sup class="super">
                        (23)
                        </sup></a> whose power is measured “by its capacity to undergo encounters without dissolution
                  and enter into complex relations with other individuals.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note24" id="Note24_return"><sup class="super">
                        (24)
                        </sup></a> Acoustics, as a science of touch and hence as a zone that facilitates processes of
                  individuation (albeit, as we have seen, in a manner that depends upon processes of
                  dissolution), expands into sensuous, poetic, and mathematical domains, ultimately
                  providing the material basis for the world-transfiguring scope of poetry. Poetry,
                  as that field of activity through which the “world must be romanticized,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note25" id="Note25_return"><sup class="super">
                        (25)
                        </sup></a> invokes a vibrating multiplicity of encounters as integral to the construction of
                  reality. Novalis writes: “Poetry [<span style="font-style:italic">Poësie</span>] is the truly absolute real. This is the core of my philosophy.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note26" id="Note26_return"><sup class="super">

                  <span style="font-style:italic">as </span>fundamental ontology—underlies the operations of poetry and its disruptive, utopian
                  energy. Novalis approaches oscillations, waves, and vibrations—which come into perceptual
                  presence upon amplification—through a science of touch founded on the exploration
                  of “active and passive tangents,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note27" id="Note27_return"><sup class="super">

                  curve. This geometry can be translated into a poetic and existential mandate: follow
                  a line of contact toward unexpected encounters, each of which in turn can generate
                  their own tangential radiations.</p>
               <p><span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</span>, as we have seen, begins with the acoustic problem of touch, of tact. The concept
                  of tact (<span style="font-style:italic">Takt</span>), according to Anders Engberg-Pedersen, encompasses two different paradigms of order
                  in the Romantic period: an order of regularity, of arrangement (tact as <span style="font-style:italic">taxis</span>); and a subjective inner sense deriving from the sense of touch (tact as <span style="font-style:italic">tangere</span>).<a class="note_back" href="#Note28" id="Note28_return"><sup class="super">
                        (28)
                        </sup></a> The clock at the outset of the narrative—already an ironic anachronism for a tale
                  that takes place in the Middle Ages (an <span style="font-style:italic">ana-chronistic</span> clock)—establishes a tact that monotonously individuates forms and thus is associated
                  more with <span style="font-style:italic">taxis </span>than <span style="font-style:italic">tangere</span>. The ticking of the clock organizes acoustic material as something uni-form (<span style="font-style:italic">einförmig</span>). One of the central problems of the novel confronts initial conditions that are
                  uniform and seeks to differentiate them, to individuate in a way that multiplies difference.
                  The condition of the clock, of regular time, of uni-formity, must be <span style="font-style:italic">unconditioned</span>.</p>
               <p>The novel disrupts the regularity of tact (<span style="font-style:italic">taxis</span>) by exploring tangential notions of rhythm (<span style="font-style:italic">tangere</span>), or rhythm as it spins off into unexpected directions in worldly encounters. It
                  must be noted that Novalis sees the concept of world as imbricated with rhythm, as
                  <span style="font-style:italic">essentially </span>rhythmical: “If we take away the rhythm of the world—then the world also disappears.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note29" id="Note29_return"><sup class="super">

                  <span style="font-style:italic">in potentia</span> in subterranean depths; it is precisely this potential that Novalis locates in “the
                  acoustic nature of the soul.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note31" id="Note31_return"><sup class="super">

                  mediated forms, ultimately encompassing the totality of social, erotic, and political
                  relations. Novalis explores these oscillations as part of an aesthetic experiment:
                  how can one <span style="font-style:italic">de-form </span>the world in such a way that new rhythms emerge? And where can one find an experimental
                  space in which strange oscillations can reshape everyday life?</p>
               <p>Novalis finds this space for the transfiguration of the rhythm of the world, and hence
                  of the world itself, in the operations of the fairy tale.<a class="note_back" href="#Note32" id="Note32_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a> When embedded in novels or longer prose forms—as they are in Novalis’ works (in <span style="font-style:italic">The Novices at Sais </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</span>)—the fairy tale punctuates the forward motion of narrative time, suspending the logic
                  of the prosaic world and producing something dramatically different. In his theoretical
                  writings, Novalis hints that the fairy tale can be approached acoustically. Novalis
                  writes: “The fairy tale is entirely <span style="font-style:italic">musical</span>.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note33" id="Note33_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a> It is musical not merely thematically, as a form that privileges sound—when music
                  is coaxed from a lyre and the fields of ice and the cliffs ring in resonant response
                  (as happens in Klingohr’s fairy tale in <span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</span>)—but musical in its very being, in the way it establishes contact with the vibration
                  of the real before organized differentiation imposes order on the world. The musicality
                  of the fairy tale indicates a world “devoid of all coherence,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note34" id="Note34_return"><sup class="super">

                  fairy tale—than a moral destiny—a lawful relation.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note37" id="Note37_return"><sup class="super">
                        (37)
                        </sup></a> The fairy tale functions as a source of romanticizing practices inasmuch as it participates
                  in an anarchic freedom prior to the differentiation of law; it is this participation
                  in anarchic primordiality that facilitates the emergence of a future both generative
                  and unpredictable (chaotic) as well as rational (as it has passed <span style="font-style:italic">through </span>the law). The central function of the fairy tale is thus to establish a zone of indifference
                  between reason and chaos that culminates in the potentiation of both domains (reason
                  and chaos): “<span style="font-style:italic">rational </span>chaos—chaos suffused with itself—inside and outside of itself—<span style="font-style:italic">chaos</span><sup>2 </sup>or ∞.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note38" id="Note38_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>Such is the purpose of the fairy tale as described in Novalis’ <span style="font-style:italic">Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia. </span>The examples of the genre written by Novalis, however, including the most complex
                  and obscure fairy tale at the heart of <span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</span>, the fairy tale told by Klingsohr, seem to belie this theory. Commentators and critics
                  have noted that the Klingsohr fairy tale in particular appears overdetermined, almost
                  allegorical, consciously constructed and ultimately restorative in intent rather than
                  anarchic and contingent.<a class="note_back" href="#Note39" id="Note39_return"><sup class="super">
                        (39)
                        </sup></a> It seems to culminate in an order approximating a moral destiny.</p>
               <p>Uncovering the chaotic substratum of the fairy tale demands an attentive ear, an ear
                  attuned to conditions of emergence that fold the stability of an apparent <span style="font-style:italic">telos </span>into a vortex of becoming. Attending to the musicality of the fairy tale can bring
                  its latent anarchic dynamics into presence; submerged acoustic fields destabilize
                  the operations of political restoration at the very moment in which they seem to reach
                  their apotheosis. An exoteric (outwardly directed) reparation of the wounded political
                  body is thus accompanied by an esoteric (internally present) process of unconditioning.</p>
               <p>If the fairy tale is “entirely musical,” then the final note of Klingsohr’s fairy
                  tale—and along with it, the telos of acoustic figuration—seems to re-establish the
                  stability of monarchical governance after an explosion of revolutionary violence.
                  The notoriously complex fairy tale unfolds through a series of crises that overturn
                  domestic (familial) and political (monarchical) orders in an upheaval unleashed by
                  subterranean forces, led by a figure known only as the Writer: a paradoxical figure
                  inasmuch as he is equated in Novalis’ notes with the understanding (<span style="font-style:italic">der Verstand</span>), although his revolutionary energy is conspicuously fueled by resentment and hatred
                  (or perhaps this is not paradoxical, but historical: the sleep of reason produces
                  monsters). The power of Fable, personified as the ostensible protagonist of the tale,
                  overwhelms the subterranean forces (the Fates) led by the Writer and brings the tale
                  to a close by weaving the previously wounded community together in a spinning song.
                  The fairy tale ends with a scene of political rapprochement between a newly crowned
                  monarchical pair and the multitude, each reconciled to the other through sympathetic
                  resonance: after the king embraces [<span style="font-style:italic">umarmt</span>] the queen, “one heard nothing except tender names and the whispering of kisses”<a class="note_back" href="#Note40" id="Note40_return"><sup class="super">
                        (40)
                        </sup></a> circulate among the crowd. This scene of erotic reconciliation nevertheless conceals
                  an esoteric symbolic and political revolution; the dynastic continuity of the monarchy
                  has been contaminated by integrating a member of a lower order (<span style="font-style:italic">Eros</span>, born from the domestic realm and transplanted into the astral, monarchical realm)
                  into its chain of succession. Any political restoration is thus fundamentally impure.</p>
               <p>The impurity of the final scene can also be deduced from its acoustic conditions;
                  the purported symbolic fulfillment takes place in contact with sonic material that
                  is more erotic noise than intelligible <span style="font-style:italic">logos</span>. The emergence of the new political-social regime culminates in two different sonic
                  modes at the end of the fairy tale: erotic whispering (<span style="font-style:italic">Kußgeflüster</span>) and the spinning song. The disindividuated crowd is bound together by noise on the
                  threshold of audibility (<span style="font-style:italic">Geflüster</span>), while individuated symbolic figures (Fable, Sophie, Phoenix) stand out against
                  this thrumming ground—in Fable’s case, as <span style="font-style:italic">song</span> (organized sound) rather than <span style="font-style:italic">murmur</span> (undifferentiated noise).<a class="note_back" href="#Note41" id="Note41_return"><sup class="super">
                        (41)
                        </sup></a> Sonic modes at the end of the fairy tale thus correspond to a relation between individuated
                  figure and a non-differentiated ground. However, Fable is not merely singing; she
                  is also <span style="font-style:italic">spinning</span>, generating social-symbolic threads. The threads that she spins are drawn from her
                  own body; when a hero (Perseus) gives her the gift of a spindle in gratitude for this
                  restoration of order, he exclaims: “In your hands this spindle shall make us eternally
                  rejoice, and out of yourself you shall spin an unbreakable golden thread.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note42" id="Note42_return"><sup class="super">
                        (42)
                        </sup></a> Fable’s own being constitutes an inexhaustible energetic resource, ultimately realized
                  in song.</p>
               <p>Fable’s song sings of eternity and eternalization, of grounding, reconciliation, and
                  an overcoming of the ephemerality of pain. However, at the moment of its enunciation,
                  the song is accompanied by the rotary motion of the spindle: </p>
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Fable spun diligently and sang with a clear voice:</div>

                  <div class="l">In love and peace conflict ends,</div>
                  <div class="l">Gone the long dream of pain, </div>

                        (43)
                        </sup></a></div>
               <p> The promise of reconciliation that takes place within the song cannot be isolated
                  from the spinning source of its genesis, a source that folds all stabilizing operations
                  of grounding into the gyrations of becoming. Spinning is, in a certain sense, Fable’s
                  basic operation, and this final gesture must be considered motivically in relation
                  to other instances of rotary motion, as repetitions or resignifications of these instances;
                  earlier in the tale, Fable draws upon the spinning song as a source of (counter-)
                  revolutionary violence, in the musical form of the tarantella: “During [Fable’s] song,
                  from all sides, tarantulas appeared, they drew a shining net over the blades of grass,
                  and they moved themselves to the beat [<span style="font-style:italic">nach dem Takte</span>] on their threads.... Her strings never rested, and the tarantulas followed the enchanting
                  sounds on fast-woven threads.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note44" id="Note44_return"><sup class="super">
                        (44)
                        </sup></a> In this instance, Fable’s song summons threads that transmit rhythms and micro-oscillations,
                  making the world into a resonance chamber, one in which the slightest movement can
                  be detected by the sensitive organs of the spider: the monotonous <span style="font-style:italic">tact </span>of the clock at the beginning of the novel is thus transformed into a different regime
                  of acoustic transmission in the fairy tale (the only other appearance of <span style="font-style:italic">Takt</span> in the novel). This form of tact becomes a channel for a release of energy: a destructive
                  tendency that must either exhaust itself (dissipate) or be sublimated into form. It
                  is this latter function that Fable’s song seeks to realize.</p>
               <p>In the discourse of tarantism, which was the subject of extensive debate in Diderot’s
                  <span style="font-style:italic">Encyclopédie</span>, for example, music played the role of a physiological cure.<a class="note_back" href="#Note45" id="Note45_return"><sup class="super">
                        (45)
                        </sup></a> According to the account as popularized by Athanasius Kircher, the musical notes
                  and the whirling bodies in the dance are supposed to counteract the poison coursing
                  through the body. The tarantella of Fable’s song positions itself obliquely to this
                  tradition. Fable’s spinning song does not seek to expel or dispel poison, but to conjure
                  it forth and harness its power; Fable’s poetic activity revolves around an acoustically
                  generated pharmakon that simultaneously wounds and heals.</p>
               <p>Fable’s song ensnares the agents of revolutionary violence (the Fates, the Writer)
                  in a web that they themselves bring about (it is in fact the Writer who demands the
                  oil of the tarantulas in the first place as fuel for his revolutionary ambitions).
                  Fable disarms the subterranean revolt by overwhelming them in the orgiastic rhythms
                  of the tarantella: “[Fable’s] pursuers rushed impetuously into the web of the tarantulas,
                  which took vengeance on them with innumerable bites. The whole crowd began to dance
                  frantically, to which Fable played a merry tune.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note46" id="Note46_return"><sup class="super">
                        (46)
                        </sup></a> It is implied that the Writer is among these pursuers, or at least that the pursuers
                  are his representatives; in any case, the Writer has become dis-individuated in the
                  spinning of the dance.</p>
               <p>Fable is thus responsible for two forms of spinning songs: the orgiastic-destructive
                  song of tarantism, and the restorative song of the weaver. These songs are not oppositional,
                  but complementary (or at least complementary in their oppositionality, a problem that
                  Nietzsche would later seek to solve in <span style="font-style:italic">The Birth of Tragedy </span>by reconciling Apollonian figuration with Dionysian dissolution). Novalis frames Romantic
                  writing—a form of writing indicated by the ultimate fate of the Writer—in relation
                  to these two primordial musical paradigms. It is significant that precisely at the
                  moment in which Romantic writing fulfills its highest ambitions—as unconditioning
                  writing—the Writer simply disappears (or seems to disappear) from the tale, a detail
                  emphasized by Friedrich Kittler.<a class="note_back" href="#Note47" id="Note47_return"><sup class="super">
                        (47)
                        </sup></a> Kittler calls this disappearance “the trace of a repression.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note48" id="Note48_return"><sup class="super">
                        (48)
                        </sup></a> There is, however, another possibility: a transformation of writing has taken place,
                  but it has become ubiquitous, absolute, atmospheric, everywhere visible and non-localizable.
                  Indeed, the Writer has not been repressed, but unconditioned and <span style="font-style:italic">amplified</span> into absolute song; the dissipation of revolutionary violence and the dis-individuation
                  of its central figure (the figure of the Writer) becomes form-generating in the “merry
                  tune” of Fable itself, woven by her spindle (rather than a weaving loom, which the
                  Writer was supposed to become in Novalis’ notes). This possibility coheres with a
                  central feature of Romantic poiesis: to extract a generative emergence from tendencies
                  toward disindividuation and to channel chaotic energy back into form.</p>
               <p>This pattern of Romantic poiesis can be found in other episodes in the fairy tale,
                  for example, when the subterranean Fates, operating in league with the Writer, find
                  themselves caught in the throes of the tarentella. The Fates are degraded to buzzing
                  flies and finally consumed by the tarantulas; they are “sucked to the marrow.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note49" id="Note49_return"><sup class="super">
                        (49)
                        </sup></a> The Fates, however, do not dissipate into song, but crystallize, transforming into
                  statues that appear at the end of the fairy tale as “caryatides of dark porphyry.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note50" id="Note50_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a> they have been de-potentiated into inorganic matter. The depotentiation of something
                  already depotentiated (the Fates as sheer non-productive, revolutionary rage) becomes
                  the source of a genesis (negation of the negative as positive). The subterranean powers,
                  now stabilizing structures, support the head of the marriage bed that will mark the
                  consummation of the utopian scene of social and political reconciliation. However,
                  the caryatides are not merely figures of stabilization; they integrate their previously
                  chaotic power in such a way that the erotic stage is uplifted, now swaying in the
                  air. The statues of the Fates, whose revolutionary energy has been brought to a standstill,
                  set the erogenous zone of reconciliation (the bed) into relation with the ground,
                  but in such a way that the ground itself is made to hover: “so that the earth floats
                  once again and does not lie on chaos.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note52" id="Note52_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>The Romantic unconditioning of the world—making the solidity of the earth sway in
                  relation to chaotic forces of disruption held at a distance—takes place through the
                  transformation of acoustic phenomena. Recall Novalis’ dictum that “sculpture is nothing
                  else but the figuristics of music.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note53" id="Note53_return"><sup class="super">
                        (53)
                        </sup></a> In this transformation of subterranean and anarchic entities into sculptural figures,
                  the solidity of the base is constructed by the waves, oscillations, and vibrations
                  from which it grew. The movement of these originally acoustic vibrations has been
                  arrested only partially, frozen in order to better bring the world into a hovering
                  relation to the ground. Although the transformation of the Writer into a loom does
                  not take place explicitly in the fairy tale, there remains nevertheless the spindle
                  that gathers the threads of Fable’s own being as part of a new collective order. In
                  the self-generation of this order, the spindle (<span style="font-style:italic">Spindel</span>) spins, repeats the whirling dance, duplicates its movements. The Writer, if he is
                  still a latent and invisible presence, has become a pure spinning movement—a tarantella
                  of the understanding—accompanied by the song of a fable that holds itself swaying
                  at a distance from the now subdued chaotic source, still drawing on its ineliminable
                  and disruptive energy.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">III. Schelling and the Repercussions of a Naturephilosophy of Sound</span></h2>
               <p>A significant source for the Romantic ontology of sound in relation to operations
                  of absolute unconditioning can be found in Schelling’s <span style="font-style:italic">Philosophy of Art</span>. Based on notes from lectures that Schelling held twice (1802/3 and 1804/5), the
                  <span style="font-style:italic">Philosophy of Art</span> formulates its central task as follows: “<span style="font-style:italic">the presentation in the ideal medium of the real element inherent in art</span>.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note54" id="Note54_return"><sup class="super">
                        (54)
                        </sup></a> What Schelling describes as presentation in an “ideal medium” is nothing other than
                  the generic definition of philosophy itself, one in which the absolute must be constructed.
                  Construction—the name of the philosophical method Schelling utilizes in the <span style="font-style:italic">Philosophy of Art</span>—brings what would otherwise remain as latent archetypal patterns into discursive
                  presence.<a class="note_back" href="#Note55" id="Note55_return"><sup class="super">
                        (55)
                        </sup></a> More importantly, to construct is not merely to represent, but to transform and transfigure
                  the real; it produces a way of looking at entities (the real) as products of an infinite,
                  absolute process, subject to a becoming without conditions. When regarded as such,
                  objects are extracted from their local contexts of significance and recast as paradigms
                  of ontological and cosmological form-generation: the philosophy of art does not analyze
                  this or that work, but “<span style="font-style:italic">the universe in the form of art</span>.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note56" id="Note56_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a> A physics of art comes to light in philosophical construction: art as cosmogenesis.</p>
               <p>What Schelling calls the “first dimension”<a class="note_back" href="#Note57" id="Note57_return"><sup class="super">
                        (57)
                        </sup></a>—indeed, the beginning of the entire construction of the philosophy of art through
                  which the materiality of the real expresses itself in the ideality of form—is that
                  of <span style="font-style:italic">sonority </span>(<span style="font-style:italic">Klang</span>). If music represents the “lowest” of the arts in the architectonics of Schelling’s
                  construction, it is also closest to nature in its primordial state, to that first
                  event through which “art breaks through into the world of representation.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note58" id="Note58_return"><sup class="super">
                        (58)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>Schelling accordingly describes sonority as the maximal presentation of the real,
                  of non-conscious matter, as registered within the world of sense and sentience: an
                  exteriority that lies at the core of interiority, approximating what Lacan would call
                  <span style="font-style:italic">extimacy</span>. Schelling describes this concept of sonority, one in which the body/mind (real/ideal)
                  distinction is simultaneously produced and suspended (in-differentiated), as the “intuition
                  of the soul of the body itself.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note59" id="Note59_return"><sup class="super">
                        (59)
                        </sup></a> Sonority is the form through which the body manifests itself as a necessary ontological
                  zone of emergence, hence as <span style="font-style:italic">soul </span>of the body.</p>
               <p>The soul here does not belong to a subject, but designates an impersonal process of
                  idealization. As such, music, which emerges from sonority, is not an art particular
                  to human beings; indeed, music does not require humanity for its realization. Music
                  belongs to the cosmos, even in its inorganic forms. The ear, then, becomes a privileged
                  (and paradoxical) organ of the inorganic, or that part of the human being most consonant
                  with inorganic modes of appearance. Schelling writes: “the roots of the sense of hearing
                  reside within anorganic nature, within magnetism. The hearing organ itself is merely
                  magnetism that has developed to organic perfection.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note60" id="Note60_return"><sup class="super">
                        (60)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>Schelling’s notion of the ear as a magnetic organ is predicated upon a paradigm shift
                  from mechanistic to dynamic theories of hearing; Chladni, for example, linked the
                  form-generation made visible on plates to oscillating elasticity (and hence mechanics)
                  rather than the play of forces (dynamics). The dynamic theory of hearing as it surfaces
                  in the <span style="font-style:italic">Philosophy of Art </span>had been prepared by Schelling’s earlier works of naturephilosophy (<span style="font-style:italic">Naturphilosophie</span>).<a class="note_back" href="#Note61" id="Note61_return"><sup class="super">
                        (61)
                        </sup></a> For example, in the <span style="font-style:italic">First Outline of a System of the Philosophy of Nature</span>, magnetism appears as the first category in the construction of matter (followed
                  by electricity and chemical processes<a class="note_back" href="#Note62" id="Note62_return"><sup class="super">
                        (62)
                        </sup></a>); magnetism “brought the first opposition into the universal identity of nature.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note63" id="Note63_return"><sup class="super">
                        (63)
                        </sup></a> Magnetism discloses oppositionality as an ontological structure operative at the
                  inorganic level that is reticulated at different levels of organization (potencies
                  that move from the inorganic to the organic to consciousness).</p>
               <p>The residual inorganic structure of the organ of hearing brings it into contact with
                  the central problem of nature itself: nature as it steps out of static equilibrium,
                  out of a condition of absolute rest, and into movement and productivity. Ian Biddle,
                  drawing on Schelling’s earlier naturephilosophical texts, ascribes a disruptive and
                  ungrounding force to the magnetism of the ear in this section of the <span style="font-style:italic">Philosophy of Art</span>, since magnetism occupies a “dark corner of the system” of naturephilosophy that
                  Schelling sometimes seems to approach with uncertainty.<a class="note_back" href="#Note64" id="Note64_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>However, if there is a dissonance or a darkness in sonority, in <span style="font-style:italic">The Philosophy of Art</span> Schelling represses this dissonance in favor of an affirmative notion of ontological
                  order. According to Schelling: “Within sonority we do not merely hear the simple tone
                  itself. Rather, we hear clothed, as it were, or imbedded in it a whole array of tones,
                  and we hear them such that the consonant ones predominate, instead of the dissonant
                  ones.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note65" id="Note65_return"><sup class="super">
                        (65)
                        </sup></a> Underlying this account of sound is a process of individuation that tips towards
                  the balance of the self-affirmation of nature as an infinite process; the oppositional
                  account of individuation characteristic of Schelling’s earlier naturephilosophy (individuated
                  forms as emergent from a disequilibrium in a conflict of forces, or form as indexing
                  the aberrant nature of appearances) has been supplanted in favor of the affirmative
                  account of individuation characteristic of his later identity philosophy (individuated
                  forms as emergent from the desire of nature to affirm itself).<a class="note_back" href="#Note66" id="Note66_return"><sup class="super">
                        (66)
                        </sup></a> Sound constitutes the primordial ontological field in which this shift is registered.</p>
               <p>The residue of an agonistic and dissonant ontology of individuation can nevertheless
                  still be detected in Schelling’s account of sound. Uncovering this residue requires
                  a closer examination of the distinction between two concepts of sound used by Schelling:
                  <span style="font-style:italic">resonance </span>(<span style="font-style:italic">Schall</span>) and <span style="font-style:italic">sonority </span>(<span style="font-style:italic">Klang</span>). Resonance (<span style="font-style:italic">Schall</span>) designates the generic operation of sound generation, and dissonance belongs essentially
                  to one of its possibilities. A body resonates when it conducts (“all resonance...
                  is conduction”<a class="note_back" href="#Note67" id="Note67_return"><sup class="super">
                        (67)
                        </sup></a>). Resonance [<span style="font-style:italic">Schall</span>] manifests itself as noise when it generates acoustic data that disintegrate into
                  incoherence, when “sound does not allow the unity in multiplicity to be recognized
                  clearly.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note68" id="Note68_return"><sup class="super">
                        (68)
                        </sup></a> Sonority supersedes this entropic pull toward disintegration through its power of
                  internal coherence, in which case multiplicity discloses itself as “a multiplicity
                  that affirms itself.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note69" id="Note69_return"><sup class="super">
                        (69)
                        </sup></a> However, at the most primordial level of individuation, resonance—or the power by
                  which sound can reach out and touch each thing (as something <span style="font-style:italic">conducted</span>)—constitutes a field in which both dissonance and affirmation, incommensurable multiplicity
                  and harmonious cohesion, are contained as latent possibilities.</p>
               <p>Starting from sound as the presentation of the inorganic within the organic, Schelling
                  constructs a series of bifurcations in which the dissonance of the real is progressively
                  filtered out: from resonance (in which dissonance still inheres as a possibility);
                  to sonority (in which consonance is generated and overcomes a still-present dissonance);
                  to music (in which consonance becomes a symbolic generator, “potence and symbol”<a class="note_back" href="#Note70" id="Note70_return"><sup class="super">
                        (70)
                        </sup></a> of the absolute producing itself through rhythm, harmony, and melody). Music, as
                  symbol of the absolute, becomes that form in which the generative dynamic of the absolute
                  in the modality of the real—productive material unconditioning—is brought into sensuous
                  presence. The progressive transfiguration of sound into sonority and then music corresponds
                  to an increase in the mythopoetic generativity of sound, or sound as a thought experiment
                  connected to other domains of existence: cosmological, religious, political.</p>
               <p>Absolute sound, in the form of music, is propulsive; in its most basic symbolic form,
                  it is more rhythmic than harmonious. Schelling thus describes rhythm as “the music
                  within music,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note71" id="Note71_return"><sup class="super">
                        (71)
                        </sup></a> calling rhythm the “predominating potence in music,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note72" id="Note72_return"><sup class="super">
                        (72)
                        </sup></a> which distills the function of music to its fundamental operation: to generate enough
                  regularity to recognize units, or discrete elements appearing <span style="font-style:italic">as </span>discrete elements; but also to generate enough multiplicity and variety such that
                  these units of sound never become monotonous and are constantly producing difference.
                  As the sensuous manifestation that most closely brushes up against the contingency
                  of sheer givenness, rhythm models the breakthrough of sense from non-sense, “the transformation
                  of an essentially meaningless succession into a meaningful one.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note73" id="Note73_return"><sup class="super">
                        (73)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>A close examination of the specifically naturephilosophical aesthetics of music, however,
                  reveals that the symbolic dimension of music—or music as <span style="font-style:italic">unconditioning</span> sound—is more expansive than stabilizing, more productive of difference than of unity.
                  Music is not limited to the human arts; drawing on Pythagoras, Schelling notes that
                  cosmic bodies (planets, stars) are ontologically homologous with music: not inasmuch
                  as they produce music in their spinning, but inasmuch as they <span style="font-style:italic">are </span>music in their very manner of being, in the forces with which they are identical.
                  Schelling writes: “The cosmic bodies float on the wings of harmony and rhythm. That
                  which one calls centripetal and centrifugal force is nothing other than harmony and
                  rhythm, respectively. Elevated by the same wings, music floats in space to weave an

                  taken as self-evident)—as force. Schelling associates rhythm in particular with centrifugal
                  force, or an expansiveness that in naturephilosophical terms corresponds to an overcoming
                  of boundaries. Schelling correlates harmony with centripetal force, or the yearning
                  for coherence, translated into sound. When Schelling claims that the predominating
                  potence of music is rhythm—that rhythm is the music within music—he thus locates the
                  specific force of music in a propulsive energetics.</p>
               <p>Music—its generative and propulsive force—will be everywhere present, latent in every
                  being, in every form of art and in every movement of discourse. Music also inheres
                  in political and collective bodies; or rather, collective bodies disclose their internal
                  tendencies musically. Every gathering of human beings produces a musical form that
                  expresses its inner tendencies. Music that is predominantly harmonic rather than rhythmic,
                  as the “expression of striving and yearning,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note75" id="Note75_return"><sup class="super">

                  the music of the Church, that of the Greek polis is rhythmical and expansive: “one

                  center and is restorative), Schelling seeks to cultivate an ear attuned to the rhythms
                  of antiquity (which flees the center and is energetic) to awaken a countertendency
                  of expansive force in musical form.</p>
               <p>Schelling’s philosophy of music thereby harnesses a primordial tendency toward difference
                  and multiplicity in a form of art (music) that stands in for the event of art itself,
                  for the breakthrough of meaning against a background of meaninglessness. The emergence
                  of art is characterized by a fundamental ambivalence. It brings to the surface a dissonant
                  and incomprehensible real only to suppress this form of the real through progressive
                  potentiation (resonance, sonority, music). At the same time, sound comprises the central
                  medium through which the momentum of centrifugality—a transgressive and difference-generating
                  expansion—achieves symbolic elevation, seeping into material and discursive forms.
                  Philosophical construction itself, in its production of the absolute, must also be
                  rhythmic in this manner. Novalis writes in reference to Fichte: “Fichte has done nothing
                  else than discover the rhythm of philosophy, and expressed it in a verbal acoustic
                  manner.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note80" id="Note80_return"><sup class="super">

                  to the overwhelmingly stabilizing harmonic collective forms of modernity (the <span style="font-style:italic">polis </span>as counterforce to the Church; Nietzsche would take this insight further in <span style="font-style:italic">The Birth of Tragedy</span>), another speculative possibility can be drawn from Schelling’s philosophy of music:
                  a collective form whose musical expression would produce a harmonic and centripetal
                  counterforce capable of counteracting the violent potential in the expansive and assimilative
                  propulsion of rhythm, but without producing an overcontraction into homogeneous communal
                  groupings. The form of the collective that could or would produce such music as an
                  ontological expression of its internal tendencies remains unthematized by Schelling.
                  Such would be the unspoken melodic (equally rhythmic <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>harmonic) utopian form of Schelling’s philosophy of music.</p>

               <p>The shift from a mechanical to a dynamic concept of sound—from wave oscillation produced
                  through the collision and elasticity of bodies (Chladni) to oscillation as a result
                  of magnetic or electrical forces (Ritter and Ørsted)—enlarges the field of auditory
                  sensibility as well as the discursive and aesthetic potentiality of sound. Central
                  to this expansion of possibilities in the idea of electrical acoustics is the phenomenon
                  of shock. For Hans Christian Ørsted, sound generated by contact gives rise to a mechanical-dynamic
                  feedback loop of shock intensification through electricity: <span class="quote">‘The compression and the consequent expansion which take place in every soundwave
                     produce ... [an] electrical alternation. Such an alternation between electrical states
                     must also take place in the ear, but each transition from one electrical state to
                     another produces a shock, however weak it may be. Each sound is accompanied by a great
                     many such shocks one following the other.<a class="note_back" href="#Note81" id="Note81_return"><sup class="super">

                  the domain of sensibility by virtue of the imperceptible shocks that it constantly
                  receives, as “frequent alternation increases the sensitivity of the ear even more.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note82" id="Note82_return"><sup class="super">

                  electric collisions that bombard the human sensory apparatus into the training ground
                  for an ecstatic askesis. The barrage of electrical shocks pushes the capacities of
                  the organ toward transcendence. Oscillations become so fast that “the speed of vibrations
                  becomes too great to be perceived by the ear.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note83" id="Note83_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>Johann Wilhelm Ritter, in dialogue with Ørsted, brings the expansion of electrical-acoustic
                  shock—and its utopian, absolute character—into continuity with form-generating functions
                  ascribed to writing, with technologies of inscription. Every tone, because it oscillates,
                  generates figures, inscribes itself in the real: <span class="quote">‘All oscillation however yields tone and thereby word. But the excited electricity

                  the human being can relate itself as it would to a foreign daemonic power. The figurative
                  power of tone, once it is scaled upwards into other domains, enters into proximity
                  (if not identity) with human beings themselves and simultaneously indicates a power

                  political and religious experimentation, Ritter and Ørsted transform the nature of
                  hearing itself, which thenceforth exposes the human being to capacious and experimental
                  ways of being in the world: as the transcendence of shock for Ørsted, or as the continuous
                  electrical production of shapes and figures for Ritter.</p>
               <p>Romantic lyric and narrative forms, albeit with different resources at their disposal,
                  equally explore the ramifications of unconditioning sound. One of the most prominent
                  examples of this experimental practice can be found in the lyric of Joseph von Eichendorff.
                  An early poem composed by Eichendorff in 1808 (“Sestime”) constructs a conceptual
                  Romantic sixfold—flowing, rustling, dreams, sky, stars, songs—in the repeating, shifting
                  constellation dictated by the form of the sestina. Eichendorff’s “Sestime” is modeled
                  on the medieval sestina, a form in which words at the ends of lines are repeated according
                  to a system of rules (the last end-word of one stanza becomes the first end-word of
                  the following one; the first end-word becomes the second end-word in the next stanza;
                  and so forth). In a reading of Arnaut Daniel’s sestina “Lo ferm voler qu’el cor m’intra,”
                  Giorgio Agamben claims that the sestina (and lyric more generally) discloses a different
                  form of temporality than that of everyday succession or progression: messianic time,
                  “the time that the poem takes to come to an end,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note93" id="Note93_return"><sup class="super">
                        (93)
                        </sup></a> as manifested in the particular temporal lyric constellations structured by recall
                  and anticipation.</p>
               <p>If Eichendorff’s sestina, like Arnaut’s, participates in this constellated temporality,
                  it nevertheless virtualizes the nesting of temporal echoes such that the very notion
                  of an end is retemporalized, or temporalized beyond its internal system of correspondences,
                  beyond the resonant unfolding of end-words in anticipation and remembrance. In Eichendorff’s
                  sestina, lyric temporality oscillates between a singular punctuation of time, the
                  repetition of a succession, and the index of an eternal nunc stans: “Always will I
                  be kneeling under this sky / That with eternal Lent seeks to flow to me.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note94" id="Note94_return"><sup class="super">

                        (98)
                        </sup></a> Eichendorff makes sonorous transformation in the context of the lyric into a reversible
                  oscillation, one in which the lyric act can be rhythmically de-semanticized and conceptually
                  re-semanticized.</p>
               <p>Eichendorff’s lyric semantically potentiates and depotentiates itself at every moment:
                  stars, moons, and flowers can be imaginatively called forth in their conceptual referentiality,
                  just as they can tend toward rhythm—although never <span style="font-style:italic">pure </span>rhythm, since some conceptuality will remain, at least as a residue. In a peculiar
                  inversion, it is the <span style="font-style:italic">concept </span>that constitutes the ineliminable remainder of Eichendroff’s lyric rather than noise;
                  the concept (or semantic determinacy) forms the background against which noise emerges,
                  rather than the other way around. In the sestina, Eichendorff couples the philosophical
                  ideal of the concept (i.e. the intellectual contemplation of forms) with an ecstatic
                  loss of awareness—bringing contemplation and rapture into a zone of indistinction—at
                  the precise instance in which the strict identity of the sestina’s form is loosened,
                  when intoxication ( Berauschen: more precisely, the infinitive as substantive, and
                  thus the act of intoxicating made into a concept) supplants rustling (rauschen: gazing
                  at the sweet intoxication of such beauty(Betrachtend solcher Schöne süß’ Berauschen).
                  When rustling becomes inebriation, rauschen becomes Berauschen, it is not beauty in
                  its eternal form that is contemplated, but rather, its intoxicating effect. The purely
                  formal-intellectual nature of beauty is thus unconditioned by sensuous, semantic and
                  phonic displacements in the shift from rauschen to berauschen.</p>
               <p>If Eichendorff’s lyric experimentation with unconditioning sound nevertheless maintains
                  itself in orbit around the ideal, a divergent and more perverse form of acoustic unconditioning
                  can be found in the work of E.T.A. Hoffmann, himself a composer and known for his
                  characterization of Beethoven’s music as the “the realm of the tragic and illimitable.”

                  his novella The Fermata, a work in which Hoffmann does not ascend to the ineffability
                  of music, but descends into its molecular and material basis in order to conjure forth
                  its deviant power. The narrative experiment begins, as in Novalis’ Heinrich von Ofterdingen,
                  in a sort of crucible, in the confinement of a provincial town, where every “foreign
                  appearance”<a class="note_back" href="#Note99" id="Note99_return"><sup class="super">
                        (99)
                        </sup></a> has an “electric effect” <a class="note_back" href="#Note100" id="Note100_return"><sup class="super">
                        (100)
                        </sup></a> on a young man, the narrator of the story. The main electrical event of the tale
                  is occasioned by the appearance of two Italian female singers who strike the narrator
                  with the force of a “magical spell”<a class="note_back" href="#Note101" id="Note101_return"><sup class="super">
                        (101)
                        </sup></a> (Zauberschlag), using musical polarities to jolt him out of a complacent fit with
                  his normative system up until that point. The two musicians make the narrator into
                  a conductor for an electrical (simultaneously musical and erotic) current passing
                  back and forth, alternating between aesthetic paradigms as if between the plus and
                  minus of a voltaic pile: Lauretta and Teresina (the two musicians), representing respectively
                  artifice and nature, ornament and simplicity, surface and depth, opera buffa and tragic
                  opera. Each of these will, and each in their turn, embody an ideal that produces an
                  aesthetic attunement to the world for the narrator. However, the story does not establish
                  the ideal and fix it in place. On the contrary, it describes the means whereby the
                  ideal (or the vacillation between multiple ideals) is perpetually dislodged; it discharges
                  singular entities or beings as bearers of symbolic significance. What comes to light
                  in Hoffmann’s tale, then, is the disruption of the ideal as a new, second-order concept
                  of ontological order.</p>
               <p>The discharging of the ideal takes place at a moment of particular temporal significance
                  in the story indicated by the title: in the fermata. The fermata is not just a motif,
                  but an ontological operation, indeed, a space of religious redemption; in the fermata,
                  a woman is represented as singing a cadenza “with a gaze directed towards the heavens.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note102" id="Note102_return"><sup class="super">
                        (102)
                        </sup></a> Following Agamben’s suggestion in his analysis of the sestina’s messianic time, the
                  thrust of time in the fermata seems teleologically laden as it moves towards its end,
                  a moment of fulfillment when regular temporality, a tempo, is restored and the orchestra—the
                  tutti, all individuals as a collective form—rejoins the individual.</p>
               <p>However, in the redemptive momentum of the fermata there lies a significant potential
                  for deviation, and it is this disruptive power that fascinates Hoffmann. If, for Schelling,
                  rhythm is the music of music and hence the means by which it produces itself as the
                  absolute, the function of the fermata is to suspend rhythmic regularity and predictability:
                  it places the beat (tact) in abeyance, pausing and extending the flow of time in such
                  a way that unexpected sound figures come into appearance. The fermata—above all in
                  the context of the narrative—makes possible a space of individuation outside the dictates
                  of the collective (the orchestral tutti) and a temporality outside universal time
                  (it is not a tempo). Drawing on the etymology of the fermata from fermare: it stops
                  the beat. </p>
               <p>The threshold signaling the restoration of temporal and collective order is generally
                  marked by the trill of the soloist, at which point the conductor must guide the orchestra
                  to enter at precisely the right moment, in the <span style="font-style:italic">kairos</span> of a temporal suspension brought to fulfillment. Hoffmann’s narrative reflects this
                  logic: the trill anticipating the end of the fermata is described as the “highest
                  moment,” the one “that would set everyone into amazement [<span style="font-style:italic">staunen</span>].”<a class="note_back" href="#Note103" id="Note103_return"><sup class="super">
                        (103)
                        </sup></a> The trill is a significant symbolic operator; in the context of the naturephilosophical
                  materialism of sound, the trill is nothing other than the explicit enactment of the
                  structure of sound itself as oscillation. The latent ontological dynamic of sound—what
                  Ørsted grasped as continually alternating electrical shocks in rapid succession between
                  polarities—finds its most apt representational form in the trill. The restoration
                  of order, the moment when suspended time is supposed to rejoin regular time, occurs
                  in tandem with the symbolization of sound in its basic ontological structure.</p>
               <p>In the work of Hoffmann, however, it is messianic time that must be disrupted at all
                  costs. Everything must go wrong. The scene is described as follows, described from
                  the perspective of the narrator who is accompanying the soloist (Lauretta) as she
                  intends to bring her cadenza to a conclusion in the fermata: <span class="quote">‘We came to the last <span style="font-style:italic">fermata</span>. Lauretta exerted all her skill and art; she warbled trill after trill like a nightingale,
                     executed sustained notes, then long elaborate roulades—a whole <span style="font-style:italic">solfeggio</span>. In fact, I thought she was almost carrying the thing too far this time; I felt a
                     soft breath on my cheek; Teresina stood behind me. At this moment Lauretta took a
                     good start with the intention of swelling up to a ‘harmonic shake’ and so passing
                     back into <span style="font-style:italic">a tempo.</span> The devil entered into me; I jammed down the keys with both hands; the orchestra
                     followed suit; and it was all over with Lauretta’s trill, just at the supreme moment
                     when she was to excite everyone’s astonishment.<a class="note_back" href="#Note104" id="Note104_return"><sup class="super">
                           (104)
                           </sup></a>’</span></p>
               <p>If the trill is nothing other than the order of sound made explicit, another type
                  of oscillation comes to the foreground in this scene: the moment at which one figure
                  of symbolic mediation falls out of ideality and is transferred to another. In the
                  wake of this event, an erotic and aesthetic transference takes place in the narrator
                  from Lauretta to Teresina; Teresina appears at the precise moment of disruption and
                  is thus correlated with the interruption of the auspicious moment, the misfire of
                  the <span style="font-style:italic">kairos</span>. What is eternalized and made generative in Hoffmann’s tale is precisely not the
                  restoration of order as the supreme aesthetic moment, but the interruption that makes
                  this second-order deviant oscillation of things into the very source of aesthetic
                  power. In accordance with an ontology in which the ideal itself must be made present
                  only in order to be deposed—discharged so that another charge can take its place—Teresina
                  too will fall out of ideality, as will, perhaps, the narrator himself.</p>
               <p>The fermata—and its disruption—repeats itself in different forms, different mediated
                  channels, throughout the narrative. It becomes its own aesthetic-ontological archetype
                  and is infinitely generative, disclosing an absolute process of signification. It
                  can be found in the painting <span style="font-style:italic">The Fermata </span>(1814) by Johann Erdmann Hummel, the viewing of which is the occasion for telling
                  the tale itself (the fermata thus produces the tale of its own production, <span style="font-style:italic">ad infinitum</span>).<a class="note_back" href="#Note105" id="Note105_return"><sup class="super">
                        (105)
                        </sup></a> Moreover, the paining, through the representation of yet <span style="font-style:italic">another</span> fermata diabolically ruined, fixes this failure in place—making the interruption
                  of the fermata into a second-order fermata by extending its temporal scope into eternity.
                  Visually fixed in place, the fermata can never be brought to completion. When the
                  painting appears in the story, it too conducts an electrical charge, striking its
                  viewer with yet another magic blow, a <span style="font-style:italic">Zauberschlag</span>. The electrical conduction of this charge is the primary purpose of Hoffmann’s fermata,
                  both within the story and as the story itself. The burst of energy released in the
                  failure of the redemptive moment is not traumatic, but the condition itself of a form
                  of unconditioning art—an art that nourishes itself not from the presence of the ideal,
                  but from its malfunction.</p>
               <p>For significant strands of the German Romantic tradition, sound discloses fundamental
                  ontology as an oscillation of the real, the real <span style="font-style:italic">as</span> oscillation: a trembling of things that moves through all individuated forms, material
                  and spiritual. In their speculative philosophical and aesthetic experiments with sound,
                  the most intimate experiences of the world become the most alien. It is not just that
                  sound indicates the absolute as that which is unconditioned, but that it constructs
                  the real as a material-ideal system in the process of turning against itself, moving
                  amidst the peaks and troughs of waves, perpetually unconditioning itself and carrying
                  all beings along in its wake. When Novalis develops chemical acoustics as a power
                  of figuration dependent upon the inhibition of the tendency toward dissolution; when
                  he seeks in the music of the fairy tale a vertiginous art capable of creating a semi-stable,
                  hovering relation to a chaotic ground; when Schelling claims a power of affirmation
                  over negation in the potentiation of sound from noise to sonority to music, culminating
                  in the manner in which collectives produce musical forms—<span style="font-style:italic">are</span> themselves musical forms—that reveal their internal developmental tendencies; when
                  Ørsted grasps sound as the perpetuation of a continually intensifying shock; when
                  Ritter understands tone as electrical figuration (nature writing itself) moving through
                  human consciousness in a manner that is foreign to it; when Eichendorff posits a field
                  of rustling intoxication (<span style="font-style:italic">Rauschen</span> / <span style="font-style:italic">Berauschen</span>) that oscillates between noise and concept, intoxication and intellection; and when
                  Hoffmann develops an electrical aesthetics to maintain beings in a constant state
                  of perverse non-identity with the ideal—we see that it is not sufficient for the German
                  Romantics to describe sound and its material or ideal basis; rather, the latent dynamics
                  emergent from the speculative and aesthetic encounter with sound must be redirected
                  back into the world: as an art of unconditioning.</p>

               or not his concept of the real is constitutive or merely regulative (a Kantian “idea

               is to downplay rather than intensify the constitutive tensions in Novalis’ discourse,
