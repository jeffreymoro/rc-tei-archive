            <p>The opening sentences of one of the paradigmatic novels of German Romanticism,
                Novalis’ <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi> (1802), are infused with
                the rhythms of an unlikely dyad: the wind and the clock. The wind and the clock,
                working with and against one another, represent the initial conditions of a Romantic
                experiment in which a restless desire is awakened within the confines of the
                bourgeois household:
                
            <quote>The parents were already sleeping, the clock on the wall beat its monotonous tact,
                before the rattling windows whistled the wind; and the chamber was lit in
                alternation from the shimmer of the moon. The youth lay restless in his bed and
                recalled the stranger [<hi rend="italic">des Fremden</hi>] and his stories.<note

           What follows is well known to readers of German Romantic literature: the walls of the
                room dissolve into a phantasmagoria of infinite distances, oceanic depths, caves and
                cliffs, death and rebirth, dreams within dreams, and somehow, impossibly, a peculiar
                clarity and distinction, and then: the erotic blue flower, simultaneously woman and
                plant, sexuated and hermaphroditic. This room is no mere room, but a womb, a matrix
                of emergence for a way of feeling and thinking that is fundamentally alien, at odds
                with the intelligibility of everyday life. Heinrich, pondering his attraction to the
                blue flower, declares: “No one can and no one will understand this.”<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi

            </p>
                   
            <p>Let us linger with the wind and the clock in the first sentence. Caught up in a
                narrative momentum driven towards the oneiric revelation of the blue flower, it is
                easy to overlook the function of these initial objects as figures in an acoustic
                drama, or rather, as indices of a metaphysical drama in acoustic form. One is
                tempted to reduce these two objects, in traditional terms, to the function of
                setting—to background conditions against which an event takes place. Not only are

            <p>Material vibrations, waves, oscillations, collisions—all taking place below the
                threshold of conscious perception—can be amplified in Romantic thought into
                larger-scale domains: from language to the soul, from acoustics to physiology, from
                wave oscillations to the modification of human sensuous capacities. In the words of

                remarkable, not least because Novalis at times prioritizes chemical processes that
                tend toward form-dissolution, in line with the Romantic chemical quest for a
                universal solvent; the chemical principle “is contrary to the

                entities in an infinite process of emergence that knows neither limit nor bound,
                thereby disrupting the material and normative conditions of existence that govern
                the intelligibility of everyday life. This essay examines paradigmatic instances of
                Romantic thought experiments with unconditioning sound: in the intersection between
                acoustic phenomena and the operations of the unconditioned absolute in Novalis’
                scientific and philosophical fragments; in <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von

                Hoffmann’s electrical-musical aesthetics that does not posit an ineffable ideal as
                the telos of Romantic poiesis, but seeks to permanently hold the ideal at bay,
                indeed, to ontologically secure the irreducible gap between real and ideal as the
                basis for a diabolic and extra-normative generativity.</p>
                   
            <p>In each of these instances, sound constitutes a privileged site in which the
                potentially agonistic forces of the unconditioned can be intensified, harnessed, and
                redirected. In his philosophical fragments, Novalis posits the unconditioned as the
                endpoint of an impossible desire. The first of his fragments in the collection
                    <hi rend="italic">Pollen </hi>(<hi rend="italic"
                    >Blüthenstaub</hi>) reads: “We seek everywhere the unconditioned, and always

                            rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 2:413.</note> Thus, in the first
                sentence of <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>, the wind and the clock
                are <hi rend="italic">only things</hi>. At the same time, they are things of a
                special sort, as they disclose the desire for the unconditioned in their
                organization and disorganization of the sensible. The clock brings appearances into
                an acoustic schema of regularity and unity: it sounds in regular beats, in <hi
                    rend="italic">tact</hi>, and its acoustic-formal principle is uniformity
                (monotony), in German, <hi rend="italic">einförmig</hi>. The acoustic-formal
                principle of the wind is stochastic; it does not beat, but swishes (<hi
                    rend="italic">saust</hi>), rattling against the speculative frame (the window).
                The two objects represent two opposing paradigms of acoustic organization, although
                to a certain extent, they depend on one another: the stochastic noise of the wind
                appears as a disruption of the order and regularity of the clock, just as the beat
                of the clock (as tact) allows the chaotic energy of the wind to be registered.</p>
                   
            <p>If there is something like an absolute, then, it is to be found not in a thing (wind
                or clock), but in a circulation of desire between things, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >unconditioning</hi> of symbolic bearers of ontological order, where
                unconditioning means: 1) the capacity to manifest a process of organization to which
                no condition or limit can be ascribed; 2) the incapacity of any singular thing to
                manifest this process absolutely. The clash or dissonance between these two
                percussive acoustic events, an oscillation between order and disorder, establishes
                the ontological field of the Romantic aesthetic experiment—an experiment that
                ultimately provides the framework in which the protagonist of the novel is propelled
                out of the normalizing constraints of bourgeois desire. </p>
                   
            <p>Significant is nevertheless that <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>
                opens with a sensorium operating at the level of base materiality: sound rather than
                sonority. The differentiation of sonority (<hi rend="italic">Klang</hi>) from sound
                    (<hi rend="italic">Schall</hi>) is one of the central conditions in the
                construction of sound as an epistemic phenomenon at this time; in Ernst Florens

                (rather than the dynamic, force-based paradigm that would become central to

                of movement simultaneously material, conceptual, and ontological. Oscillatory
                movements suffuse both mind and matter, bringing these domains into a zone of
                indifferentiation (the establishment of such indifference points between mind and

                between extremes—referring in this context to Fichte’s concept of the productive

                Oscillation, either in material acoustic form, as <hi rend="italic">Schwingung</hi>,
                or in its correlative form in consciousness, as <hi rend="italic">Schweben</hi>,
                represents an operation of fundamental ontology in Romantic thought. To approach
                reality through oscillation between extremes—i.e. between subject and object,
                regularity and disorder, clock and wind—is thus to approach the real immanently. At
                the same time, the real is inconsistent with itself, turns back upon itself; the
                movement of oscillation indexes this inconsistency.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        An important strand in scholarship on Novalis is
                            dedicated to the question of whether or not his concept of the real is
                            constitutive or merely regulative (a Kantian “idea of reason”); the
                            latter has been cogently defended in Manfred Frank,

                Johann Wilhelm Ritter) considers the word to be originally tone, he does not cast
                this primordial musicality of language as tantamount to a pure idealization of the
                word, linking it to something mystically ineffable or disembodied. On the contrary,
                primordial speech as tone sets into motion a physiological spiritualization: the
                surrounding air becomes a Chladni plate upon which the human breath calls forms (as
                words) into being. Novalis writes: “Vowels are strings of sound or <hi rend="italic"

                Such noise would not have been generative or figurative for Chladni, as it is not
                sonorous. Novalis is nevertheless attracted to the non-generative as an essential
                part of the aesthetic exercise; noise thus resurfaces at critical points in Romantic
                projects of transfiguration, and not merely as that which must be rejected, but as
                an expansion of aesthetic possibility. According to Bettine Menke, the Romantic
                paradigm destabilizes the dominant trajectories of western musical and poetic
                systems that ascend from sound to tone to speech, instead bringing hearers into a

            <p>In <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>, the initial encounter between
                wind and clock approaches acoustic phenomena in this manner, oscillating between an
                excess of regularity in differentiation (<hi rend="italic">tact</hi>) and a
                stochastic and noisy material substratum
                (<hi rend="italic">swishing </hi>and <hi rend="italic"
                    >rattling</hi>). However, the Romantic experiment of the novel goes farther than
                merely foregrounding the metaphysical and ontological significance of acoustic
                phenomena; it <hi rend="italic">amplifies</hi> this acoustic material, diffuses it
                in the very shape of the mythemes and forms of life in social and political
                experiments. As Jocelyn Holland shows in reference to the works of Romantic
                physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter, acoustic symbols that stand in for absolute
                material dynamics can be led back to a more primordial substratum, a form of
                silence, whose adequate representation would require “nothing less than the

                facilitates processes of individuation (albeit, as we have seen, in a manner that
                depends upon processes of dissolution), expands into sensuous, poetic, and
                mathematical domains, ultimately providing the material basis for the
                world-transfiguring scope of poetry. Poetry, as that field of activity through which

            <p><hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>, as we have seen, begins with the
                acoustic problem of touch, of tact. The concept of tact (<hi rend="italic"
                >Takt</hi>), according to Anders Engberg-Pedersen, encompasses two different
                paradigms of order in the Romantic period: an order of regularity, of arrangement
                (tact as <hi rend="italic">taxis</hi>); and a subjective inner sense deriving from
                the sense of touch (tact as <hi rend="italic">tangere</hi>).<note place="foot"

                The clock at the outset of the narrative—already an ironic anachronism for a tale
                that takes place in the Middle Ages (an <hi rend="italic">ana-chronistic</hi>
                clock)—establishes a tact that monotonously individuates forms and thus is
                associated more with <hi rend="italic" >taxis </hi>than <hi
                    rend="italic">tangere</hi>. The ticking of the clock organizes acoustic material
                as something uni-form (<hi rend="italic">einförmig</hi>). One of the central
                problems of the novel confronts initial conditions that are uniform and seeks to
                differentiate them, to individuate in a way that multiplies difference. The
                condition of the clock, of regular time, of uni-formity, must be <hi rend="italic"

                tangential notions of rhythm (<hi rend="italic">tangere</hi>), or rhythm as it spins
                off into unexpected directions in worldly encounters. It must be noted that Novalis
                sees the concept of world as imbricated with rhythm, as
                <hi rend="italic" >essentially </hi>rhythmical: “If we take away

            <p>The aestheticization of sound as <hi rend="italic">music</hi> gives rise to strange
                oscillations, or sound catastrophically amplified into other mediated forms,
                ultimately encompassing the totality of social, erotic, and political relations.
                Novalis explores these oscillations as part of an aesthetic experiment: how can one
                <hi rend="italic" >de-form </hi>the world in such a way that new
                rhythms emerge? And where can one find an experimental space in which strange

                they are in Novalis’ works (in
                <hi rend="italic" >The Novices at Sais </hi>and <hi
                    rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>)—the fairy tale punctuates the
                forward motion of narrative time, suspending the logic of the prosaic world and
                producing something dramatically different. In his theoretical writings, Novalis
                hints that the fairy tale can be approached acoustically. Novalis writes: “The fairy
                tale is entirely <hi rend="italic">musical</hi>.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic" 
                        >Notes,</hi> 174.</note>
                It is musical not merely thematically, as a form that privileges sound—when music is
                coaxed from a lyre and the fields of ice and the cliffs ring in resonant response
                (as happens in Klingohr’s fairy tale in <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von
                    Ofterdingen</hi>)—but musical in its very being, in the way it establishes
                contact with the vibration of the real before organized differentiation imposes
                order on the world. The musicality of the fairy tale indicates a world “devoid of
                all coherence,”<note place="foot" resp="author">Novalis, <hi
                            rend="italic"

                into sensuous form. Novalis writes: “Nothing is more contrary to the spirit of a
                fairy tale—than a moral destiny—a lawful relation.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic" >Notes,</hi> 158.</note>
                The fairy tale functions as a source of romanticizing practices inasmuch as it
                participates in an anarchic freedom prior to the differentiation of law; it is this
                participation in anarchic primordiality that facilitates the emergence of a future
                both generative and unpredictable (chaotic) as well as rational (as it has passed
                <hi rend="italic">through </hi>the law). The central function
                of the fairy tale is thus to establish a zone of indifference between reason and
                chaos that culminates in the potentiation of both domains (reason and chaos):
                “<hi rend="italic" >rational </hi>chaos—chaos suffused with
                itself—inside and outside of itself—<hi rend="italic"

                the fairy tale told by Klingsohr, seem to belie this theory. Commentators and
                critics have noted that the Klingsohr fairy tale in particular appears
                overdetermined, almost allegorical, consciously constructed and ultimately
                restorative in intent rather than anarchic and contingent.<note place="foot"

                It seems to culminate in an order approximating a moral destiny. </p>
                    
            <p>Uncovering the chaotic substratum of the fairy tale demands an attentive ear, an ear
                attuned to conditions of emergence that fold the stability of an apparent
                <hi rend="italic" >telos </hi>into a vortex of becoming.
                Attending to the musicality of the fairy tale can bring its latent anarchic dynamics
                into presence; submerged acoustic fields destabilize the operations of political
                restoration at the very moment in which they seem to reach their apotheosis. An
                exoteric (outwardly directed) reparation of the wounded political body is thus
                accompanied by an esoteric (internally present) process of unconditioning. </p>
                    
            <p>If the fairy tale is “entirely musical,” then the final note of Klingsohr’s fairy
                tale—and along with it, the telos of acoustic figuration—seems to re-establish the
                stability of monarchical governance after an explosion of revolutionary violence.
                The notoriously complex fairy tale unfolds through a series of crises that overturn
                domestic (familial) and political (monarchical) orders in an upheaval unleashed by
                subterranean forces, led by a figure known only as the Writer: a paradoxical figure
                inasmuch as he is equated in Novalis’ notes with the understanding (<hi
                    rend="italic">der Verstand</hi>), although his revolutionary energy is
                conspicuously fueled by resentment and hatred (or perhaps this is not paradoxical,
                but historical: the sleep of reason produces monsters). The power of Fable,
                personified as the ostensible protagonist of the tale, overwhelms the subterranean
                forces (the Fates) led by the Writer and brings the tale to a close by weaving the
                previously wounded community together in a spinning song. The fairy tale ends with a
                scene of political rapprochement between a newly crowned monarchical pair and the
                multitude, each reconciled to the other through sympathetic resonance: after the
                king embraces [<hi rend="italic">umarmt</hi>] the queen, “one heard nothing except
                tender names and the whispering of kisses”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi
                            rend="italic" >Schriften</hi>, 1: 315.</note> circulate among the
                crowd. This scene of erotic reconciliation nevertheless conceals an esoteric
                symbolic and political revolution; the dynastic continuity of the monarchy has been
                contaminated by integrating a member of a lower order (<hi rend="italic">Eros</hi>,
                born from the domestic realm and transplanted into the astral, monarchical realm)
                into its chain of succession. Any political restoration is thus fundamentally
                impure. </p>
                    
            <p>The impurity of the final scene can also be deduced from its acoustic conditions; the
                purported symbolic fulfillment takes place in contact with sonic material that is
                more erotic noise than intelligible <hi rend="italic">logos</hi>. The emergence of
                the new political-social regime culminates in two different sonic modes at the end
                of the fairy tale: erotic whispering (<hi rend="italic">Kußgeflüster</hi>) and the
                spinning song. The disindividuated crowd is bound together by noise on the threshold
                of audibility (<hi rend="italic">Geflüster</hi>), while individuated symbolic
                figures (Fable, Sophie, Phoenix) stand out against this thrumming ground—in Fable’s
                case, as <hi rend="italic">song</hi> (organized sound) rather than <hi rend="italic"
                    >murmur</hi> (undifferentiated noise).<note place="foot" resp="author"
                            >The whispering or murmuring of the crowd represents an acoustic event appropriate to the transient appearance of an undifferentiated mass, gathered together (<hi

See Michele Speitz, “The Wordsworthian Acoustic Imagination, Sonic Recursions, and ‘that dying murmur,’” <hi

                Sonic modes at the end of the fairy tale thus correspond to a relation between
                individuated figure and a non-differentiated ground. However, Fable is not merely
                singing; she is also <hi rend="italic">spinning</hi>, generating social-symbolic
                threads. The threads that she spins are drawn from her own body; when a hero
                (Perseus) gives her the gift of a spindle in gratitude for this restoration of
                order, he exclaims: “In your hands this spindle shall make us eternally rejoice, and
                out of yourself you shall spin an unbreakable golden thread.”<note place="foot"

            <p>Fable’s song sings of eternity and eternalization, of grounding, reconciliation, and
                an overcoming of the ephemerality of pain. However, at the moment of its
                enunciation, the song is accompanied by the rotary motion of the spindle:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
            <l>Fable spun diligently and sang with a clear voice:</l>
            <l>Founded (<hi rend="italic">gegründet</hi>) is the realm of eternity,</l>
            <l>In love and peace conflict ends,</l>
            <l>Gone the long dream of pain, </l>
            <l>Sophie is eternally priestess of hearts.</l><note place="foot" resp="author"> Novalis, <hi rend="italic" >Schriften</hi>, 1: 315.</note>
                </lg>
         
           The promise of reconciliation that takes place within the song cannot be isolated
                from the spinning source of its genesis, a source that folds all stabilizing
                operations of grounding into the gyrations of becoming. Spinning is, in a certain
                sense, Fable’s basic operation, and this final gesture must be considered
                motivically in relation to other instances of rotary motion, as repetitions or
                resignifications of these instances; earlier in the tale, Fable draws upon the
                spinning song as a source of (counter-) revolutionary violence, in the musical form
                of the tarantella: “During [Fable’s] song, from all sides, tarantulas appeared, they
                drew a shining net over the blades of grass, and they moved themselves to the beat
                    [<hi rend="italic">nach dem Takte</hi>] on their threads.... Her strings never
                rested, and the tarantulas followed the enchanting sounds on fast-woven
                    threads.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Novalis, <hi
                            rend="italic" >Schriften</hi>, 1: 307.</note> In this instance,
                Fable’s song summons threads that transmit rhythms and micro-oscillations, making
                the world into a resonance chamber, one in which the slightest movement can be
                detected by the sensitive organs of the spider: the monotonous
                <hi rend="italic">tact </hi>of the clock at the beginning of
                the novel is thus transformed into a different regime of acoustic transmission in
                the fairy tale (the only other appearance of <hi rend="italic">Takt</hi> in the
                novel). This form of tact becomes a channel for a release of energy: a destructive
                tendency that must either exhaust itself (dissipate) or be sublimated into form. It
                is this latter function that Fable’s song seeks to realize.</p>

                According to the account as popularized by Athanasius Kircher, the musical notes and
                the whirling bodies in the dance are supposed to counteract the poison coursing
                through the body. The tarantella of Fable’s song positions itself obliquely to this
                tradition. Fable’s spinning song does not seek to expel or dispel poison, but to
                conjure it forth and harness its power; Fable’s poetic activity revolves around an
                acoustically generated pharmakon that simultaneously wounds and heals. </p>
                
            <p>Fable’s song ensnares the agents of revolutionary violence (the Fates, the Writer) in
                a web that they themselves bring about (it is in fact the Writer who demands the oil
                of the tarantulas in the first place as fuel for his revolutionary ambitions). Fable
                disarms the subterranean revolt by overwhelming them in the orgiastic rhythms of the
                tarantella: “[Fable’s] pursuers rushed impetuously into the web of the tarantulas,
                which took vengeance on them with innumerable bites. The whole crowd began to dance
                frantically, to which Fable played a merry tune.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                Writer is among these pursuers, or at least that the pursuers are his
                representatives; in any case, the Writer has become dis-individuated in the spinning
                of the dance. </p>
                
            <p>Fable is thus responsible for two forms of spinning songs: the orgiastic-destructive
                song of tarantism, and the restorative song of the weaver. These songs are not
                oppositional, but complementary (or at least complementary in their oppositionality,
                a problem that Nietzsche would later seek to solve in
                <hi rend="italic" >The Birth of Tragedy </hi>by reconciling
                Apollonian figuration with Dionysian dissolution). Novalis frames Romantic writing—a
                form of writing indicated by the ultimate fate of the Writer—in relation to these
                two primordial musical paradigms. It is significant that precisely at the moment in
                which Romantic writing fulfills its highest ambitions—as unconditioning writing—the
                Writer simply disappears (or seems to disappear) from the tale, a detail emphasized

                a transformation of writing has taken place, but it has become ubiquitous, absolute,
                atmospheric, everywhere visible and non-localizable. Indeed, the Writer has not been
                repressed, but unconditioned and <hi rend="italic">amplified</hi> into absolute
                song; the dissipation of revolutionary violence and the dis-individuation of its
                central figure (the figure of the Writer) becomes form-generating in the “merry
                tune” of Fable itself, woven by her spindle (rather than a weaving loom, which the
                Writer was supposed to become in Novalis’ notes). This possibility coheres with a

            <p>This pattern of Romantic poiesis can be found in other episodes in the fairy tale,

                themselves caught in the throes of the tarentella. The Fates are degraded to buzzing
                flies and finally consumed by the tarantulas; they are “sucked to the marrow.”<note

                de-potentiated into inorganic matter. The depotentiation of something already
                depotentiated (the Fates as sheer non-productive, revolutionary rage) becomes the
                source of a genesis (negation of the negative as positive). The subterranean powers,
                now stabilizing structures, support the head of the marriage bed that will mark the
                consummation of the utopian scene of social and political reconciliation. However,
                the caryatides are not merely figures of stabilization; they integrate their
                previously chaotic power in such a way that the erotic stage is uplifted, now
                swaying in the air. The statues of the Fates, whose revolutionary energy has been
                brought to a standstill, set the erogenous zone of reconciliation (the bed) into
                relation with the ground, but in such a way that the ground itself is made to hover:
                “so that the earth floats once again and does not lie on chaos.”<note place="foot"

            <p>The Romantic unconditioning of the world—making the solidity of the earth sway in
                relation to chaotic forces of disruption held at a distance—takes place through the

                subterranean and anarchic entities into sculptural figures, the solidity of the base
                is constructed by the waves, oscillations, and vibrations from which it grew. The
                movement of these originally acoustic vibrations has been arrested only partially,
                frozen in order to better bring the world into a hovering relation to the ground.
                Although the transformation of the Writer into a loom does not take place explicitly
                in the fairy tale, there remains nevertheless the spindle that gathers the threads
                of Fable’s own being as part of a new collective order. In the self-generation of
                this order, the spindle (<hi rend="italic">Spindel</hi>) spins, repeats the whirling
                dance, duplicates its movements. The Writer, if he is still a latent and invisible
                presence, has become a pure spinning movement—a tarantella of the
                understanding—accompanied by the song of a fable that holds itself swaying at a
                distance from the now subdued chaotic source, still drawing on its ineliminable and
                disruptive energy. </p>

                describes as presentation in an “ideal medium” is nothing other than the generic

                Construction—the name of the philosophical method Schelling utilizes in the <hi

                construct is not merely to represent, but to transform and transfigure the real; it
                produces a way of looking at entities (the real) as products of an infinite,
                absolute process, subject to a becoming without conditions. When regarded as such,
                objects are extracted from their local contexts of significance and recast as
                paradigms of ontological and cosmological form-generation: the philosophy of art
                does not analyze this or that work, but “<hi rend="italic">the universe in the form

                the entire construction of the philosophy of art through which the materiality of
                the real expresses itself in the ideality of form—is that of
                    <hi rend="italic" >sonority </hi>(<hi rend="italic"
                    >Klang</hi>). If music represents the “lowest” of the arts in the architectonics
                of Schelling’s construction, it is also closest to nature in its primordial state,
                to that first event through which “art breaks through into the world of
                    representation.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi

            </p>
                    
            <p>Schelling accordingly describes sonority as the maximal presentation of the real, of
                non-conscious matter, as registered within the world of sense and sentience: an
                exteriority that lies at the core of interiority, approximating what Lacan would
                call <hi rend="italic">extimacy</hi>. Schelling describes this concept of sonority,
                one in which the body/mind (real/ideal) distinction is simultaneously produced and
                suspended (in-differentiated), as the “intuition of the soul of the body
                    itself.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi
                            rend="italic">Philosophy of Art, 108.</hi></note> Sonority is the form
                through which the body manifests itself as a necessary ontological zone of
                emergence, hence as <hi rend="italic" >soul </hi>of the body. </p>
                    
            <p>The soul here does not belong to a subject, but designates an impersonal process of
                idealization. As such, music, which emerges from sonority, is not an art particular
                to human beings; indeed, music does not require humanity for its realization. Music
                belongs to the cosmos, even in its inorganic forms. The ear, then, becomes a
                privileged (and paradoxical) organ of the inorganic, or that part of the human being
                most consonant with inorganic modes of appearance. Schelling writes: “the roots of
                the sense of hearing reside within anorganic nature, within magnetism. The hearing
                organ itself is merely magnetism that has developed to organic perfection.”<note

            <p>Schelling’s notion of the ear as a magnetic organ is predicated upon a paradigm shift
                from mechanistic to dynamic theories of hearing; Chladni, for example, linked the
                form-generation made visible on plates to oscillating elasticity (and hence
                mechanics) rather than the play of forces (dynamics). The dynamic theory of hearing
                as it surfaces in the
                <hi rend="italic" >Philosophy of Art </hi>had been prepared by
                Schelling’s earlier works of naturephilosophy (<hi rend="italic"

                        For Schelling as an innovator in the conceptualization of sound through dynamics rather than mechanics, see Steven P. Lydon, “Signatura rerum: Chladni’s Sound Figures in Schelling, August Schlegel, and Brentano,” <hi

            <p>The residual inorganic structure of the organ of hearing brings it into contact with
                the central problem of nature itself: nature as it steps out of static equilibrium,
                out of a condition of absolute rest, and into movement and productivity. Ian Biddle,
                drawing on Schelling’s earlier naturephilosophical texts, ascribes a disruptive and
                ungrounding force to the magnetism of the ear in this section of the <hi

                imbedded in it a whole array of tones, and we hear them such that the consonant ones

                sound is a process of individuation that tips towards the balance of the
                self-affirmation of nature as an infinite process; the oppositional account of
                individuation characteristic of Schelling’s earlier naturephilosophy (individuated
                forms as emergent from a disequilibrium in a conflict of forces, or form as indexing
                the aberrant nature of appearances) has been supplanted in favor of the affirmative
                account of individuation characteristic of his later identity philosophy
                (individuated forms as emergent from the desire of nature to affirm itself).<note

            <p>The residue of an agonistic and dissonant ontology of individuation can nevertheless
                still be detected in Schelling’s account of sound. Uncovering this residue requires
                a closer examination of the distinction between two concepts of sound used by
                Schelling: <hi rend="italic" >resonance </hi>(<hi rend="italic"
                    >Schall</hi>) and <hi rend="italic" >sonority </hi>(<hi
                    rend="italic">Klang</hi>). Resonance (<hi rend="italic">Schall</hi>) designates
                the generic operation of sound generation, and dissonance belongs essentially to one
                of its possibilities. A body resonates when it conducts (“all resonance... is
                    conduction”<note place="foot" resp="author">Schelling, <hi
                            rend="italic" >Philosophy of Art</hi>, 108.</note>). Resonance [<hi
                    rend="italic">Schall</hi>] manifests itself as noise when it generates acoustic
                data that disintegrate into incoherence, when “sound does not allow the unity in
                multiplicity to be recognized clearly.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi
                            rend="italic" >Philosophy of Art</hi> 108.</note> Sonority supersedes this
                entropic pull toward disintegration through its power of internal coherence, in
                which case multiplicity discloses itself as “a multiplicity that affirms
                    itself.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi
                            rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, 108.</note> However, at the most
                primordial level of individuation, resonance—or the power by which sound can reach
                out and touch each thing (as something <hi rend="italic">conducted</hi>)—constitutes
                a field in which both dissonance and affirmation, incommensurable multiplicity and
                harmonious cohesion, are contained as latent possibilities. </p>
                    
            <p>Starting from sound as the presentation of the inorganic within the organic,
                Schelling constructs a series of bifurcations in which the dissonance of the real is
                progressively filtered out: from resonance (in which dissonance still inheres as a
                possibility); to sonority (in which consonance is generated and overcomes a
                still-present dissonance); to music (in which consonance becomes a symbolic
                generator, “potence and symbol”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi
                            rend="italic" >Philosophy of Art</hi>, 109.</note> of the absolute producing
                itself through rhythm, harmony, and melody). Music, as symbol of the absolute,
                becomes that form in which the generative dynamic of the absolute in the modality of
                the real—productive material unconditioning—is brought into sensuous presence. The
                progressive transfiguration of sound into sonority and then music corresponds to an
                increase in the mythopoetic generativity of sound, or sound as a thought experiment
                connected to other domains of existence: cosmological, religious, political. </p>
                    
            <p>Absolute sound, in the form of music, is propulsive; in its most basic symbolic form,
                it is more rhythmic than harmonious. Schelling thus describes rhythm as “the music
                within music,”<note place="foot" resp="author">Schelling, <hi
                            rend="italic" >Philosophy of Art</hi>, 111.</note> calling rhythm the
                “predominating potence in music,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi
                            rend="italic" >Philosophy of Art</hi>, 112.</note> which distills the
                function of music to its fundamental operation: to generate enough regularity to
                recognize units, or discrete elements appearing
                <hi rend="italic" >as </hi>discrete elements; but also to
                generate enough multiplicity and variety such that these units of sound never become
                monotonous and are constantly producing difference. As the sensuous manifestation
                that most closely brushes up against the contingency of sheer givenness, rhythm
                models the breakthrough of sense from non-sense, “the transformation of an
                essentially meaningless succession into a meaningful one.”<note place="foot"

            <p>A close examination of the specifically naturephilosophical aesthetics of music,
                however, reveals that the symbolic dimension of music—or music as <hi rend="italic"
                    >unconditioning</hi> sound—is more expansive than stabilizing, more productive
                of difference than of unity. Music is not limited to the human arts; drawing on
                Pythagoras, Schelling notes that cosmic bodies (planets, stars) are ontologically
                homologous with music: not inasmuch as they produce music in their spinning, but
                inasmuch as they <hi rend="italic" >are </hi>music in their very
                manner of being, in the forces with which they are identical. Schelling writes: “The
                cosmic bodies float on the wings of harmony and rhythm. That which one calls
                centripetal and centrifugal force is nothing other than harmony and rhythm,
                respectively. Elevated by the same wings, music floats in space to weave an audible
                universe from the transparent body of sound and tone.”<note place="foot"
                   resp="author"> Schelling, <hi
                            rend="italic" >Philosophy of Art</hi> 117.</note> Rhythm is thus <hi
                    rend="italic">naturalized</hi>—belonging to nature as self-producing process
                (rather than in the sense of being taken as self-evident)—as force. Schelling
                associates rhythm in particular with centrifugal force, or an expansiveness that in
                naturephilosophical terms corresponds to an overcoming of boundaries. Schelling
                correlates harmony with centripetal force, or the yearning for coherence, translated
                into sound. When Schelling claims that the predominating potence of music is
                rhythm—that rhythm is the music within music—he thus locates the specific force of
                music in a propulsive energetics. </p>
            <p>Music—its generative and propulsive force—will be everywhere present, latent in every
                being, in every form of art and in every movement of discourse. Music also inheres
                in political and collective bodies; or rather, collective bodies disclose their
                internal tendencies musically. Every gathering of human beings produces a musical
                form that expresses its inner tendencies. Music that is predominantly harmonic
                rather than rhythmic, as the “expression of striving and yearning,”<note

                collective forms, exemplified above all by the Church, which produces a “striving to
                view oneself within the absolute as one with everyone else.”<note place="foot"

                harmonic tendencies—best exemplified in polyphonic sacred music—with a yearning for
                coherence that can be devitalizing and contractive. In contrast to the music of the
                Church, that of the Greek polis is rhythmical and expansive: “one in which a pure

                predominantly characterized by harmony (which seeks the center and is restorative),
                Schelling seeks to cultivate an ear attuned to the rhythms of antiquity (which flees
                the center and is energetic) to awaken a countertendency of expansive force in
                musical form.</p>
                    
            <p>Schelling’s philosophy of music thereby harnesses a primordial tendency toward
                difference and multiplicity in a form of art (music) that stands in for the event of
                art itself, for the breakthrough of meaning against a background of meaninglessness.
                The emergence of art is characterized by a fundamental ambivalence. It brings to the
                surface a dissonant and incomprehensible real only to suppress this form of the real
                through progressive potentiation (resonance, sonority, music). At the same time,
                sound comprises the central medium through which the momentum of centrifugality—a
                transgressive and difference-generating expansion—achieves symbolic elevation,
                seeping into material and discursive forms. Philosophical construction itself, in
                its production of the absolute, must also be rhythmic in this manner. Novalis writes
                in reference to Fichte: “Fichte has done nothing else than discover the rhythm of
                philosophy, and expressed it in a verbal acoustic manner.”<note place="foot"
                   resp="author"> Novalis, <hi
                            rend="italic" >Notes</hi>, 57.</note> While the expansive
                momentum of rhythmic antiquity could function as an antidote to the overwhelmingly
                stabilizing harmonic collective forms of modernity (the
                <hi rend="italic" >polis </hi>as counterforce to the Church;
                Nietzsche would take this insight further in <hi rend="italic">The Birth of
                    Tragedy</hi>), another speculative possibility can be drawn from Schelling’s
                philosophy of music: a collective form whose musical expression would produce a
                harmonic and centripetal counterforce capable of counteracting the violent potential
                in the expansive and assimilative propulsion of rhythm, but without producing an
                overcontraction into homogeneous communal groupings. The form of the collective that
                could or would produce such music as an ontological expression of its internal
                tendencies remains unthematized by Schelling. Such would be the unspoken melodic
                (equally rhythmic <hi rend="italic" >and </hi>harmonic) utopian
                form of Schelling’s philosophy of music. </p>

            <p>The shift from a mechanical to a dynamic concept of sound—from wave oscillation
                produced through the collision and elasticity of bodies (Chladni) to oscillation as
                a result of magnetic or electrical forces (Ritter and 
                    Ørsted)—enlarges the field of auditory sensibility as well as the
                discursive and aesthetic potentiality of sound. Central to this expansion of
                possibilities in the idea of electrical acoustics is the phenomenon of shock. For
                Hans Christian
                Ørsted, sound generated by contact gives rise to a mechanical-dynamic feedback loop of shock intensification through electricity: 
                
            <quote>The compression and the consequent expansion which take place in every soundwave
                produce ... [an] electrical alternation. Such an alternation between electrical
                states must also take place in the ear, but each transition from one electrical
                state to another produces a shock, however weak it may be. Each sound is accompanied
                by a great many such shocks one following the other.<note place="foot"

            The constant intensification of shock infinitely stimulates
                    the ear; the ear expands the domain of sensibility by virtue of the
                    imperceptible shocks that it constantly receives, as “frequent alternation
                    increases the sensitivity of the ear even more.”<note place="foot"

The barrage of electrical shocks pushes the capacities of the organ toward transcendence. Oscillations become so fast that “the speed of vibrations becomes too great to be perceived by the ear.”<note

           The figure-generating potentiality of tone—which locates the generation of form at
                the event of excitation itself rather than as the result of an excitation—becomes at
                one and the same time a natural ontological ground as well as a domain to which the
                human being can relate itself as it would to a foreign daemonic power. The
                figurative power of tone, once it is scaled upwards into other domains, enters into
                proximity (if not identity) with human beings themselves and simultaneously

                    and experimental ways of being in the world: as the transcendence of shock for
                    Ørsted, or as the continuous electrical production of shapes and figures for

            <p>Romantic lyric and narrative forms, albeit with different resources at their disposal, equally explore the ramifications of unconditioning sound. One of the most prominent examples of this experimental practice can be found in the lyric of Joseph von Eichendorff. An early poem composed by Eichendorff in 1808 (“Sestime”) constructs a conceptual Romantic sixfold—flowing, rustling, dreams, sky, stars, songs—in the repeating, shifting constellation dictated by the form of the sestina. Eichendorff’s “Sestime” is modeled on the medieval sestina, a form in which words at the ends of lines are repeated according to a system of rules (the last end-word of one stanza becomes the first end-word of the following one; the first end-word becomes the second end-word in the next stanza; and so forth). In a reading of Arnaut Daniel’s sestina “Lo ferm voler qu’el cor m’intra,” Giorgio Agamben claims that the sestina (and lyric more generally) discloses a different form of temporality than that of everyday succession or progression: messianic time, “the time that the poem takes to come to an end,”<note place="foot" resp="author">Giorgio Agamben, <hi

            <p>If Eichendorff’s sestina, like Arnaut’s, participates in this constellated temporality, it nevertheless virtualizes the nesting of temporal echoes such that the very notion of an end is retemporalized, or temporalized beyond its internal system of correspondences, beyond the resonant unfolding of end-words in anticipation and remembrance. In Eichendorff’s sestina, lyric temporality oscillates between a singular punctuation of time, the repetition of a succession, and the index of an eternal nunc stans: “Always
                    will I be kneeling under this sky / That with eternal Lent seeks to flow to

                    and generalities to the point where meaning becomes incidental to the lyric act,
                    does not so much evacuate semantic and conceptual determinacy as place it on a

                        Eichendorff’s lyric thus approaches what Barthes describes as follows: “language would not thereby abandon a horizon of meaning: meaning, undivided, impenetrable, unnamable, would however be posited in the distance like a mirage, making the vocal exercise into a double landscape, furnished with a ‘background’; but instead of the music of the phonemes being the ‘background’ of our messages (as happens in our poetry), meaning would now be the vanishing point of delectation.” Roland Barthes, “The Rustle of Language,” in <hi

                If, however, for Schelling, music (qua rhythm) represents
                    the “transformation of an essentially meaningless succession into a
                meaningful one,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Schelling, <hi

                transformation in the context of the lyric into a reversible oscillation, one in
                which the lyric act can be rhythmically de-semanticized and conceptually
                re-semanticized. </p>
                    
            <p>Eichendorff’s lyric semantically potentiates and depotentiates itself at every
                moment: stars, moons, and flowers can be imaginatively called forth in their
                conceptual referentiality, just as they can tend toward rhythm—although never
                <hi rend="italic" >pure </hi>rhythm, since some conceptuality
                will remain, at least as a residue. In a peculiar inversion, it is the
                <hi rend="italic" >concept </hi>that constitutes the
                ineliminable remainder of Eichendroff’s lyric rather than noise; the concept (or
                semantic determinacy) forms the background against which noise emerges, rather than
                the other way around. In the sestina, Eichendorff couples
                    the philosophical ideal of the concept (i.e. the intellectual contemplation of
                    forms) with an ecstatic loss of awareness—bringing contemplation and rapture
                    into a zone of indistinction—at the precise instance in which the strict
                    identity of the sestina’s form is loosened, when intoxication (
                    Berauschen: more precisely, the infinitive as substantive, and thus the act of intoxicating made into a concept) supplants rustling (rauschen: gazing at the sweet intoxication of such beauty(Betrachtend solcher
                    Schöne süß’ Berauschen). When
                    rustling becomes inebriation, rauschen becomes Berauschen, it is not beauty in its eternal form that is contemplated, but rather, its intoxicating effect. The purely formal-intellectual nature of beauty is thus unconditioned by sensuous, semantic and phonic displacements in the shift from rauschen to berauschen.</p>
                    
            <p>If Eichendorff’s lyric experimentation with unconditioning
                    sound nevertheless maintains itself in orbit around the ideal, a divergent and
                    more perverse form of acoustic unconditioning can be found in the work of E.T.A.
                    Hoffmann, himself a composer and known for his characterization of Beethoven’s

                (Zauberschlag), using musical polarities to jolt him out of a complacent fit with his normative system up until that point. The two musicians make the narrator into a conductor for an electrical (simultaneously musical and erotic) current passing back and forth, alternating between aesthetic paradigms as if between the plus and minus of a voltaic pile: Lauretta and Teresina (the two musicians), representing respectively artifice and nature, ornament and simplicity, surface and depth, opera buffa and tragic opera. Each of these will, and each in their turn, embody an ideal that produces an aesthetic attunement to the world for the narrator. However, the story does not establish the ideal and fix it in place. On the contrary, it describes the means whereby the ideal (or the vacillation between multiple ideals) is perpetually dislodged; it discharges
                singular entities or beings as bearers of symbolic significance. What comes to light in Hoffmann’s tale, then, is the disruption of the ideal as a new, second-order concept of ontological
                    order.</p>
                    
            <p>The discharging of the ideal takes place at a moment of
                    particular temporal significance in the story indicated by the title: in the
                    fermata. The fermata is not just a motif, but an ontological operation, indeed,
                    a space of religious redemption; in the fermata, a woman is represented as
                    singing a cadenza “with a gaze directed towards the heavens.”<note

                Following Agamben’s suggestion in his analysis of the sestina’s messianic time, the thrust of time in the fermata seems teleologically laden as it moves towards its end, a moment of fulfillment when regular temporality, a
                    tempo, is restored and the orchestra—the tutti, all individuals as a collective form—rejoins the individual. </p>
                    
            <p>However, in the redemptive momentum of the fermata there lies a significant potential for deviation, and it is this disruptive power that fascinates Hoffmann. If, for Schelling, rhythm is the music of music and hence the means by which it produces itself as the absolute, the function of the fermata is to suspend rhythmic regularity and predictability: it places the beat (tact) in abeyance, pausing and extending the flow of time in such a way that unexpected sound figures come into appearance. The fermata—above all in the context of the narrative—makes possible a space of individuation outside the dictates of the collective (the orchestral tutti) and a temporality outside universal time (it is not a
                    tempo). Drawing on the etymology of the fermata from fermare: it stops the beat. </p>
            <p>The threshold signaling the restoration of temporal and collective order is generally marked by the trill of the soloist, at which point the conductor must guide the orchestra to enter at precisely the right moment, in the <hi rend="italic">kairos</hi> of a temporal suspension brought to fulfillment. Hoffmann’s
                    narrative reflects this logic: the trill anticipating the end of the fermata is
                    described as the “highest moment,” the one “that would set everyone into
                    amazement [<hi rend="italic">staunen</hi>].”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Hoffmann, <hi
                            rend="italic" >Die Serapions-Brüder</hi>, 83.</note>
                The trill is a significant symbolic operator; in the
                    context of the naturephilosophical materialism of sound, the trill is nothing
                    other than the explicit enactment of the structure of sound itself as
                    oscillation. The latent ontological dynamic of sound—what Ørsted grasped as
                    continually alternating electrical shocks in rapid succession between
                    polarities—finds its most apt representational form in the trill. The
                    restoration of order, the moment when suspended time is supposed to rejoin
                    regular time, occurs in tandem with the symbolization of sound in its basic
                    ontological structure.</p>
                    
            <p>In the work of Hoffmann, however, it is messianic time that must be disrupted at all costs. Everything must go wrong. The scene is described as follows, described from the perspective of the narrator who is accompanying the soloist (Lauretta) as she intends to bring her cadenza to a conclusion in the fermata: 
            <quote>We came to the last <hi
                    rend="italic"> fermata</hi>. Lauretta exerted all her skill and art; she warbled trill after trill like a nightingale, executed sustained notes, then long elaborate roulades—a whole <hi rend="italic">solfeggio</hi>. In fact, I thought she was almost carrying the thing too far this time; I felt a soft breath on my cheek; Teresina stood behind me. At this moment Lauretta took a good start with the intention of swelling up to a ‘harmonic shake’ and so passing back into <hi rend="italic" >a tempo.</hi> The devil entered into me; I jammed down the keys with both
                    hands; the orchestra followed suit; and it was all over with Lauretta’s trill,

                    astonishment.<note place="foot" resp="author"> E.T.A. Hoffmann, “The Fermata,” <hi

            <p>If the trill is nothing other than the order of sound made explicit, another type of oscillation comes to the foreground in this scene: the moment at which one figure of symbolic mediation falls out of ideality and is transferred to another. In the wake of this event, an erotic and aesthetic transference takes place in the narrator from Lauretta to Teresina; Teresina appears at the precise moment of disruption and is thus correlated with the interruption of the auspicious moment, the misfire of the <hi rend="italic">kairos</hi>. What is
                    eternalized and made generative in Hoffmann’s tale is precisely not the
                    restoration of order as the supreme aesthetic moment, but the interruption that
                    makes this second-order deviant oscillation of things into the very source of
                    aesthetic power. In accordance with an ontology in which the ideal itself must
                    be made present only in order to be deposed—discharged so that another charge
                    can take its place—Teresina too will fall out of ideality, as will, perhaps, the
                    narrator himself.</p>
                    
            <p>The fermata—and its disruption—repeats itself in different forms, different mediated channels, throughout the narrative. It becomes its own aesthetic-ontological archetype and is infinitely generative, disclosing an absolute process of signification. It can be found in the painting <hi rend="italic" >The Fermata </hi>(1814) by Johann Erdmann Hummel, the viewing of which is the occasion for telling the tale itself (the fermata thus produces the tale of its own production, <hi
                    rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi>).<note place="foot"> The narrator sees the painting and recognizes in the representation a scene that took place in his own life.</note> 
                Moreover, the paining, through the representation of yet <hi
                    rend="italic">another</hi> fermata diabolically ruined, fixes this failure in place—making the interruption of the fermata into a second-order fermata by extending its temporal scope into eternity. Visually fixed in place, the fermata can never be brought to completion. When the painting appears in the story, it too conducts an electrical charge, striking its viewer with yet another magic blow, a <hi
                    rend="italic">Zauberschlag</hi>. The
                    electrical conduction of this charge is the primary purpose of Hoffmann’s
                    fermata, both within the story and as the story itself. The burst of energy
                    released in the failure of the redemptive moment is not traumatic, but the
                    condition itself of a form of unconditioning art—an art that nourishes itself
                    not from the presence of the ideal, but from its malfunction.</p>
                    
            <p>For significant strands of the German Romantic tradition, sound discloses fundamental ontology as an oscillation of the real, the real <hi rend="italic">as</hi> oscillation: a trembling of things that moves through all
                    individuated forms, material and spiritual. In their speculative philosophical
                    and aesthetic experiments with sound, the most intimate experiences of the world
                    become the most alien. It is not just that sound indicates the absolute as that
                    which is unconditioned, but that it constructs the real as a material-ideal
                    system in the process of turning against itself, moving amidst the peaks and
                    troughs of waves, perpetually unconditioning itself and carrying all beings
                    along in its wake. When Novalis develops chemical acoustics as a power of
                    figuration dependent upon the inhibition of the tendency toward dissolution;
                    when he seeks in the music of the fairy tale a vertiginous art capable of
                    creating a semi-stable, hovering relation to a chaotic ground; when Schelling
                    claims a power of affirmation over negation in the potentiation of sound from
                    noise to sonority to music, culminating in the manner in which collectives

                / <hi rend="italic">Berauschen</hi>) that oscillates between noise and concept, intoxication and intellection; and when Hoffmann develops an electrical aesthetics to maintain beings in a constant state of perverse non-identity with the ideal—we see that it is not sufficient for the German Romantics to describe sound and its material or ideal basis; rather, the latent dynamics emergent from the speculative and aesthetic encounter with sound must be redirected back into the world: as an art of unconditioning. </p>
