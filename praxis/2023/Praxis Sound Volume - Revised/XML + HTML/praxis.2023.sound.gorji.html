            <p>This essay examines representations of quiet in Coleridge’s “Frost at Midnight” to
               ask broader questions about the ways Romantic lyric can register and express volume
               and sound dynamics. It offers historical contexts for understanding the poem including
               the development of musical and rhetorical notation for volume as well as accounts
               of shifting reading practices in the period. It demonstrates how “Frost at Midnight”
               offers a rich nexus for thinking about the experience and the representation of volume,
               and of silence, in Romantic lyric. The poem invites further thinking about the semiotics
               of sound and silence through a playful interplay between eye and ear. Coleridge was
               fascinated by visual codes for sound and the ways in which patterns of sound can be
               seen as well as heard, and his poems are full of accounts of different kinds of sound,
               which complicate the distinction between silent and vocalised reading. Coleridge provides
               an especially interesting case study not only because he was writing on what has been
               described as the cusp between reading aloud and silent reading, and during an era
               of scientific discovery and innovation in the realm of acoustics, but also because
               he was deeply interested in musical forms and in the science and semiotics of acoustics.
               The essay demonstrates how shifts in volume can be expressed and experienced in a
               poem’s own acoustic, rhythmic and verbal textures and suggests that the representation
               of sound and quiet in “Frost at Midnight” challenges and extends what is understood
               by ‘silent’ reading. More broadly, it proposes that volume, a term which acquired
               its current acoustic sense in the Romantic period, is a significant figure in Lyric
               studies which has gone unacknowledged. It proposes that volume was not only important
               to Romantic poets such as Coleridge, who, as this essay shows, found subtle ways of
               modulating and expressing shifts in volume in his poetry, but also that, more broadly,
               volume should be understood as part of a critical discourse about genre. The essay
               explores the ways in which volume is figured and expressed in Coleridge’s writing,
               and especially in “Frost at Midnight,” and considers the critical language we might
               use to describe volume and dynamics more generally. Arguing that Coleridge’s lyric
               poetry has its own playful modes and codes for communicating degrees of sound, the
               essay proposes that volume is a neglected but significant figure in Lyric studies.

               <p>“When I put my ear to the page, I hear nothing but the sound of my hair against the
                  surface. If I erase the letters, no “sound” remains. Sound is not <span style="font-style:italic">on</span> the page, even if a graphic transmission allows for its properties to be noted for
                  reproduction’” (Johanna Drucker, in Marjorie Perloff and Craig Dworkin, eds. <span style="font-style:italic">The Sound of Poetry/The Poetry of Sound, </span>2009, 239) [my emphasis]</p>
               <p>“Sound is what happens <span style="font-style:italic">in</span> Lyric” (Jonathan Culler, <span style="font-style:italic">Theory of the Lyric</span>, Harvard, 2015) [my emphasis]</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>What does it mean for sound to happen in Lyric? Culler’s claim invites questions about
                     how we define Lyric, but also about the phenomenology of sound, its medium, and the
                     relation between sound, print and poem. How is sound experienced by the reader – by
                     the eye, the ear, the mind’s ear, when it is read aloud and read in silence, <span style="font-style:italic">in </span>Lyric? The preposition “in” suggests that Lyric is a container for sound, a vessel,
                     perhaps, an urn: 
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard</div>
                        <div class="l">Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;</div>
                        <div class="l">Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear’d,</div>
                        <div class="l">Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone: </div>

                     </div> Where is sound happening in Keats’ lines? On the page? In our ears? “through the air”?
                     In our mind’s ears? Is there a difference between the way it “happens” in our ears,
                     when read out loud, and in the mind’s ear, during silent reading? And what of the
                     sounds that are seen but not heard? Like the playful eye-rhyme suggested by “unheard”
                     and “endear’d:” both words contain the word “ear,” but we only hear it sounded in
                     “endear’d.”

                     </div> And what of the poem’s other silences? The gaps and pauses? The moments of no sound
                     and “no tone”? The quiet? The silence at the end of a line after “unheard,” the white
                     space, the line break? Or, somewhere else, as a boy “hangs/ waiting for the owls to
                     answer”? What of these silences? Are they heard or “unheard”? What of the many silences
                     contained in and articulated by Lyric? The silence of the urn, this “silent form”?
                     Are they "happening" in the same way as sound ‘happens’? And what of those eye rhymes
                     we see and don’t hear, between “heard” and “endear’d”? Both contain the word “ear,”
                     but it is not sounded in “heard,” seen not heard, silent. And what is <span style="font-style:italic">soft</span> sound? In these lines, <span style="font-style:italic">soft</span>, in the phrase “soft pipes”, suggests a quality of sound - timbre and volume. But
                     do we experience different qualities of sound, and degrees of softness and loudness,
                     when we read these lines silently? How does quietness “happen” in a poem?</p>
               </div>
               <p>The word “volume” acquired an acoustic register in the late eighteenth-century, according
                  to <span style="font-style:italic">OED</span>, a musical sense first recorded in Busby’s <span style="font-style:italic">Complete dictionary of music</span> (1786) referring to the tone and power of a human voice: “<span style="font-style:italic">Volume</span>, a word applied to the compass of a voice from grave to acute: also to its tone,
                  or power: as when we say, ‘such a performer possesses an extensive or rich volume of
                  voice’.” (<span style="font-style:italic">OED</span>, 9a). The first recorded usage of the word volume as “Quantity, strength or power,
                  combined mass, of sound” (<span style="font-style:italic">OED</span>, 9b) occurs a little later, in 1822, and is attributed to Lord Byron in <span style="font-style:italic">Werner, </span> (v.i. 134 I heard…, Distinct and keener far upon my ear Than the late cannon's 333)
                  volume, this word—‘Werner!’). This new sense of the word registers a larger cultural
                  and scientific curiosity about the nature and experience of sound in the period, a
                  curiosity which also finds shape in poetry of the period.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The contemporary poet Alice Oswald is also interested in the expression of volume,
                     and plays with different ways of suggesting quiet and silence through and around words,
                     using space, measuring lines and fading ink to create a graphic code for calibrating
                     sound and silence. In the last lines of her poem "Tithonus" (<span style="font-style:italic">Falling Awake, </span>2016, 45-81), for example, there’s a moment of graphic quietening. The final letters
                     of the poem fade into whiteness, so that the poem’s concluding word, “appearing” is
                     almost invisible, printed in the very lightest shade of type, as dawn, and light,
                     appear.

                     </div> The fading font produces an aural effect, the suggestion of diminuendo, in the way
                     that <span style="font-weight:bold">bold</span> or CAPITAL LETTERS, larger font size or <span style="font-style:italic">italics</span> can suggest a louder volume. But, as we shall see, a poem can sound or produce the
                     effect of quiet in other ways.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Coleridge, too, was intensely curious about the nature and experience of sound in
                  the ear and in print. “Frost at Midnight”, written in Somerset in the winter of 1798,
                  does not use the word “volume”, but records a playful exploration of dynamics and
                  of the various ways (graphic, rhythmic, linguistic and as an effect of tempo) in which
                  sound and quiet could be represented to both eye and ear in a poem. Like other Romantic
                  poets, Coleridge was fascinated by visual codes and patterns for sound and marking
                  emphasis. Julia S. Carlson has shown how Wordsworth drew on developments in cartography
                  and rhetoric in his own shapings in and of sound on the page (Julia S. Carlson, <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Marks and Measures: Wordsworth’s Poetry in Fields of Print</span>, 2016). Taking this yet further, I suggest that Coleridge was also preoccupied with
                  how to represent sounds and especially volume, and that his imaginative interest in
                  acoustics and in musical forms and notation informed the way he shaped sound into
                  both aural patterns and visual language in his poetry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2">
               <h2><span class="head">ii. <span style="font-style:italic">pp</span></span></h2>
               <p>Many of our critical terms for discussing lyric poetry are, of course, borrowed from
                  music; for example, as Susan Stewart has explained: “we speak of such features as
                  counterpoint, harmony, syncopation, stress, duration, and timbre” as some of the “ways
                  in which sound is measured as if music and lyric were analogous” (<span style="font-style:italic">Stewart</span>, 2002: 68). In music, however, there is a system of notation for marking dynamics
                  on a musical score, differences in volume and also in the quality of the sound, <span style="font-style:italic">pp, f, piu p, poco a poco dim., molto piano</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">quasi niente</span>, for example. The Romantic period witnessed the expansion of the range of musical
                  notation marks for dynamics; for example, it was during the last decade of the eighteenth
                  century, “that the convention of indicating a gradual increase or decrease of volume
                  by terms such as ‘cresc’ or ‘dim.’, or by ‘hairpins’, became commonplace” (Clive Brown<span style="font-style:italic">, </span> 1999: 62).</p>
               <p>The expressive possibilities of volume became increasingly important to composers
                  and performers in this period. In part, this was enabled by developments and innovations
                  in musical instruments themselves: the <span style="font-style:italic">pianoforte</span>, invented in the eighteenth century, allowed a much wider dynamic range than had
                  been available to the harpsichord, for instance, and it was during the period 1750-1850
                  that various adjustments were made to stringed instruments which increased the range
                  of volume they could express. Changes in the way sheet music was produced in the period
                  may also have contributed to this interest in dynamics and its expression on the page
                  as well as in performance: there was an increase in the publication of sheet music
                  in the later eighteenth-century which meant, Brown argues, that the performance of
                  music was no longer always in the direct acoustic control of the composer, since in
                  the later period composers were no longer physically present to instruct performers
                  how to alter dynamics. This is perhaps one reason why composers increasingly marked
                  their scores to indicate these dynamic shifts. Moreover, “Many composers . . . came
                  increasingly to regard accentuation and dynamic nuance as integral to the individuality
                  of their conceptions and were unwilling to entrust this merely to the performer’s
                  instinct” (62). For this reason, he suggests, during the nineteenth century there
                  was “a proliferation of markings, designed to show finer grades or types of accents
                  and dynamic effects, and performance instructions of all kinds were used ever more
                  freely” (62). It is likely that it was a combination of factors to do with the production
                  and performance of music as well as technological innovation in the dynamic range
                  of instruments that led to the development and proliferation of dynamic notation in
                  the period, and that this also registered a wider cultural interest in sound and its
                  expression.</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3">
               <h2><span class="head">iii. Voicing and Volume.</span></h2>
               <p>A range of new terms emerged for indicating the dynamics of performance in music but
                  also in the fields of literary performance and rhetoric. It was not only on musical
                  scores that dynamic markers appeared: a number of eighteenth-century literary critics
                  also annotated reading texts to indicate volume and dynamics, the levels or the qualities
                  of quiet or loudness for performance; some adopted musical notation, others used different
                  terms. Discussing reading aloud, late eighteenth-century critics of rhetoric such
                  as James Beattie associated different volumes with different emotional states and
                  intensities of feeling and indicated in their annotations how readers might vary the
                  volume and intensity of their voices to best express the affective range and qualities
                  of a piece of writing. Varying the dynamics of reading, reciting or speaking, he explains,
                  could also engage the listener and be more persuasive. In <span style="font-style:italic">Dissertations Moral and Critical</span> (1783), Beattie argues that: <span class="quote">‘In describing what is great, poets often employ sonorous language. This is suitable
                     to the nature of human speech: for while we give utterance to that which elevates
                     our imagination, we are apt to speak louder, and with greater solemnity, than at other
                     times" (I, 629). ’</span> The word “sonorous” here conveys a sense of volume as well as suggesting a particular
                  style, meaning, “Of spoken or written style: using imposing language; having a full,
                  rich sound; imposing, grand; harmonious” (<span style="font-style:italic">OED</span>, 3a). The first recorded instance of the word to describe language is recorded in
                  1650, and derives from an earlier usage of the word to mean, more generally, “That
                  makes a loud or resonant sound; capable of producing a loud sound, esp. of a deep
                  or ringing character” (<span style="font-style:italic">OED</span>, 1a). The concept of linguistic volume Beattie’s comment suggests invites further
                  investigation: certain words might be considered “sonorous”, others quiet depending,
                  perhaps, on semantic associations, others because of onomatopoeia. The possibility
                  that writers of the period <span style="font-style:italic">volume</span> of words when selecting and composing a poem, for example, and that readers were
                  attuned to the possibility of linguistic dynamics opens up another dimension for literary
                  critics.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The concept of volume also shaped how Beattie understood the rhythm of a poem or piece
                     of dramatic writing. Readers should, he points out, attend closely to the rhythm of
                     the writing, and this, he explains, could be understood in terms of loudness as well
                     as duration, “The rhythm of sounds may be marked by the distinction of loud and soft,
                     as well as that of long and short” (I, 283). It’s clear from Beattie’s account that
                     volume was part of a critical vocabulary for understanding rhythm and conversely,
                     as we shall see, in poetry, rhythm can express sound dynamics and volume.

                              of syllabic length and accent; but when Beattie uses the terms “loud and soft” to
                              describe rhythm, he is doing something slightly different, referring to affective

                     volume was an important aspect of this. He explains, for instance, that “Words of
                     indignation pronounced with a soft voice and a smile. . . would be ridiculous” (I,
                     241). When reading aloud, choosing the appropriate volume and modulating between degrees
                     of loud and soft was considered essential to the successful performance of a poem

                              Institutio Oratoria, he does not discuss volume at any length or often, in the way
                              that 18th century rhetoricians do. This invites further investigation.</span></div>
                     </div> In his <span style="font-style:italic">Art of Speaking</span>, for instance, James Burgh explained how a speaker’s <span style="font-style:italic">success</span> with his audience” depends much upon his “<span style="font-style:italic">setting out</span> in a proper key, and at a due pitch of <span style="font-style:italic">loudness</span>. If he begins in too <span style="font-style:italic">high</span> a tone, or sets out too <span style="font-style:italic">loud, </span>how is he afterwards to rise to a <span style="font-style:italic">higher note</span>, or swell his voice <span style="font-style:italic">louder</span>, as the more <span style="font-style:italic">pathetic</span> strains may require?” (emphasis original (12). Burgh turns to terms such as “proper
                     key,” “due pitch,” “tone” and “note” here; these terms are firmly part of musical
                     as well as rhetorical discourse. He draws on them again when describing how the different
                     emotional states require different modes of expression in both facial features and
                     gestures, but also in terms of the dynamics of voice. “Despair” for instance requires
                     the “tone of the voice” to be “<span style="font-style:italic">loud </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">furious</span>” (17). Whereas “Shame” requires a voice that is “<span style="font-style:italic">weak</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">trembling</span>” as well as short sentences and drawn down eyebrows to convey its full expression
                     (17). He marks a number of speeches and texts with symbols to indicate the quality
                     of delivery, which includes volume, for example in a speech on “Horrors of War,” an
                     extract from Pope’s <span style="font-style:italic">Homer</span>. Certain lines, he indicates, are “to be spoken quick and loud,” others “to be spoken
                     faintly, and with pity” or “to be spoken with a quivering voice” (16, 17). Recognising
                     and performing the appropriate volume for particular literary passages when reading
                     them aloud was key to their rhetorical expressiveness, and Burgh offered readers help
                     in doing this by using descriptive language to indicate the appropriate dynamics.
                     Other kinds of notation were also available.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In his <span style="font-style:italic">Lectures on Elocution</span>, Thomas Sheridan uses musical terms to distinguish between loud and soft, and high
                  and low: “Loud and soft in speaking, is like the <span style="font-style:italic">forte</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">piano</span> in music, it only refers to the different degrees of force used in the same key whereas
                  high and low imply a change of key” (83). Joshua Steele’s <span style="font-style:italic">Prosodia rationalis: or, An essay towards establishing the melody and measure of speech,
                     to be expressed and perpetuated by peculiar symbols</span> stresses the importance of modulating the voice, and sets out symbols for accent
                  and emphasis, loud and soft (24), which he applies to a number of literary examples,
                  including a speech from <span style="font-style:italic">Hamlet</span> (40).</p>
               <p>Gilbert Austin, writing in <span style="font-style:italic">Chiromania, or a Treatise on Rhetorical Delivery</span>, also uses symbols, including some musical notation such as the hairpin to indicate
                  shifts in loudness as well as a number of other symbols, such as the zigzag line to
                  indicate uniform loudness or forte, explained in “Symbols for Noting the Force and
                  Rapidity or Interruption of the Voice in Delivery” (367). He advises readers and performers
                  that these symbols were “to be marked in the margin near the commencement of the passage
                  which they are to influence” (367).</p>

               <p>It is important to note that this kind of notation was not usually deployed by poets
                  themselves; it was added later to mark up a text for performance, to encourage emphasis
                  for dramatic and rhetorical effect. There were perhaps stylistic cues in the writing
                  itself which these notations and marginal indications were responding to and amplifying.
                  It was not necessarily only the subject matter or emotional tone of a piece of writing
                  that suggested a particular volume; it could also be an effect suggested in the rhythmic
                  and linguistic texture of the poem itself. Lyric poetry has its own language and codes
                  for communicating volume and dynamics, and these effects do not depend on performance
                  or vocalisation, on the timbre and grain and pitch of a reader’s voice, but can be
                  experienced even when we read a poem in silence. There are other ways that a poem
                  might register and express shifts in volume, not just in performance, but also during
                  silent reading. If onomatopoeia denotes a shared code or language to represent certain
                  sounds, like a cat purring or a dog barking, what are the linguistic, formal and rhythmic
                  codes and cues of quiet? <span style="font-style:italic">Shhhh, hush, </span>ellipses . . . what else?</p>

               <h2><span class="head">iv. Silent reading.</span></h2>
               <p>Coleridge was well known for reading his own poems aloud, and of course when a poem
                  is voiced, the reader can vary the volume as well as the pitch and tone, but usually
                  there is no direct <span style="font-style:italic">verbal</span> cue or instruction for this in the poem itself (as there sometimes is, say, in a
                  play script, which often gives the actor or reader performance and stage directions).
                  When he read his own poems aloud, Coleridge could of course vary the volume as he
                  thought fitting. But how could he communicate the appropriate dynamics to his readers?
                  And might they experience these shifts in volume during silent reading? Although,
                  as Lucy Newlyn has shown, “the practice of ‘reading aloud’” was “a thriving one at
                  the end of the eighteenth century” (355), so too was silent reading. Laura Mandell
                  points out that Romantic poets expected their poems to be read in silence, and that
                  despite Wordsworth’s “love of reading-and-writing aloud and performing his poetry,
                  nonetheless Wordsworth knew that most would encounter it as silent and graphic. Blake,
                  too, could not mistake the essential noiselessness of his prints” (220). She goes
                  on to argue that “their poems thematised their own soundlessness while offering compensatory
                  images”(220). And yet the poems, read in silence, are not, perhaps, entirely soundless.</p>
               <p>Effects or impressions of sound and volume can be experienced when a poem is read
                  in silence. There is also the possibility of an imagined listening. Lyric poems can
                  have their own inscripted codes and cues for volume and dynamics, ways of suggesting
                  and registering shifts between loud and soft, sound effects which we experience even
                  when we read in silence. And these differences in volume are expressed or suggested
                  in various ways, in and through rhythm, vocabulary and lineation. The question of
                  what volume means in relation to a poem is worth exploring further. If, according
                  to the Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, certain colours were “quiet”
                  (313), perhaps a poet could also produce effects of quiet or loudness in words, rhythms,
                  and spatial patterns on the printed page. And this experience of sound puts pressure
                  on the very idea of ‘silent reading’ itself.</p>
               <p>The expansion of print, according to Walter Ong’s well-known thesis, produced a shift
                  from oral reading aloud to quiet and then silent reading. Print, he claimed, was one
                  factor in the creation of privacy in modern society, and, he argues, the production
                  of books that were “smaller and more portable than those common in manuscript culture”
                  set the stage “psychologically for solo reading in a quiet corner, and eventually
                  for completely silent reading” (131). It should be noted that silent reading in the
                  West long precedes the invention of print, and is recorded by 400 CE, in Augustine’s
                  famous comments on Ambrose, archbishop of Milan, in <span style="font-style:italic">Confessions</span> 6.3.3. And that Ong’s description of print as a kind of silencing medium does not
                  account for the various kinds of sound which print can embody. Perhaps, as Steven
                  Connor suggests, “the move from sounded to silent reading” was not: <span class="quote">‘simply a move from noise to quiet. Rather, perhaps, it is a move from one kind of
                     sound to another … The increasing commonness of silent reading is to be regarded therefore,
                     not as the simple turning down of sound, but as the creation of a more complex space
                     of inner resounding. (106, 109) ’</span> To push this further we might ask whether these “spaces of inner resounding” might
                  vary according to genre. Perhaps Lyric enables and produces distinct kinds of aural
                  and acoustic “spaces," distinct possibilities for inner resounding. We might ask whether
                  Romantic lyric is quieter than other genres or sub-genres, than declamatory neoclassical
                  lyric, say, or than epic or satire. Perhaps the intimate occasion of certain lyric
                  poems itself implies a dynamic of performance, that it be read in a quieter voice
                  than a poem in another genre. Lyric, I want to argue, invites a particular kind of
                  listening, and in the Romantic period this listening was inflected by historical contingencies
                  in musical notation, book publication, and reading practices. The way volume was heard,
                  and indeed the volume of poetry was recognised and interpreted, changed in the Romantic
                  period. And perhaps one reason for this was that during this period a historical juncture
                  between oral and silent reading was especially significant and pronounced.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In <span style="font-style:italic">Discourse Networks 1800/1900</span>, Friedrich Kittler famously suggested that reading after 1800 was shaped, Steven
                     Connor explains, by the “principle of what might be called oralized writing,” (128)
                     what Connor calls a “consensual hallucination, namely the capacity for a kind of ‘earsight’
                     or ‘hearsight’ that allows one to mistake writing for voice, to imagine that writing
                     is everywhere suffused with the most intimate and expressive accents of the voice”
                     (129). But if print could express, silently, the <span style="font-style:italic">accents </span>of voice, it could also register the <span style="font-style:italic">dynamics</span> of voice, and descriptions of sound in the poem itself. Dynamics are a feature of
                     accent, but accent is not the only way dynamics are expressed. A printed poem can
                     also convey shifts between loud and soft on the page, for example, such as a gradual
                     quietening. And such shifts are not only descriptive but can also be mimetic of what
                     is described. They can register effects of intimacy and musical and rhetorical patterns
                     of expression. The question of how a poem might register these shifts and gradations
                     in and of sound took particular inflection and emphasis in the Romantic period not
                     only because of shifting reading practices but also because of a growing curiosity
                     about the developing science and technologies of sound transmission, such as the stethoscope
                     and microphone, and, later in the nineteenth century the phonograph, telephone and
                     telegraph, as well as a fascination with the ways in which sound was codified in music,
                     writing and in other visual forms, such as Chladni figures, the Phonautograph and
                     the Eidophone, all part of what Coleridge was to call the “embryo Science of Acoustics<a id="index.xml-anchor-d339e454"></a>” (197).

               <p>Coleridge was a great talker, musical, oracular, entrancing, and his eloquence has
                  been rightly celebrated. At times, his talking could be challenging; he was not as
                  sensitive perhaps as he might have been to his own listeners: Wordsworth could not
                  understand “one syllable” of his friend’s oration despite listening attentively for
                  two hours, according to Samuel Rogers’ report (308). There are many accounts of people
                  listening to Coleridge, fewer of Coleridge himself as listener. And yet although he
                  didn’t always attend enough to his listeners when he spoke, he was himself an acute
                  and sensitive listener: his poems, as well as his notebooks, are full of great moments
                  of listening. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Throughout Coleridge’s writing we find traces of this sensitivity in his “records
                     of attentive listening,” as John Hollander has termed them. And often the sounds which
                     drew his ear were quiet sounds. In these lines from a notebook entry, for instance: <span class="quote">‘I hear only the Ticking of my Watch, in the Pen-place of my Writing Desk, &amp; the far
                        lower note of the noise of the Fire— perpetual, yet seeming uncertain/it is the low
                        voice of silent quiet change, of Destruction doing its work by little &amp; little.

                     and distinguish between the sounds he hears. And he was curious about how these subtle
                     variations of pitch and dynamics might be expressed in the texture of a poem.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Coleridge was writing on the cusp between reading aloud and silent reading. This is
                  perhaps one reason that he was interested in the space between thought and address:
                  in “Frost at Midnight,” for instance, he is addressing his babe, but in silence. This
                  intimate occasion might also account for the poem’s interest in quiet sounds and sounding
                  quiet. The volume of a poem perhaps depends on occasion as well as on genre, so that
                  the intimate occasions of certain kinds of Romantic lyric poem might be productive
                  of quiet, or at least be quieter than more declamatory or public modes. Like other
                  Romantic poets Coleridge was thoughtful about the sound of poetry, and about shaping
                  sound and silences—especially because he was writing in an age when poems were very
                  often read in silence.</p>

                     </div>. She suggests that the typographical shift from the long "f"-like "s" to the “s”,
                     for example, accompanied a shift from reading aloud to silent reading (the “f”-like
                     “s” being associated with reading aloud). It’s interesting to note, as Mandell does,
                     that in the 1798 edition of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s <span style="font-style:italic">Lyrical Ballads</span>, both forms of “s” are used, and this, she suggests, “would have complicated silent
                     reading” (220). Coleridge’s <span style="font-style:italic">Rime of the Ancient Mariner</span>, for instance, uses the “f” like “s,” and so calls for reading aloud. Mandell explains
                     that this is because of different processes of reading associated with silent reading
                     and reading aloud. You need to pronounce a word which contains an “f” like “s” to
                     know whether it is an “f” or an “s,” she explains. But when an “s” form is used, you
                     recognise it in a different way, which does not require pronouncing it or sounding
                     it out. And yet, I would argue, this account of silent reading as a kind of visual
                     decoding, a reading without sound, belies the complexity of the way sound operates
                     and exists in the medium of print and in a poem.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Mandell’s notion of sound focusses on the idea of the voice and voicing; but poems
                  offer other kinds of sounding and other patterns and articulations of sound. Coleridge
                  understood poems to be musical forms, and his poems are full of accounts of other
                  kinds of sound, which further complicate this distinction between silent or vocalised
                  reading. Indeed, his poems seem to invite a play between eye and ear, not just by
                  varying the typographic forms of letters such as the “s.” They invite us to think
                  about the relation between seeing and hearing not only in terms of voice but also
                  in terms of music and pattern. </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the need for further exploration of Mandell’s claim about the cognitive
                  processes involved in reading aloud and reading silently, it is clear that poets writing
                  in this period were keenly aware that reading practices were shifting, as Mandell
                  and Newlyn have shown. It is also worth considering whether, and how, these and other
                  cultural, technological and scientific changes might have shaped and influenced the
                  representation of sound and dynamics in their poetry. Their poems invite further thinking
                  about the semiotics of sound and of volume through a playful and dynamic interplay
                  between eye and ear.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Writing elsewhere, Mandell examines Laurence Sterne’s play with visual and aural codes
                     registered in his use of a sequence of four asterisks (****) to denote words which
                     might offend readers in <span style="font-style:italic">Tristram Shandy </span>. The **** are difficult to voice, she explains, but the words they represent and
                     obscure present a different challenge to those reading aloud to an audience; his use
                     of **** thus engages with a shift in reading practices in a playful way, mindful that
                     some would read the novel aloud, others in silence.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Writing in his notebooks Coleridge expressed his frustration that he did not “have
                     the language of music” (II: 2035). This could mean that he was unable to read a musical
                     score, or that he did not feel he fully understood musical language. And yet perhaps
                     he was being overly modest; he does, after all, analyse the prosody of <span style="font-style:italic">Paradise Lost</span> in terms of a pattern of “fifteen breves”, which suggests some knowledge of musical
                     terms (<span style="font-style:italic">Marginalia</span>, iv. 603-4). And although there are no musical scores to be found in his notebooks,
                     they do contain quite a few comments about his wide-ranging musical listening, to
                     instruments such as the Eolian harp and Glass Harmonica as well as to a range of polite
                     and popular musical forms; he notes, for instance, the superior song of the Ramsgate
                     Muffin Man but also talks about enjoying Beethoven, Weber, Mozart and Cimarosa. In
                     an essay in <span style="font-style:italic">The Friend</span> he identifies a sense of ‘recognition’ in listening to music: <span class="quote">‘If we listen to a Symphony of Cimarosa, the present strain still seems not only to
                        recall, but almost to renew, some past movement, another and yet the same! Each present
                        movement bringing back, as it were, and embodying the spirit of some melody that had
                        gone before, anticipates and seems trying to overtake something that is to come (<span style="font-style:italic">Notebooks</span> ii. 2356).’</span> This sensitivity to the effects of musical repetition informs Coleridge’s own poetic
                     composition and points to the importance of musical thinking to his own understanding
                     of sound and its forms and effects in poetry.

               <p>Coleridge was keenly aware that poets did not use the “language of music” itself,
                  and that included musical notation, to indicate the dynamics of a poem. And yet, as
                  he instinctively understood, somehow certain poems or lines in poems can suggest different
                  dynamic qualities, with some moments seeming louder or quieter than others. Coleridge’s
                  poems are especially rich in dynamic effects. It is striking how many of his lyric
                  ‘Conversation poems’ not only meditate on sounds heard, but themselves describe and
                  also communicate changes in volume. Consider the following shifts: from the owlet’s
                  cry which comes “loud” (l.3) to the quieter sound of the fluttering soot on the grate
                  (l.15) in “Frost at Midnight;” from the silence of the stream (l.6) to the happy song
                  of nightingales in “The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem;” from “green and silent
                  spot” (l.1) and “small and silent dell” (l.2) to the crescendo in Invasion’s “thunder
                  and the shout,/ And all the crash” (l.36-37) in “Fears in Solitude;” from “the stilly
                  murmur of the distant Sea,” that “Tells us of Silence” (ll.11-12), to the music of
                  the breeze as it plays over the lute strings in “The Eolian Harp” (l.15). Coleridge
                  offers a descriptive vocabulary to describe a range of dynamics, a shifting scale
                  of volume from loud to quiet to silence. But his poems not only name and describe
                  these dynamics but also perform these shifts in their verbal, acoustic and rhythmic
                  textures. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The late critic Thomas Macfarland was attuned to dynamic shifts across Coleridge’s
                     poetry. The opening lines of “The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem,” he suggests,
                     have, “a quietness that is in stark contrast to the frenetic notes of the hysterical
                     sublime” we hear in some of Coleridge’s earlier work (246). The word “quieter” suggests
                     intimate, less declamatory; but his choice of word also conveys a sense of volume.
                     I want to push this yet further and think about how this sound, this quiet is expressed: 
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">Distinguishes the West, no long thin slip</div>

                        </div>
                     </div> How is a sense of quietness achieved in these lines? The language seems to be visual
                     rather than aural here; the description begins by calling up to the eye what is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> seen, clouds, a slip of light, trembling hues. The repetition of “no” emphasises,
                     by contrast, the solidity of the deictic “this” in the phrase “this mossy bridge”,
                     and the simple affirmation “You see” in the next line, emphasising what the eye can
                     see. This visual language is soundless in one sense, anticipating the soundlessness
                     described when we reach ‘no murmuring’ and ‘silently’. But the language takes on a
                     more complex sensory register when we reach “dim”, a word used in these lines to describe
                     a visual phenomena, faintness of light (<span style="font-style:italic">OED </span>1 a), but which also had currency as an acoustic term in this period, meaning “Of
                     sound, and esp. of the voice: Indistinct, faint” (<span style="font-style:italic">OED,</span> 5; curiously, the last citation in <span style="font-style:italic">OED </span>for this sense of the word is in the Romantic period, in Shelley’s 1817 poem “Marianne’s
                     dream”). The lines create an effect of <span style="font-style:italic">diminuendo</span> in terms of visual description and also in sound, so that effects of eye and ear confirm
                     and amplify one another. What else in the opening lines suggests quiet? That word
                     “still” is important; it offers one way in to thinking about how a sense of quiet
                     is expressed in these lines. The predominant meaning of “still” here is “motionless”
                     (<span style="font-style:italic">OED</span>, 1). But for Coleridge’s first readers the word also had a sense relating to volume,
                     “Of a voice, sounds, utterances: Subdued, soft, not loud (<span style="font-style:italic">OED,</span> 2a). This sense of “Still”, according to <span style="font-style:italic">OED</span> is no longer current. I think that this correspondence between movement and volume
                     offers one way to think about how poetry expresses sound dynamics in and through shifts
                     in movement, tempo or pace. It is, after all, moving or vibration of matter, as Coleridge
                     understood, that creates sound in the first place as in the strings of a lute or an
                     Eolian harp. That word “trembling”, in the phrase “trembling hues”, amplifies the
                     sense I’m referring to here: overtly it’s referring to a visual phenomenon but it
                     calls a sense of gentle movement to mind, the gentle movement of a stringed instrument
                     playing very quietly (trembling suggests a faint movement).

                              trembling into thought, Coleridge had used the word “tremble” in his poem “Eolian
                              Harp”, first published 2 years (CW, Poetical Works I, ed. J. C.C. Mays, ll.46).</span></div>
                     </div> There is something suggestive about using Coleridge’s use of the word “trembling”
                     to describe <span style="font-style:italic">colour</span>, something synaesthetic perhaps, which calls to mind a kind of quiet sound by association.
                     But which also alerts us to the sound texture of these lines and the way in which
                     they move: the repetition suggests a kind of trembling and also a kind of quietening.
                     In the opening of “The Nightingale. A Conversation Poem, April 1798”, the thick texture
                     of repetition of the word “no” (ll.1, 2, 3, 6) which is drawn out by the <span style="font-style:italic">o </span>sound in “flows” (l.6) and “O’er” (l.7) creates a slowing effect, so that the sound
                     is not modulating as freely as we might expect, not moving not progressing, and this
                     slowing suggests a quietening.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Coleridge was interested in how gradations of sound were experienced by the listener
                  and also by the reader, and he was thoughtful about how that might be represented
                  on the page and in a poem. His poems are often intensely musical and sensitive to
                  acoustic shiftings. Changes in linguistic register, tense, shifts in metre, pauses,
                  punctuation marks, and the sonic texture of a line, the distribution of phonemes,
                  all contribute to how a poem shifts dynamics between loud and soft. Pitch and tempo,
                  genre, pacing and tonal register can contribute to a poem’s dynamics and Coleridge
                  takes full and subtle advantage of all those means. Here in these lines from the 1796
                  version of “The Eolian Harp,” for instance Coleridge creates a quietening effect rhythmically,
                  by slowing the pace of the poem: </p>
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">… How exquisite the scents </div>
                  <div class="l">Snatched from yon bean-field! and the world <span style="font-style:italic">so</span> hushed!</div>
                  <div class="l">The stilly murmur of the distant Sea </div>
                  <div class="l">Tells us of silence. (ll.9-12)</div>
               </div>
               <p> That italicized word <span style="font-style:italic">so</span> stands out, typographically more emphatic, but not, somehow, <span style="font-style:italic">louder</span>, than surrounding words. The word “so” (l.9) was italicized in the 1796 version of
                  the poem (which appeared with the title “EFFUSION XXXV. COMPOSED <span style="font-style:italic">AUGUST</span> 20<span style="font-style:italic">th</span>, 1795, AT CLEVEDON, SOMERSETSHIRE”) and the word was also italicised in the version
                  of the poem published in <span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (1803), entitled “Composed at Clevedon Somersetshire." We know that this emphasis
                  was intended by Coleridge because he underlined the word (“<span style="text-decoration:underline">so</span>”) in the manuscript version of the poem he sent to Cottle for publication in 1796
                  (Rugby MS). However, the version of the poem published <span style="font-style:italic">Sibylline Leaves</span> in 1817 does not have the word “so” italicised.</p>
               <p>The italicisation (or its omission) is significant in terms of how we hear the line,
                  and also in how the line represents volume. The use of <span style="font-style:italic">italics</span> can create shifts of vocal tone but it can also contribute to shifts of pace and
                  rhythm, which in turn suggests a dynamic effect, in this case, a quietening. Here,
                  the italicization alters the rhythm of the line so that instead of the iambic pattern
                  of “the WORLD so HUSHED,” that word “so” gains a stress, to the WORLD SO HUSHED. These
                  three stresses in a row slow us down and the change of pace creates a feeling of intimacy—drawing
                  us in, as it slows us down: together these contribute to the effect of <span style="font-style:italic">diminuendo</span>. There is a sense of quieting as we reach the word “hushed,” a slowing down which
                  puts emphasis on the quiet it denotes, a quiet which fades to the silence of the white
                  space at the end of the end-stopped line. The word “hushed” conveys the sense, still
                  current, of “Reduced to silence; silenced, stilled, quieted” (<span style="font-style:italic">OED</span>): in slowing the pace of the line by emphasizing the word “<span style="font-style:italic">so,”</span> Coleridge creates a stilling effect rhythmically, and this contributes to the quietening
                  of volume described and enacted.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The rhythmic shift in the next line, sounded in the phrase “the stilly murmur,” with
                     its return to an iambic pattern, contributes to a steadying which suggests a quietening
                     effect. The rhythm of the line shifts in the phrase “of the distant sea,” so that
                     the word “distant” is emphasized after two unstressed syllables (“of the”); this shift
                     in perspective is also suggested semantically as we shift from the proximity suggested
                     by “murmur,” suggesting the “low continuous sound of water” (<span style="font-style:italic">OED</span>, 2) but also a quiet speaking voice, “A word or sentence spoken softly or indistinctly;
                     faint or barely audible speech” (<span style="font-style:italic">OED,</span> 4).

                     </div> This “murmur” is a quiet voice we can hear only if we are close to the sound; a shift
                     from this suggestion of proximity to “distant” produces a fading effect, a kind of
                     diminuendo. Once again, a shift in pace and rhythm contributes to a quietening effect.
                     There is a slowing of pace, suggested by the thickening acoustic texture of the lines
                     with their alliterative clustering of <span style="font-style:italic">s </span>sounds that concentrate in, and emphasise, the final word of the sentence, “silence”:
                     “the <span style="font-style:italic">s</span>tilly murmur of the di<span style="font-style:italic">s</span>tant <span style="font-style:italic">s</span>ea/ Tells u<span style="font-style:italic">s </span>of <span style="font-style:italic">silence.</span>” This is an example of the kind of interplay between sound and semantic meaning which
                     T.S. Eliot understood was key to the auditory imagination, that “feeling for syllable
                     and rhythm, penetrating far below the conscious levels of thought and feeling, invigorating
                     every word” (T.S. Eliot, ‘Matthew Arnold’, in <span style="font-style:italic">T. S. Eliot, The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism </span>(London 1933) p. 119). Coleridge creates acoustic shifts in and through rhythmic and
                     verbal textures and contextures in many different ways, including the use of emphatic
                     markings such as underlining or italicisation as well as through shifts of rhythm
                     and pace, as he does in these lines.

               <p>The change in register in the line “the stilly murmur of the distant sea” also contributes
                  to a sense of historical distance, and to a related sense of acoustic distancing or
                  quietening, diminuendo. The line, “the stilly murmur of the distant sea,” sounds archaic
                  with its balanced pairs of adjective and noun- <span style="font-style:italic">stilly</span> murmur, <span style="font-style:italic">distant</span> sea- in which the <span style="font-style:italic">st</span> sounds chime with <span style="font-style:italic">stilly</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">distant</span>. The word <span style="font-style:italic">stilly, </span>in itself archaic, denotes not moving- and so the slowing down effect of the previous
                  line, <span style="font-style:italic">the world so hushed, </span>leads to this articulation of stilly-ness. A still sea, is, of course, a silent sea,
                  and, as we might expect, another sense of the adverb “stilly”, recorded in <span style="font-style:italic">OED,</span> bears this out; “In a still manner; silently, quietly; in a low voice; †secretly.”
                  The sea is very quiet and therefore tells us of silence. It is an odd thing to say,
                  that it tells us <span style="font-style:italic">of</span> silence. That <span style="font-style:italic">of </span>is intriguing. It’s not that the sea is silent, it tells us of – about - silence,
                  a story of silence, perhaps. This is a playfully indirect- and perhaps we could say
                  a <span style="font-style:italic">quieter</span> way of telling us that the sea is silent, a syntactic distance opens up into a deeper
                  silence.</p>

                  <p>In “The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem,” the play with sound and semiotics takes
                     another form: the invitation to listen at the heart of the poem is not voiced, but
                     silent, signed rather than said: 
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">My dear babe,</div>

                        <div class="l">Mars all things with his imitative lisp</div>

                     </div> Here in these lines Coleridge is offering us the sign language of a pre-verbal baby,
                     and inviting us to think about the silence of signs on the page. It is interesting
                     to note that it was in the Romantic period that a new codified form of sign language
                     for the deaf was developed in France (Jacobus: 2012, 84-88). Coleridge’s baby’s gesture
                     can be better understood when placed in relation to some recent examples of sign language
                     in the work of deaf poets Raymond Antrobus and Ilya Kaminsky as part of their own
                     enquiries into the forms, dynamics and politics of signs and silence.

                     the deaf man Daniel Harris killed after police officers, who had been chasing him
                     for speeding, misinterpreted his use of sign language and shot him. The poem interrogates
                     the difficulties of interpreting sign language; Antrobus was trained in British Sign
                     language, which is different from American Sign. But a failure to understand sign
                     can, as Antrobus points out in the poem, have tragic consequences. He examines the
                     cruel irony that the ASL sign for <span style="font-style:italic">alive</span> looks like two guns pointing up to the sky:

                  played out, from the very opening lines: </p>

               </div>
               <p> The poem’s very first lines signal an interest in the relation between eye and ear
                  in a visual rhyme, or ‘eye rhyme’ between “ministry” and “cry.” This silent eye rhyme
                  is part of the poem’s play with the way sound is codified or represented in visual
                  form, in the semiotics of sound in print. The sound of that “cry” is picked up later
                  in the half-rhyme with “side” and later “life.” Perhaps it’s too much of a stretch
                  to suggest that t the long <span style="font-style:italic">I</span> sound, or “eye” rhyme, is registered to the eye but not to the ear in “live.” Nonetheless,
                  in these lines Coleridge invites us, in different ways, to move in and out between
                  eye and ear, between rhyme seen and rhyme heard. Throughout the poem eye and ear work
                  together and askance in unexpected ways.</p>
               <p>Another striking feature of these opening lines is the dramatic dynamic shift from
                  the “loud” cry of the owlet outdoors to the quiet of the indoor scene, a shift which
                  produces a sense of intimacy and interiority and the accompanying illusion of <span style="font-style:italic">diminuendo</span>. That word “loud” primes our listening ears for a certain pitch of sound—which emphasizes
                  in contrast the subsequent lines’ account of quiet. The poem’s shifts in dynamics
                  depend on and produce shifts in intimacy as it records a shift from outside to inside,
                  from loud noise to quiet. The word “secret” in the very first line suggests both quiet
                  and intimacy, since “secret” carries the suggestion, now obsolete, but current when
                  Coleridge was writing, of reticence, or quiet: “Of a person: †Reserved or reticent
                  in conduct or conversation (obsolete); not given to indiscreet talking or the revelation
                  of secrets; silent as to any matter, uncommunicative, close.” (<span style="font-style:italic">OED,</span> 2 a). By giving the frost a curious sense of human agency, it “performs a secret
                  ministry,” Coleridge draws out association of “secret” with quiet and closeness</p>
               <p>The poem creates this sense of closeness dramatically, too, so that the reader feels
                  as though we are standing with the poet, listening with him. That is expressed in
                  the shift from the past tense “came loud” to the present tense “hark again!,” from
                  the temporal distance of the past tense to the sense of immediacy suggested by HARK
                  which instructs the reader, <span style="font-style:italic">now</span>, give ear, listen! The reader imaginatively is listening but also aware of being
                  a reader, something of which the poem deliberately reminds us.</p>

                     increasingly abstract and hard to imagine. The owl, the crackling fire, the fluttering
                     speck, the dream (inaudible to another), the quiet shining of the quiet moon. Indeed,
                     the model Coleridge chose to describe the poem was musical rather than vocal or dramatic:
                     he conceived of the poem in musical terms, as a Rondo, a form which was extremely
                     popular in the late eighteenth century. In an earlier draft, the poem ended with six
                     lines which describe the baby’s response to the icicles. Explaining why he cut these
                     lines, Coleridge wrote: ‘The last six lines I omit because they destroy the rondo,
                     and return upon itself of the Poem. Poems of this kind &amp; length ought to lie coiled
                     with its ‘tail round its’ head.” (<span style="font-style:italic">CC</span>, 16.1.1, p.456n.). Coleridge had taken Charles Burney’s <span style="font-style:italic">General History of Music</span> out of Bristol library a few months before he composed “Frost at Midnight” (in November
                     1797), and may well have read the account of the rondo in its pages (155). His interest
                     in Burney’s book around the time he wrote “Frost at Midnight” suggests a rich and
                     suggestive musical context for interpreting the poem’s sounds and silences.</p>

                     aurality, as a listening poem. A poem which meditates on the experience of listening
                     not just to the sound of a voice, but to the sounds of the non-human, the owls, the
                     fire, the quiet itself. And it creates the effects of quiet through particular codes

                  of the poem from its traditional emphasis on the acoustic to a new appreciation of

                  rather than the acoustic qualities and expression. I would push this further and argue
                  that Coleridge is deeply interested in the <span style="font-style:italic">relation</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">dynamics</span> between the visual and the acoustic but also between the visual and the aural. Patterns
                  can be heard as well as seen. Throughout the poem, Coleridge plays with the way visual
                  and acoustic dimensions are intimately related. This is in part because the poem is
                  written with a sense of its own mode of reception in mind: that is to say, Coleridge
                  was keenly aware that it might be read in silence, and so was especially thoughtful
                  about how sound might be represented in print patterns, on the page.</p>
               <p>There is a curious play between eye and ear, for instance, in the poem’s concluding
                  lines: </p>
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">[…] whether the eave-drops fall </div>
                  <div class="l">Heard only in the trances of the blast, </div>
                  <div class="l">Or if the secret ministry of frost </div>
                  <div class="l">Shall hang them up in silent icicles, </div>
                  <div class="l">Quietly shining to the quiet Moon. (ll. 70-74)</div>
               </div>
               <p> The beautiful and strange description of a moon shining quietly prompts a question,
                  an imagining, of what a loud shining might sound like. On the one hand, the idea of
                  a “quiet moon” is a folk idiom to describe a new moon, and indeed the poem was written
                  at the time of the new moon. And yet the image is so much more suggestive. It is “quietly
                  shining to the quiet moon”: that <span style="font-style:italic">quiet</span> repeated in <span style="font-style:italic">quietly</span>, emphatically. An icicle can be silent by imagined contrast: its silence remembers
                  the sound of dripping water before it has frozen into an icicle, or after it thaws.</p>
               <p>Another example of Coleridge’s interests in the play between eye and ear is the visual
                  analogy to musical form described by Levinson: the fluttering soot on the grate, she
                  argues, and suggests visually (in her <span style="font-style:italic">fig</span>. 7, reproduced below), can be read as a visual representation of a stave with a musical
                  note. And to take this further, it is the semiotics of music, the semiotics of sound,
                  that interest Coleridge here.</p>

               <p>“Frost at Midnight” is a poem which explores the edges of silence. Coleridge has,
                  as Susan Wolfson notes, an “ear for such limits, of sound suspended” (Wolfson, 2008:
                  para. 3). There is an intriguing richness and, at times, an opacity to the poem’s
                  acoustic language which rewards attention, and which, in turn, invites new readings
                  and imaginings of the poem itself, and new possibilities for thinking about the quietudes
                  of Romantic Lyric<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> The poem generates thinking about what it might it mean to shine “quietly”. And about
                  how we might listen to the moon. And about the audibility and inaudibility of dreams.
                  Setting the poem’s sonic and aural language in the context of Coleridge’s wider thinking
                  about sound dynamics and acoustics and its imaginative possibilities, gives us some
                  hints.</p>
               <p>In 1827, Coleridge read Sir Charles Wheatstone’s “Experiments on Audition” and was
                  struck by his account of the microphone, an instrument which, he explained, “rendered
                  audible the weakest sounds” (70). Coleridge describes, in <span style="font-style:italic">Marginalia</span>, how it sparked a recognition of a “fond and earnest dream project of mine own …with
                  sundry other imaginations in what might be effected in the only embryo Science of
                  Acoustics” (197). The science of Acoustics, that “branch of physics concerned with
                  the properties and phenomena of sound, sometimes esp. in relation to hearing or speech.”
                  (<span style="font-style:italic">OED</span>,1), was just over 100 years old when Coleridge scribbled these words. As his marginal
                  gloss suggests, <span style="font-style:italic">Coleridge’s</span> fascination with acoustics was apparent years before he read of Wheatstone’s invention:
                  we find an interest in the properties and phenomena of sound registered in numerous
                  notebook entries and poems.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>We know, for instance, that he was fascinated by the sound experiments of the musician
                     and scientist Ernst Chladni (who was to publish the first textbook on acoustics in
                     1802), which seemed to show sound itself making shapes in iron filings.

                     as legend has it: ‘The sound is painting!’ (quoted in Cox, 14). The significance of
                     this experiment cannot be overstated: not only did it seem to reveal the material
                     form of sound, but doing so Chladni proved that sound could travel through solid substances
                     and could no longer “be subsumed under the ‘the science of air’ and could be considered
                     a branch of physics in its own right” (Viktoria Tkaczyk, 27-56, 27). Chladni first
                     published his acoustical figures in German in 1787, and gave a copy to the Royal Society
                     in November of the same year. Coleridge may have read about the experiment in the <span style="font-style:italic">Philosophical Magazine </span>(3, May 1799, 389-96) in which a translation of the Jena physics professor Johann
                     Heinrich Voigt’s 1796 account of it (“Beytrag in den Versuchen über die Klangfiguren
                     schwingender Flächen”, <span style="font-style:italic">Neues Journal der Physik</span> vol. 3, part 4 (1796), 391-399) was published as “Observations and experiments in

                     in <span style="font-style:italic">The Analytic Review</span>, volume 1 (July 1788, 371-2). Chladni toured Europe conducting performances of the
                     experiment to enraptured audiences (including Napoleon, in the Tuilerries Palace);
                     Coleridge may also have learned of the sound painting during his visit to Gottingen

                     (he had visited Gottingen between December 1792 and early 1793, https://monoskop.org/Ernst
                     Chladni ). The experiment was to be popularised in London in 1800 when Thomas Young
                     repeated the demonstration to an enthralled audience at The Royal Society. The Chladni
                     figures were part of a wider culture of acoustic spectacle in the early nineteenth
                     century. Edward Gillen explains that in “London’s fashionable West End . . . sonorous
                     displays, especially those of a musical nature, combined with philosophical inquiry,
                     provided mystifying and wondrous entertainment” (1). He argues that “Chladni’s acoustic
                     plates provided a rich example of how specialist and non-specialist audiences alike
                     could engage with new scientific ideas from the Continent”. While I am not suggesting
                     that Coleridge’s poems of the 1790s were influenced directly by Chladni’s experiments,
                     I want to propose that they too register a curiosity about what he was to describe
                     as “the Embryo science of acoustics”, which was itself part of a culture of curiosity
                     about sound in the Romantic period.

               <p>Coleridge’s own interest in the semiotics of sound and its representation is figured
                  in the Conversation poems and based on his wider interest in science during his stay
                  in Somerset the 1790s. As Tim Fulford has explained, the Conversation poems were influenced
                  by and part of a wider culture of scientific enquiry. Pushing Fulford’s argument yet
                  further, we might understand Coleridge’s Conversation poems as articulations of a
                  growing interest in and curiosity not only about the nature of air, but also about
                  a relate field of enquiry, the science of acoustics, and in particular, the movement
                  and materiality of sound. In “Frost at Midnight” this interest was perhaps modulated
                  by his sense of the poems’ expected mode of reception: he knew that it was likely
                  to be read in silence, heard only in the mind’s ear. But it is also framed by its
                  occasion, spoken to a sleeping baby who cannot hear him, at least not consciously.
                  </p>
               <p>The poem’s concluding lines meditate on the sounds and silences of water drops and
                  icicles in a way that puts pressure on the language of listening: </p>
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">[…] whether the eve-drops fall </div>
                  <div class="l">Heard only in the trances of the blast, </div>
                  <div class="l">Or if the secret ministry of frost </div>
                  <div class="l">Shall hang them up in silent icicles, </div>
                  <div class="l">Quietly shining to the quiet Moon. (ll.70-74)</div>
               </div>
               <p> The word “silent” invites our listening. Here, in these lines, or perhaps I should
                  say through these lines, our ears become subtly tuned to the sounds of <span style="font-style:italic">silence</span> which shifts gently into <span style="font-style:italic">quiet</span>. The line “<span style="font-style:italic">quietly shining to the quiet moon,</span>” picks up and resounds the <span style="font-style:italic">i</span> of <span style="font-style:italic">silent icicles, </span>recalling the sound of that <span style="font-style:italic">silence</span> even as it suggests a different sound. It’s worth noting here that the phrase is
                  not, as it might have been, <span style="font-style:italic">silently </span>shining to the<span style="font-style:italic">silent </span>moon – but <span style="font-style:italic">quietly</span> shining to the <span style="font-style:italic">quiet</span> moon<span style="font-style:italic">,</span> and this difference suggests a thawing of <span style="font-style:italic">silence,</span> since <span style="font-style:italic">quiet</span> can, but does not always or only, mean silent. Quiet can suggest a low or subdued
                  sound (<span style="font-style:italic">OED</span> 1A, a, <span style="font-style:italic">adj</span>, “making little sound”; 2a, “making little or no noise”). That repeated word <span style="font-style:italic">quietly</span> dims into a shorter <span style="font-style:italic">quiet</span>, drawing the ear to listen in, to the possibility of the moon’s quiet sound<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> And the line has only 4 stresses instead of the 5 stress iambic baseline of the poem,
                  so we are left both with a sense of lack- and anticipation - listening out for the
                  last stress.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>There’s a sense of diminishing and <span style="font-style:italic">diminuendo</span>, but also a feeling of completion as “quietly” turns to “quiet,” and as we move from
                     “icicles” to the monosyllabic “moon”. This drawing in suggests both sonic diminuendo
                     and intimacy, despite the great distance of the moon. The icicles are quiet because,
                     unlike the water dropping from the eaves, they no longer splash and make a sound.
                     There is a strange shift of scale and of distance here – one which prompts us to question
                     how a moon might be quiet. That repeated word “quiet” suggests a kind of proximity
                     —even, that it might be possible to hear the moon, that its sound might be quiet,
                     even as are the nearby icicles. The quiet shining of the icicles <span style="font-style:italic">to</span> the moon is imagined as a form of address, to the listening moon. These icicles are
                     silent but eloquent: and yet their silence is not eloquent of the self in the way
                     Salome Voegelin proposes. (83). Rather, it speaks of the presence of something greater.
                     As Paul Magnuson puts it, “at the quietest moments of the year when the icicles are
                     frozen in silence, there is a force in the world shining through the icicles.”

               <h2><span class="head">viii. Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>For Coleridge, the ability to listen was fundamental to being a poet. A great poet,
                  he suggests, writing in July 1802 to his friend William Sotheby, should be able to
                  listen with “the ear of a wild Arab list’ning in the silent Desart” (Coleridge, <span style="font-style:italic">Letters</span>: ii, 810). We know that the Arab is listening, in silence – but we do not know what
                  it is he listens to or for. The state of listening, hearkening, for something is the
                  poetic state. But silence also seems important: Coleridge’s test for the poet combines
                  forms of privation – that emptiness, which shares the root ‘desert’: the dryness of
                  deserts, the solitude of the deserted, and the soundlessness of silence. The wild
                  Arab is alert for the slightest sound- listening FOR sound in silence. Coleridge’s
                  words invite the reader too to listen - that word “listening” alerts us to the sound
                  patterns instinct in the lines that follow. The poet, Coleridge goes on, should also
                  be possessed of “the eye of a North American Indian tracing the footsteps of an Enemy
                  upon the leaves that strew the forest, the <span style="font-style:italic">Touch</span> of a blind man feeling the face of a darling Child” (810). Primed to listen, the
                  reader might pick up a suggestion of sound in the word <span style="font-style:italic">footsteps</span> (they are footsteps he is tracing, rather than the <span style="font-style:italic">footprints</span> we might have expected) and the sound of these footsteps resounds in the <span style="font-style:italic">st</span> sounds of <span style="font-style:italic">strew</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">forest</span>. It alerts us to the gentle pathos of that word <span style="font-style:italic">touch </span>touching in <span style="font-style:italic">sound</span> the <span style="font-style:italic">child</span> as the blind man touches its face.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thinking about different kinds of listening in a notebook entry a few months later,
                     in September 1802, Coleridge returns to the blind man and the wild Arab as figures
                     for sensory acuity. His choice of an Arab and a North American Indian as examples
                     are striking and suggest, perhaps, a primitivist notion that such peoples had more
                     acute senses than Europeans. Choosing these geographically remote listeners introduces
                     a poignant distance between himself and the figure of the ideal listener, which in
                     turn intensifies the dynamics of listening described. Here, the blind man and the
                     Arab come together in the figure of “a <span style="font-style:italic">blind Arab</span> list’ning in the wilderness” (Coleridge, <span style="font-style:italic">Notebooks</span>, i. 1244): now the blindness of the listener intensifies his listening once again.
                     And instead of the blind man feeling the face of the darling child we have, more painful,
                     a different kind of listening, a listening which can never be satisfied, a “Mother

                     loss and absence – Coleridge’s examples move through degrees of privation - from the
                     blind Arab in the desart to the poignant expectancy of the mother listening for a
                     sound that she will never hear.

               of syllabic length and accent; but when Beattie uses the terms “loud and soft” to
               describe rhythm, he is doing something slightly different, referring to affective
