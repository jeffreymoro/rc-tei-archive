               <h1><span class="head">Introduction: Sound Studies in Romanticism</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>This collection takes up two interrelated questions. One, how might the interdisciplinary
               field of sound studies change the way we engage with Romantic literature? Two, how
               can sound studies foment broader inquiries into a range of Romanticisms not exclusive
               to British Romanticism? Inspired by such thinking, the essays gathered here attest
               to how sound studies can uncover a multisensorial Romanticism steeped in narratives
               of experiential history not limited to Romantic literatures of just one place or people
               or time. As questions of multisensory meaning and experience arise as a red thread
               running across the volume, attendant questions pertaining to the stakes of human relationality
               both in a social sense and an environmental one become impossible to ignore. The volume
               stands as a fresh complement to 2008 <span style="font-style:italic">Praxis</span> volume edited by Susan J. Wolfson and titled “<a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/praxis/soundings/index.html">Soundings of Things Done”: The Poetry and Poetics of Sound in the Romantic Ear and
                  Era</a>. While those generative essays deal chiefly with “the sounding sense of Romantic
               poetry, both thematically (a poetics of sound) and sensually/phonically (the poetry
               of sound and the sound of poetry),” this volume studies sound through a wider cross-section
               of Romantic genres. This includes not poetry alone but also periodicals, drama, and
               the novel as well as governmental, musical, and scientific literature (1). And whereas
               the previous volume foregrounds Wordsworthian poetics and a smaller subset of authors
               of British Romanticism, these essays increase their reach to include a wider array
               of writers, German Romanticism, and extra-Romantic historical and contemporary documents
               on sound, voice, and song.</p>
            <p>This collection, then, begins to open up larger conversations for scholars and readers
               of Romantic-era literature and culture such that they might consider a wider assortment
               of representations of sounds, silences, voices, calls, quietudes, volumes, modes of
               listening, sensing, and interpreting sonic experiences, including human and nonhuman
               sound-bound relations. By so doing—in some small yet important way—these essays herald
               Dylan Robinson’s recent call to acknowledge “how writing allows certain moments of
               sonic experience to be heard while foreclosing upon others” and how a person’s “positionality
               guides the way [they] listen” (1). There is a politics to how we make sense of sound,
               how we mark sonic experiences, how we record practices of listening, voicing, sounding,
               hearing—as Steingo and Sykes remind us, nearly two decades ago Jonathan Sterne noted
               in the <span style="font-style:italic">Audible Past</span> “that, in the West, the ‘differences between hearing and seeing’ … [are] <span style="font-style:italic">ideologically loaded</span> (2 original emphasis).</p>
            <p>Sterne’s iconic essay, “Sonic Imagination” from <span style="font-style:italic">The Sound Studies Reader</span> (2012), defines sound studies as an interdisciplinary project “that takes sound as
               its analytical point of departure or arrival” (2). To “<span style="font-style:italic">think sonically</span>” entails “analyzing both sonic practices and the discourses and institutions that
               describe them” (2). The task of the critic of sound studies, then, is to “redescribe
               what sound does in the human world, and what humans do in the sonic world,” to “always
               go beyond … common-sense categories” to uncover “what we don’t already know” (2).
               In keeping with Sterne’s definition, the essays appearing here attune readers to Romantic
               representations of human sonic worlds as well as more-than-human sonic worlds to underscore
               the key parts played therein by sound. Across the whole, the volume experiments with
               making sense of Romantic literature by way of sound studies. Consequently, and as
               this volume’s readers will learn for themselves, every one of these essays features
               questions of relationality. In this sense, the volume coheres in the manner of a chorus
               uniting voices of all sorts that in this instance cannot but sing of relationality
               because sound does not exist in a vacuum and because its histories are more contingently
               experiential than broadly universal.</p>
            <p>Each author demonstrates how sound studies alerts us to key dimensions of Romantic
               literatures and cultures that we didn’t already know. The collection moves from rethinking
               modes of lyric listening to discovering the role that sonic thinking and feeling plays
               in conceptualizing the Romantic power of the imagination. It registers the ways in
               which sonic terror operates in the gothic novel. It broadcasts how understanding sound
               not only in a narrow auditory sense but as a relational multisensory experience enables
               us to reconceive Romanticism’s models of epistemology, ecology, and aesthetics. Sound
               studies makes it impossible to <span style="font-style:italic">un</span>hear Romantic literature’s preoccupation with ways of knowing and feeling that couple
               together this sensory mode with that, ultimately complicating simplistic accounts
               of the imperial, oppressive primacy of the visual.</p>
            <p>In homage to the original <span style="font-style:italic">Praxis</span> volume on sound and its nuanced discussions of British Romantic lyric in particular,
               this volume’s opening essays stage a veritable dialogue on representations of sound
               in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s classic poem “Frost at Midnight.” Mina Gorji’s and Elizabeth
               Weybright’s respective treatments of one poem, Coleridge’s “Frost at Midnight”(c.
               1798), showcase how reading Romantic poetry in light of the sound studies turn can
               yield profuse interpretive futures for studies in Romanticism.</p>
            <p>Gorji’s “Lyric Listening” inquires into the place of sound and volume as well as listening
               – or the lack thereof - in lyric studies. Using Coleridge’s poem and lyric theory
               as key points of departure, Gorji notes how the word <span style="font-style:italic">volume </span>“acquired an acoustic register in the late eighteenth century” and explains that the
               <span style="font-style:italic">OED</span>’s first recorded use of the term bearing this new meaning is attributed to Byron’s
               <span style="font-style:italic">Werner </span>(1822) (para 3). Gorji contends that while “Frost at Midnight” does not use the term
               <span style="font-style:italic">volume</span> itself, the poem bespeaks a Coleridgean “preoccup[ation] with how to represent sounds
               and especially volume, and that his imaginative interest in acoustics and in musical
               forms and notation informed the way he shaped sound into both aural patterns and visual
               language in his poetry” (para 3).</p>
            <p>Gorji questions how lyric poetry might serve as “a container for sound” or as an “expression
               of volume” through a richly contextualized interpretation of “Frost at Midnight.”
               The essay grapples with how the poem “records a playful exploration of dynamics and
               of the various ways (graphic, rhythmic, linguistic and as an effect of tempo) in which
               sound and quiet could be represented to both eye and ear in the poem” (para 3). Extending
               Susan Wolfson’s essay in particular from the previous <span style="font-style:italic">Praxis </span>volume on sound, Gorji thickens her consideration of “Frost at Midnight” with other
               contemporary and later lyric poetry to offer “the state of listening, hearkening”
               after “something” as <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> “poetic state” of Romantic lyric. Gorji gives readers new ways to think about “the
               significance of silence and quiet in Coleridge’s poems, and in Romantic lyric more
               widely,” with the essay ultimately calling for a “new kind of listening” and pushing
               “Lyric Studies [to expand] the range and frequency of its listening.”</p>
            <p>Gorji’s work on Coleridge dovetails with Elizabeth Weybright’s “Unquiet Romanticism,”
               which likewise engages with “Frost at Midnight” and Wolfson’s “Sounding Romantic.”
               Yet Weybright’s approach departs from Gorji’s by offering a comparative reading of
               the poem that takes into account related representations of sound—and furthermore,
               noise—in Wordsworth’s <span style="font-style:italic">Prelude </span>and Percy Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mont Blanc.</span> Weybright’s essay demonstrates how “Romantic literary representations of listening
               present noise as an underpinning of phenomenological experience and audition” (23).
               Noise, as Romantic literature frames it, is “as an essential (sometimes involuntary)
               activity through which human subjects enter into self-reflective reciprocity with
               elements of their social and natural worlds” (23). In this sense, noise is defined
               as a dynamic interaction, one prompting humanity to recognize itself as always already
               in necessary dialogue with the cultural and natural worlds within which they reside.
               Building on influential theorizations of noise, sound, and silence penned by the likes
               of Jacques Attali, John Cage, Michael Chion, Jean-Luc Nancy, David Novak, Jonathan
               Sterne, Shelley Trower, Salomé Voegelin, and more, Weybright’s contribution to this
               volume resoundingly testifies to the rich upwellings of thought that arise from a
               conceptual terrain sensitive to both sound studies and studies of Romanticism.</p>
            <p>Rather than reading “Frost at Midnight” from a musical perspective akin to Gorji’s
               project, Weybright centers her inquiry into Romantic lyric poetry around the question
               of “how sounds … far removed from anything like musical organization (or even the
               categories of tonal sound available at the turn of the nineteenth century) might be
               generative points of contact between the creative mind and the phenomenal world” (6-7).
               For Weybright, figurations of “‘quiet’ things made ‘unquiet’” become central to understanding
               sound as it relates to models of subjectivity in Romantic lyric, particularly as Romantic
               poets’ “approaches to quietly noisy sounds … refuse absolute epistemological or symbolic
               stability” (2, 3). Weybright argues “that for the Romantics, listening to unquiet
               noise is often both an active ‘straining’ to place oneself as a creative agent in
               relation to the world and—somewhat paradoxically—a compelled state of receptive embodiment”
               where noise is not understood “as a one-dimensionally overwhelming, distracting or
               painful thing, but rather was an ambiguous, sometimes baffling, and sometimes imaginatively
               provocative presence” (3, 4). </p>
            <p>David Sigler’s essay dismantles the binary that counterpoises sound against vision.
               In “The sound of the gaze in Ann Radcliffe’s <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance</span>” Sigler troubles the simplistic formula that takes sound as the bearer of mystery
               and vision as the bringer of knowledge. In the end, Sigler deconstructs the gaze-as-bad/sound-as-good
               dichotomy extant within Radcliffe criticism, Gothic Studies, and Romantic Studies
               more generally. The essay notes that in Radcliff’s novel, “sound … asks to be seen”
               and “show[s] vision to be an aspect of sound,” all of which allows Sigler to unearth
               “the psychic consequences of that sensory entanglement” (1, 4). It is less that we
               cannot know sound in Sigler’s analysis of Radcliff’s gothic novel, and more that -
               like desire - sound yields an “excess of signification” that could never be fully
               determined. Thereby sound harbors the power to terrify with its potential to lead
               us into spaces of the unknown and indeterminate. Sigler’s approach pairs sound studies
               with psychoanalysis to demonstrate that by “thinking about sound through epistemologies
               of vision, Radcliff could respond to contemporary debates about gender, class, and
               privilege” (3). That is, sound has the capacity to play such a role in the novel precisely
               because “sound (including music, noise, and silence) had an important visual component
               in the eighteenth-century English culture, especially for the construction of gender”
               (4).</p>
            <p>Sigler’s analysis of <span style="font-style:italic">A Sicilian Romance </span>confirms that “Radcliff hears lack as a positive presence in its own right, consistently
               crossing the visual and sonic registers to highlight a multisensory ambiguity” (28).
               Intriguingly, by thinking with sound studies approaches, Sigler unearths how “Radcliff
               subjects her characters to a sonic voyeurism that exceeds Foucauldian and Sartrean
               models of the gaze” (28). The essay offers a fresh understanding of the novel by conveying
               how “Radcliff challenges emergent visual epistemologies of the eighteenth century
               and reorganizes prevailing patterns of Enlightenment subjectivity” (28). Through a
               compelling assessment of the sonic contexts within which Radcliff’s characters are
               placed, Sigler stresses how “lack, in [Radcliff’s] account, is not something missing
               but something present and resonant” (28).</p>
            <p>Joel Faflak’s contribution, “Shelley’s Sound Body,” turns upon questions of voice,
               vocal expression, and listening in Percy Shelley’s lyrical drama <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound </span>to confront the ways in which sound challenges sense making even as it is derived
               of the senses. Faflak’s project “explore[s an] incompossibility between voice and
               the said” in Shelley’s lines (1). Akin to Sigler’s work, Faflak acknowledges that
               “Romanticism inherits from the Enlightenment a preoccupation with sight, visuality,
               and the gaze as both formative and troubling forms of how an emergent modernity increasingly
               comes to apprehend the world” (2). But at the same time, Faflak underscores that “in
               its preoccupation with voice and sound, however, Romanticism explores what this apprehension
               misses” (2). More to the point, Romanticism’s debates around voice and sound foreground
               compelling questions of human potential and right action, where the very act of listening
               assumes a political edge and bears great ontological weight. Such debates held across
               Romantic literature announce “that human potential ‘does not [necessarily] solidify
               in an object of fetish reverence’—the kind of reverence that [in <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound</span>] guarantees tyranny as a symbol and method of prescribing what humans and thus the
               human itself can and should be” (2).</p>
            <p>For Faflak, “sound in Shelley’s poem seems to be merely the medium” but in a sort
               of Kittleresque fashion “at the same time [sound] facilitates a mode of relationality
               that is the matrix of meaning itself without making meaning present” (23). Because
               sound acts as both medium and never-fully-present message in <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound</span>, “sound insists on its own opacity,” and thus Shelley’s thinking chimes with Édourard
               Glissant’s when the latter writes of “the ‘errantry’ of ‘Totality’s imaginary [which]
               allows the detours that lead away from anything totalitarian’” (23). Faflak argues
               that <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound </span>“asks us to listen without prejudice, as if that is ever possible” since counter to
               any “illusions of transparency … listening requires the implicit acknowledgement that
               we can never truly understand what we are listening for” (24). In keeping with this
               ethos, though the poem directs readers to listen as an intrinsic good and goes so
               far as to devote the “fourth Act [to] a staging of the act of listening itself … the
               poem doesn’t tell us what to listen <span style="font-style:italic">for</span>” (25, author’s emphasis). Instead, and in light of its prescription to listen, <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound </span>scripts for its readers yet another unpredictable scene, a scene to be played out
               beyond the pages of the poem: “confronted by the nothingness of sound from which meaning
               can or might or might not come, we are nonetheless compelled to speak again” (25).</p>
            <p>Offering the collection’s closing argument, Gabriel Stephen Trop surveys significant
               works of German Romanticism to discuss how within this body of literature sounding
               objects figure “a metaphysical drama in acoustic form” (2). Beginning with the examples
               of the clock and the wind that famously open Novalis' novel <span style="font-style:italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen </span>(1802), Trop insists that readers not “reduce [such] objects, in traditional terms,
               to the function of setting—to background conditions against which an event takes place”
               (2). Instead, Trop argues, “they indicate tensions in the dynamic from which entities
               emerge, the domain the Romantics and post-Kantian philosophers called the <span style="font-style:italic">unconditioned </span>(<span style="font-style:italic">das Unbedingte</span>): the absolute as that to which no conditions can be attached” (2). As Trop notes,
               whereas “the window is typically a privileged speculative site, the opening onto a
               space at once visual and visionary, in Novalis “the first sensory organ to register
               the drama of the unconditioned in this instance is the ear” (2). The essay finds that
               within various works of German Romanticism “it is not just that sound indicates the
               absolute as that which is unconditioned, but that it constructs the real as a material-ideal
               system in the process of turning against itself, moving amidst the peaks and troughs
               of waves, perpetually unconditioning itself and carrying all beings along in its wake”
               (33). In this sense, then, a larger implication of Trop’s project is that sound carries
               us all in its wake.</p>
            <p>Across an ambitious yet careful analysis of sound in key works of German Romanticism,
               Trop emphasizes how such texts articulate “the irreducible gap between real and ideal
               as the basis for a diabolic and extra-normative generativity” (3). Trop engages with
               not just Novalis’ novel but also his “scientific and philosophical fragments,” Shelling’s
               take on “sonority” from the <span style="font-style:italic">Philosophy of Music</span>, Ørsted’s discussions of “sound as shock,” Ritter’s conception of sound “as an electrical
               virtuality of figuration,” Eichendorff’s “lyrical equation of contemplation with intoxication
               through the concept of rustling, <span style="font-style:italic">Rauschen,</span>” as well as E. T. A. Hoffmann’s “electrical-musical aesthetics” (3). In these respective
               treatments of sound each work testifies to how “Material vibrations, waves, oscillations,
               collisions—all taking place below the threshold of conscious perception—can be amplified
               in Romantic thought into larger-scale domains: from language to the soul, from acoustics
               to physiology, from wave oscillations to the modification of human sensuous capacities”
               (2). The essay uncovers how “sound discloses fundamental ontology as an oscillation
               of the real, the real <span style="font-style:italic">as </span> oscillation: a trembling of things that moves through all individuated forms, material
               and spiritual” (33). Trop grapples with how “the most intimate experiences of the
               world become the most alien” as the German Romantics he studies undertake “their speculative
               philosophical and aesthetic experiments with sound” (33). By these lights “we see
               that it is not sufficient for the German Romantics to describe sound and its material
               or ideal basis; rather, the latent dynamics emergent from the speculative and aesthetic
               encounter with sound must be redirected back into the world: as an art of unconditioning”
               (33).</p>
            <p>To round out the introduction by voicing one of the volume’s largest implications
               that might otherwise go unsung, I’ll turn once again to Sterne’s field-defining work
               on sound studies from <span style="font-style:italic">The Audible Past</span>. There Sterne makes quick work of dispelling a persistent myth: that the telegraph,
               telephone, phonograph, and radio irrevocably altered “the nature, meaning, and practices
               of sound in the late nineteenth century” (1). Sterne calls out seductive narratives
               such as these for being “incomplete” given that “[m]any of the practices, ideas, and
               constructs associated with sound-reproduction technologies predated the machines themselves”
               (1). Extending Sterne’s thinking, I offer the lines of Romantic literature studied
               here and elsewhere as a valuable record of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century soundways.
               Romanticism’s literary records predate the likes of the telegraph or the radio and
               so comprise a sound-reproducing technology bearing sonic cultures and sonic histories
               and sonic theories. These are cultures, histories, and theories that are at risk of
               going unheard if we were to fail to take the time now to turn their pages, to tune
               in, and listen to them.</p>
