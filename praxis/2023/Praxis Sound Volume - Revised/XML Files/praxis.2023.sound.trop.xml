            <p style="text-align: center;">Unconditioning Sound in German Romanticism</p>
            <p>I. The Wind and the Clock</p>
            <p>The opening sentences of one of the paradigmatic novels of German Romanticism,
                Novalis’ <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi> (1802), are infused with
                the rhythms of an unlikely dyad: the wind and the clock. The wind and the clock,
                working with and against one another, represent the initial conditions of a Romantic
                experiment in which a restless desire is awakened within the confines of the
                bourgeois household:</p>
            <p>The parents were already sleeping, the clock on the wall beat its monotonous tact,
                before the rattling windows whistled the wind; and the chamber was lit in
                alternation from the shimmer of the moon. The youth lay restless in his bed and
                recalled the stranger [<hi rend="italic">des Fremden</hi>] and his stories.<note

            <p>What follows is well known to readers of German Romantic literature: the walls of the
                room dissolve into a phantasmagoria of infinite distances, oceanic depths, caves and
                cliffs, death and rebirth, dreams within dreams, and somehow, impossibly, a peculiar
                clarity and distinction, and then: the erotic blue flower, simultaneously woman and
                plant, sexuated and hermaphroditic. This room is no mere room, but a womb, a matrix
                of emergence for a way of feeling and thinking that is fundamentally alien, at odds
                with the intelligibility of everyday life. Heinrich, pondering his attraction to the
                blue flower, declares: “No one can and no one will understand this.”<note

            </p>
            <p>Let us linger with the wind and the clock in the first sentence. Caught up in a
                narrative momentum driven towards the oneiric revelation of the blue flower, it is
                easy to overlook the function of these initial objects as figures in an acoustic
                drama, or rather, as indices of a metaphysical drama in acoustic form. One is
                tempted to reduce these two objects, in traditional terms, to the function of
                setting—to background conditions against which an event takes place. Not only are
                wind and clock not mere background conditions; rather, they indicate privileged
                points of entry into the very metaphysical matrix of becoming from which entities

            <p>Material vibrations, waves, oscillations, collisions—all taking place below the
                threshold of conscious perception—can be amplified in Romantic thought into

                wave oscillations to the modification of human sensuous capacities. In the words of

                universal solvent; the chemical principle “is contrary to the

                Hoffmann’s electrical-musical aesthetics that does not posit an ineffable ideal as
                the telos of Romantic poiesis, but seeks to permanently hold the ideal at bay,
                indeed, to ontologically secure the irreducible gap between real and ideal as the
                basis for a diabolic and extra-normative generativity.</p>
            <p>In each of these instances, sound constitutes a privileged site in which the
                potentially agonistic forces of the unconditioned can be intensified, harnessed, and
                redirected. In his philosophical fragments, Novalis posits the unconditioned as the
                endpoint of an impossible desire. The first of his fragments in the collection
                    <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Pollen </hi>(<hi rend="italic"
                    >Blüthenstaub</hi>) reads: “We seek everywhere the unconditioned, and always

                sentence of <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>, the wind and the clock
                are <hi rend="italic">only things</hi>. At the same time, they are things of a
                special sort, as they disclose the desire for the unconditioned in their
                organization and disorganization of the sensible. The clock brings appearances into
                an acoustic schema of regularity and unity: it sounds in regular beats, in <hi
                    rend="italic">tact</hi>, and its acoustic-formal principle is uniformity
                (monotony), in German, <hi rend="italic">einförmig</hi>. The acoustic-formal
                principle of the wind is stochastic; it does not beat, but swishes (<hi
                    rend="italic">saust</hi>), rattling against the speculative frame (the window).
                The two objects represent two opposing paradigms of acoustic organization, although
                to a certain extent, they depend on one another: the stochastic noise of the wind
                appears as a disruption of the order and regularity of the clock, just as the beat
                of the clock (as tact) allows the chaotic energy of the wind to be registered.</p>
            <p>If there is something like an absolute, then, it is to be found not in a thing (wind
                or clock), but in a circulation of desire between things, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >unconditioning</hi> of symbolic bearers of ontological order, where
                unconditioning means: 1) the capacity to manifest a process of organization to which
                no condition or limit can be ascribed; 2) the incapacity of any singular thing to
                manifest this process absolutely. The clash or dissonance between these two
                percussive acoustic events, an oscillation between order and disorder, establishes
                the ontological field of the Romantic aesthetic experiment—an experiment that
                ultimately provides the framework in which the protagonist of the novel is propelled
                out of the normalizing constraints of bourgeois desire. </p>
            <p>Significant is nevertheless that <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>
                opens with a sensorium operating at the level of base materiality: sound rather than
                sonority. The differentiation of sonority (<hi rend="italic">Klang</hi>) from sound
                    (<hi rend="italic">Schall</hi>) is one of the central conditions in the
                construction of sound as an epistemic phenomenon at this time; in Ernst Florens
                Friedrich Chladni’s <hi rend="italic">Discoveries in the Theory of Sound</hi>
                (1784), sonority emerges “when an elastic body makes simultaneous and audible

            <p>Oscillation, even within the mechanical (elastic) paradigm articulated by Chladni
                (rather than the dynamic, force-based paradigm that would become central to
                Romanticism), constitutes a foundational operation of Romantic thought, a paradigm
                of movement simultaneously material, conceptual, and ontological. Oscillatory
                movements suffuse both mind and matter, bringing these domains into a zone of
                indifferentiation (the establishment of such indifference points between mind and
                matter constitutes one of the main operations of Romantic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturphilosophie</hi>). In his studies on Fichte, for example, Novalis
                characterizes the back-and-forth swaying motion (<hi rend="italic">Schweben</hi>)
                between extremes—referring in this context to Fichte’s concept of the productive
                imagination—as “the source, the mother of all reality, reality itself.”<note

                Oscillation, either in material acoustic form, as <hi rend="italic">Schwingung</hi>,
                or in its correlative form in consciousness, as <hi rend="italic">Schweben</hi>,
                represents an operation of fundamental ontology in Romantic thought. To approach
                reality through oscillation between extremes—i.e. between subject and object,
                regularity and disorder, clock and wind—is thus to approach the real immanently. At
                the same time, the real is inconsistent with itself, turns back upon itself; the
                movement of oscillation indexes this inconsistency.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13"

                Johann Wilhelm Ritter) considers the word to be originally tone, he does not cast
                this primordial musicality of language as tantamount to a pure idealization of the
                word, linking it to something mystically ineffable or disembodied. On the contrary,
                primordial speech as tone sets into motion a physiological spiritualization: the
                surrounding air becomes a Chladni plate upon which the human breath calls forms (as
                words) into being. Novalis writes: “Vowels are strings of sound or <hi rend="italic"

                the vowel with poetry (openness, floating) and the consonant with prose (limitation,
                retardation); the two working in tandem generate a higher-order poetic figuration,
                the poetry of poetry and prose, already prefigured physiologically in the manner in
                which human beings articulate sound. </p>
            <p>Novalis also includes the deformation of acoustic matter—sounds with a diminished

                Such noise would not have been generative or figurative for Chladni, as it is not
                sonorous. Novalis is nevertheless attracted to the non-generative as an essential
                part of the aesthetic exercise; noise thus resurfaces at critical points in Romantic
                projects of transfiguration, and not merely as that which must be rejected, but as
                an expansion of aesthetic possibility. According to Bettine Menke, the Romantic
                paradigm destabilizes the dominant trajectories of western musical and poetic
                systems that ascend from sound to tone to speech, instead bringing hearers into a
                relation of “infinite approximation” to noise.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn20"

                merely foregrounding the metaphysical and ontological significance of acoustic
                phenomena; it <hi rend="italic">amplifies</hi> this acoustic material, diffuses it
                in the very shape of the mythemes and forms of life in social and political
                experiments. As Jocelyn Holland shows in reference to the works of Romantic
                physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter, acoustic symbols that stand in for absolute
                material dynamics can be led back to a more primordial substratum, a form of

            <p><hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi>, as we have seen, begins with the

                >Takt</hi>), according to Anders Engberg-Pedersen, encompasses two different
                paradigms of order in the Romantic period: an order of regularity, of arrangement
                (tact as <hi rend="italic">taxis</hi>); and a subjective inner sense deriving from
                the sense of touch (tact as <hi rend="italic">tangere</hi>).<note place="foot"

                The clock at the outset of the narrative—already an ironic anachronism for a tale
                that takes place in the Middle Ages (an <hi rend="italic">ana-chronistic</hi>
                clock)—establishes a tact that monotonously individuates forms and thus is
                associated more with <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">taxis </hi>than <hi
                    rend="italic">tangere</hi>. The ticking of the clock organizes acoustic material
                as something uni-form (<hi rend="italic">einförmig</hi>). One of the central
                problems of the novel confronts initial conditions that are uniform and seeks to
                differentiate them, to individuate in a way that multiplies difference. The
                condition of the clock, of regular time, of uni-formity, must be <hi rend="italic"

            <p>The novel disrupts the regularity of tact (<hi rend="italic">taxis</hi>) by exploring
                tangential notions of rhythm (<hi rend="italic">tangere</hi>), or rhythm as it spins
                off into unexpected directions in worldly encounters. It must be noted that Novalis
                sees the concept of world as imbricated with rhythm, as
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">essentially </hi>rhythmical: “If we take away

            <p>The aestheticization of sound as <hi rend="italic">music</hi> gives rise to strange
                oscillations, or sound catastrophically amplified into other mediated forms,
                ultimately encompassing the totality of social, erotic, and political relations.
                Novalis explores these oscillations as part of an aesthetic experiment: how can one

                The fairy tale functions as a source of romanticizing practices inasmuch as it
                participates in an anarchic freedom prior to the differentiation of law; it is this
                participation in anarchic primordiality that facilitates the emergence of a future
                both generative and unpredictable (chaotic) as well as rational (as it has passed
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">through </hi>the law). The central function
                of the fairy tale is thus to establish a zone of indifference between reason and

                the fairy tale told by Klingsohr, seem to belie this theory. Commentators and
                critics have noted that the Klingsohr fairy tale in particular appears
                overdetermined, almost allegorical, consciously constructed and ultimately
                restorative in intent rather than anarchic and contingent.<note place="foot"

                It seems to culminate in an order approximating a moral destiny. </p>
            <p>Uncovering the chaotic substratum of the fairy tale demands an attentive ear, an ear
                attuned to conditions of emergence that fold the stability of an apparent
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">telos </hi>into a vortex of becoming.
                Attending to the musicality of the fairy tale can bring its latent anarchic dynamics
                into presence; submerged acoustic fields destabilize the operations of political
                restoration at the very moment in which they seem to reach their apotheosis. An
                exoteric (outwardly directed) reparation of the wounded political body is thus
                accompanied by an esoteric (internally present) process of unconditioning. </p>
            <p>If the fairy tale is “entirely musical,” then the final note of Klingsohr’s fairy
                tale—and along with it, the telos of acoustic figuration—seems to re-establish the
                stability of monarchical governance after an explosion of revolutionary violence.
                The notoriously complex fairy tale unfolds through a series of crises that overturn
                domestic (familial) and political (monarchical) orders in an upheaval unleashed by
                subterranean forces, led by a figure known only as the Writer: a paradoxical figure
                inasmuch as he is equated in Novalis’ notes with the understanding (<hi
                    rend="italic">der Verstand</hi>), although his revolutionary energy is
                conspicuously fueled by resentment and hatred (or perhaps this is not paradoxical,
                but historical: the sleep of reason produces monsters). The power of Fable,
                personified as the ostensible protagonist of the tale, overwhelms the subterranean
                forces (the Fates) led by the Writer and brings the tale to a close by weaving the
                previously wounded community together in a spinning song. The fairy tale ends with a
                scene of political rapprochement between a newly crowned monarchical pair and the
                multitude, each reconciled to the other through sympathetic resonance: after the
                king embraces [<hi rend="italic">umarmt</hi>] the queen, “one heard nothing except
                tender names and the whispering of kisses”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="40"

                crowd. This scene of erotic reconciliation nevertheless conceals an esoteric
                symbolic and political revolution; the dynastic continuity of the monarchy has been
                contaminated by integrating a member of a lower order (<hi rend="italic">Eros</hi>,
                born from the domestic realm and transplanted into the astral, monarchical realm)

                impure. </p>
            <p>The impurity of the final scene can also be deduced from its acoustic conditions; the
                purported symbolic fulfillment takes place in contact with sonic material that is

                the new political-social regime culminates in two different sonic modes at the end
                of the fairy tale: erotic whispering (<hi rend="italic">Kußgeflüster</hi>) and the
                spinning song. The disindividuated crowd is bound together by noise on the threshold
                of audibility (<hi rend="italic">Geflüster</hi>), while individuated symbolic
                figures (Fable, Sophie, Phoenix) stand out against this thrumming ground—in Fable’s

                Sonic modes at the end of the fairy tale thus correspond to a relation between
                individuated figure and a non-differentiated ground. However, Fable is not merely
                singing; she is also <hi rend="italic">spinning</hi>, generating social-symbolic
                threads. The threads that she spins are drawn from her own body; when a hero
                (Perseus) gives her the gift of a spindle in gratitude for this restoration of
                order, he exclaims: “In your hands this spindle shall make us eternally rejoice, and
                out of yourself you shall spin an unbreakable golden thread.”<note place="foot"

            <p>The promise of reconciliation that takes place within the song cannot be isolated
                from the spinning source of its genesis, a source that folds all stabilizing
                operations of grounding into the gyrations of becoming. Spinning is, in a certain
                sense, Fable’s basic operation, and this final gesture must be considered
                motivically in relation to other instances of rotary motion, as repetitions or
                resignifications of these instances; earlier in the tale, Fable draws upon the
                spinning song as a source of (counter-) revolutionary violence, in the musical form
                of the tarantella: “During [Fable’s] song, from all sides, tarantulas appeared, they
                drew a shining net over the blades of grass, and they moved themselves to the beat
                    [<hi rend="italic">nach dem Takte</hi>] on their threads.... Her strings never
                rested, and the tarantulas followed the enchanting sounds on fast-woven
                    threads.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn44" n="44"><p rend="footnote text"

                            style="font-size:11pt">, 1: 307.</hi></p></note> In this instance,
                Fable’s song summons threads that transmit rhythms and micro-oscillations, making
                the world into a resonance chamber, one in which the slightest movement can be
                detected by the sensitive organs of the spider: the monotonous
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">tact </hi>of the clock at the beginning of
                the novel is thus transformed into a different regime of acoustic transmission in
                the fairy tale (the only other appearance of <hi rend="italic">Takt</hi> in the
                novel). This form of tact becomes a channel for a release of energy: a destructive
                tendency that must either exhaust itself (dissipate) or be sublimated into form. It
                is this latter function that Fable’s song seeks to realize.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi>, for example, music played the role of a

                According to the account as popularized by Athanasius Kircher, the musical notes and
                the whirling bodies in the dance are supposed to counteract the poison coursing
                through the body. The tarantella of Fable’s song positions itself obliquely to this
                tradition. Fable’s spinning song does not seek to expel or dispel poison, but to
                conjure it forth and harness its power; Fable’s poetic activity revolves around an
                acoustically generated pharmakon that simultaneously wounds and heals. </p>
            <p>Fable’s song ensnares the agents of revolutionary violence (the Fates, the Writer) in
                a web that they themselves bring about (it is in fact the Writer who demands the oil
                of the tarantulas in the first place as fuel for his revolutionary ambitions). Fable
                disarms the subterranean revolt by overwhelming them in the orgiastic rhythms of the
                tarantella: “[Fable’s] pursuers rushed impetuously into the web of the tarantulas,
                which took vengeance on them with innumerable bites. The whole crowd began to dance
                frantically, to which Fable played a merry tune.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn46"

                Writer is among these pursuers, or at least that the pursuers are his
                representatives; in any case, the Writer has become dis-individuated in the spinning
                of the dance. </p>
            <p>Fable is thus responsible for two forms of spinning songs: the orgiastic-destructive
                song of tarantism, and the restorative song of the weaver. These songs are not
                oppositional, but complementary (or at least complementary in their oppositionality,
                a problem that Nietzsche would later seek to solve in
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">The Birth of Tragedy </hi>by reconciling
                Apollonian figuration with Dionysian dissolution). Novalis frames Romantic writing—a
                form of writing indicated by the ultimate fate of the Writer—in relation to these
                two primordial musical paradigms. It is significant that precisely at the moment in
                which Romantic writing fulfills its highest ambitions—as unconditioning writing—the
                Writer simply disappears (or seems to disappear) from the tale, a detail emphasized

                a transformation of writing has taken place, but it has become ubiquitous, absolute,
                atmospheric, everywhere visible and non-localizable. Indeed, the Writer has not been
                repressed, but unconditioned and <hi rend="italic">amplified</hi> into absolute
                song; the dissipation of revolutionary violence and the dis-individuation of its
                central figure (the figure of the Writer) becomes form-generating in the “merry
                tune” of Fable itself, woven by her spindle (rather than a weaving loom, which the
                Writer was supposed to become in Novalis’ notes). This possibility coheres with a
                central feature of Romantic poiesis: to extract a generative emergence from
                tendencies toward disindividuation and to channel chaotic energy back into form.</p>
            <p>This pattern of Romantic poiesis can be found in other episodes in the fairy tale,
                for example, when the subterranean Fates, operating in league with the Writer, find
                themselves caught in the throes of the tarentella. The Fates are degraded to buzzing
                flies and finally consumed by the tarantulas; they are “sucked to the marrow.”<note

                consummation of the utopian scene of social and political reconciliation. However,
                the caryatides are not merely figures of stabilization; they integrate their
                previously chaotic power in such a way that the erotic stage is uplifted, now
                swaying in the air. The statues of the Fates, whose revolutionary energy has been
                brought to a standstill, set the erogenous zone of reconciliation (the bed) into
                relation with the ground, but in such a way that the ground itself is made to hover:
                “so that the earth floats once again and does not lie on chaos.”<note place="foot"

            <p>A significant source for the Romantic ontology of sound in relation to operations of
                absolute unconditioning can be found in Schelling’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of
                    Art</hi>. Based on notes from lectures that Schelling held twice (1802/3 and
                1804/5), the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi> formulates its central task as
                follows: “<hi rend="italic">the presentation in the ideal medium of the real element
                    inherent in art</hi>.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn54" n="54"

                Construction—the name of the philosophical method Schelling utilizes in the <hi

                objects are extracted from their local contexts of significance and recast as
                paradigms of ontological and cosmological form-generation: the philosophy of art

                the entire construction of the philosophy of art through which the materiality of

                    >Klang</hi>). If music represents the “lowest” of the arts in the architectonics
                of Schelling’s construction, it is also closest to nature in its primordial state,
                to that first event through which “art breaks through into the world of
                    representation.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn58" n="58"><p rend="footnote text"

            <p>Schelling accordingly describes sonority as the maximal presentation of the real, of
                non-conscious matter, as registered within the world of sense and sentience: an
                exteriority that lies at the core of interiority, approximating what Lacan would
                call <hi rend="italic">extimacy</hi>. Schelling describes this concept of sonority,
                one in which the body/mind (real/ideal) distinction is simultaneously produced and
                suspended (in-differentiated), as the “intuition of the soul of the body
                    itself.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn59" n="59"><p rend="footnote text"

                through which the body manifests itself as a necessary ontological zone of
                emergence, hence as <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">soul </hi>of the body. </p>
            <p>The soul here does not belong to a subject, but designates an impersonal process of
                idealization. As such, music, which emerges from sonority, is not an art particular
                to human beings; indeed, music does not require humanity for its realization. Music
                belongs to the cosmos, even in its inorganic forms. The ear, then, becomes a
                privileged (and paradoxical) organ of the inorganic, or that part of the human being
                most consonant with inorganic modes of appearance. Schelling writes: “the roots of
                the sense of hearing reside within anorganic nature, within magnetism. The hearing
                organ itself is merely magnetism that has developed to organic perfection.”<note

            <p>Schelling’s notion of the ear as a magnetic organ is predicated upon a paradigm shift
                from mechanistic to dynamic theories of hearing; Chladni, for example, linked the
                form-generation made visible on plates to oscillating elasticity (and hence
                mechanics) rather than the play of forces (dynamics). The dynamic theory of hearing
                as it surfaces in the

                oppositionality as an ontological structure operative at the inorganic level that is

                inorganic to the organic to consciousness).</p>
            <p>The residual inorganic structure of the organ of hearing brings it into contact with
                the central problem of nature itself: nature as it steps out of static equilibrium,
                out of a condition of absolute rest, and into movement and productivity. Ian Biddle,
                drawing on Schelling’s earlier naturephilosophical texts, ascribes a disruptive and
                ungrounding force to the magnetism of the ear in this section of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophy of Art</hi>, since magnetism occupies a “dark corner of
                the system” of naturephilosophy that Schelling sometimes seems to approach with

                do not merely hear the simple tone itself. Rather, we hear clothed, as it were, or
                imbedded in it a whole array of tones, and we hear them such that the consonant ones
                predominate, instead of the dissonant ones.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"

                individuation characteristic of Schelling’s earlier naturephilosophy (individuated
                forms as emergent from a disequilibrium in a conflict of forces, or form as indexing
                the aberrant nature of appearances) has been supplanted in favor of the affirmative

            <p>A close examination of the specifically naturephilosophical aesthetics of music,
                however, reveals that the symbolic dimension of music—or music as <hi rend="italic"
                    >unconditioning</hi> sound—is more expansive than stabilizing, more productive
                of difference than of unity. Music is not limited to the human arts; drawing on
                Pythagoras, Schelling notes that cosmic bodies (planets, stars) are ontologically
                homologous with music: not inasmuch as they produce music in their spinning, but
                inasmuch as they <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">are </hi>music in their very
                manner of being, in the forces with which they are identical. Schelling writes: “The
                cosmic bodies float on the wings of harmony and rhythm. That which one calls
                centripetal and centrifugal force is nothing other than harmony and rhythm,
                respectively. Elevated by the same wings, music floats in space to weave an audible
                universe from the transparent body of sound and tone.”<note place="foot"

                    rend="italic">naturalized</hi>—belonging to nature as self-producing process
                (rather than in the sense of being taken as self-evident)—as force. Schelling
                associates rhythm in particular with centrifugal force, or an expansiveness that in
                naturephilosophical terms corresponds to an overcoming of boundaries. Schelling
                correlates harmony with centripetal force, or the yearning for coherence, translated
                into sound. When Schelling claims that the predominating potence of music is
                rhythm—that rhythm is the music within music—he thus locates the specific force of
                music in a propulsive energetics. </p>
            <p>Music—its generative and propulsive force—will be everywhere present, latent in every
                being, in every form of art and in every movement of discourse. Music also inheres
                in political and collective bodies; or rather, collective bodies disclose their
                internal tendencies musically. Every gathering of human beings produces a musical
                form that expresses its inner tendencies. Music that is predominantly harmonic
                rather than rhythmic, as the “expression of striving and yearning,”<note

                predominantly characterized by harmony (which seeks the center and is restorative),
                Schelling seeks to cultivate an ear attuned to the rhythms of antiquity (which flees
                the center and is energetic) to awaken a countertendency of expansive force in
                musical form.</p>
            <p>Schelling’s philosophy of music thereby harnesses a primordial tendency toward
                difference and multiplicity in a form of art (music) that stands in for the event of
                art itself, for the breakthrough of meaning against a background of meaninglessness.
                The emergence of art is characterized by a fundamental ambivalence. It brings to the
                surface a dissonant and incomprehensible real only to suppress this form of the real
                through progressive potentiation (resonance, sonority, music). At the same time,
                sound comprises the central medium through which the momentum of centrifugality—a
                transgressive and difference-generating expansion—achieves symbolic elevation,
                seeping into material and discursive forms. Philosophical construction itself, in
                its production of the absolute, must also be rhythmic in this manner. Novalis writes
                in reference to Fichte: “Fichte has done nothing else than discover the rhythm of
                philosophy, and expressed it in a verbal acoustic manner.”<note place="foot"

                momentum of rhythmic antiquity could function as an antidote to the overwhelmingly

                Nietzsche would take this insight further in <hi rend="italic">The Birth of
                    Tragedy</hi>), another speculative possibility can be drawn from Schelling’s
                philosophy of music: a collective form whose musical expression would produce a
                harmonic and centripetal counterforce capable of counteracting the violent potential
                in the expansive and assimilative propulsion of rhythm, but without producing an
                overcontraction into homogeneous communal groupings. The form of the collective that
                could or would produce such music as an ontological expression of its internal
                tendencies remains unthematized by Schelling. Such would be the unspoken melodic
                (equally rhythmic <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">and </hi>harmonic) utopian
                form of Schelling’s philosophy of music. </p>
            <p>IV. Amplifications of Unconditioning Sound in Romantic Science and Literature</p>
            <p>The shift from a mechanical to a dynamic concept of sound—from wave oscillation
                produced through the collision and elasticity of bodies (Chladni) to oscillation as
                a result of magnetic or electrical forces (Ritter and <hi rend="color(202122)"
                    >Ørsted</hi>)—enlarges the field of auditory sensibility as well as the
                discursive and aesthetic potentiality of sound. Central to this expansion of
                possibilities in the idea of electrical acoustics is the phenomenon of shock. For
                Hans Christian
                <hi rend="color(202122)" xml:space="preserve">Ørsted, sound generated by contact gives rise to a mechanical-dynamic feedback loop of shock intensification through electricity: </hi></p>
            <p>The compression and the consequent expansion which take place in every soundwave
                produce ... [an] electrical alternation. Such an alternation between electrical
                states must also take place in the ear, but each transition from one electrical
                state to another produces a shock, however weak it may be. Each sound is accompanied
                by a great many such shocks one following the other.<note place="foot"

            <p>The figure-generating potentiality of tone—which locates the generation of form at
                the event of excitation itself rather than as the result of an excitation—becomes at

                human being can relate itself as it would to a foreign daemonic power. The
                figurative power of tone, once it is scaled upwards into other domains, enters into
                proximity (if not identity) with human beings themselves and simultaneously

            <p><hi rend="color(202122)" xml:space="preserve">Romantic lyric and narrative forms, albeit with different resources at their disposal, equally explore the ramifications of unconditioning sound. One of the most prominent examples of this experimental practice can be found in the lyric of Joseph von Eichendorff. An early poem composed by Eichendorff in 1808 (“Sestime”) constructs a conceptual Romantic sixfold—flowing, rustling, dreams, sky, stars, songs—in the repeating, shifting constellation dictated by the form of the sestina. Eichendorff’s “Sestime” is modeled on the medieval sestina, a form in which words at the ends of lines are repeated according to a system of rules (the last end-word of one stanza becomes the first end-word of the following one; the first end-word becomes the second end-word in the next stanza; and so forth). In a reading of Arnaut Daniel’s sestina “Lo ferm voler qu’el cor m’intra,” Giorgio Agamben claims that the sestina (and lyric more generally) discloses a different form of temporality than that of everyday succession or progression: messianic time, “the </hi><hi
