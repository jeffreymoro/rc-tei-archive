                  <p><span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Psychosis</span> begins with the premise that the Trump White House regime evinced certain similarities
                     of culturally significant psychotic behavior and psychotic effects between our own
                     historical moment and that of the Regency, with the years leading up to the Regency
                     signaling what we might term prepsychotic destabilizations and the loss of a fully
                     functional relation between the symbolic order and its subjects. The familiar phrase
                     “the Madness of King George” may suggest more than a monarch’s loss of control over
                     his symbolic function.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Alan Bennett’s 1991 play title is actually, The Madness of King George III.</span></div>
                     </div> It describes a psychotic break in the monarch’s identification with the illocutionary
                     force of imperatives—the monarch as both the Father and the Law within the symbolic
                     order—signaling something broader and generalizable to the affairs of (his) state.
                     Our claim is that the Regency, as a period without a head of state, is a psychotic
                     period: royal psychosis played out semiotically in the body politic. The similarities
                     between Trump as head of state during his administration—a head whose affairs equally
                     muddy distinctions between public and individual hallucination and demonstrate reduced
                     and broken language use and paranoid fantasies, thus often leaving the country without
                     a head—and “Mad George” are intensely relevant to the deep concerns held regarding
                     Trump’s mental stability as president and his psychotic symptoms as played out on
                     the cultural public stage. During his term as president, the United States experienced
                     Trumpian behavior across the country, demonstrated by outrageous group resistance
                     to the demands of reason, which illustrates that the body politic is threaded through
                     with more than the king’s symbolic body. His mind is also intimately connected, and
                     when he has lost it, the societal results plunge the nation into psychotic crisis,
                     as the events of 2020 illustrated. W. J. T. Mitchell points out in “American Psychosis:
                     Trumpism and the Nightmare of History” that Nietzsche’s aphorism rings universally
                     true: “Insanity in individuals is somewhat rare. But in groups, parties, nations,
                     and epochs, it is the rule.”
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>As Mitchell notes in reference to climate denial, even more disastrous is the truth
                              that “When the world’s most powerful nation goes crazy, the consequences are global.”
                              See also Mitchell’s “Present Tense: Time, Madness, and Democracy around 6 November
                              2018.”</span></div>
                     </div> What this ironic witticism doesn’t mention is that communal insanity requires a figurehead,
                     a leader who speaks on behalf of the larger whole. In George III’s (and Trump’s) case,
                     it is a leader who has lost himself and whose phallic loss registers a shattering
                     or rejection of the Symbolic in favor of hallucinatory irruptions into the communal
                     reality: an irrelevant throne, a failed governmental structure.</p>
               </div>
               <p>“Romantic psychosis” names this cultural expression of a lost leader during the Romantic
                  period, in which psychosis revealed in celebrated eccentric behaviors is both embraced
                  by society and critiqued by disquieted writers and poets. The Regent’s narcissism—revealed
                  in his uncontrolled spending on obsessively decorating his person, his mistresses,
                  Carlton House, and Brighton Palace—was mirrored societally, for example, by the dandy’s
                  narcissistic and obsessive self-care rituals. By corollary, the obsessive, narcissistic
                  presidential Twitter deluges that engulfed us daily were merely reflections of a larger
                  cultural pathology. Because Trump’s hallucinative Tweets recall the Regency, with
                  its xenophobia, ritualistic behaviors, and word disorders (such as young gentlemen
                  deliberately learning the slang of cockneys and jockeys), I will offer an example
                  of what I mean by a “psychotic” expression as a cultural malaise, rather than medically
                  diagnosable illness, by beginning with George III’s malady during the five major periods
                  of his mental disturbances. His eventually permanent mental illness provides a way
                  to understand how we do and do not comprehend a president comfortable with disjointed,
                  partial, or jumbled speech acts, uncontrolled verbal barrages sent by Twitterstorm,
                  and messages often inspired by hallucinatory conspiracy theories. This is not to indicate
                  that the following essays will treat such word disorders but to show that such incompetent
                  syntax in a semiotic code, whether linguistic or cultural, and in a hallucinated reality
                  is symptomatic of psychosis in a way that this volume explores.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>George III’s disease was both physical and mental: diagnosed now as either porphyria
                     or arsenic poisoning or both, it produces bodily and mental symptoms that caused both
                     Parliament and the royal household to treat his increasingly arbitrary dictates and
                     behaviors as “madness” and to restrain him accordingly. His sporadically unsound behaviors
                     included “psychiatric symptoms such as confusion, fits and hallucinations,” by one
                     account, and “ravings” by another.

                              in the Madhouse. See also John Wiltshire’s “Frances Burney, the Court, the King and
                              Pathography.”</span></div>
                     </div> During these episodes, his behavior was policed in a way unthinkable today for any
                     public official. Nevertheless, the confusion and ravings are symptoms that bear resemblance
                     to some of the newspaper reportage on the forty-fifth president, while the king’s
                     hallucinations—the hallmark of psychosis—are resonant with Trump’s paranoid fantasies.
                     Until 1810, when the Regency was established due to the king’s permanent madness,
                     his monarchical career produced another resemblance to that of any twenty-first century
                     national leader in that the Seven Years’ War, as well as Britain’s involvement in
                     the African slave trade and trade with India and the Far East, qualified George III
                     to be the first monarch of a globally connected nation in the modern sense. In many
                     ways George’s madness, as much as a chaotic Regency, reflects our own loss of sane
                     leadership and the subsequent stresses put upon us that will undoubtedly leave scars
                     on both the national and global levels. Beginning with the connection between the
                     dislocations of the Regency’s various semiotic codes and cultural expression as echoing
                     George III’s mental instability and his resulting loss of mental and behavioral coherence,
                     this volume aims to illuminate how cultural expressions and individual writers of
                     the British Romantic period, including the years leading up to and following the Regency,
                     participated in and made use of Romantic psychosis.

                              and to Congress diagnosing then President Trump as suffering from clinical narcissism
                              and egomania, followed up with a more recent diagnosis of paranoid obsessional neurosis
                              and narcissism, only strengthens our belief that the political and cultural condition
                              under such a leader suffers from a concurrent identity disintegration. (See Lance
                              Dodes and Joseph Schachter as well as Andrew Feinberg). This allows for theorizing
                              a parallel between the years of Trump’s dismantling of the state, beginning with his

               <p>I will remark on the present-past comparison a few more times here, although this
                  is not our principal focus in the volume. Trump’s tweets and verbal habits during
                  public speeches and televised appearances on Fox—which could all too easily be read
                  as Freudian slips and usually are—often display a wild relation to truth and the signifier
                  that, in these moments of floating, unstable, and incoherent relation between word
                  and reality, announces foreclosure. These are psychotic moments and arguably make
                  the connection to George III all the tighter, justifying our investigation. Whether
                  the madness of King George or the skewing of language by Donald Trump, we are engaging
                  in a problem of sovereignty. What defines the state in a state of language discomposure?
                  What can a Regent or Vice President do in a regime where words are truly severed from
                  political symbolization or, rather, free-floating in the unconscious of the times
                  without the rules of signification to guide them? The libidinal wishes and terrors
                  of the night overwhelm conscious intentionality, as registered in Congress’s frustrating
                  attempts to engage the White House and Senate today or in William Pitt’s frustrated
                  attempts to manage his king before the creation of the Regency. <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Psychosis</span> situates itself amid the psychosis that shadows politically pathological neurosis,
                  the instabilities of mind and governance, the polity and the (whimsical?) object of
                  desire, and the specter of the postword that hung over the Regency and that haunts
                  us again today.</p>
               <p>Much has been said of the collapse of “truth” as a category in our own time. What
                  registers even more perhaps is the loss of value suffered by words themselves: a collapse
                  of language more generally and the resulting inefficacy of words to do their work.
                  Words, and language, are the territory of the Symbolic. When the symbolic register
                  ceases to organize our psychic and experiential lives, we have a state of psychosis.
                  Voices can emanate from anywhere, telling—even ordering—us to do things, from Twitter,
                  Facebook, text messaging, ads, and presidential speeches and adlibs. Looked at another
                  way, these are hallucinatory voices, and their messages often—like those of clinical
                  psychosis—don’t make sense within a rational order. In disorder, they make a kind
                  of sense that barely registers as abnormal. “Truthiness,” Stephen Colbert’s ironically
                  apt term for the Bush White House’s signature moves, becomes “post-truth” in John
                  Oliver’s riff on presidential signatures; both notions disintegrated into “alternative
                  facts” and “fake news” in Trump’s first years. But in the last two years of Trump’s
                  term, there were often only words severed from any possible signifiers, free-floating
                  signs roaming the metonymic chains of associations without needing difference between
                  signifiers, their meaningful distinction, to qualify them for use. Tweet firestorms
                  at 4 a.m., rants in the place of prepared speeches; these are the forms that psychotic
                  speech inhabits when words no longer have validity or valence. Severed from the symbolic
                  register, words can seem to mock their own indeterminacy, but it is nothing so clever.
                  How punningly appropriate, then, that the title for Julie Carlson’s response to the
                  three essays of <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Psychosis</span>, “After Word,” addresses the problem of what happens after words are no longer signifying
                  in meaningful ways. The pun strikes to the heart of the problem with which these essays
                  grapple in different ways; like the posthuman, the postword may already be upon us.
                  However, it has a longer political and literary history and was especially an aspect
                  of Regency British life and legacy.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The question of a psychotic relation to words that appears to result from a set of
                     neurotic symptoms in the White House can be argued two ways: either it is historically
                     overdetermined (truthiness, post-truth, alternative facts, fake news, and now a version
                     of Hamlet’s response to Polonius’s question of what “matter” he reads: “words, words,
                     words,” which are “Slanders, sir” [<span style="font-style:italic">Hamlet</span>, II.ii.192, 196]—a very Trumpian sentiment and notably expressed when Hamlet is playing
                     mad),

                     are mirrored in the person of the president. <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Psychosis</span> positions itself in relation to both options: history and mental instability are fundamentally
                     entangled now in ways that were prefigured during the Romantic period when the sovereign
                     nation echoed to some degree its king’s madness. We might say that the problem of
                     the Twenty-Fifth Amendment was once the problem arising from George III’s bouts with
                     insanity and his “removal from office” in parliament’s creation of the Regent position.
                     As Joshua Zeitz writes of our most recent difficulty, the Twenty-Fifth Amendment’s
                     “framers might have agreed that it could be invoked to remove a president who suffered
                     mental illness that led him to lapse into a state of delusion or unreason. But not
                     a president who already demonstrated those traits when the people, in their wisdom,
                     elected him to office.”  Mirroring indeed: is Trumpian America’s narcissistic and
                     reality-denying its ideal ego or its semblable?

                     that we might think of it in terms of explosions: cultural, political, technological,
                     scientific, philosophical explosions that produced what we now recognize as the basis
                     for our contemporary lives. We are tied to these explosive years in ways we may no
                     longer recognize, but the historical similarity of a certain situatedness — the Regency,
                     Trump’s America — when madness seems to have had a particular role in historical and
                     cultural production is currently a strong, recognizable part of that roping together
                     of the past and present.</p>

               <p>What does it mean to live now in these mad times when paranoia is a daily marker of
                  our sense of belonging to an internationality and a global community? Our daily uncertainty
                  has a contemporaneity with that of the Regency’s sense of instability after the Peace
                  of Amiens collapsed. Those post-1800 years produced an assertive negativity of a possible
                  future that we associate with Romantic irony and that has resonance with today’s dark
                  comedy spawned from White House antics. Both then and now dark despair fluctuated
                  with the assertive optimism that we associate with P. B. Shelley’s idealism and that
                  for us looks like the promise of a scientific rehabilitation of global pandemics,
                  globate climate change, and the future to come. Both sides of this antinomy—irony
                  and idealism—had fissures, cracks caused by uncertainty about a path forward that
                  are analogous to the cracks in a psychotic state when the organizing labor of the
                  Symbolic isn’t apparent. In psychosis, the Real intrudes into every crack or tear
                  in the ego’s fabricated story of what is actually happening and of what should happen
                  in the expected patterns of general systematicity. This volume posits the idea that
                  today’s world also bears the marks of a psychotic fissure and that these destabilizations
                  caused by an intrusive and traumatic Real parallel to a recognizable degree the psychotic
                  expression intruding on so much of Romantic imaginative experience; in doing so, the
                  volume investigates how literary texts express the disjuncture between the Symbolic
                  and its foreclosure in a historically psychotic episode. Historical trauma coupled
                  with a mad sovereign produces a sense that interpretability is up for grabs in a world
                  without “facts” and where truth is how one defines it; how must literature deal with
                  this paradox? The three essays that follow unpack singular texts—Mary Wollstonecraft’s
                  <span style="font-style:italic">Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</span> (1793) and Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> (1826), the bodily text of Beau Brummell’s dandyism, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s
                  late-Romantic <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span> (1856) — in terms of the ways they give expression to, respond to, or voice the psychosis
                  that is Romanticism in its least idealist, least ideological, and most fractured condition.
                  Julie Carlson’s afterword mediates the essays through a larger consideration of neurocosmopolitanism
                  and its bodily, biological, and linguistic functions of signification, agency, boundary
                  permeability, and cultural sedimentations and disruptions.</p>
               <p>In bringing together these essays, <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Psychosis</span> offers ways to engage Lacan’s conception of psychosis in <span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span> with Romantic texts and lives and to engage feminist responses to Lacan’s theories,
                  so as to push against some standard assumptions in Romantic studies concerning the
                  male gaze, body/mind segregation, and past/present noncontinuity. The volume takes
                  as its historical field the problem of Romantic psychology: the Romantic period was
                  the seedbed of Freudian psychoanalysis with its attention to subjectivity, affect,
                  the psyche, dream visions and nightmares, and the realization of an inhabited unconscious.
                  Lacanian interpretations and innovations in Freudian theory have meant that a Lacanian
                  lens reveals the sociopolitical field in ways not otherwise available. As Daniela
                  Garofalo and David Sigler note, “Lacan matters for a politicized study of culture,”
                  and if “the quintessentially Romantic project of subject-formation tends to get caught
                  up, irredeemably, in its impasses,” this further reveals the lacks that inform subjective
                  experience and cultural expression (xi, xviii). Even more situating is the problem
                  of Romantic crisis, whether the trauma of revolution or that of war’s aftermath. Psychoanalytic
                  theory provides the essays’ main lens as a generative conceptual structure for thinking
                  through moments of cultural crisis during the Romantic period. In taking on the conspiracy
                  of language and psychopathology at the level of cultural crisis, <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Psychosis </span> seeks not only to participate in current debates about neurocosmopolitanism but also
                  to use it as a bridge to larger-scale thinking about how the particularities of the
                  past and of our peculiar present are knotted together and interlaced in ways that
                  speak to the knots in psychic registers (Imaginary-Real-Symbolic) that Lacan theorizes.</p>
               <p>More largely, the essays are grounded in the eventfulness of Romanticism. They are
                  premised on the idea that what the Romantics developed has great currency for us today.
                  Innovative approaches to recognize and engage with the female specular gaze, creative
                  ways to grapple with materiality, and expressions of culturally inscribed psychosis
                  resonate particularly with our own crises of political, environmental, and psychic
                  undoings. Perhaps even more so does the unraveling of cultural institutions structured
                  by heteronormativity cry out for a Romantically-informed intervention. In offering
                  a wider perspective for the particular and shared concerns of the three essays, Carlson
                  not only brings out the their congruencies while responding to the way each offers
                  a different entry into thinking about “Romantic psychosis”; she also offers a way
                  to think more deeply about what it means to leverage a term like “psychosis” to interrogate
                  adjacencies between past and present critical times and between language and the law
                  during psychotically destabilized periods of crisis.</p>

                  <p>The law becomes implicitly important for this volume’s essays precisely because the
                     subject’s relation to the signifier is both to language generally and to the primordial
                     signifier perpetually: that which names the prohibition against the desire for presence.

                              denies to girls their desire for the absolute presence of the mother; the Law is what
                              enables individuation from the maternal body regardless of the child’s sexual destiny.</span></div>
                     </div>), is the basis of social authority. The law of the father plays a distinguishing
                     role in each of the three subjects under scrutiny: Mary Wollstonecraft, Elizabeth
                     Barrett Browning, and Beau Brummell. All three bear names that cannot compete with
                     the Name-of-the-Father, though each tries to subvert the Name’s power to subject them
                     and constrain or deny their desire, their capacity to situate their bodies as sites
                     of expressive satisfaction. Todd McGowan points out that the psychotic subject’s disenfranchisement
                     from the signifier is not liberation from the law’s constraint. By evading the law’s
                     regulation, the psychotic might appear to have found a way to enter into his own pleasure
                     at will, since language has no regulatory effect on him and sentences don’t even need
                     to end or maintain a “sense.” Or rather, the “sense” of words becomes sensory rather
                     than syntactically logical. Moreover, the subject’s access to the Real is unmediated
                     by the Symbolic and therefore appears during psychotic episodes or during the artistic
                     attempt to portray that experience at the personal, rather than historical or cultural,
                     level. But as McGowan notes, such freedom is a “freedom from subjectivity rather than
                     the freedom of the subject” (49). Moreover, “The schizophrenic’s foreclosure of the
                     signifier of law does not eliminate the effect of law on the signifying structure”
                     (49) — a problem that Brummell in particular discovered quite starkly, although it
                     is unclear that in his later years he realized the full extent of his disconnection
                     from the law.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Law is the irrational prohibition against one’s own desire and thus subtends society’s
                     demand for conformity and for subjects to desire recognition from those in power in
                     order to achieve their own power of recognition. Jane Austen’s Mr. Collins exemplifies
                     the desire for compliance with social demand. But one’s freedom lies in the distance
                     between the unreason of the law and the seeming logic of social demand. Put another
                     way, the law dominates our unconscious desire, and if demand is how we give expression
                     to desire’s unremitting tug, the law also provides the room for artistic play (Elizabeth
                     Bennet’s pithy wit rather than Mr. Collins’s empty verbal arabesques). The field of
                     the Other—the “domain of law and language, law-as-language,” as Elizabeth Grosz explains—is
                     paramount if the infantile ego is to mature into a speaking subject (66). If demand
                     “initiates the child into the categories and terms of discourse,” it does not provide
                     the libidinal push that desire does: desire “institutes a new relation to and in language,”
                     one directly linked to both the formation of the discursive subject (the ‘I’) and
                     to “systems of meaning unregulated by any individual or group, and unrestricted in
                     relation to and in language” (Grosz 66).

                     also provides the foundation for the unique character of each speaking subject: “The

                     according to Lacan, and so powerful is this effect that “<span style="font-style:italic">Desidero</span> is the Freudian <span style="font-style:italic">cogito</span>” (Lacan, <span style="font-style:italic">Four Fundamental Concepts</span> 154).</p>

                  <p>The neurotic subject finds his or her freedom in the distance between unconscious
                     and conscious motivations. But the psychotic has lost this distance and hallucinates
                     an entirely different relation to authority and power. It is one that bypasses society
                     altogether during psychotic and creative periods, paying only lip service to them
                     during the periods between episodes. His or her relation to the Name-of-the-Father
                     is like that of an inexplicably absent father—there is no quilting point to the domain
                     of signifiers that provides the normative subject with an awareness of what signifiers
                     are supposed to do. The psychotic’s relation to verbiage is unhinged. Yet the Name-of-the-Father,
                     like a real father, does not simply disappear; laws remain in place, subjects are
                     constrained, power maintains itself. For the psychotic, the primordial signifier (the
                     phallus) or Father’s Name reinstates itself in the Real, so that the subject hallucinates
                     or “hears” voices; as Judge Schreber’s memoirs testify, the psychotic may well hear
                     the Father’s voice as a divine or supernatural one that calls him directly, offering
                     revelation and commanding his or her desire. Psychotic delusion makes the unconscious
                     literal, thus further separating one from the normative “reality” of subjects fully
                     integrated into the Symbolic and its law. In this way, psychosis plays out the redoubling
                     of negation that resistant subjects experience under the Law of the Father and the
                     juridical. Again, Wollstonecraft, Barrett Browning, and Brummell offer different but
                     compelling versions of a nonredemptive negation at work, for although we are arguing
                     that psychosis can also be culturally and historically symptomatic, it is never culturally
                     or historically productive or eventful. Its power lies in what it says about us, rather
                     than what it achieves. Psychosis is always pathological in the sense that its symptoms
                     reveal a distortion or disruption in the functioning of the Symbolic at either the
                     individual or societal level (although Lacan also makes clear that psychosis, or at
                     least the psychotic mechanism, is also normative at a certain stage of development).

                     </div> In terms of historical and cultural similarities between the United States under Trump
                     and Regency Britain, we could say that psychosis became normative in both periods,
                     displacing neurosis (particularly hysterical and obsessional neuroses) as the normative
                     pathology under patriarchal capitalism. Because of this norming of its symptoms, it
                     is important to attend to psychotic expression, which is always in need of interrogation.
                     During the years of Trump, such interrogation had become imperative in order to redirect
                     cultural behaviors toward a more healthful relation to the Symbolic. The three Romantic
                     artists under scrutiny in this volume offer the occasion for reconsidering other instances
                     of Romantic psychosis that have not been identified as such or that have been interpreted

                  <p>What follows here is a sketch of Lacan’s theoretical understanding of psychosis as
                     a significant aspect of the human condition in language, and his presentation of psychosis
                     as something that extends beyond the clinical treatment of the disease into a fundamental
                     disruption in the human capacity to organize life and mentality symbolically. Freud
                     considered neurosis to be the pervasive psychiatric adaption to the conditions of
                     living under patriarchy in a class-structured, Western society.

                              hands of science two great outrages against its naive self-love.  .  . .  But the
                              third and most irritating insult is flung at the human mania of greatness by present-day
                              psychological research, which wants to prove to the ‘I’ that it is not even master
                              in its own home, but is dependent upon the most scanty information concerning all
                              that goes on unconsciously in its psychic life.  .  . .  We were compelled to disturb

                     </div> We have come to understand this (mal)adaptation as peculiarly situated in nineteenth-century
                     Western societies, and the Freudian trilogy of neurosis, perversion, and psychosis
                     as characterizing the nineteenth century in Europe writ large. Building on Freudian
                     theory, Lacan’s seminars gradually evolve a model more suited to characterizing twentieth-century
                     Western culture, particularly that of the Euro-American world. As his medical training
                     was conducted during World War II, Lacan’s theories respond to the psychiatry of those
                     years, predicated on the advancements achieved since Freud. The trauma of the war
                     years of WWII gave Lacan insight into how the psyche responds to stresses that are
                     due to culturally situated shock, in which so much socially informed experience lies
                     beyond verbal expression except in the most self-alienated way or most figurative
                     way.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The relevance of Lacan’s explication of psychosis is that it shows how we might consider
                  it as <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> pervasive psychopathology of the human subject today because of the fraught relation
                  to language that characterizes interpersonal relations generally, which is all the
                  more exposed, stressed, and burdened now. The Trump presidency’s increasingly frenzied
                  disruption of the symbolic register on which we depend for mutual intelligibility,
                  mutual mitigation of hostile drives, and the inhibition of what must be inhibited
                  for civic life to proceed, reinforces the psychotic analogy. As I write now, in August
                  2020, a fence has been hastily erected around the White House to protect a president
                  seemingly unafraid and uninhibited, yet so full of repressed desire that he fears
                  mob reprisal as his Freudian slips indicate. We anticipate a future history being
                  written about the present time that will make explicit the ways in which the Symbolic—
                  not just as represented by American institutions but also as it structures our political,
                  economic, and social remediations, protections, and goals—is being continuously disrupted
                  and adlibbed. The result is that currently we are set adrift in a world seemingly

                  <p>Language is the limit of both the subjective experience of psychic life and of culturally
                     imbricated communal life. And within language lies lack and desire—in other words,
                     those motivating urges that can spur on great deeds but also great misdeeds. Language’s
                     role is to mitigate the unspeakable, ineffable and inexpressible. Thinking in terms
                     of psychosis is helpful, then, in recognizing and interrogating the fissures in social
                     experience as represented in accounts of historical events, narratives of individual
                     lives, and literary works whether these seek to represent cultural crisis or do so
                     as slips of the tongue that reveal the personal and/or cultural unconscious at work.
                     Lacan’s theory of psychosis as a psychopathological condition depends on his larger
                     model of the role language plays in psychic life. Psychosis is the flattened relation
                     to language in which the big Other can’t be heard to speak because for the speaking
                     subject, the big Other is inaccessible through the Symbolic, which is foreclosed.
                     The ego’s formation, to which the psychotic does have access, is established early
                     in life precisely in order to negotiate the Real; it is necessary in order that the
                     subject can be formed through, and find itself in, language (the Symbolic). But the
                     ego structure is already a malformation that alienates the individual from the Real—that
                     which lies beyond an imagined self-unity as well as beyond language, and which can
                     be understood as the register of trauma, disorienting fracture, destabilizing experience,
                     and threatening events. The massacre at Peterloo belongs to the Real in the sense
                     that it destabilized the delusion of the progressivist activist giving speeches to
                     the peacefully assembled crowd that political justice was achievable:

               <p>Trump’s own mobilizing of militia and army troops against peaceful protesters in the
                  rallies of Summer 2020 forces the question: are these two separate events those of
                  the sovereign state in a “corrective” autoimmune mode that kills off dangerous cells,
                  or are they instead psychotic events at the cultural and social level? Arguably both
                  are the latter, for they evince the incapacity of each governing figure to meaningfully
                  grasp the role of the big Other here. The Symbolic becomes the terrain of trauma as
                  well as demand and desire, the unpredictable and incomprehensible Real displacing
                  the Symbolic’s regime. To meet the protesters’ demand with lethal violence is to return
                  us to the point before civilized life began when, according to Freud, murder—especially
                  the murder of the father, but also the murder of brothers—need not be inhibited. It
                  is to put us in a politically psychotic state where words are detached from their
                  meanings, free-floating and unstable yet utilized <span style="font-style:italic">as if</span> meaningful, <span style="font-style:italic">as if</span> nondelusional,<span style="font-style:italic">as if</span> communicating the promise of being heard, and of the reciprocity that should characterize
                  all verbal engagement. It is the detachment of words from their normative and habitual
                  pathways that normally characterizes literary texts and accounts of lives lived.</p>
               <p>Poetry and literature are particularly situated to take advantage of Lacan’s theory
                  of language and symbol; they are therefore also ripe for plumbing the depths of a
                  psychotic relation to language or its literary capture. Whereas speech is associated
                  with the need-demand-desire of the message communicated to or reciprocated by the
                  mother, language is the cultural invasion of the child’s body-mind field of experience
                  by the paternal function operating as the law. Language is both how cultures form
                  and deform individuals as subjects, and how cultural expression plays out; it is the
                  register of the big Other, the Name-of-the-Father, and the law writ large. Language
                  makes sense of the assemblage of images the child uses to create a unified identity
                  by enabling it to speak as a subject; its grammar and tropes are reflexively incorporated
                  in the mental structures that arise in conjunction with language acquisition as well
                  as in the unconscious, which only forms with the advent of the Symbolic in the child’s
                  newly subjective life. When things go awry, this structuration does too, and when
                  that happens, we begin to realize how fragile the relation between our experience
                  and our ability to express that experience is. When life itself is unpredictable,
                  words lose their force and become “words, words, words,” to echo Hamlet again, and
                  slanderous as well. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It might seem odd, then, to claim that symbolic language, so anchored to hierarchical,
                     patriarchal ordering, is the field of artistic expression, not just for poetic language
                     but more widely, for any creative art form. Psychoanalytic theory justifies this claim
                     by appending the pleasure or jouissance of the creative act to that of language mastery.
                     Cultural expression, as the Symbolic’s secondary aspect after instantiating the grammar
                     of the law, is another way that the Symbolic opens itself up to artistic creation.
                     Culturally articulated or performed expression, as in the role of representative figures
                     of a period such as the Regency dandy, provides a rich field for locating aspects
                     of this theoretical model at play. Cultural expression is itself figural: it involves
                     the substitutions, condensations, image sequences, seductive play, and manipulation
                     of desire that are inherent in verbal expression but extended into the nonverbal realm.
                     Think Jeff Bezos, Jared Kushner, or Michelle Obama as representative of twentieth-first-century
                     American culture in ways similar to how the Regency dandy, the Regent, or Georgiana,
                     Duchess of Devonshire metonymically represented the Romantic period. For Lacan, metonym
                     is <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> determinant trope in human thought because it follows the associative pattern of signifiers
                     in which the visual or imagistic is as important as the verbal, and metonyms can be
                     telling: “the suits” (corporate executives) exemplify the subprime housing debacle
                     for instance, and the step from there to Kushner as real estate mogul is an easy slide—and
                     one that makes the executive leverage of the political in the Wall Street bailout
                     even more apparent. The Regency dandy, with his obsessive regard for appearance, is
                     equally metonymic, and the development from Brummellian dress to men’s contemporary
                     business suits, along with the metonymic value of each stage of development (from
                     the dandy’s tight waist and cravat to the Victorian top hat to the office suit) has
                     been well studied.

                     </div> The same argument can be applied to literary works that capture the temper of the
                     times. If metonymy replicates our thought structure, metaphor replicates that of the
                     hierarchical regime into which a human is born; it transforms a human being into a
                     human subject through the paternal metaphor or the Name-of-the-Father that teaches
                     each child the rules and rights of patriarchy. Both tropes make meaning obscure and
                     indeterminate through their deferral of absolute meaning, and more importantly, desire.
                     And what desire points to is what can never be understood. Literature perpetually
                     alludes to this margin of desire, to what is in excess of meaning.</p>
               </div>
               <p>At the cultural level, symptoms appear that locate the traumatic, unbearable thing
                  that, as for subjective individual trauma, cannot be put into words. These are not
                  only symptoms arising from the disruption of the Real into the symbolic-dependent
                  political regime, as in civic protest; these also find expression in representative
                  symptoms. A Regency example of a cultural symptom would be the Regent’s lack and unsatisfiable
                  desire expressed as the insatiable collection of aesthetic objects and the appetite
                  of the gourmand—symptoms of a wealth that does not bring the lacking thing, the phallic
                  prowess of the crown — and bears witness to such trauma (family dysfunction, forced
                  marriage, political dissension, but also social injustice and starvation of the disenfranchised
                  amid elitist profligacy). But in between the individual and cultural expression lies
                  the conditions for artistic identity and self-expression that are founded on the libidinal
                  ties to language use and meaning: these are the wordplay and word games embedded in
                  grammar and polysemy, metaphors and alliteration. If the symbolic register and the
                  entrance into language regulate our self-identity and behavior as a sort of mechanism
                  of conformity, then the foreclosure of the Symbolic that a psychotic confronts in
                  language use and word imagery means that metonymy may be more significant than metaphor
                  for detecting desire and the difference between frisson and fracture in literary identity.</p>

                  <p>When we are thinking about ideology and the normative demands of cultural tradition
                     and social pressures to conform, we are thinking about the writing on the wall. That
                     is, such conformity also demands its opposite, and those rebelling against or transgressing
                     such norms are doing so either because they are walking to a different drummer (for
                     example, William Blake as visionary and prophet) or because try as they might to conform,
                     the Symbolic is closed off to them, its organizational power unassimilable. Such a
                     state offers literary exploration a way to work around the Symbolic, to envision an
                     altered playing field. Writing that participates fully in the Symbolic is a form of
                     inscription, but a culturally psychotic state would allow for visionary experience
                     or poetic vision: hallucination, seeing otherwise, and then writing along altered
                     lines. Normally, the writer is not the master of her/his own words, but is rather
                     their productive machine, one which absorbs words and possible meanings from the environment
                     and produces an assemblage that represents to some extent the image-assemblage produced
                     by a unifying vision. But when the writer frees herself from the restrictive bounds
                     of the symbolic register, we get a much more semiotically informed use of language,

                     </div> Kate Singer begins her essay with an example of just such a psychotically-inflected
                     start to a lengthy statement from Mary Wollstonecraft: “It is the pestiferous purple
                     which renders the progress of civilization a curse, and warps the understanding.”
                     The pestiferous purple progress is something Singer makes much of in order to theorize
                     the symbolic-resistant discourse of materiality she finds being expressed in Wollstonecraft’s
                     writing. Aesthetically “psychotic” language use often exposes human dialogue as a
                     ritual of demand and response that is reliant on lack and desire, on the paucity of
                     the individual and its exigencies, on its absolute dependency on the other. As Wollstonecraft’s
                     pestiferous purple progress demonstrates, it provides a way to undermine or critique
                     the symbolic order. Cultural psychosis, whether literary artists make anything of
                     it or display it unwittingly, is a kind of writing on the wall, a mapping of the fragility
                     of the human psyche under duress, under conditions that, like the pestiferous purple,
                     are maddening. The visionary gleams admired by Wordsworth and the idealism insistently
                     dramatized by an increasingly disenchanted Shelley are but acceptable variants of
                     the human mind’s friability, imagination’s attempt to robustly shore up what is already
                     fissured, already shakily in doubt.</p>

                  <p>It is this vein of understanding the particular ways in which self-alienation and
                     ego fragmentation play themselves out, whether in a grammar of consumer behavior or
                     poetic literary expression, that informs the following three essays. We do not all
                     hew strictly to Lacanian analysis but take the advent of cultural fragmentation and
                     the dismemberment of the cultural imaginary today as an opportunity to scrutinize
                     certain texts as having larger significance, a more expansive application in relation
                     to what might be termed cultural psychosis and in the particularity of the historical
                     regime under discussion, “Romantic psychosis.” These essays investigate larger questions
                     concerning the very boundaries erected by institutional and ideological structures
                     that psychosis disrupts, overwrites, and disfigures. Some of the essays also play
                     with language in various ways in order to disturb disciplinary assumptions and to
                     open up our preconceptions to new ways of thinking about the subjects under scrutiny.
                     Finally, all three essays aim to disrupt the mind/body dichotomy by tracing the psychological
                     exploration or expression that conditions Romantic art, each one offering a different
                     model for undertaking such projects. David Sigler’s Lacanian analysis of a late-Romantic
                     text unpacks the fissures and breaks the voice of a female poet’s rejection of the
                     Symbolic as the controlling register. Kate Singer’s essay reads psychic experience
                     in Wollstonecraft through Irigaray’s counter-theory of psychoanalytic theory. And
                     my own meditation on Beau Brummell extends Lacanian theory through Deleuze and Guattari’s
                     account of the subject under capitalism. All three essays explore the cultural and
                     literary expressions of the subject under pressure and the ways in which the symbolic
                     structures that pressure, in particular historical-politico-cultural situations (like
                     the Romantic period and the United States under Trump), to reveal the fractures in
                     the seeming coherence of patriarchal capitalism. As Lacan points out, foreclosure
                     of the Symbolic in psychosis creates a hole that forces the irruption into reality
                     of the rejected signifier in question, the phallus or the object of desire. Mourning,
                     he also points out, is merely the flip side of this: mourning is the hole ripped out
                     of reality when the loved object is lost, an object that is often also associated
                     with the phallus.

                     and mourning, a mixture my own essay registers. But a different situation is also
                     necessary for us to comprehend the proximity rather than the distance between the
                     cultural and the individual as well as the imaginary (in the Lacanian as well as the
                     artistic sense) and the biological. Rather than setting them apart completely, Julie
                     Carlson’s afterword (after words) adjudicates the disparity but also the resonances
                     between a cultural/textual analytic of psychosis in the Lacanian sense and schizophrenia
                     in the neuroscientific sense. Her deployment of the term “neurocosmopolitanism” frames
                     this adjudication, while her argument for a meeting ground of the poetic field seconds
                     this: the irruption of speech that is the signature of psychosis understood and performed
                     as an irruption into the poetic itself. By putting both the Lacanian and neuroscientific
                     understandings of psychosis in conversation and theorizing their meeting point, Carlson
                     provides a way for readers to understand that instead of conflating the cultural and
                     biological, this volume instead acknowledges their expression and reality as registers
                     of both communal trauma and neurodiversity.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Kate Singer’s essay, “‘I feel it coming in the air tonight’: Mephitical Vapors, Pestiferous
                  Plagues, and the Psychosis of Materiality in Wollstonecraft,” takes the volume’s argument
                  more broadly. In focusing on the concept of jouissance, or sexual enjoyment as a painful
                  pleasure that stands in for an impossible satisfaction, Singer locates the French
                  feminist concept of fluid materiality as a later rendition of Romantic feminist materiality
                  of ether and bodies: “it is the airy vapor and the dispersed new materiality that
                  suffuses all kinds of bodies which can also diffuse its opposite, the mephitical vapor
                  of aristocratic excess.” The democratic new materiality of the Romantic age is one
                  that feminist thinkers were uniquely positioned to recognize, given that not just
                  ether but bodily fluids participate in this materiality that the ancien régime denied
                  but revolutionary thought made visible. Wollstonecraft, for instance, “entangles human
                  objects and subjects, miasmatic and vaporous materialities in a conceptual swerve
                  that may help us rethink the classic Lacanian relationship to the nonhuman world”
                  in texts such as <span style="font-style:italic">Maria; or the Wrongs of Woman</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Letters Written from Sweden, Norway and Denmark</span>. That swerve collapses the distinction between subject and object or rather between
                  subject and partial objects, so that the Symbolic is undone by such a psychotic materiality.</p>
               <p>That is, far from being a delusion, the intermingling of human and nonhuman bodies
                  Wollstonecraft realizes in her writing unseats the phallic or master signifier from
                  its (symbolic) organizing power: “thinking outside the paternalistic order . . . might
                  both appear and be insane when it locates itself and its transformations of ontology
                  as a reality-, or Real-, yet-to-come.” And yet if delusional, this feminine jouissance
                  as a resistance to such ordering is a necessary psychotic delusion if it is to be
                  transformational, for it routes desire away from the Symbolic’s cracks and lack. In
                  Singer’s words, “the phallic Symbolic is human while a nonphallic Symbolic would need
                  to be posthuman” because “posthuman, shared affective materiality becomes a medium
                  that materially shapes the signifiers and ontologies of desire.” It is a new kind
                  of witchcraft, Singer suggests, one that allows humans to enter an ontological Real
                  closed off to us in a symbolically ordered world.</p>
               <p>My contribution, “Pissing on Walls: Beau Brummell, or Romantic Psychosis Writ Large,”
                  takes the life of Beau Brummell as its text, using it to thread the mobius strip of
                  past and present similitudes in order to understand how representative figures can
                  speak to each other across centuries. Brummell represents the hystericized body at
                  odds with the daunting requirements of verbal mastery and accession to the Symbolic’s
                  promise, a body recognizable today in Trump. I argue that Brummell’s dandyism gave
                  him a way to resist the Name-of-the-Father, as represented by the Regent himself,
                  and to attempt to unseat the Father. The exchange of “cuts,” that telling verbal or
                  nonverbal gesture of Regency culture, becomes the swordplay of patriarch and rebel
                  son, the duel of power for recognition that is the Oedipal crisis and castration necessary
                  to maintain psychic and social order. In contesting that castration, Brummell literalizes
                  his psychotic resistance to the Law by which his body speaks for him. The Regent’s
                  assertion of patriarchal power as representative of the Father then reveals Brummell’s
                  self-imaging to be psychotic in its delusory self-regulation. His fall from power,
                  as spectacularly rapid as his ascent, becomes an exercise in castrative humiliation,
                  yet Brummell himself was apparently as self-deluded about that as he was about his
                  ability to control and best the Regent through wit and verbal thrusts. Brummell provides
                  an example of cultural self-production under the pressure of schizoid fissures in
                  licit and illicit expressions of desire, jouissance, and libidinal play.</p>
               <p>David Sigler’s “The Lime Trees of Aurora Leigh: Romanticism’s Psychotic Future” proposes
                  that Barrett Browning far from emulating her poetic forefather Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
                  whose “This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison” is so clearly referenced early in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>, is instead using Coleridge’s imagery in her epic “to enact a psychotic poetics.”
                  Sigler interprets such a poetics to be using a forefather’s elements—here, Coleridge’s
                  innovative conversation poem form—to create new figures, different modes of desire
                  and pleasure, and “difficult temporalities.” Barrett Browning’s psychotic revision
                  of Coleridge as representative of the Name-of-the-Father—that is, of poetic authority—is
                  a resistance to Coleridge’s aggressive co-optation of the traditionally feminine poetic
                  space of the bower. As Sigler argues, “if Coleridge’s poem proclaims the neurosis
                  of the entrapped male poet, who resents being left behind as his friends go walking,
                  then Barrett Browning’s poem can be said to be approaching that persona psychotically.”
                  A psychotic poetics here, as for Wollstonecraft and Brummell, is one that resists
                  the lawful deployment of signification and the social demand of desiring the approval
                  of authoritative Others.</p>
               <p>Coleridge, representing the poetic Name-of-the-Father, is the Other in question for
                  Barrett Browning; looming large over this female epic poem, he is the interlocutor
                  whose voice figuratively haunts the poem’s unconscious. That vocal call is made real,
                  evading the Symbolic, through its refiguring and reassemblage in Barrett Browning’s
                  feminine poetics. Sigler notes that “Unwilling to recognize an Other, the poem struggles
                  to situate its protagonist in time,” producing a “strange temporality.” Moreover,
                  “Aurora dreads that the lime tree, and thus perhaps by extension the English poetic
                  tradition, may want something from her.” That dread announces a significant psychotic
                  move: “The movement of the tree between Aurora’s “outer life” and “inner life,” which
                  ultimately becomes a way for Aurora to better figure herself as a suckling infant,
                  suggests that the psychic mechanism of foreclosure may be at work.” Indeed, because
                  Aurora has refused the normative act of transferring her own desire to the big Other
                  by acceding to the demand to recognize its authority, she had refused the Father’s
                  dominance. The bower returns again as the window of Aurora’s bedroom, another effect
                  of Barrett Browning’s turning of Coleridge’s poem “inside out,” as Sigler puts it.
                  Effectively, <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh </span> exemplifies “the psychotic decomposition of Romantic discourse.”</p>
               <p>Julie Carlson’s “After Word” surveys the larger field of current thought about the
                  psychiatric, the psychoanalytic, and the neuroscientific implications of a neurocosmopolitanism
                  that all three essays embrace and respond to. Ralph Saverese’s coinage “neurocosmopolitanism”
                  replaces neurotypicality (the universal) with neurodiversity, a more realistic representation
                  of the discrete ways in which the human mind-body parlays itself into someone subjected
                  to language and linguistic self-significance but also sensitive to vibrant materiality.
                  Such an optimistic view requires a strong caveat though: the mind/body porousness
                  of clinically diagnosed schizophrenics and the threat posed by external objects that
                  are experienced as penetrative so that exterior and interior are confused without
                  the boundaries neurotypicals depend on and must try to overcome cannot model as such
                  a way to think the future. Embracing that porousness puts psychotic subjects at risk.
                  The solution is not to reject the potential for neurocosmopolitanism and schizoid
                  imaginings but to hold it less lightly and to embrace the poetic field as a proven
                  meeting ground for psychotic speech and affective truths, a mind/body field that thinks
                  beyond signifiers and their structurations.</p>
               <p>In providing this wider lens, Carlson expertly crafts a frame capable of holding together
                  the libidinal energies, poetic meeting ground, and speculative thought with which
                  the volume’s essays are entangled and enmeshed. As she compares and engages with the
                  three essays and with recent work concerning neuroscience and neurocosmopolitanism,
                  Carlson provides a reflective space for the provocations of <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Psychosis</span>, to say nothing of its intentions and unspeakable desires. Her concluding reflection
                  on guidance as to where to go from here and how to apply the thinking of these essays
                  to the onto-political, even onto-theological situation we find ourselves in today
                  (in the sense of a belief in oncoming disaster versus an ardent right-wing belief
                  in a continuous norm of safety), asks us all to ponder the psychotic moment not just
                  for its promise but also its very real threat.</p>

               and to Congress diagnosing then President Trump as suffering from clinical narcissism
               and egomania, followed up with a more recent diagnosis of paranoid obsessional neurosis
               and narcissism, only strengthens our belief that the political and cultural condition
               under such a leader suffers from a concurrent identity disintegration. (See Lance
               Dodes and Joseph Schachter as well as Andrew Feinberg). This allows for theorizing
               a parallel between the years of Trump’s dismantling of the state, beginning with his
               candidacy, and the Regency. In both cases, there are traumas arising from extended
               warfare (literal in the Romantic period, political warfare that Trump escalated traumatically
               for us) and sociopsychological responses to trauma. This is particularly evident in
               maladaptative excesses that reveal themselves to be lacks, such as excessive consumerism
               pursued within an unremitting machine of desire, and deeply symbolized by Manhattan’s
               phallic Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago’s excessiveness. In a world marked by the fissures
               and ruptures of psychosis, a narcissistic leader might seem amoral but hardly abnormal.
               Because both narcissism and psychosis misidentify or misplace the libidinal object
               of desire, relationships to language, demand, and lack are also skewed as illustrated
               daily in Trump White House communiques and tweets (see Asawin Suebsaeng). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
