               and to Congress diagnosing then President Trump as suffering from clinical narcissism
               and egomania, followed up with a more recent diagnosis of paranoid obsessional neurosis
               and narcissism, only strengthens our belief that the political and cultural condition
               under such a leader suffers from a concurrent identity disintegration. (See Lance
               Dodes and Joseph Schachter as well as Andrew Feinberg). This allows for theorizing
               a parallel between the years of Trump’s dismantling of the state, beginning with his
               candidacy, and the Regency. In both cases, there are traumas arising from extended
               warfare (literal in the Romantic period, political warfare that Trump escalated traumatically
               for us) and sociopsychological responses to trauma. This is particularly evident in
               maladaptative excesses that reveal themselves to be lacks, such as excessive consumerism
               pursued within an unremitting machine of desire, and deeply symbolized by Manhattan’s
               phallic Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago’s excessiveness. In a world marked by the fissures
               and ruptures of psychosis, a narcissistic leader might seem amoral but hardly abnormal.
               Because both narcissism and psychosis misidentify or misplace the libidinal object
               of desire, relationships to language, demand, and lack are also skewed as illustrated
               daily in Trump White House communiques and tweets (see Asawin Suebsaeng). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               as both hysteric and obsessive is that the psychotic mechanism (the rejection of the
               phallus as signifier) is something every subject undergoes in the period after the
               Oedipal crisis as he/she represses realization of the Other’s lack (<span style="font-style:italic">Book VI: Desire and Its Interpretation</span>, 347).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               denies to girls their desire for the absolute presence of the mother; the Law is what

               of their own society: “Humanity, in the course of time, has had to endure from the
               hands of science two great outrages against its naive self-love.  .  . .  But the
               third and most irritating insult is flung at the human mania of greatness by present-day
               psychological research, which wants to prove to the ‘I’ that it is not even master
               in its own home, but is dependent upon the most scanty information concerning all
               that goes on unconsciously in its psychic life.  .  . .  We were compelled to disturb
               the peace of the world . . . .” Freud, “Traumatic Fixation—The Unconscious,” (331-–32).
               The summary of Lacan’s understanding of psychosis is from his early Seminar III; although
               he later revises his theory somewhat, the earlier discussion is more widely familiar
               to readers.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               language through the two phases of infant development that usher in the imaginary
               and symbolic registers, poetic language itself and thus the creative imagination are
               both linked to the mother’s somatic soundscape (her rhythms of blood, fluids, breaths).
               They are also matrixed to the libidinal promise of her excess, her seeming capacity
               to complete and to fully satisfy the pre-differentiated infant. See Julia Kristeva’s
               <span style="font-style:italic">Revolution in Poetic Language </span>for her seminal intervention in Lacanian theory of semiotic versus symbolic language.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
