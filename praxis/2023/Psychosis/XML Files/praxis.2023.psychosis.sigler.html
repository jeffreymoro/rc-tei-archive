            <p>The Lime Trees of <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>: Romanticism’s Psychotic Future</p>
            <p>This essay examines Aurora Leighʼs reactions to an encroaching lime tree in Book I
               of Elizabeth Barrett Browningʼs 1856 novel in verse, <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>. I suggest that Aurora's psychotic response to the tree, from the vantage of her
               domestic prison, can be considered part of Barrett Browningʼs complex reaction to
               Samuel Taylor Coleridgeʼs poetry and the legacy of male-authored Romantic poetry generally.
               Drawing on the psychoanalytic concept of “ordinary psychosis” and the work on that
               topic by Jacques Lacan, I suggest that Barrett Browning develops, through the account
               of Aurora's paranoid delusion, a feminist poetics capable of situating itself in the
               future.</p>

            window of her study: </p>

            </div>
         </blockquote>
         <p> The allusion is to Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s conversation poem “This Lime-Tree Bower
            My Prison,” written a half-century prior (1797, published 1800/1817). Like Barrett
            Browning, Coleridge had used a lime tree and garden bower as figures for domestic
            entrapment. Barrett Browning had long admired Coleridge’s verse. In the 1840s, she
            had declared Coleridge “so much the greater” poet than Robert Southey or William Wordsworth,
            and the “grander” and “intenser genius” than the latter; when corresponding with Sara
            Coleridge, she gushed with “reverence for the illustrious name you bear, which presented
            one of the earliest shrines of my hero worship" (Browning and Browning 5: 333, 7:
            123, 10:129; Inboden 147). Coleridge’s stated pleasure in how “a deep radiance lay
            / Full on the ancient ivy,” may be one of the reasons why Aurora chooses ivy, instead
            of bay or myrtle, for her self-made poetic crown (Coleridge, <span style="font-style:italic">Lime-Tree</span> 54–55; Barrett Browning 2.40-–52).</p>
         <p>Yet Barrett Browning’s lime-tree bower seems a world away from Coleridge’s. In “This
            Lime-Tree Bower My Prison,” as soon as the speaker notices how “the solitary humble-bee
            / Sings in the bean-flower!,” he discovers that being “bereft of promis’d good  . 
            .  .  may lift the soul” (ll. 60–61, 67–68). The bees in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>, not solitary, are capable only of humming away Aurora’s “morning-dream.” The tree
            is at the edge of Aurora’s consciousness, not the center: Aurora’s aunt encourages
            her to sit </p>
         <blockquote class="quote">
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">in just the chair she placed,</div>
               <div class="l">With back against the window, to exclude </div>
               <div class="l">The sight of the great lime-tree on the lawn, </div>
               <div class="l">Which seemed to have come on purpose from the woods </div>
               <div class="l">To bring the house a message. (ll. 1.484–88). <span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
            </div>
         </blockquote>
         <p> The content of that message is never shared with the reader, or and possibly not
            even with Aurora, but the mood is portentous. If Coleridge advises us that “no sound
            is dissonant which tells of Life” (l. 78), Barrett Browning, appropriating his imagery
            from a different vantage point and turning it into a paranoid delusion, gives voice
            to dissonance itself. Because the chair is turned away from the window, Barrett Browning
            also captures the anxiety that comes with the willful disregard of that dissonance.</p>
         <p>Generally, critics agree that Barrett Browning venerated Coleridge and was aligning
            herself with his poetic project. Robin Inboden has most thoroughly tracked Elizabeth
            Barrett’s debts to Coleridge, and has discussed the relative dearth of critical commentary
            on those debts; Inboden discusses only the poet’s earlier work under the name Elizabeth
            Barrett, and so does not mention <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh </span> or its lime-tree bower (129). Critics who have noted the echoes of “This Lime-Tree
            Bower” in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span> specifically have presented Barrett Browning as a relatively uncritical admirer of
            Coleridge’s poem. For Maureen Thum, the allusion to Coleridge’s poem begins the “mental
            process of Aurora’s awakening,” helping her find “a new alternative view of female
            identity” (89). In Thum’s reading, <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh </span>effectively replicates the trajectory of Coleridge’s lime-tree fantasy, attuning us
            to “the implicit call of the natural world beyond the conventions of the house and
            the narrowness even of the attached garden” (88). For Delores DeLuise and Michael
            Timko, Coleridge helps Aurora see that her domestic prison is not so bad, and the
            presence of the lime tree in the poem ensures that “it is clear that she has not given
            up the belief in the male poet as genius” (92,99). Such readings have been part of
            a broader effort to examine <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>’s debts to British Romanticism (Louis; Kobayashi).</p>
         <p>I want to challenge the supposition that Barrett Browning, in Book I of <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>, was paying homage to her Romantic predecessor, for I believe that the subtle differences
            in tone, divergent strategies of figuration, and striking disruptions in meter mark
            Barrett Browning’s distance from Coleridge. As I see it, Barrett Browning, far from
            assenting to Coleridge’s conclusions, seems to be repurposing his imagery to enact
            a psychotic poetics. Though many elements in the two poems are the same—blank verse,
            lime tree, woods, prison-like house, daydreaming, bees, a “sort of friend,” and an
            emphasis on affect—Barrett Browning is rearranging these elements into new figures,
            to open up unusual modes of enjoyment and difficult temporalities. Barrett Browning,
            read in relation to Coleridge, can be seen as a belated example of a discursive phenomenon
            known as “fellow Romantics” or “Romantic interactions,” in which male and female poets
            share discursive common ground and productively challenge and repeat one another (Lau;
            Wolfson). The gender politics being negotiated here are complex: even before Barrett
            Browning arrives onto the scene, the lime-tree bower was is already displaying Coleridge’s
            willingness to appropriate traditionally feminine poetic spaces (96; Murray 57). Barrett
            Browning might be wresting back this space for the women’s side; yet in doing so,
            she is developing a complex response to the immediacy of Coleridge’s verse. Although
            Barrett Browning repeatedly alludes to Coleridge’s lime-tree bower in Book I of her
            text, she does so to flatten Coleridge’s poetic world and detach the Coleridgean conversational
            “I” from its sources of comfort. To put the difference in psychoanalytic terms: if
            Coleridge’s poem proclaims the neurosis of the entrapped male poet, who resents being
            left behind as his friends go walking, then Barrett Browning’s poem can be said to
            be approaching that persona psychotically.</p>
         <p>It may seem iniquitous to speak of <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span> in terms of psychosis. I am not eager to associate one of the most important feminist
            poems of the nineteenth century with abnormal conditions of the mind and mental illness,
            given how readily the nineteenth century wielded psychiatric discourses against women.
            The association may seem especially unfortunate, given the remarkable clarity of Barrett
            Browning’s writing and thought, which is apparent everywhere in the poem, and Barrett
            Browning’s carefully reasoned arguments, through the voice of Aurora Leigh, about
            gender-based oppression. The poem chronicles, in a detailed and persuasive way, Aurora’s
            purposefulness in the face of conventionality. There does not appear to be anything
            particularly psychotic about Aurora’s quest to become an artist or transcend the limitations
            placed upon her—although Daniel Paul Schreber, too, was “clear thinking and sober”
            in pursuit of what he called “cool intellectual criticism” (69)-and I am not trying
            to suggest that the character Aurora Leigh, or that the author Barrett Browning, is
            especially psychotic. Instead, I will explore the category of “ordinary psychosis”—a
            psychosis often indistinguishable from ordinarily neurotic states of mind, except
            insofar as it relates to language and signification (Vanheule). It is psychosis as
            a method of resisting and refusing patriarchal law—and, as Todd McGowan reminds us,
            “The fundamental law is that of the signifier itself” (48). So, by my use of <span style="font-style:italic">“psychosis</span>,” in this essay, I merely mean to indicates that <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span> understands figuration and meaning quite differently from Coleridge, and that those
            differences, taken as a whole, substantially shift the poetic function of Leigh Hall’s
            menacing lime tree into a different register of experience. As figural and syntactic
            differences emerge between Barrett Browning and Coleridge, they become part of Barrett
            Browning’s agenda of feminist resistance. Unwilling to recognize an Other, the poem
            struggles to situate its protagonist in time. Mary Mullen has shown how, “by representing
            multiple, overlapping timescapes, <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh </span>questions the dominance of linear, progressive time” (64). The strange temporality
            of <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>’s Book I in particular, which arises from its interactions with Coleridge’s text
            at the level of figuration, proves confining for Aurora but enables Barrett Browning
            to build on a tradition of counter-temporal women’s writing inherited from Romantic-era
            women writers like Catherine Macaulay, Mary Wollstonecraft, Charlotte Smith, and Mary
            Shelley. Psychosis, in my reading of the poem, is less a medical or psychiatric diagnosis
            than a way of relating to language, male-authored poetry, and time.</p>
         <p>Aurora dreads that the lime tree, and thus perhaps by extension the English poetic
            tradition, may want something from her, and she hesitates to contemplate the tree
            or turn her chair that waytowards it. In what could easily be described as a paranoid
            delusion, she maintains that the tree has come from the woods to the house, and seems
            to be stalking her and attempting to communicate: it is here “to bring the house a
            message.” For Coleridge, the situation is exactly the opposite: the lime-tree bower,
            at first frustrating, becomes an emissary from the house to the woods, so that the
            injured poet can convey his feelings to his distant friends and his aspirations for
            their happiness. Coleridge’s lime tree is frustratingly immobile, while Barrett Browning’s
            seems to have made like a tree and left the woods behind; its seeming mobility is
            what provokes Aurora’s anxiety. The tree marks the outside world intruding into Leigh
            Hall and into the core of the subject: the tree's “message” is traumatic and meaningless
            in itself, and yet indicates “a thing / Beyond it” (1.484-5). The message becomes
            part of Aurora’s contemplation of “the inner life,” something that she likens to regression:
            Aurora maintains “relations in the Unseen  .  .  .  as a babe sucks surely in the
            dark. / I kept the life, thrust on me, on the outside / Of the inner life” (ll. 1.473–78).
            She goes on to suppose that: </p>
         <blockquote class="quote">
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">“And so, as froward babes, we hide our eyes </div>
               <div class="l">And think all ended.—Then, Life calls to us  .  .  .  Above us, or below us, or around:
                  </div>
               <div class="l">Perhaps we name it Nature’s voice, or Love’s, / </div>
               <div class="l">Tricking ourselves.” (ll. 1.672–676). </div>
            </div>
         </blockquote>
         <p> The second quoted example indicates that “Love”—a signifier to which we will shortly
            return—constitutes an untrustworthy “voice,” generated and named by our own psyche,
            but which imposes itself on us from outside. The distinction between inside and outside
            collapses, and so the voice may come from “above us, or below us, or around,” indifferently,
            or all at once. In both examples, Aurora styles herself as an infant only at the level
            of figuration, as the vehicle of a simile: she regresses by placing herself at the
            mercy of literary language, as a way of skirting the Law, in an effort to refuse to
            relinquish early childhood enjoyments.</p>
         <p>But her inner life seems to have been installed there from an alien source. The movement
            of the tree between Aurora’s “outer life” and “inner life,” which ultimately becomes
            a way for Aurora to better figure herself as a suckling infant, suggests that the
            psychic mechanism of foreclosure may be at work. The effect is a flattening out of
            meaning, as “the incoherencies of change and death” become folded into what Aurora
            calls the “smooth fair mystery of perpetual Life” (l. 1.171–73). Foreclosure, a concept
            coined by Jacques Lacan in 1956 in the final session of his Seminar on psychosis,
            is the process by which the subject loses access to a primordial signifier, known
            playfully, in Lacanian parlance, as the Name (or No) of the Father (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span> 321). The subject forecloses the signifier of the law in a bid to retain access to
            primordial enjoyment. Yet, even while the paternal signifier remains foreclosed from
            the psychotic subject, it can return in unexpected ways: “what is foreclosed does
            not simply disappear altogether but may return, albeit in a different guise, from
            outside the subject,” explains Russell Grigg (50). The arrival of the lime tree, and
            thus by extension Coleridge’s entire psychodrama of reconstituting “Friends, whom
            I never more may meet again" as a permanent presence that can keep the heart / Awake,”
            seems to function in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh </span> as an index of permanent filial attachment (Coleridge “Lime-Tree” ll. 6, 65–66).
            But because these affective bonds have been foreclosed in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>, the dynamics of loss and memory play out as “relations in the Unseen.” (l. 1.473).</p>
         <p>Psychosis arises not out of the daughter’s relationship to either mother or father,
            but to the child’s relationship to the mother’s relationship to the father—i.e.that
            is, it stems from a person’s relationship with their mother’s desire (Lacan, <span style="font-style:italic">Écrits</span> 464; Grigg 64). Aurora explains, "I felt a mother-want about the world, / And still
            went seeking, like a bleating lamb" (l. 40). Embodying her mother’s desire, and refusing
            to think of either parent as permanently lost, there can be no anchoring point for
            language or meaning for her. We get a sense of this through the jumbled syntax and
            jagged line breaks as Aurora gazes at a portrait of her mother, “half in terror, half
            / In adoration”: Therefore very strange / The effect was” (1.134–37). Much like her
            manipulations of Coleridge’s poem in the library of Leigh Hall, Aurora here seems
            to be constructing her own arrangements out of the linguistic ingredients available.
            Consider the remarkable extent to which Aurora experiences her father as an effect
            of language. Arriving as an orphan in England, she “heard [her] father’s language
            first / From alien lips," a defamiliarization (or unmooring) of language that provokes
            a reaction in her that others found find alarming: “some one near me said the child
            was mad / Through much sea-sickness” (ll. 1.254–59). The poem, finding an “apocalyptic”
            relation to language in a sustained effort not to deal with the traumatic loss of
            the mother and father (l. 1.674), begins to articulate something “very strange” that
            strikes those around her as madness. We can see the arrival of the lime tree in this
            light: “A feeling of being intruded upon,” Lacan explains, often playing out in “shared
            delusions,” such as the “delusion of being watched,” which especially arises in cases
            of psychosis connected to “the mother/daughter couple” (<span style="font-style:italic">Écrits</span> 447).</p>
         <p>Psychosis can ensue when the father appears to be undeserving or inadequate in the
            face of the mother’s desire, and in the face of the symbolic Law. As Grigg explains:
            <span class="quote">‘For Lacan, what is foreclosed is not the possibility of an event’s coming to pass,
               but the very signifier, or signifiers, that makes the expression of impossibility
               possible in the first place. Thus, “foreclosure” refers not to the fact that a speaker
               makes a statement which declares something impossible-a process closer to disavowal—but
               to the fact that the speaker lacks the very linguistic means for making the statement
               at all. This is where the difference between repression and foreclosure lies. (49)
               ’</span> An impossible event, such as a tree’s seeming “arrival” from the woods to Leigh Hall,
            might at first seem like a fanciful way to describe the return of the repressed. But
            it is not at all the case that Coleridge’s poetry, or his lime-tree imagery, have
            been “repressed” in Aurora’s world: there is a library full of English books, and
            the lime tree is visible just through the window—yes, the reading chair has been turned
            away, but the world outside that window is hardly repressed material. Therefore, I
            would encourage us to think of that tree not as the embodiment of the repressed, but
            rather as the arboreal embodiment of the father’s signifier (“Love,” to which Aurora
            feels she has no access) and the world of literary language more broadly. In this
            sense, it is a symbol of how the work of poetic figuration is kept “outside” of Aurora’s
            view, even when she is immersed in reading. The psychic movement from inner to outer—as
            a way of pretending that one can maintain oneself as separate from the expectations
            that surround one—is crucial to understanding the ethos of <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span> and its relationship to Romanticism, as Emily Kobayashi has argued (823). It is also
            crucial to psychosis in the psychoanalytic tradition. For instance,: Schreber even
            begins his <span style="font-style:italic">Memoir</span> with the claim that “the total mental life of a human being rests on their excitability
            by external impressions” (19). The lime tree, ominously approaching Leigh Hall, exemplifies
            this phenomenon.</p>
         <p>“Love” is a special signifier in this text, as it was the father’s emphatic last word
            to his now-orphaned daughter: “His last word was, ‘Love—’ / ‘Love, my child, love,
            love!” (ll. 1.211–12). For Aurora, “love” is not the name for an ethical relation
            nor a sentiment, but a signifier of her father’s lack: in her memory, her father is
            the man “Whom love had unmade from a common man / But not completed to an uncommon
            man” (ll.1.183–84). Such an association is not unusual in cases of psychosis: Lacan
            explains that “words of love” are “always a rupture in the system of language,” and
            are thus often pivotal in psychosis <span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span> 55). Orphaned at thirteen, Aurora is alarmed to find her father not only dead but
            also rendered incomplete and “unmade” by the signifier of his own paternity, which
            had once been the signifier of her mother’s desire. Hence, when arriving in England,
            Aurora is alarmed by the extent to which the landscape—recently enclosed—seems to
            disclose her father’s lack through the cut of its property lines: clearly, she reckons,
            it was not “my father’s England” because of how the “ground seemed cut up from the
            fellowship / Of verdure” —with even the line break marking the violence of the cut—and
            finding because of the loss of the commons re-inscribed in the “delicate lines” of
            her Aunt’s face (ll. 1.259–61, 278). Such delineation is, for Aurora, the mark of
            castration in and through her “my father’s language” (l. 1.254): it is the signifier
            of the father’s lack. But the primordial word “love,” to which Aurora is traumatically
            attached, is foreclosed in the experience, and so Aurora moves through the world with
            ears too full / Of [her] father’s silence” (ll. 1.227–28). To render this silence
            in poetry—with one’s own “lines” and the emphatic line breaks of the poem’s aggressive
            enjambment—is Aurora’s attempt to link this cut to the father, to turn the dead father’s
            love into just another signifier, instead of accepting it as the Name of the Father.
            Hence the signifier “love” resounds through the poetry found in her aunt’s library,
            turning the Name of the Father into just another signifier as the lime tree keeps
            watch: “From many a volume, Love re-emphasised / Upon the self-same pages” (ll. 1.710–11).</p>
         <p>Without the stabilizing presence of a master signifier, Aurora is “left prey to  . 
            .  .  the mother’s unregulated desire” : I am like, / They tell me, my dear father,"
            she observes (Grigg 55; Barrett Browning 1.198-99). It is a flattening out and undoing
            of the Oedipal triangle. Again, she refuses to separate the “I” of narration from
            the “they” who intercedes, syntactically speaking, between sheher and her father.
            Put in Lacanian terms, she has refused to transfer her enjoyment to the big Other—an
            imagined repository of signifiers normally held as a tribute to the dead father’s
            enjoyment, and his ongoing dominance, as per Freud’s totem myth. Aurora’s refusal
            of this Other, I am suggesting, is a consequence of foreclosure: hence her boast that
            the lime tree’s “message,” once “ thrust on me,” can be kept “on the outside / Of
            the inner life.” Lacan says, in “On a Question Prior to Any Possible Treatment of
            Psychosis,” that when we arrive “at the point at which the Name-of-the-Father is summoned—and
            we shall see how—a pure and simple hole may thus answer in the Other" (<span class="italics">Écrits</span> 465). This hole is the outcome of foreclosure. That hole begins to answer in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span> as Aurora begins to “hear the silence open like a flower” (l. 1.683). Although she
            can sense the delivery of that absent message internally, as if emitted from inside
            of her head, its blankness is firmly kept on the “outside.” Grigg warns us against
            such a dynamic in his account of psychotic foreclosure: “Yet what is foreclosed from
            the symbolic is not purely and simply abolished. It returns, but, unlike the return
            of the repressed, it returns from outside the subject, as emanating from the real”
            (56). As it returns in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>, we observe a collapse of levels in these lime-tree bower passages: the tree arrives
            as the externalized embodiment of the father’s signifier, and so the poetry renders
            impossible any distinction between inside, outside, and beyond.</p>
         <p>Celeste Langan has done important work in thinking about Coleridge’s theories of poetic
            language—in particular through <span style="font-style:italic">Christabel</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">Biographia Literaria</span>—in light of Schreber’s <span style="font-style:italic">Memoir.</span> For Langan, Schreber’s psychotic “nerve-language” can be read as “a ‘pathological’
            instance of Coleridge’s poetic theory.” As she explains,: “there is an underexamined
            equivalency between poetry and what can be described as forms of speech pathology.
            Poetry, as it is practiced by Coleridge and Schreber, is the very opposite of ‘free’
            speech,” given their shared “conditions of constraint” (120–21). In Coleridge’s “Lime-Tree
            Bower” poem, something external impresses itself upon the speaker’s body, restructuring
            his affect. The transformation is conveyed by a jarring line break: “A delight / Comes
            sudden on my heart” (ll. 45–46). Aurora’s strategy, of keeping “the life, thrust on
            me, on the outside / Of the inner life,” is quite different, though it communicates
            by similar means. In aspiring to maintain a distinction between “outside” and “inner”
            lives, the very rigor of her attempt ensures the collapse of that distinction: hence
            the rhetoric of unwanted penetration (“thrust on me”) and the syntactical way that
            “on me” is enfolded, as a subordinate clause, within the play of “outside” and “inner,”
            as if “I” were always internal to the play that defines one's own boundaries. In effect,
            the speaker of <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span> is treating the Real as the Symbolic: she is building a symbolic distinction out
            of the violent rupture of repressed material, flattening the levels out onto a single
            plane of signification. Coleridge’s epiphany is now asked to take on a subjectivity
            of its own, such that it no longer functions as an epiphany. It becomes, over the
            course of Book I, an engine of “rupture” and “break” instead of the “deep radiance”
            of a “straight path”: “Then, something moved me,” Aurora explains, sayingadding: ,
            “here’s a cause / For rupture;—herein we must break with Life, / Or be ourselves unworthy”
            (Coleridge ll. 54, 71; Barrett Browning ll. 1.661–70).</p>
         <p>Although such contrasts between the two poems, culled from a close reading of just
            a few small words and their rhetorical function, may seem too subtle to warrant the
            invocation of something as extreme as “psychosis” in Aurora Leigh’s case, it is actually
            only in such subtleties that ordinary psychosis manifests itself. That is why Lacan
            urges his students to focus on the order of words, rather than the words themselves
            (that is, to prioritize the analysis of syntax over diction), in the writings of psychotic
            patients: “a metaphor is above all sustained by positional articulation,” he explains,
            and so we have to study the relationship of signifier to signifier, without much consideration
            of any signified <span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span> 226). Because “the mainspring of the metaphor isn’t the meaning, which is supposed
            to be transposed” from tenor to vehicle, Lacan explains, “the transference of the
            signified [from vehicle to tenor] is possible only by virtue of the structure of language”
            <span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span> 225).</p>
         <p>The window is the most obvious perspectival difference between the two poems: Barrett
            Browning emphasizes how the architecture and interior design direct her gaze; they
            limit her capacity, and everyone’s capacity, to hear the “message” of the tree. Coleridge’s
            speaker is directly “in this bower, / This little lime-tree bower,” while Aurora shuffles
            “demurely,” for now, around the “carpeted low rooms” of Leigh Hall, occasionally craning
            her neck toward the window (Coleridge ll. 47–48; Barrett Browning ll. 1. 489). Does
            the fact of looking at the lime tree through a window influence the affect it provokes,
            and the temporality of the “message” it might impose? It is not enough to see the
            presence of a lime tree as “a vestigial remnant of male genius,” as DeLuise and Timko
            would have it, because <span style="font-style:italic">how </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">through what intermediary </span>we see the lime tree is as least as important as its status<span style="font-style:italic">as </span>a lime tree (99). There is a disquieting aura surrounding the Barrett Browning lime
            tree, which becomes, as the tree comes back again and again throughout Book I, thoroughly
            uncanny.</p>
         <p>In his Seminar on anxiety, Lacan explains that: “the magisterial German <span style="font-style:italic">Unheimliche</span>, presents itself through little windows. The field of anxiety is situated as something
            framed.  .  .  .  Anxiety is the appearance, within this framing, of what was already
            there, at much closer quarters, at home" (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar X</span> 74–75). To illustrate this, Lacan examines two drawings of trees made by psychoanalytic
            patients: the first and more famous, by the Wolf Man, depicting five wolves sitting
            in the branches of a tree, gazing as if to bring the house a message, and the second,
            by an Italian woman with schizophrenia he calls Isabella, depicting a tree with three
            large humanoid eyes positioned vertically along its trunk and cursive foliage that
            spells out “<span style="font-style:italic">Io sono sempre vista</span>,” or, rendered into English, “I am always in view.” Lacan is interested in how Isabella’s
            drawing parallels the Wolf Man’s, and yet the wolves have been replaced with signifiers.
            Lacan stresses the ambiguity of “<span style="font-style:italic">Io sono sempre vista</span>,” as it has “two meanings, subjective and objective” in the French translation: we
            cannot know whether the tree is wary of being the object of our gaze, or if Isabella
            might be concerned about her visibility to the tree (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar X</span> 73). It is this syntactical ambiguity—never knowing whether you are the watcher or
            the watched—which becomes a wellspring of Isabella’s psychotic anxiety. These are
            striking images, both extremely unsettling, and yet Lacan strategically disregards
            the content of these images in his discussion, focusing instead on how their uncanny
            effects are mediated by a windowpane. Although one cannot see the windowpane in either
            case, Lacan stresses that, in both images, “the fantasy is beheld on the other side
            of a windowpane, and through a window that opens. The fantasy is framed” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar X</span> 73). <a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                  (2)
                  </sup></a> It is the window, connecting but separating the tree to and from the house, which
            fills the artist with dread: an uncanny and terrifying “countryside view” and a tree
            who has come to the house to deliver an ambiguous message (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar X</span> 74).</p>
         <p>As the figural language of the poem begins to be flattened out—by which I mean the
            levels of vehicle and tenor become indistinguishable—the window to Aurora’s bedroom
            begins to be metaphorized as a bower: “the folds / Hung green about the window, which
            let in / The out-door world with all its greenery" (1.572-4). Once Aurora’s window
            becomes a metaphorical bower, we are forced to notice that the mediating fact of the
            window is what separates Leigh Hall’s lime tree from Coleridge’s. Coleridge is sitting
            outside in his garden bower, a space semi-natural and semi-domestic. For Aurora to
            liken the windowpane to a garden bower is to imagine herself in her own future, already
            outside the house. Yet the windowpane always frames Aurora’s experience of the tree.
            In a reversal of Coleridge, criminological language is associated with the house,
            not the bower: Romney Leigh, Aurora’s cousin and eventual suitor, is ever “agonising
            with a ghastly sense / Of universal hideous want and wrong / To incriminate possession”
            of Leigh Hall (1.519-21). That is, the house “incriminates” its socially-conscious
            master in a way that inverts Coleridge’s carceral metaphor. For Coleridge, the bower
            is effectively a prison, whereas for cousin Romney, the bower—in its function as one
            of the estate’s “seasonable delights” (1.518)—is the very crime. In <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>, to enjoy is to be guilty, ; yet one is then condemned to enjoy, and one enjoys precisely
            by being “sentenced,” that is, at the lexical and syntactical levels. Barrett Browning,
            introducing Romney, twists Coleridge’s imagery to depict him as a reverse version
            of Coleridge’s encomium to Charles Lamb from the lime-tree bower: Romney is not “gentle-hearted,”
            but only “tender when he thought of it”; he is not “my friend” but rather “a sort
            of friend”; a “delight” does not “come sudden upon [his] heart,” except through his
            “repressing all its seasonable delights”; the lesson for Aurora is not that “Nature
            ne’er deserts the wise and pure,” but that “’Twas natural to like to get away” (Coleridge
            ll. 29–62; Barrett Browning ll. 1.506–14.). Barrett Browning reorganizes the elements
            found in Coleridge’s poem, twisting the function of Coleridge’s words and images to
            give them uncanny moods.</p>
         <p>Like Isabella, Aurora cannot determine if she is looking at the tree, or if the tree
            is beholding her—if it is she, or the tree, that is “always in view.” Coleridge’s
            tree is “always in view” as well, but it’s clearer that the speaker is exercising
            a gaze upon it: in extraordinarily visual diction, the speaker “mark’d,” “watch’d,”
            and “lov’d to see” the lime tree (ll. 48–51). Aurora’s experience is not like that.
            It finds a closer corollary in another moment from Coleridge, this one from “Frost
            at Midnight,” in which the speaker discovers his inner self in an external if “companionable
            form” (“Frost” 19). That is, the lime tree gives substance to Aurora’s fantasy, and
            its enigmatic “message” is Coleridge’s message for the future being returned to him
            in a new contemporary moment, in inverted form <span style="font-style:italic">Écrits</span> 30). This uncertainty is something that she must “await”: in Lacanian terms, it is
            not a feeling but a premonition and “pre-feeling,” as we await the cause of our desire,
            a confrontation with “that which deceives not” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar X</span> 76). That happens because Barrett Browning’s allusion functions both spatially and
            temporally: it separates inside from outside, as “Frost at Midnight” does in its own
            figurations of domestic space, but also styles Aurora as a baby (as we saw above),
            and thus as little Hartley Coleridge. Aurora is someone of the following generation,
            a figure from the future of Romanticism to whom Coleridge had been sending aspirational
            wishes. This temporal movement, positioning Aurora’s present as Coleridge’s future,
            —and thus as living out one’s life as a someone else’s future projection from the
            past, —is how, despite her claims to the contrary, Aurora’s “inner life” can return,
            through the companionable tree, “on the outside.” Aurora has located her inner experience
            outside of herself, in an effect that Lacanian analyst Stijn Vanheule has called “bodily
            externality” (86). The body never becomes a narcissistically cathected object, and
            so there is no “ego” here, and the subject does not register properly in time. Aurora
            begins to embody what Anne C. McCarthy has called, with reference to “Frost at Midnight,”
            the “future just beyond the poem’s frame that may or may not take place,” in response
            to that poem’s “doubly suspended” “slow, dilated time” (29).</p>
         <p>In so doing, Barrett Browning undoes the central conceit of Coleridge’s two poems,
            and reverses their aspirations for the future. <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span> resists the law laid down by Coleridge’s use of trope, and we can feel the ripples
            of this difference temporally. “This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison,” like “Frost at Midnight,”
            converts metonymy into metaphor: the lime-tree bower metonymizes the house at which
            the injured poet is stuck, only for that metonym to become the tenor of a carceral
            metaphor: “this lime-tree bower my prison” (l. 2). In Freudian terms (as processed
            through Lacan’s discussion of metonymy and metaphor), Coleridge’s figural language
            works first by displacement, “as I myself were there!” (l. 47), only to begin the
            work of condensation, as if Charles and the speaker were the same person, and so they
            can “contemplate / With lively joy the joys we cannot share” (ll. 68–69). This gives
            a dreamlike quality to Coleridge’s text, which has been seen as a source of its unusual
            temporality: . Aas Francis O’Gorman notes, Coleridge is imagining and situating himself
            within a present, as a way of expressing trepidation for the future. He meanwhile
            treats the present as his own past: “So my friend / Struck with deep joy may stand,
            as I have stood” (ll. 38–39). The figural trajectory of Aurora’s lime tree is quite
            different: the tree appears as an allusion to Coleridge, but then becomes a symbol
            of a world outside the house. The lime tree never becomes a metonym for the house,
            and never a metaphor for a prison; rather, the window from which Aurora watches the
            tree stands in metonymic relation to the house, and then the window becomes allegorized
            as the bars of her prison cell. The symbolic tree is viewed from through that mediating
            frame. McGowan explains what is at stake in this difference: <span class="quote">‘“The psychotic is capable of registering metonymy and thus can function within the
               symbolic structure. But the psychotic foreclosure of the signifier of law marks a
               refusal of metaphor, which is what condemns the psychotic to a profound unfreedom.
               In this way, the psychotic is the most dangerous psychic structure  .  .  .  because
               its appearance of the ultimate freedom obscures the conformity that characterizes
               it. (63-64) ’</span> Thus, the window itself becomes an index of Aurora’s incarceration. We can feel the
            effects of this difference in the temporality of the scene. Coleridge notes, in the
            present tense and in all immediacy, how “A delight / Comes sudden on my heart” (“Lime-Tree”
            ll. 45–46), while Barrett Browning goes out of her way to place the experience ambiguously
            in the past. In a section of <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span> with otherwise perfect iambic pentameter, one line alone has an extra syllable: “which
            seemed to have come on purpose from the woods” (l. 1. 484). The syntax serves as what
            Lacan would call a “positional link” in the sentence, and so “reappears at all levels
            and sets up the synchronic coexistence of terms” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span> 225). That is, it compresses the temporality of the scene to mark the disjuncture
            of time in Barrett Browning’s lime-tree prison. The line highlights its deliberate
            construction: the words “on purpose,” forming a spondee, are very emphatic, but not
            necessary to the line’s meaning; removing them, the line becomes surprisingly anapestic
            (“which seem to have come from the woods”). The sonic excess of the extra syllable—an
            extra bit whichthat cannot be folded into the meter or the sense of the line—lends
            a hint of anxiety to the scene. Although “had come” or “seemed to come” would have
            made more sense syntactically and would have better satisfied the metrical requirements,
            Barrett Browning has gone out of her way to say “seemed to have come” instead. She
            lets the past perfect of <span style="font-style:italic">it had come</span> encounter the simple past of <span style="font-style:italic">it seemed</span>, creating a temporal division between the perspectives of the tree and speaker. From
            out of this gap, the tree’s purpose is given in the infinitive (“to bring the house
            a message”), as if a message were coming from the future into Aurora’s contemporary
            moment, despite our being able to recollect its past actions (and our own, in the
            time of Aurora’s narration). The poem is opening up two asynchronous temporalities—Aurora’s,
            belonging to Coleridge, in which a poetic past is repeated as the present, and the
            tree’s, in which the past situates us within its peculiarly deciduous prophecy—and
            fuses them into one asynchronous perspective. This effectively turns Coleridge’s poem
            inside-out, given how “This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison” was, in O’Gorman’s estimation,
            one of Coleridge’s boldest attempts “to try, however illusorily, to control the direction
            of the future through the assertion of a flawed individual will” and the culmination
            of his “efforts  .  .  .  somehow to know or to anticipate what was to come” (233).</p>
         <p>Aurora experiences that Coleridgean project of directing the future, ultimately, as
            a source of comfort—but it is comforting only insofar as it offers her a way to imagine
            herself in service to an omnipotent Other, here called Nature, who demands her enjoyment:

         <p> The beams of light, the all-seeing sun and moon, which control the birds, the terror
            of being inaudible to God except under certain conditions: the poem seizes on the
            lime tree to articulate a remarkably Schreberian vision. The tree becomes the focal
            point of a paranoid structure. The confusion about who is speaking that arises when
            poetry encloses itself in quotation marks, as happens here, is a particularly Coleridgean
            inheritance and a signal of its alliance with Schreber’s psychotic discourse, as Langan
            indicates in her reading of <span style="font-style:italic">Christabel</span> (147-48). I want to highlight, here, the sun’s use of the word “shall,” which, as
            Russell Grigg reminds us, epitomizes psychotic discourse: in the face of the utterance
            “shall,” the subject is asked to commit to the plan of the other (61). In making this
            point, Grigg draws on Lacan’s discussion of the word “shall” in Schreber’s hallucinatory
            conversations with God. Lacan’s sees language as an “endurance test” for Schreber,
            who receives “interrupted messages, by means of which a relationship is sustained
            between the subject and his divine interlocutor” (<span class="italics">Écrits</span> 451). God tests Schreber with incomplete phrases like “Now I shall . . .…” and “I
            shall . . .,” to which Schreber must fill in what remains of the sentence in a way
            that “indicate[s] the subject’s position on the basis of the message itself” (452).
            The sun’s “shall I” in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh </span> functions quite similarly. As Aurora quotes her hallucination of the sun, it addresses
            a “you” that, at one level, interpellates Aurora, but at another level, because Aurora
            is quoting the sun’s voice, forces Aurora to imagine herself as outside of herself,
            as seen by the omnipotent sun and its angels. The double interpellation is especially
            disquieting because Aurora’s name, meaning “dawn,” indicates her own readiness to
            “lift this light / Against the lime-tree.”: Sshe is forced to experience herself as
            the divine agent of her own manipulation;: swept clear of her own thoughts, she is
            being placed “beside me” by her remade relation to the lime tree. Michelle C. Martinez
            emphasizes how the first lime-tree passage in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh </span>signals “an important change of register in the text,” as the poem then begins to
            apostrophize a “You,” seemingly the reader, standing outside of Leigh Hall (40). The
            figural work of that apostrophe certainly continues in this passage. For Lacan, the
            work of such a “you” marks the border between psychotic and non-psychotic discourse:
            “The <span style="font-style:italic">you</span> is the hooking of the other in the waters of meaning,” he explains, as he seeks a
            way, within psychotic language, “to elevate this <span style="font-style:italic">you</span> to subjectivity” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span> 299). The “you” of this passage, however, is “me,” who is subjected to an omnipotent
            sun who asks “shall,” as if it had been subjected, at dawn, to a yet more powerful
            “you”: the gap between the ego and Other has been foreclosed in this passage.</p>
         <p>If psychotic subjects have foreclosed the Name of the Father, it does not mean that
            they have no recourse to language: as the psychotic patient Mr. Primeau tells Lacan,
            “I create worlds through my poetry, through my poetic speech” (Lacan, “A Lacanian
            Psychosis” 34). The missing signifier makes it impossible, though, for the psychotic
            subject to resolve herself into the Law: psychosis is a failure of language systems
            to produce meaning, and a confrontation with the absence of meaning, rather than an
            abstention from language itself (Grigg 56). In the words of Mr. Primeau:<span class="i0"> “</span>I am a little disjointed in regard to language. . . .  … Language could present strata
            and substrata” ("A Lacanian Psychosis" 19-20). That is why Lacan understands psychosis
            as “a question of the subject’s access to a signifier as such and of the impossibility
            of that access,” in the face of which we find “the separate deployment and the bringing
            into play of the entire signifying apparatus,  .  .  .  laden with non-meaningfulness,
            [and] the decomposition of internal discourse, which marks the entire structure of
            psychosis.” Psychosis, in short—as Lacan sees it—is “the encounter, the collision,
            with the inassimilable signifier,” which then “has to be reconstituted” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span> 321).</p>
         <p>In reading <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh </span>as the psychotic decomposition of Romantic discourse, I am trying to situate the poem
            within recent debates about the clinical approach to psychosis within Lacanian psychoanalysis,
            and specifically what is called “ordinary psychosis.” WithIn cases of “ordinary psychosis,”
            explains Vanheule, one must consider not an array of dramatic symptoms, but only “how
            speech structures the subject" (78). This is part of a movement, now ongoing with
            Lacanian psychoanalysis, to define psychosis not by means of a “hegemonic authoritarian
            psychiatry” but “as a conceptual framework or philosophical perspective supported
            by descriptive narrative and symptomatic phenomenology that challenges preconceived
            notions of what we typically consider psychosis to entail,” according tos Jon Mills
            explains As Mills suggests, “contemporary Lacanian’s [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] are in hot debate over what constitutes psychosis, including defining the ordinary
            from pathological variants that have historically defined that phenomena as a mental
            illness” (1-2). For Vanheule, this is what makes Lacan’s approach to psychosis better
            suited for this historical moment of ours: it is poised to make headway in cases of
            “ordinary psychosis” because it begins from the premise of the subject’s relation
            to language (78). McGowan, echoing Vanheule, prizes Lacan’s approach to psychosis
            for the way that it stresses a “fundamental kinship” between the purportedly normal
            subject and the psychotic—much as Freud has done for neurosis (50). We are seeing
            such a kinship play out in Book I of <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>, as Barrett Browning reckons with Coleridge’s legacy. In her interactions with Coleridge’s
            text, we can see her closely listening to a partner’s voice, to parse its “interrupted
            messages” (Lacan, <span style="font-style:italic">Écrits</span> 451). This, as Lacan explains, is the crux of psychosis, even in the absence of noticeable
            symptoms.</p>
         <p>Roland Barthes suggests that symbol is “analogical and inadequate” to its referent,
            and thus takes an inexact relation to signification (38). It is for this reason, perhaps,
            that symbolization becomes the limit point of psychosis. To be psychotic is to refuse
            the cut of the signifier and thus to be rendered unable to demarcate the realm of
            symbolic meaning from other levels of apprehension. In this context, we might find
            new ways of understanding Aurora’s offhand admonition that, “By the way, / The works
            of women are symbolical” (ll. 1. 455–56): the statement might not refer to the tendency
            for women artists to use symbolism, or to produce, through their domestic craftworks,
            tokens of their own marginal status, but rather might suggest that women’s works directly
            <span style="font-style:italic">are </span>symbolical, with the “are” doing the work of a metaphor. That is, women’s texts begin
            to function as a replacement for the symbolic register itself. By “works,” Barrett
            Browning means quasi-artistic productions that will be used by men in the domestic
            space—the mending of a husband’s slippers, the construction of a stool, or “at best,
            a cushion” (ll. 1. 458–61). Note how these “works” are not “symbolical” in the sense
            that they function symbolically: Barrett Browning seems to mean that they function
            metonymically, as slivers of evidence of women’s subordination. They attest to a sexual
            nonrelation, by leaving material traces of women’s domestic labour around the house.
            These traces are “symbolical” to the extent that they reveal a truth about everyday
            life—a hidden resentment of women and devaluation of their work—in an assemblage of
            seemingly minor examples. Now, to make such a sweeping statement about “the works
            of women” tout court is an outrageous generalization, as Barrett Browning clearly
            knew well—and this, in a poem, itself very ambitious in scope, which valorizes the
            dignity of women’s artistic ambitions. The point is not, though, that women artists
            have an innate special relation to symbol; it may rather be that Aurora Leigh—the
            fraught “I” of the “novel in verse”—cannot comfortably differentiate her own ego from
            the category “woman” in general.: Sshe is, through her foreclosed redeployment of
            symbolic language, becoming-woman in Schreber’s sense and : she is finding new arrangements
            for enjoyment that do not depend upon the cut of castration (Schreber 18 n.1). Just
            as, in Paul de Man’s assessment, “the symbol is always part of the totality that it
            represents,” and thus functions as a species of synecdoche, so too in Lacan’s exposition
            of psychosis, in whichdoes the subject, becoming “the mouthpiece of a discourse that
            is not his own,” find that “he cannot speak without hearing himself” (de Man 190–91;
            <span style="font-style:italic">Écrits</span> 447). Barrett Browning, as she inhabits and speaks Coleridge’s symbolic discourse,
            finds that Aurora cannot detach herself from her own poetic utterances.</p>
         <p>Romanticism, in de Man’s view, was the movement away from allegory and toward symbol;
            he found in the dialectical interplay of these tropes forms of repetition that could
            organize images in time. In symbol, says de Man, “time is merely a matter of contingency,”
            whereas in allegory, which functions through repetition instead of synthesis, “time
            is the originary constitutive category” (207). Symbol functions spatially, by simultaneity:
            it refuses the repetitions that characterize allegory, undoing “an authentically temporal
            destiny,” yet as it collides with allegory it creates its own temporalities. Coleridge
            is of course de Man’s primary case in point (de Man 206). Barrett Browning is undoing
            that figural work, recasting Coleridge’s metonymy as symbol and then sequestering
            the symbol from any allegorical processes, to create something asynchronous and not
            totalizing, although its mood is often stifling. Where there is repetition in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>’s allusions to Coleridge, it does not stem from the negation of Romantic totalities;
            rather, repetition is there from the start, built in tointo the poem through the allusion
            to Coleridge—and so Barrett Browning can sidestep the signature dialectics of Romantic
            figuration. The poem’s lime-tree symbolism, both strategic and deliberate,strategic
            and deliberate lime-tree symbolism becomes an important part of its feminist poetics.</p>
         <p>Such is the atemporal “message” that the lime tree brings to the house in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>: the poem’s report of the tree’s arrival directly <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> the “message,” and so further elaboration would be impossible. Barrett Browning,
            or perhaps Aurora, reconstitutes Romantic language in such a way as to create subtle
            ruptures in time. This is consistent with Lacan’s account of psychosis as a “turning
            away” from the diachronic aspects of discourse. Schreber himself remains uncertain
            if certain phases of his life were taking place over “a few earthly months only and
            not of centuries” (69). It is far from clear, in Book I of <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>, that “Times followed one another” (2.1), and the poem in general is, “deliberately
            untimely” (Mullen 73). If, under typical Saussurean conditions, “there is no discourse
            without a certain temporal order,” then in psychosis we witness language becoming
            “a set of several lines, a stave,” according to which “certain elements become isolated,
            laden, take on a value, a particular force of inertia, become charged with meaning,
            with a meaning and nothing more” (Lacan, <span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span> 54). Along these lines (as it were), one can place <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span> within a tradition of Romantic-era women’s writing that, through its manipulations
            of figurative language and the materiality of the signifier, began to think about
            time asynchronously. Such a tradition, which does not always or usually avail itself
            of psychotic structures to create alternative temporalities, would include authors
            works such as Mary Wollstonecraft’s “The Cave of Fancy,” Helen Maria Williams’s <span style="font-style:italic">Paul and Virginia</span>, Charlotte Smith’s <span style="font-style:italic">Beachy Head</span>, and Mary Shelley’s “The Mortal Immortal.” Because Barrett Browning’s contribution
            to this tradition exploits the elements of psychotic language, and the reconstitution
            of existing signifying structures, then in order to show how this flattened temporality
            emerges in Barrett Browning’s poem, we have needed to examine Barrett Browning’s lime
            tree in relation to Coleridge’s, with careful attention to the rhetoric of temporality
            of both poets, to show how this flattened temporality emerges in <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>. What had been, for Coleridge, a series of interlocking tropes designed to create
            intimacy with nature and one’s friends has been rewritten so as to stress the anxiety
            attendant upon that scene once the different levels that support it collapse.</p>
         <p>Aurora Leigh imagines herself as a “wild bird” trapped within her Aunt’s “cage-bird
            life” (ll. 1. 310, 305). At one level, the contrast in the text would seem to be between
            a bird captured from the wild and a bird raised in captivity, given as two models
            of Victorian womanhood. Yet the image also reveals a doubleness of experience, the
            feeling of being wild and caged simultaneously. Mr. Primeau expresses his experience
            of psychosis in just such terms, much to Lacan’s evident frustration:<span style="font-style:italic">“</span>The fact of speaking of these solitary circles and of living without boundaries; there
            is no contradiction. In my mind I do not see a contradiction. How can I explain that?
            I am in a solitary circle because I am broken off from reality” (“A Lacanian Psychosis”
            33–34). That is, psychosis can confer the experience of freedom upon those living
            within severe confinements. “In relation to the solitary circle, I live without boundaries,”
            Primeau explains to Lacan, adding,: “But in relation to the real, I live <span style="font-style:italic">with </span> boundaries” (34). Like Mr. Primeau, Aurora Leigh finds in poetic language—in the
            figural work of allusion and symbol, and in the disruptions of meter, syntax, and
            lineation—a way to create an unbounded confinement in the absence of a master signifier.</p>
         <p>Coleridge’s work resonates through Book I of <span style="font-style:italic">Aurora Leigh</span>, but Barrett Browning, by shifting the tropes and by framing the experience through
            a window, undoes the imaginative work of “This Lime-Tree Bower” as part of its innovative
            feminist poetics. This might be termed an “impasse of the feminine” which that “is
            central to psychosis in women,” according to Willy Apollon, Danielle Bergeron, and
            Lucie Canton: Aurora’s unwriting of “the social link, the requirement of the cultural
            construction of the feminine, removes the possibility [for her] to address a reliable
            Other for an essential dimension of [her life]” (132). Such an impasse arises, in
            its temporal dimension, once symbol and meter escape their boundaries and overflow
            the signifying processes of Coleridge’s text. Instead of choosing to adopt a Coleridgean
            hopefulness or to pledge generosity toward an absent friend, Barrett Browning creates
            an anxious and uncanny encounter with the cause of the friend’s desire—one that has
            repetition built into its very premise and premises, so that it does not need to wait
            for repetition to be generated out of the work of metonymy and symbol. In so doing,
            Barrett Browning registers Romantic poetry as a discourse both alien to the subject
            and internal to it, an ambiguity that registers in Aurora as an unnamable site of
            anxiety. The ambiguity leaves Romanticism vulnerable to its future, which here never
            stops being written.</p>
