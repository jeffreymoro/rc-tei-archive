            <p>This essay argues that Beau Brummell’s reign as Regency dandy illustrates the pathological
               arc of a psychotic in the making. His celebrated eccentricities performatively enact
               the larger cultural psychosis of a period without a king, and therefore without a
               clear relation to the symbolic function of the paternal metaphor and “the Law.” Brummell’s
               signature acts of defying the prohibitive Law, whether this is the law of social hierarchy
               or the laws of polite behavior, perform the defacement of the walls and blocks that
               which the patriarchal Ssymbolic erects around the subject. Because the psychotic has
               a fractured relation to language through the foreclosure of the Ssymbolic, walls can
               be recoded, or repurposed, or ignored. Brummell used walls to constrain his unstable
               subject status by way of the tightly corseted figure he cultivated, in this manner
               imitating the “normal” neurotic subject but without heeding normal social constrainsconstraints.
               Once psychosis became the revealed temper of his narrative arc, he substituted cell
               walls for sartorial ones, effectively busting out of bodily constraints that could
               no longer contain his self-authored myth.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">“Pissing on Walls: Beau Brummell, or Romantic Psychosis Writ Large”</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Psychosis as an illness, as like schizophrenia, causes pain, terror, disruption, isolation.
               But used in the adjectival sense to describe a society at its limits, the terms <span style="font-style:italic">psychosis</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">psychotic</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic">schizoid</span> can yield thoughtful insights into cultural phenomena. It is in this sense that I
               will pursue the question of Romantic psychosis as embodied in the story of Beau Brummell’s
               ascendency and exile. If Deleuze and Guattari appear to spectacularize psychosis as
               the unveiled expression of capitalism in its essential character, Lacan brings us
               back to the psychic mechanisms that permit, enable, and structure psychotic cultural
               events. Indeed, Lacan’s presentation of psychosis makes it appear to be <span style="font-style:italic">the</span>representative psychic state of twentieth-century society through his discussion of
               the ego’s normal functioning as hallucinative, much in the same way as Freud presented
               neurosis as representatively Victorian.</p>
            <p>Psychosis understood in this sense, as I will undertake to trace its psychic and social
               lineaments in my telling of Beau Brummell’s Regency embodiment, reveals a great deal
               about Romantic-era romantic culture that might entice us to redirect our gaze away
               from Jane Austen’s saner presentation of that period, and toward its zanier, and therefore
               more revelatory, episodes. These episodes hold startling resemblance to the screwier,
               nearly incomprehensible, and psychotic episodes of today’s world of media grabs, self-authorizing
               gestures, and power snatchesgrabs, which can be viewed as echoing Brummell’s capacity
               to center social attention on his visual image. Brummell’s rise to power and meteoric
               fall represent an instability that, accompanied by a disintegration of personality
               and language, feels uncomfortably familiar in terms of today’s political stage. If
               there are no lessons here for us to learn, there are at least warning signs we might
               do well to register.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>An intimate of the Prince Regent and Mrs. Fitzherbert, George Bryan Brummell seemed
                  to purposely escalate the friction he began experiencing in Carlton House toward the
                  end of his intimacy with the Prince, which appeared in tandem with the Regent’s abandonment
                  of his Whig friends. Various anecdotes were floated to account for the final disintegration
                  in 1811 of a friendship between Brummell and the heir to the throne that had begun
                  when in 1794 when Brummell was able to purchase a lowly commission in the Prince’s
                  Tenth Royal Hussars. Living always beyond his means was fundamental to Brummell’s
                  self-portrayal, much like Donald Trump’s career in real estate. He was virtually afloat,
                  living on wit and words, a parodic figuration of the nobility with whom he associated.
                  Finally, words were his undoing: whether it was, according to anecdotes, because he
                  said to Colonel McMahon of the Regent, “I made him what he is, and I can unmake him,”
                  or to because he asked Lord Alvanley “who’s your fat friend?”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)

                           society, Wits and Beaux of Society.</span></div>
                  </div> when the Regent didn’t acknowledge him, is irrelevant, however it happened, the cut
                  was made verbally, figuratively, and above all, it provoked the Regent’s most symbolic
                  counter-stroke. This signifier itself is the cut on the presymbolic Rreal, and remains
                  the cutting tool that bars or eclipses the subject: it is the signifier that the Other
                  cannot give but that cuts in all directions, especially across the ego-defenses of
                  the Imaginary. —iIn other words, the signifier “phallus.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>Thus, both the Prince, on assuming his royal identity as Regent, and Brummell together
               experienced a crisis, one in which social mask and subjective identity come into conflict.
               The Regent’s political and personal loyalties took a 180-degree turn on the assumption
               of symbolic power while Brummell’s carefully constructed social mask slipped, revealing
               disturbance in the disparity between appearance and reality, between the pretense
               toof havinge access to the phallus instead of the Prince, (or access to to have it)
               instead of the Prince, and the reality of not having it. As for any psychotic awaiting
               a triggering event for the psychopathology to emerge, this was a matter of hystericized
               self-rupture that would eventuate in a catastrophic undoing of Brummell’s fabulated
               person. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>However it transpired, Beau Brummell, dandy extraordinaire, came to a paradoxical
                  end: was he indeed ill, or simply invested in living out a self-mockery? Brummell’s
                  last years after his meteoritic fall from grace with the Prince Regent and then from
                  London society at large—a fall exasperated exacerbated by the concurrent evaporation
                  of his carefully amassed cultural capital, plus a gambling debt of thousands of pounds—was
                  spent in exile on the Continent to avoid debtor’s prison.

                  </div> After ten years, he gained a small and short-lived appointment at the British consulate
                  at Caen, but when that evaporated, he was forced into the Calais debtor’s prison and
                  eventually died of syphilis at age 61. Syphilitic destruction of the brain is a slow
                  process, and its symptoms closely resemble those of other mental disturbances; . in
                  In Brummell’s case, “unkempt” might best describe his physical appearance during his
                  decline, his dress a paradigmatic self-mockery;, but in the asylum in whichwhere he
                  died, he also was also said to live in a feces-bespattered room (revealing how the
                  fictitiousness of the his self-authoring personal hygiene during his ascendency),
                  and behaved generally in ways that signaled a loss of self-consciousness and a deep
                  disturbance in the symbolic register.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am interested in how such a disturbance opens up the constrictions of dandified
                  dress and a deeply self-conscious, performative life -practice to what lies beyond
                  such tight bodily delimiting. If Brummell at his height would not deign to eat common
                  vegetables, —hating cabbage in particular (too gaseous?), though claiming “yes, yes 
                  .  .  . ;  I once eat a pea —at his darkest moments that tight bodily control became
                  its opposite; finally the body is allowed to speak.

                           pea!” (163), revealing how Brummell’s wit is memorable but not rigidly bound to the
                           words themselves: ; rather, his witticisms are performance art, each a cut in the
                           imaginary-symbolic relation. </span></div>
                  </div> Finally, the body is allowed to speak, and It it speaks of its immersion in life processes
                  as if in protest against the purity regime it had so long endured. Busting out, as
                  it were, the body turns inside out, beyond the corseted confines of elegant profile.
                  The cut of scathing wit, drawing in return the most devastating cut of all, the publicly-enacted
                  castration that came with the absolute finality of the Prince Regent’s rejection of
                  Brummell, provides the reverse of a Lacanian <span style="font-style:italic">point de capiton</span>: an <span style="font-style:italic">un</span>quilting point, an <span style="font-style:italic">unbuttoning</span>, that instead of securing ego integration by the lodging of a signifier onto a signified,
                  initiates psychological disintegration. What had been mere phallic play is suddenly,
                  and uncannily, the thing itself, and Brummell didn’t have it. Brummell’s break with
                  reality, in my reading, traces back to this point when the Ssymbolic ruptures; slipping
                  from his self-appointed place in the symbolic network, he faces the writing on the
                  wall as social death.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The hallucinatory aspects of the high point of Brummell’s career, and his subsequent
               lowest point, reflect Lacan's theory of psychosis. Because Brummell’s most potent
               performances were at the verbal level through his witticisms, the verbal hallucinations
               that characterize psychosis are relevant here. —The their most important aspect of
               verbal hallucinations isbeing that they have the structure at the level of signifiers.
               Moreover, “what characterizes the hallucinatory satisfaction of desire is that it’s
               formed in the domain of signifiers and that, as such, it implies a locus of the Other”
               (Lacan, <span style="font-style:italic">Seminar V</span> 204–-5). The psychotic, as if fascinated by the foreclosed Ssymbolic, can’t stop
               fixing on signifiers that nevertheless remain without signification. In Brummell’s
               case, signifiers become mere playthings, witticisms whether verbal or material, and
               the place of the Other is unstable, unfixed. The cause for this coming unstuck, this
               unquilting, is that “the Name-of-the-Father [is unable] to respond from its place,
               which is where it is incapable of responding from because it has never come to that
               place. . .” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar V</span> 188). Instead, the structure of the mother’s “not” appears in its place; the phallus
               or paternal metaphor has never arrived. What could the Prince Regent have that Brummell
               did not have more of?, ?—that seems to have been the question. Whether the cutting
               remark or the thin, brittle dandy’s cane, Brummell wielded phallic playthings as if
               he didn’t know their force or their function.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I want to consider here Beau Brummell’s psychotic disintegration as emblematic of
                  Romantic radical openness, hallucinogenesis,

                  </div>, and the materiality of language. The phallic signifier seems to have come unstuck
                  for those living through the events and after-effects of the French Revolution when,
                  in Paris, phallic heads and paternal metaphors really did come unstuck. I am also
                  interested in the interstice between psychosis and solipsism run amok: radical solipsism
                  transitions into “a sense of senselessness” as Shelley depicts it in both <span style="font-style:italic">Alastor</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Laon and Cythna, </span>an alienation effect where the Iimaginary can no longer hold the Real at bay (Lacan, <span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span>, 113). At the height of his politico-social influence as the arbiter of taste, Brummell
                  was already self-estranged. His success depended on an economy of borrowing time and
                  credit, coming out of nowhere, resources self-created as much as particles emerge
                  from empty space by borrowing energy and cashing it in before the system notices and
                  reacts to the debts incurred.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)

                  </div> His career, built on daily acts of staged identity using borrowed energy and credit,
                  could stayed afloat for some years after the Prince Regent’s public rejection, but
                  finally the system noticed. With this crash, Brummell began his descent into an increasingly
                  variegated and delimited psychotic region that seemingly mirrored the largess and
                  splendor of his earlier success. The spectacular rise and fall of notable peoples
                  was a constant of the period, as Emma Hamilton’s career illustrates; it was also characteristic
                  of a period in which the instability of geopolitical alliances meant that nothing
                  was proof against incipient or, even looming disaster. Brummell’s extraordinary success
                  depended on grand gestures that had the effect of pissing on walls, defacing them,
                  and thus disfiguring the barriers that sustained rank as well as hierarchically inscribed
                  rules of politeness. Rule- smashers always deface what sustains civil life in order
                  to impose their own rules, and their own status-making machinery. (Trump’s behavior
                  has long exemplified this truth.)</p>
            </div>
            <p>Brummell’s loss of control over his status-making behaviors, concomitant with the
               wall the Regent raised against Brummell, resulted in diminished gestures that can
               be read as a staging of Romantic irony to an inversely small audience, or as a nod
               toward openness that moves into pure art as the thing itself: pissing on walls as
               materially revelatory, as the jouissance of writing. This too can be psychotic: in
               psychosis, the father does not intervene as law, and instead, “tThere is the raw intervention
               of the message ‘not’ upon the mother’s message to the child,” which “insofar as it
               is completely raw, is also the source of the code that lies beyond the mother” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar V</span> 188). Therefore, the schizoid’s relation to language is flattened, two dimensionaltwo-dimensional,
               just writing in effect. But writing that mystifies, that contains a new code. According
               to Lacan, the psychotic’s verbal hallucinations do indeed provide a new code that
               substitutes for the one beyond the mother: “The messages that he receives in the fundamental
               language, which are composed of words which  .  .  .  are always neologisms in their
               own way, consist in teaching the subject what they [the words] are in a new code,
               one that literally repeats a new world to him, a signifying universe” (188).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This new world is the biblical writing on the wall, as at Belshazzar's feast in chapter

                  that can be pissed on literally. A wall to be disgraced becomes a wall <span style="font-style:italic">of</span> disgrace, which that becomes Brummell’s expressive domain. Rather than the body being
                  so tightly confined that the neck cannot bend and sitting is difficult without splitting
                  one’s fine leather breeches, the body now becomes liberated into discourse, its viscera
                  and excretions the very stuff of expression and self-representations. The gGrace of
                  body and visage become disgrace and defacement. As Lacan notes, in psychosis where
                  verbal hallucinations have become typical, the “invasion of the world of objects by
                  the image of the body” is what the delusions manifest (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar V</span> 188). The expression must seem meaningful to productively continue, but as a semantic
                  field, bodily products are unstable signifiers. One wants an audience to endow the
                  expression with associative, figural, or performative coding. But in bodily signifiers,
                  meaningless-ness converges with the possibility for nonverbal expression, like dandy
                  couture and stylized body language. Though these are not without their message, they
                  must be received by the other to be authorized; when they are not (when the Name-of-the-Father
                  does not give the law, when it does not sit in its place), the un-symbolized “not”
                  stands in, but is unable to authorize. Without authority then, Brummell has free range,
                  for he is beyond rather than before the law, much like the Prince himself who, however,
                  is legitimately so as the nominal law-giver. Brummell’s writing at the end of his
                  life, his delusional messages, take the structure of the psychotic’s stutterings:
                  the interrupted messages are ones that “present themselves as pure messages, as orders,
                  or as interrupted orders,” that are message and code dissociated from each other (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar V </span> 188). This is the nonresolution of the father’s discourse, which should ratify message
                  and code, turning them into coherent discourse, ; but for Brummell, it is as ephemeral
                  and meaningless as his self-expressiveness in tight form was at the height of his
                  insubstantial and airy career, though not without message-less. The difference is
                  that in the aftermath of a psychotic break it is jouissance for an audience of one,
                  using the sinthome or symptom, which should hold everything together, to essentially
                  cheat the Ssymbolic is jouissance for an audience of one.</p>

               <p>My sense of the dandy, whether strutting metropolitan streets then or today, is that
                  this is a performance artist, a trickster, but one who is caught in the role because
                  due to a believing belief in both its elevatory power and its supererogatory requirements.
                  It requires both narcissism and not a little madness to be the exemplary dandy, the
                  sine qua non for a social elite to contain. The dandy is a transcendent factor when
                  viewed from this angle, embodying ascension over the body, over the social, over even
                  the smallest lapse. Taking every moment as a staging and every space as a performative
                  one, the dandy’s discriminating and discriminatory eye never rests. Turned ever on
                  the self, the dandy’s eye is equally brutal to others; if discernment creates categories
                  of the acceptable and inacceptableunacceptable, its judgments also create insurmountable
                  distances between the subject of scrutiny and who or whatever else occupies the surrounding
                  space.

                  requires and produces it. Brummell is both phallic power and its empty shell, both
                  manliness and its emasculated formality, a trump card in the social register. A system
                  that faces change can forestall it by playing one faction off against the other, —Brummell
                  against other social elites, —to create a tension and envy that sustains the harmony

            <p>Brummell, a self-constituted man of his time, fascinates because his story is timely.
               Mark Salber Phillips’s 2015 study <span style="font-style:italic">On Historical Distance</span> provides a conceptual mapping for the various ways we feel and treat historical distance,
               and I extend his thinking on this disciplinary imperative to include the ways in which
               we <span style="font-style:italic">do not</span> feel historical distance. Beau Brummell provokes the collapse of historical time,
               or perhaps it is a Mobius strip he makes apparent where several spots or nodes provide
               contiguities between his experiential moment and ours. I am not suggesting a naiïve
               assertion of equality between late-eighteenth and early twenty-first- century equality
               of historical realities, but rather that there is a recognizability in what Brummell
               produces, in so far as I seespecifically its efficacy, also at workis recognizable
               today in the effects of individuals who exert recognizably similar pressures and discriminations
               on our own society, and also that in so far as Brummell’s pathological behavior resembles
               the psychopathologies of these contemporary individuals whose constant presence in
               the historical compressions and contiguous points orient my thinking here.</p>
            <p>One more note on such historical and hystericized figures: hystericized in the self-dandification,
               as psychic tension registers itself symptomatically on the body. I am not using the
               psychoanalytic definition of hysteria here, in which the typically female subject
               displaces her desire onto another with whom she identifies and uses her self-alienation
               to push the envelope of knowledge, aggressively seeking to find the gaps in the Other’s
               knowledge. Brummell has no wish to know; he is hysterical in the sense of the dandy’s
               self-performance as teetering on the boundary between masculine and feminine, between
               agent and object, between gazer and object of the gaze. Despite his supposed rivalry
               with the Prince for women of their circle, it seems to me that Brummell evinces a
               playful sexuality that can go either way (I am phallically male; I am hysterically
               female), and in its play he displays an absolute security in his identity—unlike the
               phallically-construed man and woman who are always aware of their lack, and must mask
               it with a performance of masculinity and femininity. I am thinking specifically of
               The contemporary individuals contemporary to us whom I am thinking ofwho, unlike Brummell,
               are all clearly insecure about their masculinity unlike Brummell, but like him they
               do entertain the self-destructiveness of excessive discrimination of Brummell; in
               this they are dandy-esque. One attribute stands out for both of these historical and
               contemporary dandy-figuresdandy figures: they all strut, and they view as their most
               important attribution their capacity to piss on the world as their most important
               attribution. Because they identify this world as the space of their theatrical behavior,
               it exists as so many walls: —so many surfaces to deface, to write on with the detritus
               of the self; so many nondiscriminatory planes whose adequacy or inadequacy the dandy
               it takes upon himself to judge. His judgment is fatal but also whimsical; whimsy,
               it turns out, can be the most cutting edge, a veritable surgical knife wielded by
               one who self-identifies as superior to any of the medical or intellectual elite, for
               whom therefore reason is unreasonable to suppose.</p>
            <p>These several descriptive lines between the historical and contemporary dandy -figures
               converge in a twentieth-century figure of psychoanalytic note, Judge Daniel Schreber.
               I take the pathologies of Brummell and certain contemporary dandy-figuresdandy figures
               to be incipient psychoses, though this is a reading rather than (and (most emphatically)
               not) a diagnosis; . through Through Schreber’s account of his psychotic breakdown,
               I find significant contiguities or touching points with Brummell’s fall from power,
               and hovering behind both Brummell and Schreber are the contemporary presences (Trump
               is exemplary, but there are others) that both inform and haunt my cultural analysis.
               Haunting is important, since so much of psychotic experience occurs through hallucination.
               Because in psychosis the Iimaginary must also do the work of the Ssymbolic, what Lacan
               considers to be the ego’s normative hallucinations, those that guide our interpretations
               of reality, fall into crisis: things talk, words are written in the sky, other people
               become irrelevant or transform malevolently. Moreover, because the ego’s normative
               hallucinating is founded on the mirror stage, we might map Brummell’s self-transformation
               into the epitome of dandyism as one of an altered relation with the mirror stage:
               he is the narcissist whose self-mirroring has psychotic tendencies. Lacan says of
               the mirror stage and the gaze that we are eternally transfixed by the image as a necessary
               narcissism; , in narcissism which the libido can become attached to the ego in literal
               self-love. Indeed, Brummell is so transfixed he seems to find the world reflecting
               his image wherever he looks, so potent is his love. But his narcissism is more than
               neurotic; it loosely holds together a psychotic break about to happen.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For Judge Schreber, narcissism did not function this way; rather, Lacan notes “what
                  was repugnant to the said President’s narcissism was the adoption of a feminine position
                  towards his father, which involved castration. Here is someone who is supposed to
                  be better off obtaining satisfaction in a relation founded on a delusion of grandeur,
                  since castration can no longer affect him once his partner has become God”

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This is Lacan’s summary of Freud’s analysis of the case.</span></div>
                  </div> (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III </span>89). But, Lacan argues, “something has profoundly modified the object” or the other
                  to which Schreber’s libido is now attached (90). The usual aggressive aspect of libidinal
                  attachment to an other is here made impossible when it is the ultimate big Other,
                  God. The ego cannot control this relationship, which has gone beyond representational
                  limits. Lacan’s analysis drives inexorably through Seminar III to reach the conclusion,
                  never stated in so many words, that Schreber’s relationship to God, which famously
                  is as a handmaiden to the divinityDivinity, as well as a bearer of His future progeny,
                  is the result of anal rape. As a handmaiden, Schreber avoids the difficult question
                  of his homosexuality, but God inseminates him in that manner. The analogy I am drawing
                  between Brummell’s and Schreber’s cases forces the question: has Brummell been fucked
                  by the Regent, figuratively speaking? Inefficacious as prince, the Regent holds the
                  rod of power after all. His cutting of Brummell is a cut to the head, a designification
                  of Brummell’s sartorial phallus. For Schreber, God’s anal fuck renders the male body
                  indeterminate, both male <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> female. “Judge” is the paternal role that Schreber feels ill-equipped for, while the
                  dandy’s costume is a phallic rendering of male symbolic power at the same time that
                  it depicts the male body as immobilized, so tightly contained that sitting is difficult,
                  musculature discouraged, and movement in general constrained. Rendered passive by
                  the corseting uniform, the dandy parodies the real psychotic’s passivity enforced
                  by God. Confinement becomes the main descriptor of the dandy’s and the psychotic’s
                  physical space, the feminized space of non-movement. What Brummell was playing at,
                  Schreber experienced psychotically, but also in realityreally, insofar as the Real
                  and Iimaginary became confused and blurred for him. Brummell’s own play with sexuality,
                  space, and an either/or relation to the phallus—phallic having (as the masculine position)/phallic
                  being (as the feminine one)—after his rupturing castration by the Regent, soon becomes
                  his reality as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In psychosis, both the Real and the real become unglued and begin to interleave with
                  internal discourse. It is hard to tell where things stop and start, and nothing can
                  be anticipated; such unfathomability is the very opposite of Brummell’s tightly disciplined
                  regime, but it is very consonant with his whimsy. In a whimsical universe, trauma
                  and pleasure can recycle beyond signification; words begin to change form and function,
                  becoming something altogether other. So too, in psychosis, where the Ssymbolic cannot
                  organize signification, words are untethered from meaning-making signifying chains,
                  and instead appear, as they did for President Schreber, as streams of nonsense or
                  as divine but incomprehensible commands. Charles Shepherdson argues that the signal
                  move we must make is to “think <span style="font-style:italic">through </span>the ‘linguistic turn’—not to react against the formative power of representation,
                  but rather to think its <span style="font-style:italic">limits.</span>” (1).

                  </div> Schreber’s breakdown signals the limits of representation in a way that describes
                  the arc of language—its role in the structuring of the self, its flight at the transcendent
                  moment, its inefficacy for the disintegrating ego, and finally its memorializing function
                  in creating a narrative to account for this sequence of events. Such narratives attempt
                  to rationalize and thus obscure representational limits, which is why literary analysis
                  alone cannot frame and think through these limits. Brummell’s writing on the wall
                  must be taken into account as well.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Because Brummell’s representations are largely visual and performative, archived through
               the descriptive language of others such as William Hazlitt but not accounted for in
               language by Brummell himself, Schreber’s autobiographical account of his psychotic
               breakdown provides one speculative map through Brummell’s own, though rather different,
               order of breakdown. Nonetheless, it seems to me that his Brummell’s case provides
               an exemplary representation of the larger cultural “psychosis” at play during the
               period of the king’s madness, the Rregent’s whimsical behavior, and the unraveling
               of words and meanings that—not unlike our current recent politico-cultural situation—threatened
               cultural stability and continuity. It is the limits of this representation, of Brummell’s
               breakdown, that I want to push against and think through. Lacanian thought provides
               an itinerary through this terrain that exposes the stages of language’s psychotic
               arc and helps make sense of how reality constitutes itself differently depending on
               where a society is in its development from normative neurosis to a full-blown psychosis—which
               is how I view the Reign of Terror—in other words, those historical traumas whose legacy
               legacies reshapes subsequent realities such as the Holocaust, genocides against other
               nations, and similar crimes against humanity. Those legacies, the writing on walls,
               the shit that happens, reclaim the Ssymbolic as the register of order itself. In this
               way cultural psychosis is reabsorbed into the cultural Ssymbolic, patriarchally reinstalled
               as normal deviations within the mean of history. Lacan notes that “remembering necessarily
               takes place in the symbolic structure,” remembering being crucial to restorative justice,
               whereas in psychosis “an enormous meaning” emerges into reality, but it is one that
               is incomprehensible because “it cannot be tied to anything, since it has never entered
               into the system of symbolization—but under certain conditions it can threaten the
               entire edifice” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar III</span> 104, 85). The task for the posterities of historical trauma is to read the writing
               on the walls, and to restore the edifice differently so that it cannot be threatened
               again by “the nonsymbolized reappear[ing] in the real” (86). The task for those of
               us who are reading congruencies between the Romantic Period—particularly the Regency—and
               today’s political traumas, is to attend to this very wall-writing and its representations
               <span style="font-style:italic">in order</span> to attend to the work of a restoration grounded in first principles and in careful
               attention to the otherness that is without exception all of us.</p>
            <p>With that warning in mind, I want to turn to the more positive rendering of psychosis
               in Deleuze and Guattari’s treatment. Notwithstanding the criticism of their conception
               of psychosis as too liberationist, too unrealizable in a world of human manufacture,
               their anti-Oedipus offers a way to unpack Brummell’s story productively, furthering
               my argument concerning his as a test case for today’s psychotic state. </p>

               <p>If Beau Brummell’s figurative pissing on walls, transfigured in his decline literally
                  as the fluid expression of his discontent, can tell us anything, it is that the Oedipal
                  structures that Freud and Lacan find so consistent throughout human experience are
                  there to be resisted, parodied, mocked, and defiled <span style="font-style:italic">precisely in order</span> to reveal them and at the same time reinforce them. Psychoanalytic theory tells us
                  no less than this: Oedipal structuration both enables our self-definitions and describes
                  our essential lack or incompletion, our unmeetable need to be satisfied. Oedipus is
                  the myth in which we understand our compulsory dimorphism, inescapable familial dysfunction,
                  masculine aggression, feminine complicity, and patriarchy itself.

                           on his earlier explanations of being the phallus (female) versus having the phallus
                           (male), the two role-playing identificatory games men and women play.</span></div>
                  </div> This is never so clear as in a monarchy headed by a woman or, as for George III and
                  the Regent in his future role as George IV, a weak king. Lacan situates the phallus
                  as the primary locus of our dysfunction, even as it allows us to speak as subjects.
                  Nevertheless, because the phallus is in so many ways synonymous with language itself—our
                  subjectivity as structured and experienced through language, our sheer expressive
                  capacity, even to an extent our creative capacity—it enables us because it inducts
                  us into the Ssymbolic. The psychotic or schizo is positioned to do the end run around
                  the phallus rather than playing it straight precisely because the Ssymbolic is closed
                  off and unavailable in schizophrenia, unavailable. The paternal function or paternal
                  metaphor fails, and the subject is never alienated from him- or herself in the way
                  that language use both structures and depends upon. Instead, language for the psychotic
                  is flat, becoming a code to which one has partial clues but no mastery, or a game
                  at which winning and losing are mere gambits, and inconsequential. The first example
                  describes Judge Schreber’s schizoid episodes, whereas the second describes Brummell’s.</p>
            </div>
            <p>I draw some of my insight into Brummell’s situation from Deleuze and Guattari’s <span style="font-style:italic">Anti-Oedipus: Schizophrenia and Capitalism</span>, because of the authors’ heavy emphasis on the role of schizophrenia in unveiling
               Oedipal structures as retrofits. They argue that these are structures Freud and Lacan
               sutured onto capitalist society in order to explain societal/familial roles in subjective
               identity and experience. Not only is psychosis/schizophrenia the mind-body state that
               sees Oedipus to beas fictional, thereby unseating the psychoanalytic reinforcing reinforcement
               of patriarchal power as essential and inescapable, but capitalism itself is a schizophrenic
               economy, an economy at its limits. Who better to realize its anti-Oedipal energies
               than the schizo? Redrawing the lines of this argument, I ask, who better than Brummell
               to unveil the schizoid energies of the Regency, with its runaway lust for material
               goods and experiences that we need not , as we tend to do, categorize as sheer consumerism.
               In fact, for the bon ton as Brummell embodied it, materialism was not to be accumulated,
               for dispersal was as important as acquisition. Whereas in the earlier part of the
               Romantic period gambling was an aristocrat’s game, for Regency high society gambling
               became the exemplary metonymic for capitalism’s randomness effects: incomes and outflows
               mediated by the game. For Deleuze and Guattari, the flows are the circulation of energies
               that Oedipus attempts to harness and disrupt. But flows are essential to the body,
               whether the human body-machine or the social body, the “body without organs."</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>These flows are what transform body-machines into desiring-machines. The baby doesn’t
                  experience itself as having a body (which only happens once one views “wholeness”
                  in a mirror); instead, the infant has a mouth-breast- machine, and a mouth without
                  the mother’s breast that is a desiring- machine wanting what it lacks. Body-machines
                  are always only partial objects (at this moment, I consist of a foot that hurts and
                  typing hands; I am a foot-shoe- machine and finger-keyboard- machine). Within the
                  context of body-machines, the gaze, that most Lacanian of concepts, is inconsequential.
                  What I see—the words unfolding, the world as constituted by my surroundings—is not
                  the gaze (for Lacan, it is the projections of my hallucinating ego), but nor am I
                  constituting myself by it. The gaze, following <span style="font-style:italic">Anti-Oedipus</span> is a psychoanalytic myth overly valorized by film theory (or even misunderstood, as
                  Joan Copjec argues). These partial objects to which I am attached, then detached in
                  my coupling and uncoupling of body-thing- machines, are productions of the Real or
                  the unconscious, and they return in my dreams in various ways. I am therefore the
                  product of my machinations alone, my desiring flows, attachments, disjunctions, conjunctions,
                  and blockages. Blockages are provided by the socius, the social field with its players
                  constrained by hierarchies and filiations, but not by Oedipus unless I believe in
                  him. Blockages keep our desires in check, and ensure that we continue to feel inadequate,
                  lacking, and in search of that which will complete us: the Lacanian “barred Other,”
                  that which is prohibited under castration as the Oedipalized mother herself.

                           but the position of “mother.”</span></div>
                  </div> But Deleuze and Guattari argue that when schizophrenized, both the sociohistorical
                  and the individual unconscious can be seen to belong to desiring- machines, not to
                  the mythical and nonexistent Oedipus.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Brummell excelled in producing himself as an elaborate corpus of connected body-machines,
               one that mimed a standing, walking phallus whose power is parodied and revealed as
               no-power through his slender cane, the ineffectual walking stick that supports and,
               although sword-like, wounds no one. His body, then, was a giant desiring- machine
               that mocked and unveiled the glaring lack in Oedipus’s power of the gaze. “Gaze on
               me,” his body demanded, “desire me; you can’t have me—I’m not the mother!! I’m not
               even the father, look at my tiny stick!” Brummell was no revolutionary; his status
               as an idiosyncrat makes him exemplary of the Regency rather than its resistor, parodist,
               or delinquent son as was Byron. Brummell’s parodic self-as-art-object only reinforces
               the Regency’s claims on a power that needed to be reinstalled in the monarchy. His
               infamous cutting remark to the Regent that, according to him caused his downfall,
               invited the Regent’s “off with his head” castration that thereby restored to the Prince
               his sovereign power. No longer Brummell’s second, the Prince comes into his own as
               the phallic father whose castrating function restores order to a socius endangered
               by desiring- machines run amuck. After the Prince’s dismissive gesture, no one desired
               Brummell; his flows were effectively, catastrophically blocked. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We might not know, despite Brummell’s superficiality, that he was no revolutionary,
                  since he so effectively shepherded group fantasy. As Deleuze and Guattari argue, group
                  fantasy is revolutionary whereas individual fantasy is merely Oedipalization and castration.
                  But the group fantasy involving Brummell was a dalliance in the vein of the Parisian
                  aristocracy’s guillotining parties at which a black humor reigned, women famously
                  wearing red ribbons around their necks in anticipation of their beheading. Brummell’s
                  admirers, as didlike these self-mocking Parisians, belonged to the gambling crowd.
                  They were men and women who squandered fortunes just as they squandered clothes and
                  food at their extravagant feasts in rituals of schizophrenic enactment that ironically
                  restored equilibrium to the socius (Deleuze and Guattari 150). But neither individual
                  nor group fantasy can be revolutionary unless the group fantasy is sufficiently motivated
                  to disrupt the socius by either the individual (Trump) or group hallucination (Trump’s
                  supporters). Even thenin that case, as for the French revolutionists, disruption inevitably
                  leads to the restoration of the socius in its normative configuration. What is revolutionary
                  is desire, for desire is anti-Oedipal. Freud says no less; desire wants what it wants,
                  though as Lacan explains, it is produced in and through language, whose messages can
                  never actually articulate the prohibited desire for the m(Other). But normatively,
                  desiring production—as in body- machines that are desiring- machines—is social production.
                  These two productivities, desiring production and social production, have different
                  regimes, however, and so contest each other: one requires flows, the other actively
                  blocks flows. But they work together as antagonistic antipodes that make a systemic
                  whole. At the height of his career, Brummell facilitated flows, encouraging desiring
                  production to run rampant. Few blocks were put on his construction of an alternate
                  body -without -organs, his walking phallus, a body on which group desire was inscribed.
                  As his dry witticisms demonstrate, what Brummell most epitomized was a kind of cultural
                  complaint; a signifying chain in which the headless state is a symptom of a futureless
                  future (much like Trump’s disastrous claims against tomorrow with his denial of climate
                  changedenial, COVID- 19 denial, denial of journalistic professionalism, denial and
                  even of words as meaningful). Complaint, Aaron Schuster claims, is “the very essence
                  of desire” which “finds fault with whatever is in order to persist as desire.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> With Brummell, desire (and complaint) got out of hand; Romantic psychosis reveals
                  itself in the group fantasy that is uninhibited by the Ssymbolic, resistantly desiring
                  and unwilling to be reined in by Oedipus. This kind of revolution is mere rebellion;
                  it does not lead to change but neither does it lead to redemption and reabsorption
                  by the Law and the reign of the Name-of-the-Father. Non-reformist, it instead causes
                  chaotic and random events, a game of chance by which society gambles with its future.
                  The same could be said of our own capacity to view chaos and random whimsy as a new
                  version of probability theory; so too do we gamble with our future.</p>
            </div>
            <p>At his height, Brummell described perfectly a capitalist society at its limits. Deleuze
               and Guattari make the problematic clear: “Neurotic territoriality of Oedipus, perverse
               territoriality of the artifice [artwork], psychotic territoriality of the body without
               organs.” (136). Developing this thought further, they write,</p>
            <p>The relationships of neurosis, psychosis, and also perversion depend on the situation
               of each one with regard to the process, and on the manner in which each one represents
               a mode of interruption of the process, a residual bit of ground to which one still
               clings so as not to be carried off by the deterritorialized flows of desire.  .  . 
               .  sometimes the process is caught in the trap and made to turn about within the triangle,
               sometimes it takes itself as an end-in-itself.  .  .  .  Each of these forms has schizophrenia
               as a foundation; schizophrenia as a process is the only universal. (136)</p>
            <p>I want to draw attention to what happens when the process of flows and blocks is interrupted:
               the process can take “itself as an end-in-itself” or it can get “caught in the trap
               and made to turn about within the triangle.” Certainly, Brummell’s perverse body art
               was always in danger of being carried off by the flows of desire; that in itself is
               a strong rationale for his excessively straightening costume that barely allowed movement,
               and his express rejection of desire, particular of the alimentary kind of which the
               Regent was so fond. But when it took itself as an end-in-itself—when both the flows
               of desire that his body art suggestively emitted and the straightening costume become
               a closed circuit, —then his desire turns turned inward, thus fending off, —quite perversely,
               —the socius. His body -without - organs becomes the entire world for him; free of
               familial repression, desiring production is all the social production he finds necessary.
               This is Brummell at his most self-infatuated height. But entrapment reverses this
               situation; once caught in the trap of Oedipus (daddy-mommy-me), the process is “made
               to turn about within the triangle”—not the Oedipal one, but the neurosis-perversion-psychosis
               one (Deleuze and Guattari 136). One turn of the dial, perversion into psychosis, artist
               into schizo, and back to neurotic. Neurosis makes one subject all over again to Oedipal
               castration and the “I,” as a walking incompletion, an I-lack. This was Brummell’s
               fate, to be Oedipalized all over again. </p>
            <p>I want to suggest that it drove him over the wall in a move characteristic of the
               Romantic socius generally, due to its psychotic condition of the missing phallus (a
               mad king, and a Regent incapacitated by Parliament), the non-signifying Ssymbolic,
               and surplus jouissance (rampant desire played out in bizarre feasts and extravaganzas).
               Each of the ways the process can be interrupted “has schizophrenia as a foundation:
               ; <span style="font-style:italic">schizophrenia as a process is the only universal.</span> Schizophrenia is at once the wall, the breaking through this wall, and the failures
               of this breakthrough” (Deleuze and Guattari 136; emphasis mineadded). It is the pissing
               on walls that is Brummell’s metaphorical signature. His acting out at once describes
               the wall, suggests its defacing and breaking, and anticipates his own failure to be
               other than contained by it. Just a joke after all, this little jest.</p>
            <p>The jest is, of course, a mocking of what the master (both George the III and the
               Regent) knows and can say (the one mad, the other merely playing at royalty). Even
               the child, Lacan says, knows that the master or father “is he who knows nothing about
               truth” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar XVII </span>130). And this is because desire, expressed as jouissance, “separates the master signifier 
               .  .  .  from knowledge qua truth." With knowledge separated from truth, it is hard
               to know what the truth is, and harder to know what desire will lead to. Things were
               complicated by the Regent’s serious version of Brummell’s mockery; his dandified dress,
               and imitation of Brummell’s performative behavior. Where Brummell only pretended to
               be challenging the Regent’s socio-hegemonic power, the Regent certainly desired his
               own father’s death: George III was not only old and made, and his heir was growing
               older while playacting childishly, the throne continuing to elude him. The death of
               the father, or rather the desire for it, brings jouissance, —the very jouissance that
               is prohibited as desire for the (m)Other. In the Regent’s case, the prohibited mother—Mrs.
               Fitzherbert—is already his, albeit clandestinely. The jouissance he desires upon the
               father’s death might more properly be Mother England herself (as Lacan notes, “To
               be sure, it’s through murdering the father that Oedipus finds free access to Jocasta,
               and that this is granted to him, to popular acclaim,” [<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar XVII </span>117]). The Regent looks forward to his ascension to popular acclaim; importantly,
               he will insist that his wife Caroline be prohibited from the ceremony. The prohibition,
               then, was not against desiring the m(Other), but of the woman herself as impossible.</p>
            <p>But there is more to the death of the father than either Brummell’s jesting or the
               Regent’s real desire. Killing the father, however metaphorically, occurs because the
               subject “absolutely want[s] to know the truth.  .  .  .  It is not possible seriously
               to examine the Freudian reference without bringing the dimension of truth to bear,
               along with murder and <span style="font-style:italic">jouissance</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar XVII </span>117). Yet the subject never knows what he wants to know. Moreover, the subject doesn’t
               know what he/she desires, but as Deleuze and Guattari suggest, <span style="font-style:italic">desire knows what it wants,</span> and the key to understanding desire is not knowledge but truth, or rather, “the schiz
               and not the signifier” (Deleuze and Guattari 137), psychosis and not neurosis. Still,
               neurosis is where both Brummell and the Regent reside, playing with psychosis as a
               gambit just as the Regency itself was a play of life, a comedy with intermittent serio-tragical
               scenes. If the phallus is coordinated with knowledge, jouissance is the only path
               to truth. But did either Brummell or the Regent want truth? What is more evident is
               that Brummell’s process of desiring flows and regulating blockages reached an apex
               where it became stuck in the trap of his self-enclosed circuit, refusing both jouissance
               and the truth. This denial, this end-in-itself, precipitated the event of the Regent’s
               cut, the re-castration that fully reasserts the Oedipal myth and loses Brummell his
               head (metaphorically speaking). To be castrated once is to enter into the realm of
               the master (the son will be the father); to be re-castrated is altogether another
               matter. At that moment, the master signifier, the phallus as Regent who is playing
               the big Other at this moment of the decapitation, not only reigns through the signifier,
               and but in re-Oedipalizing Brummell, pushes him through the wall, the limit of capitalist
               society. There is truth in this. Pushed into an outright schizophrenia instead of
               a play-enactment of it, Brummell’s world does indeed lose its symbolically signifying
               capacity to make meaning, as well as any justifying and self-justifying legislative
               function. Jouissance, the desire that is prohibited by the father (the wall itself),
               loses all meaning in the schizoid world of exile, but truth reigns supreme. As Lacan
               notes, “truth is the little sister of <span style="font-style:italic">jouissance</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar XVII </span>116).</p>
            <p>Lacan as well as Deleuze and Guattari push at the borders of what jouissance, especially
               surplus jouissance, can do when unregulated. Language is, of course, the regulator
               par excellence, since it transmits the Ssymbolic and the law,; but it is also inefficient:.
               “Language, including the language of the master, cannot be anything other than a demand,
               a demand that fails” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar XVII </span>124). Perhaps this is why Brummell’s trademark had been spare witticisms, le mot juste,
               or the cutting look that was not “the gaze” but rather a not-saying all the more hurtful.
               Like the witticism, the silent cut enhances the failure of the other’s demand by reducing
               and reifying it as an artful product that showcases negation, an inconsequential gesture
               that ruins reputations, or that renders another socially invisible. A deadly serious
               game in which language’s demand and failure are unveiled and derailed. Only in this
               way can patriarchal power be challenged, mocked, toyed with, and – —after all, it
               was only a joke – —reinstated. Not revolutionary, merely the acting out that justifies
               and helps regulate the ordering regime: the necessary symptom that binds society together.</p>
            <p>The master’s intervention in language is to produce the master signifier; in anti-Oedipal
               terms, it is to inaugurate blockage of the desiring flows. This is a pre-productive
               production, one that gets the desiring economy going. The master signifier—“the subject”
               as an empty signifier, or “the phallus,” both of which are empty in that they are
               not tied to a literal body (the “I”) or a literal partial object (the penis)—says
               nothing but gets everything going. Brummell’s witticisms and cutting remarks, his
               quizzing, function similarly as parodic versions of the master signifier’s legislative
               function. To parody the phallus’s role in language is both to unseat its mastery (the
               Regent is no king) and to reinstate it (<span style="font-style:italic">my</span> friend the Regent, whom I authorize with my pretend “stick”). The subject is a self-produced
               parodic art object, the phallus is a sham artifice. Brummell has dewigsged the signifier
               rather than unseatsed it, revealing the master/Regent to be just a body-tool after
               all.</p>
            <p>None of this bothered the Regent; he was, to the contrary, as drawn to this performative
               play as were Brummell’s other dandy acolytes. It was hardly his sexuality that the
               Regent felt Brummell was challenging during the famous incident of the cut. Indeed,
               the major insight I draw from Lacan’s <span style="font-style:italic">Seminar XX</span> is that there is no such thing as woman (in <span style="font-style:italic">Seminar XVII </span> Lacan has already noted that “there is no sexual relation,” [116]). Neither the Regent
               nor Brummell were sparring over a woman, or even the m(other), but rather the right
               to castrate another, to keep another man in his place. Perhaps until this point of
               rupture, and Brummell’s fall into a full-fledged psychosis, it is reasonable that,
               given the unpredictability and arbitrariness of the second half of the Romantic period,
               that both the Regent and Brummell took it upon themselves to occupy all the positions,
               male and female, brothers as daddy-mommy-me encapsulated in one body, and many personas.
               The Regent played these out in resplendent detail, designing outlandish and feminizing
               outfits for himself, crying in public at theatrical productions and in private over
               lovers. Even his clandestine relationship with Mrs. Fitzherbert might be seen as that
               of a son who desiring desires his mother (she was six years his senior), rather than
               a husband. If Brummell was more restrained in his sexual personae, merely the ambiguity
               of his dandy costume was enough to suggest multiple sexualities at play. Indeed, Brummell’s
               dandyism is predicated on an androcentric universe; women are there for sexual dalliance,
               but they are not objects of desire in the usual sense. Whereas the Regent took his
               Romantic psychosis—his schizophrenic selves—rather seriously, he also escaped it when,
               in cutting Brummell, he restored himself to the paternal function, the patriarch who
               excludes the woman and the feminine. Brummell, on the other hand, because he did not
               take his psychosis seriously, but instead played at it with all his might, fell more
               deeply into the schizoid state after his fall from power. What had been mere play
               became his Real projected onto the real in an all too literalizing way. If Schreber,
               the historically true psychotic, merely hallucinated, Brummell discovered his projections
               were all too real: the poverty that was itself a parody of his former riches, the
               filthy body that was the Real informing his pristine dandified self.</p>
            <p>There is one idea Lacan raises one idea in <span style="font-style:italic">Seminar XVII</span> that can shed some light on the game Brummell thought he was playing during his ascendency.
               It is what Lacan calls “the double agent.” This returns us to the problem of sexuality,
               of occupying all the positions in the assumption that the woman is impossible, a non-player.
               Deleuze and Guattari's The three impasses of the process of desire -blockage (“sometimes
               the process is caught in the trap and made to turn about within the triangle, sometimes
               it takes itself as an end-in-itself, other times it continues on in the void and substitutes
               a horrible exasperation for its fulfillment,” [Deleuze and Guattari 136]) are all
               ones Brummell played to the limit. Even his witticisms evince exasperation for having
               got the prestige and wealth he gambled for. But playing at these impasses, pretending
               to be stymied and trapped, can be read in terms of the double agent. This is someone
               who “starts again” because he “doesn’t just want the master’s little market,” Lacan
               remarks (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar XVII </span>126). He thinks he is in contact with “everything that has true worth, I mean in the
               order of <span style="font-style:italic">jouissance</span>,” which he also thinks “has nothing to do with the web of intrigues,” or the entrapments
               that create impasses. The double agent thinks that everything that has to do with
               jouissance “would also have to be arranged." Brummell is the master of such arrangement,
               of such tight control, for the double agent is one who “conserves." But why? Lacan
               offers a clue: “Because if that is true [if jouissance has to be arranged and, conserved],
               the arrangement is going to become true, and by the same token the first arrangement,
               the one that was obviously fake, will also become true." That is, the double agent
               takes the Oedipal myth—the master’s game (his “little market”)—and attempts to unmask
               it as <span style="font-style:italic">mere</span> myth through the valorization of the schizo’s tool, jouissance or desiring flows.
               What was obviously fake—the Regent’s political and legislative power, Brummell’s playacting,
               Regency feasts and spectacles spectacles—“will also become true” once the double agent
               has revealed the artifice of the master game. Yet if desiring flows are true, but
               so are blockages and repression: one is what is true, the other what legislates truth.
               In trying to make things true that were myth, Brummell’s playacting is real (‘(“no,
               I really meant it after all’all”). His witty repostes <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> truths, even if they are also harbingers of his exile years where saying truths has
               no market value and jouissance translates into the unsayable.</p>
            <p>The one who reveals Brummell’s truths as such, —where the desiring flows and the belief
               that such flows can be artistically and politically arranged, and yet the legislative
               blockages are also true—that one is the Regent’s legal wife, Caroline. It is sShe
               who is both fake (the Regent was already married to Mrs. Fitzherbert, albeit illicitly)
               and mythic (Princess Caroline, beloved of the people yet hated by her husband). She
               has no verities at all, no access to truth. She is not only <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> the Oedipal mother (she is the antithesis, the undesirable, the unprohibited).; Sshe
               is made to disappear from the Regent’s world. And yet, despite in her antithetical
               role that helped prove Brummell’s truths to be true (he is both the wall-defacer and
               its proof as limit), Caroline evinces a jouissance of her own. In the all-male theatre
               of her husband’s world, in which woman is denied and unsayable, Caroline found a way
               to speak her desire. Lacan notes that “the mother’s role is the mother’s desire” (<span style="font-style:italic">Seminar XVII,</span> 112). That desire in Oedipal terms is directed at the son and the husband; Caroline
               had neither—. Eeven her daughter was alienated from her; . Iin such a case the mother’s
               desire might depart from the Oedipal scheme, for Caroline has been un-mothered, un(m)othered,
               and so un-othered. Outside Oedipus, she is only, but also exactly, a desiring-machine
               freed from the socius. Caroline spent her later years chasing her desire, indulging
               her appetite in ways that parodied her husband’s expanding girth and sexuality. She
               was prodigious, ridiculous, unappealing—. aAnd she didn’t care. Lost in her own world
               of jouissance without the Law, wasn’t perhaps she was the more successful schizo?
               . Having broken through the wall, she broke through the possibilities for Oedipal
               entrapment. She is the body without organs who transcribes on her surface the ravages
               of the Regency’s play with Oedipal myths, for as she aged, she became increasingly
               unappealing visually, the object of no one’s gaze, ; yet she was no self-parody. She
               only wore on her surface what she had become, perhaps even no longer divided as a
               subject, perhaps beyond such Oedipal restrictions.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have given Caroline little space in this argument,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">

                           </span></div>
                  </div> but she is a clear rebuke to the status of the impossible woman under Regency psychosis.
                  Unlike Brummell, whose end is equivocal (has he failed at the game or succeeded in
                  pursuing jouissance to the end?), she proves Deleuze and Guattari’s claim that it’s
                  “the schiz and not the signifier,” psychosis and not the phallus or the paternal function,
                  that are is the truth under capitalism. Freud thought everyone was neurotic unless
                  they had worse pathologies; Lacan begins to think everyone is actually psychotic.
                  Deleuze and Guattari think that everyone <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> be, and unless convinced otherwise by psychoanalysts, actually <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> psychotic. We are all schizes up against the limit. In the Romantic period, there
                  were two options to those rare individuals who recognized this truth of the capitalist
                  dilemma: play the schizo but deliberately, with gamesmanship, or be the schizo at
                  full jouissance. Brummell or Caroline. One is the dandy’s way, the other is perhaps
                  the way of the impossible woman, not allowed to speak under the law but pursing her
                  unauthorized, non-signifying desire just the same. There is a lesson there somewhere
                  for us today.</p>
