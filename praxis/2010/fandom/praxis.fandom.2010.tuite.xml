				<p rend="noCount">This essay investigates how the concept of fandom might make sense
					of a reading practice that emerged in the romantic period, the practice of
					visiting places associated with authors and their works in order to re-read
					their works in situ. Focussing on Lady Frances Shelley as a typical romantic
					literary tourist, the essay considers the ways in which she (and by extension
					others) produced new constructions of reading and the reader in response to the
					emergent figure of the romantic author. Shelley's various accounts of visiting
					romantic locales associated with Rousseau, Scott and Byron not only provides a
					conspectus of possible tourist-stances and practices but suggests that romantic
					readers strove to represent themselves on a footing not only of intimacy but of
					social equality with the author, re-establishing a sense of a coterie audience
					in the face of the realities of an increasingly heterogenous mass reading
					public.</p>

				</epigraph>
				<p>[The research and writing of this

					Council.]</p>
<div type="section">
				<p>So Henri Beyle recalls his
					introduction to Lord
						Byron in Milan in October
					1816 in the theatre of La Scala, in the box of Beyle's friend, Monsieur Ludovic de Br&#234;me:
					&#8220;I entered M. de Br&#234;me's box on my return from an excursion on Lake
					Como. I found that the gathering had a sort of solemn and awkward air: everybody
					was silent. I was listening to the music when M. de Br&#234;me said to me,
					indicating my neighbour, 'Monsieur Beyle, this is Lord
						Byron'.&#8221; (Lovell
					196) At this moment, Byron is freshly exiled and just arrived in Italy, trailing
					scandalous celebrity and the opening flourishes of &#8220;[t]he pageant of his
					bleeding heart&#8221; (Arnold,
						<title level="a">Stanzas</title>) that came with the separation from his
					wife, Annabella Milbanke, the ensuing public scandal, and the flight from
					England. After travelling via Switzerland, where he stayed with Percy Bysshe and
					Mary Shelley at Lake Geneva, Byron has been just over a week in Italy, where he was to live for
					the rest of his life. Beyle, also in exile, has been mainly in Milan since 1813, when he took leave from Napoleon's
					army after the retreat from Moscow, and where he would spend the next seven
					years. When they meet, Monsieur Beyle is still just Beyle, not yet 'Stendhal,' as he will soon become when he adopts this pseudonym for
					the first time as the author of <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence in
						1817</title> (1817), in which he will recount a different version of this
					first meeting with Byron&#8212;one of many, as it turns out, in private letters and
					published texts.</p>
				<p>While Monsieur Beyle is
					still Beyle, Lord Byron is for Beyle very much the author
					identified with his works: &#8220;At that time I was mad about <title level="m"
						>Lara</title>. From the second glance, I no longer saw Byron as he really was,
					but as I thought the author of <title level="m">Lara</title> should be&#8221;
						(Lovell 196). Here, Beyle registers both the
					power and the radical partiality that marks the gaze of the fan, in the form of
					this &#8220;second glance&#8221; and its prerogative to wilfully misread. Beyle's &#8220;second
					glance&#8221; enacts what D. A.
						Miller has referred to as the &#8220;Stendhalian eros [that] would
					seem to depend on love plots engendered from misjudgements and blind spots.
					Error, as it were, permits the narrateable movement of errantry (wandering,
					elapsing, delaying) in which finally comes to lie the erotic&#8221; (225).
					Indeed, Stendhal's fondness
					for irony means that he congenially <emph>throws</emph> such blind spots and
					errors to his correspondents and readers as though they were gifts. <note
						place="foot" resp="editors">Stendhal's generous capacity for error in relation to dates, for
						example, is registered in the letter to Colomb, where the meeting of October
						1816 is misremembered as occurring in &#8220;the autumn of 1812&#8221; (see
							Lovell 196), and in the
						famous misdating of the 1816 meeting that is included in <title level="m"
							>Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</title>. </note>
				</p>
				<p>This essay examines the love plots and errantry that proliferate in Stendhal's recollections of
					his meeting with Byron.
						Stendhal's work and
					life (and the intermediating code of &#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr"
						>beylisme</foreign>&#8221;) is associated most famously with &#8220;<foreign
						xml:lang="fr">la chasse au bonheur</foreign>&#8221; (&#8220;the pursuit of
					happiness&#8221;). As I wish to suggest, Stendhal's recollections of Byron are marked by the
					happy over-investment of affect that has come to be identified with fan
					practices. A significant feature of Stendhal's account of the meeting is that his emotion
					is produced after the event, in the act of recollection. The recollections
					embody, then, a typically Stendhalian concern with the fraught interrelation
					between desire and memory. For the historical figure of Henri Beyle has offered the
					consummate allegory of the distortions of memory, and of the contradictions
					between reason and feeling that memory dramatizes. In W. G. Sebald's historical fiction, <title level="a">
						Beyle, or Love is a
						Madness Most Discreet</title> (included in <title level="m"
					>Vertigo</title>), Beyle is
					made to offer &#8220;eloquent proof of the various difficulties entailed in the
					act of recollection&#8221; (Sebald
					5). Likewise, the fan Beyle
					who meets Byron embodies
					love as a madness most discreet: &#8220;if I had dared, I would have burst into
					tears and kissed Lord
						Byron's hand&#8221; (
						Lovell 196).</p>
				<p>In the first full-length biography of Stendhal, <title level="m">
						Henry Beyle (otherwise
						De Stendahl [sic]) A Critical and Biographical Study</title> (1874), Andrew Archibald Paton foregrounds such
					contradictions between reason and feeling as vital to his subject: &#8220;Beyle was a man of genius,
					but he had a hundred irresistible impulses which could not be squared with
					reason&#8221; (9). <note place="foot" resp="editors">
						Paton's biography
						displayed a certain contradictory charm itself, as Henry James noted in a review in the <title
							level="j">Nation</title> (17 September 1874): &#8220;It contains hardly
						an opinion which is not ludicrously erratic, and hardly a quotation, a
						foreign phrase, or a proper name which is not misspelled or misprinted. But
						the author writes with a garrulous <foreign xml:lang="fr">
							bonhomie</foreign> &#8212;that of an easy-going cosmopolite ...
						&#8212;which will soften the edge of the reader's displeasure; and he is to
						be thanked at any rate for bringing Beyle once more before the world&#8221; (James 187). </note> As I wish to
					suggest, it is precisely such &#8220;irresistible impulses&#8221; that make up
					the affective repertoire of fan culture. And nowhere are these impulses offered
					more readily than in these recollections by Stendhal, the master of memory and emotion. Stendhal's response to Byron is informed both
					impulsively and masterfully by a withholding or disguising of emotion. As Henry James wrote in his
						(<emph>un</emph>withholding and rather mixed) review of Paton's biography, Stendhal's work has
					&#8220;that singular something ... &#8212;a kind of painful tension of feeling
					under the disguise of the coolest and easiest style&#8221; (James 189). The beauty of the
					impulse, and its significance as a way of illuminating fan practices, is that it
					occupies a liminal position between the desire to act and the act itself. By
					narrowing the distinction between desire and act &#8212;as mere as &#8220;a wave
					of excitation in the nerve&#8221; (OED) or an &#8220;influence acting upon the
					mind&#8221; (Johnson 1: 954)
					&#8212;the category of the impulse enables a focus upon the mobility and
					changeability of desire. In this way, Stendhal's impulse to burst into tears and kiss Lord Byron's hand is both
					expressed and checked.</p>
				<p>The impulse is a very similar emotional creature to the sensation. Stendhal was a keen follower
					of the sensationalism of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">id&#233;ologues</foreign>
					&#8212; materialist philosophers and psychologists such as Condorect, Condillac,
					Tracy, and Stendhal's
					revered Cabanis, the physician and materialist philosopher from whom he borrowed
					his &#8220;woman's skin&#8221;: &#8220;I will borrow for an instant the language
					of Cabanis. I have too fine a skin, a woman's skin ...; I graze my fingers,
					which are very fine, for a trifle; in a word, the surface of my body is
					feminine&#8221; (Stendhal,
						<title level="m">Life</title> 120). Revolutionaries and Republicans with a
					total system that conceived of personal happiness as an effect of political
					liberty, the <foreign xml:lang="fr"> id&#233;ologues</foreign> disregarded the
					question of classical form when it came to literature and emphasized the effect
					of the literary work upon reason, sensibility and imagination &#8212;its status,
					in other words, as sensation.</p>
				<p>As I will argue in this essay, Stendhal's emphasis on sensation is also legible in relation to the
					forms of celebrity culture. Stendhal's recollections of Byron offer a different way of approaching the classic
					Stendhalian affective repertoire of sensation; the pursuit of happiness; the
						<foreign xml:lang="fr">mal du si&#232;cle</foreign>; and the intrigued and
					intriguing engagement with memory and love. I read Stendhal's recollections as
					the revelatory staging of a close encounter between celebrity and fan, and I
					argue that Stendhal's
					recollections suggest how practices of sensation can be understood as part of
					the affective routines of the fan that are such a vital part of celebrity
					culture. This essay explores, then, this constellation of interests in memory,
					sensation and love, by examining Stendhal's recollections of Byron in relation to the productivity and affectivity
					of the fan. Hence, my emphasis is primarily on the fan, Stendhal, rather than on the
					celebrity, Byron.
					Focusing on the meeting between Stendhal and Byron as a particular form of ritualized sociable encounter in the
					box at La Scala, I examine how Stendhal's recounting of this meeting enacts celebrity culture's
					transformation of stranger to intimate, and how the fan-celebrity relation
					between Stendhal and Byron is mediated both by
					the social materiality of place and by a shared devotion to another contemporary
					idol, Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
				<p>Stendhal's recollections
					come to us in various textual forms, and are produced over about fifteen years
					from 1817&#8212;1832, in private correspondence, autobiographical fragments and
					published texts (collected in Lovell 1954: 196-206). <note place="foot" resp="editors">
						Except where indicated, I take my primary quotations of Stendhal from <title

							Lovell (New York: Macmillan, 1954), 196-206. For readers who wish
						to consult directly the relevant published works by Stendhal (and by others

						Antoine-Augustin Renouard, 1824); <title level="m">
							<foreign xml:lang="fr">Souvenirs d'Egotisme</foreign></title>, the
						autobiographical fragment written in 1832 an first published in 1892. The
						letters to Louis Crozet (20 Oct. 1816) and Louise Belloc (24 Sept. 1824) are
						included in <title level="m">Correspondance</title>, ed. Henri Martineau and
						V. Del Litto, 3 vols. (Paris: Biblioth&#232;que de la Pl&#233;iade,
						1962-1968): to Crozet, I: 831-835 (letter no. 608); Belloc, II: 42-46
						(letter no. 771). The letter to Stendhal's cousin and executor, Romain Colomb (24
						August 1829), is included in <title level="m">
							<foreign xml:lang="fr">Correspondence In&#233;dite</foreign>
						</title> (Paris, 1855), II, 71. Prior to the meeting with Byron that is
						recounted in the letter to Crozet of October 20, Stendhal writes to Crozet
						over four letters (of 28 September; 30 Sept; 2 Oct; 16-17 October, and five
						if we include the letter of Oct 20 after the meeting, about Byron's significance
						for &#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">[l]e syst&#233;me
						romantique</foreign>&#8221; (827) and &#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">les

						Jeffrey, Romanticism and the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> (See
							<title level="m">Correspondance</title>, I: 818-835). For an analysis,
						see Wu 2007. Of particular
						interest here in regard to sensation and celebrity is the discussion of
						Jeffrey on contemporary poetry's &#8220;pursuit of her new idol of strong
						emotion&#8221;. </note> With the exception of <title level="m">Rome, Naples
						and Florence in 1817</title> (1817), all of these accounts take their place
					within the flood of published recollections that appear in the wake of Byron's death in April
					1824. These comprise the new genres of the &#8220;conversations of Byron&#8221; and
					&#8220;recollections of Byron,&#8221; which included recollections by such figures as Thomas
					Medwin, Lady Blessington, John Galt, Thomas Moore and, some time later, Teresa
					Guiccioli. Stendhal's
					recollections, like those of almost everyone else, did not go uncontested. In
					particular, John Cam Hobhouse,
						Byron's closest
					friend and executor, who accompanied Byron during these encounters in Milan, described Stendhal's eye-witness account, <title level="a">
						<foreign xml:lang="fr">
							Lord Byron en
							Italie, r&#233;cit d'un t&#233;moin oculaire</foreign>
					</title> (1830), as &#8220;a tissue of fictions.&#8221; <note place="foot"
						resp="editors">
						Hobhouse is quoted from an
						undated MS in the John Murray archive in Doris Langley Moore's <title level="m">The Late
								Lord Byron:
							Posthumous Dramas</title> (372). See Moore, Chapter XI, &#8220;An Imaginative
						Frenchman,&#8221; 372-95. Moore's highly unsympathetic account of Stendhal takes its cues
						from Hobhouse and reads
							Stendhal's
						recollections as &#8220;published exploitation&#8221; (374). For an analysis
						of Hobhouse and Moore, see Jonathan Keates's biography
							<title level="m">
							Stendhal
						</title> (186-94). Keates
						traces the chronology of textual production of the different versions of the
						meeting, and claims that &#8220;[t]here is no hard evidence ... with which
						to catch Stendhal in
						quite so blatant an act as that of faking Byron&#8221; (190). For his part, Byron wrote to thank
							Stendhal for the
						praise he received in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence</title>:
						&#8220;Sir, At present, [now?] that I know to whom I am indebted for a very
						flattering mention in the 'Rome, Naples, and Florence in 1817, by Mons.
							Stendhal,' it is
						fit that I should return my thanks ... to Mons. Beyle, with whom I had
						the honour of being acquainted in Milan in 1816.&#8221; (Genoa, May 29, 1823, <title level="j"
							>BLJ</title> 10: 189) Byron also took the opportunity to defend Walter Scott against the attack
							Stendhal had made
						on him in the same work.</note> (Not that Stendhal was backward in coming forward to challenge
					other Byron
					recollections. As he wrote of <title level="a">Le Moore</title>: &#8220;<foreign

						[Stendhal, <title
						level="m">Correspondance</title> II: 175]). In this essay, deciding the
					veracity of Stendhal's
					memories in relation to the historical record is not my concern. I happily and
					knowingly read these recollections of Stendhal very much as 
						Stendhal's versions of Byron and not as literal
					transcriptions of Byron's conversations. I am interested rather in the significance of
					these memories as participants within a new culture of celebrity encounter, and
					seek to engage their productive and necessarily inventive power.</p></div>
				<div>
					<head>II.</head>
					<p>The meeting between  
							Stendhal and 
							Byron was destined to be: a match made in heaven on account of
						worldliness, a shared love of Napoleon, a keen interest in the fraught pains
						and pleasures of amorous memory, and in sensation. Sensation, after all, is
						what Stendhal found in
						the poetry of Byron:
						&#8220;Since my first childhood imaginings, I have found a sensation,
						comparable by its immensity and its tenacity, triumphing over all other
						memories, only in the poems of 
							Lord 
								Byron
						&#8221; ( 
							Stendhal
						<title level="m">Roman Journal</title>, 21). With this marvellous billow of
						ambiguity that attends the Romantic invocation of childhood, Stendhal suggests both
						that the sensation of 
							Byron's poetry is the only thing that compares with
						&#8220;childhood imaginings&#8221; <emph>and</emph> that even childhood
						itself could only imagine the &#8220;sensation&#8221; that Byron's poetry later
						realized. Here, the poems of 
							Lord Byron are not so much the secondary
						compensation for a lost childhood as the sensation that Stendhal has been
						searching for since childhood. 
							Byron's poetry is the long-lost discovery that
						transcends &#8220;childhood imaginings,&#8221; even as it is augured and
						desired through them. 
							Byron's poetry is the sensation that makes this precocious life
						worth the wait. In such a way,  
							Stendhal suggests, 
							Byron retrospectively creates his readers and
						authors their earliest and most precocious longings.</p>
					<p>As Stendhal eloquently
						elaborates, it is the sensation of the poetry itself, and not the moral or
						the truth it represents, which matters, and which so moved Byron's early readers,
						for better and worse. As a later reader, Matthew Arnold, wrote in one of his tributes
						written in that ambivalent moment of 
							Byron's re-evaluation that occurs around 1850: <quote>
							<lg type="stanza">
								<l rend="indent2"> He taught us nothing; but our soul</l>
								<l rend="indent2"> Has <emph>felt</emph> him like the thunder's
									roll.</l>
							</lg> (<title level="a">Memorial Verses, April 1850</title> 270)
						</quote> In this aptly sensational meteorological figure, Arnold suggests how
							&#8220;Byron's
						force&#8221; (272) licensed the deeply participatory reading practices that
						privileged the corporeal and emotional effects of the poetry upon the reader
						(&#8220;With shivering heart ... with reverential awe&#8221;). A privileged
						topos of celebrity culture is reading &#8212;private, transportable and what
							Jacques Ranci&#232;re
						terms &#8220;random&#8221; reading experiences (Ranci&#232;re 14), and the sensations that are
						affected through these reading experiences.</p>
					<p>The culture of celebrity that 
							Byron's poetry both authorizes and is expropriated
						by places a premium on sharing such readerly sensations with the author
						himself: &#8220;As I told him [
							Byron] this one day in Venice, quoting <title
							level="m">The Giaour</title>, he replied, 'That is why it is full of
						dotted lines. The moment the experience of the age of reason can attack one
						of my images, I abandon it, I don't want the reader to find the same
						sensations in my work as at the Stock Exchange'&#8221; (Stendhal, <title
							level="m">Roman Journal</title> 21). Here, as Byron is made to
						corroborate the fan's sensation, he produces a distinction between reason
						and sensation and adopts a characteristically anti-commercial stance.
						Ironically, these very sensations that 
							Byron identifies as constitutively opposed to the
						Stock Exchange are in fact dependant upon such commercial institutions. For
						it is only through highly-developed capitalist relations of production and
						consumption that the particular sensations of print culture and celebrity
						culture can be disseminated as the commodified cultural pleasures
						&#8220;full of dotted lines&#8221; that they are. <note place="foot"
							resp="editors"> On 
								Byron's relation to the commercial entailments of fame and
							celebrity culture, see Manning, Christensen and Mole. </note>
					</p>
					<p>Against the clich&#233;s of celebrity culture as gushy and excessive, Stendhal's meeting with
							Byron is marked
						primarily by &#8220;timidity&#8221; and suggests an encounter that is
						restrained, discreet and even courtly. Indeed, it is so restrained that
							Stendhal is
						rendered speechless: &#8220;Since the conversation had languished, M. de
						Br&#234;me sought to make me speak. This was impossible for me&#8221; (Lovell 196). But even in
						silence, there is clich&#233; and emotion and gushiness enough. For when
							Stendhal recovers
						himself sufficiently to be able to speak, he goes on to share with Byron &#8220;the
						finest conversation I have ever known in my life; a volcano of new ideas and
						generous sentiments, so mingled that one believed himself to be enjoying
						them for the very first time&#8221; (
							>Lovell 198). Recounting this moment of the social sublime, Stendhal subtly draws
						attention to the difference between illusion and reality, and between the
						past moment of high emotion and the present moment of sober recollection.
						However, he also suggests that this distinction is barely legible and, in
						the end, rather negligible. For the impulse of the passage is to catapult
						the speaker and the reader of the present moment of recollection back into
						the past as experienced.</p>
					<p>
						Stendhal's
						recollections of 
							Byron offer an abbreviated form of &#8220;the exact and
						scientific description of a brand of madness&#8221; that is produced in
							Stendhal's 1822
						work <title level="m">Love</title> (
							Stendhal, <title level="m">Love</title> 25). As
						with <title level="m">Love</title>, 
							Stendhal's recollections work to demonstrate the
						specificity of literary representation as distinct from scientific
						description, but they also show how nonetheless emotion can be imbricated
						with cognition. The cognitive literary critic Patricia Waugh has referred to the unique capacity
						of literature to &#8220;embody ... the problem of knowledge&#8221; by
						enabling the tension between the subjective and objective points of view to
						be experienced (Waugh 1999:
						51, 52). Stendhal's
						recollections do this too. By inhabiting, in the form of the recollection,
						both the first-person and third-person perspective, and thereby splitting
						the subject between present and past, they enable the tension between past
						and present to be experienced. This suggests an alternative way of
						approaching Stendhal's
						famous disrespect for chronology. Far from casually disregarding chronology,
							Stendhal was
						acutely aware of chronology as a rhetorical convention of narrative &#8212;
						indeed as a rhetorical effect of narrative &#8212;and displayed this
						awareness in direct addresses to the reader: &#8220;After all these
						observations, I will now be born&#8221; (21), he writes in his
						autobiography, <title level="m">The Life of Henri Brulard</title> (completed
						in 1836 and published posthumously in 1890). In this way, he draws attention
						to the tensions and distortions between past and present that are created by
						the act of retrospective narration.</p>
					<p>We know, then, that these &#8220;new ideas and generous sentiments&#8221;
							Stendhal claims to
						enjoy in conversation with 
							Byron can't be so new, if 
							Stendhal is not enjoying them for the first time.
						But what really matters here is the feeling itself &#8212;the sensation.
						This sensational affective regime of the fan is a fetishistic regime. For
							Stendhal's
						statement &#8212;&#8220;a volcano of new ideas and generous sentiments, so
						mingled that one believed himself to be enjoying them for the very first
						time&#8221; &#8212;does not so much produce a redeeming and enlightening
						epistemological distinction between the original and the copy, reason and
						emotion, as recapitulate what Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek refers to as &#8220;the
						formula of fetishism&#8221;: &#8220;I know, but nevertheless ...&#8221;.
							<note place="foot" resp="editors"> These are the words
								(&#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">Je sais bien, mais quand
								m&#234;me</foreign>&#8221;) of Octave Mannoni's famous patient in

								<foreign xml:lang="fr">Clefs pour l'Imaginaire ou l'autre
									sc&#232;ne</foreign>
							</title> (Paris: Seuil, 1969). For an elaboration of these words as the

							245. See also Schor
							113-116. </note> (<emph>I know that I was not experiencing these ideas
							and sentiments for the very first time, but nevertheless</emph>.) Such a
						vindication of affect in the face of disbelieving reality works to
						consecrate the entry into social life of the intense affectivity of fandom,
						or what Stendhal's
						contemporaries termed &#8220;idol worship.&#8221;</p>
					<p>Fandom would seem to proceed, then, according to the fetishistic logic that
							Naomi Schor refers to as
						&#8220;a perpetual oscillation between two incompatible beliefs&#8221;
							(Schor 114). It is this
						logic of fetishism that  
							Stendhal's narrative draws attention to in that earlier moment
						when he says: &#8220;At that time I was mad about <title level="m"
							>Lara</title>. From the second glance, I no longer saw Byron as he really
						was, but as I thought the author of <title level="m">Lara</title> should
						be.&#8221; This is both the knowledge of hindsight (<emph>Only now do I
							realize I no longer saw 
								Byron as he really was</emph>), and the knowledge that is
						fetishism's disavowal (<emph>I knew my 
								Byron was the Byron I thought he
							should be rather than the 
								Byron he was, but nevertheless</emph>).</p>
					<p>
						Stendhal's
						recollections participate in the genre of the celebrity sighting or what
							Chris Rojek has referred to
						as the &#8220;out-of-face encounter&#8221; between celebrity and fan (17).
						As the dynamic of presence and absence is critical to celebrity affect, the
						textual revisitation of the &#8220;out-of-face&#8221; encounter is about
						staging the author's presence as a moment of private life and staging
						familiarity with the author. The genre of the celebrity sighting dramatizes
						celebrity culture's preoccupation with embodiment, which is predicated upon
						distance (see Rojek 12). As
						such, it engages one of the most striking ironies of celebrity culture,
						which is that the desire for intimacy increases as access becomes more
						unattainable and distance greater. For this reason, technologies of
						simulation become more prolific in the labour of transforming the distant
						celebrity stranger into an intimate, predicated as they are upon the
						disavowal of the distance that they in fact materialize. The genre of
						&#8220;conversations of 
							Byron&#8221; speaks to celebrity culture's premium upon
						embodiment and authorial presence, and to a certain disavowal of textual
						mediation. As  
						Stendhal's conversations speak the genre, they present the
						exquisitely productive power of textual mediation in conjuring authorial
						presence.</p>

						Stendhal's celebrity
						sighting of Byron is
						a moment of high emotion. Most significantly, this is a moment of emotion
						shared between two men, one of whom presents himself with the intensity of a
						lover. This moment encapsulates a particular intensity of emotion that
						informs the proverbial devotion of fan to idol, and which mimics the
						gestures and emotional intensities of Romantic love. Stendhal's episodic
						narratives mimic, too, the narrative that Roland Barthes has analysed in
							<title level="m">A Lover's Discourse</title> as the &#8220;scene&#8221;
						of &#8220;love at first sight&#8221;: <quote rendition="#indent2"> the first
							thing we love is <emph>a scene</emph>. For love at first sight requires
							the very scene of its suddenness (what makes me irresponsible, subject
							to fatality, swept away, ravished): and of all the arrangements of
							objects, it is the scene which seems to be seen best for the first time:
							a curtain parts: what had not yet ever been seen is discovered in its
							entirety, and then devoured by the eyes: what is immediate stands for
							what is fulfilled: I am initiated: the scene <emph>consecrates</emph>
							the object I am going to love. (Barthes 192)</quote><lb/> In Stendhal's
						love-at-first-sighting of 
							Byron, the scene is set at La Scala, Milan, where the curtains part, and what takes place
						off-stage &#8212;more precisely in the box of M. de Br&#234;me &#8212;is
						moved to centre-stage. (&#8220;I entered M. de Br&#234;me's box on my return
						from an excursion on Lake Como. I found that the gathering had a sort of
						solemn and awkward air: everybody was silent. I was listening to the music
						when M. de Br&#234;me said to me, indicating my neighbour, 'Monsieur Beyle, this is Lord
						Byron'.&#8221;)</p>
					<p>As Michael Moon notes of
						Barthes' scene of ravishment, the scene of love-at-first-sight requires not
						so much the &#8220;beloved-at-first-sight&#8221; as &#8220;the scene
						itself&#8221; (Moon 6). For
							Stendhal, as he
						writes in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence</title>, it was love at
						first sight for the scene itself a few weeks earlier, when he returned to La
						Scala after a brief absence from Milan, but presents it as though for the very first time,
						devouring it with his eyes: <quote rendition="#indent2">I was limp with
							exhaustion; but I dragged myself straight off to La Scala ... and there,

							may evolve, all that is most baroque and most bizarre, all that is most
							sumptuous in architectural devising, all that can be made to live and
							breathe through the soft brilliance of draperies, all that can be coaxed
							into reality through the symbolism of characters who have not merely the
							costume, but the very faces and gestures of their make-belief and alien
							lands ... all this and more have I seen tonight.</quote><lb/> Not only
						as a stage, but as a whole social world La Scala dazzles: <quote

							intoxicating. I am in a feverish daze as I write this.</quote>
						<quote rendition="#indent2"> (25 September 1816; <title level="m"

						Byron is also
						impressed by the multiple uses to which La Scala generously put itself for
							Milan society: <quote
							rendition="#indent2"><lb/> All society in Milan is carried on at the opera: they have
							private boxes, where they play cards, or talk, or any thing else; but
							(except at the Cassino) there are no open houses, or balls, &amp;c.,

						<quote rendition="#indent2"> (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 5:

							>palchi</foreign>) where elite Milanese like M. de Br&#234;me would <foreign xml:lang="fr"
							>Rendez-vous</foreign> to conduct business and pleasure were lavishly
						decorated affairs that functioned as multi-purpose sociable spaces within
						the theatre. As Robert Alter elaborates, &#8220;a box at La Scala was more
						like a small parlor than the little overhanging pockets jammed with fixed
						seats of modern theatres. A party of eight or ten could comfortably deploy
						themselves where they chose, around a pedestal table convenient for reading
						and card playing, in movable chairs by the railing, or on the cushions of
						the divan set against one wall of the box. This meant that a party at La
						Scala was very much a social group whose activities were limited neither in
						nature nor duration by the performance on the stage below&#8221; (134).</p>
					<p>Taking place on-stage that night of 23 October 1816 was a performance of the
						opera <title level="m">Elena</title>, a success of that season, by Johann
						Simon Mayr (1763-1845), himself a successful opera composer despite being
						later eclipsed by the renowned Gioacchino Rossini (1792-1868). <note 
							place="foot" resp="editors"> Rossini became the young idol of the
							Italian opera-going public virtually overnight in 1813 with the success
							of <title level="m">Tancredi</title>, which Byron and
								Hobhouse saw in Venice
							in November 1816, performed, as 
								Hobhouse writes, by &#8220;the famous
							Marchesini [who] delighted me, and indeed affected us both, more than
							[Angelica] Catalani&#8221; (Hobhouse I: 61). As 
								Benjamin Walton notes, Rossini was &#8220;the
								Scott, Byron or Napoleon
							of music, depending on the fancy of individual critics&#8221; (Walton 82). Despite
							Rossini's enormous popularity, however, in 1816 he endured the
							scandalous failure of the first performance of <title level="m">The
								Barber of Seville</title> in Rome on Feb 26 1816. (The second
							performance, in Bologna, was a big success.) Stendhal writes about
							the episode in his <title level="m">Vie de Rossini </title> (1823),
							itself a scandalously plagiarized text &#8220;cribbed&#8221; from
							Guiseppe Carpani's <title level="m">Rossiane</title>. See Walton on the mixed
							reception of Rossini in London. To note another Napoleonic intertext:
							Rossini's father, the town trumpeter, very famously welcomed the
							Napoleonic troops into their northern Italian town, a gesture for which
							he was later thrown into jail after the Habsburg restoration of 1796.
						</note> In <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence</title>, Stendhal writes:
						&#8220;La Scala has revived <title level="m">Elena</title>, an opera by
						Mayr... . Dear God, how dull it seems! Yet what wild enthusiasm still
						survived to greet the <emph>sextet</emph> in Act II! ... There is genius in
						such a passage: old Mayr must have saved it up from the days of his youth,
						or else pilfered it where he chanced to light upon it. Alone, this passage
						rescued the entire opera from disaster&#8221; (21). Byron too it seems was
						suitably impressed by the sextet, according to Stendhal in <title

						</title> (1823): &#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">
							Lord Byron avait

					</p>
					<p>For all its ravishing social sublimity, the celebrity sighting delivers
						nevertheless an emphatically different kind of ravishment to the
						love-at-first-sighting. The celebrity sighting is very much a second sight,
						a &#8220;second-order intimacy&#8221; (
							Turner 92-3), the deliriously misprisioning sight
						of what Stendhal refers
						to as the &#8220;second glance.&#8221; The celebrity is always already
						known, and so a certain belatedness is at play. Such belatedness also marks
						the post-Napoleonic social, affective and psychic armature of the <foreign
							xml:lang="fr">mal du si&#232;cle</foreign>, that constitutive feature of
						French Romanticism, with its nostalgic but inhibited desire for the great
						gesture, compromised by suspicion of gallantry (see Brookner, <title
							level="m">Romanticism</title>, 41ff).</p>
					<p>
						Stendhal's biographer,
							Paton, would beg
						to differ from a reading of the meeting between Stendhal and Byron as a scene of
						ravishment and idol worship: &#8220;But 
							Beyle was not on his knees before Byron, as if he had
						been an idol, like thousands of others, whose admiration of his verses made
						them blind to all the personal defects of the man; and Beyle tells us roundly
						that those who saw him close at hand considered him haughty, and even a
						little mad&#8221; (
							Paton 1874: 122). Indeed, in another recollection of Byron, the 20 October
						1816 letter to Louis Crozet,  
							>Beyle refers to 
							Byron as &#8220;the original of Lovelace,&#8221; and, in <title
							level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</title> (1817), as
						&#8220;the most amiable monster that I have ever seen&#8221; (quoted in
							Lovell 196). Celebrity
						affect is, after all, an ambivalent mode of affect. &#8220;The purpose of
						gossip about celebrities,&#8221; as Graeme 
							Turner points out, &#8220;is not to elevate or
						idealize them as exemplary individuals&#8221; (107); it is about
						&#8220;modelling, fantasy and identification&#8221; (Gamson, quoted in Turner 110). As a practice of
						the fan's identity work, gossip involves, then, the production of identity
						through <emph>dis</emph>-identification as much as identification with such
						amiable monsters. The fan's obsessive preoccupation with the private life of
						the celebrity necessarily entails revealing the bad, the mad and the
						dangerous to know. And, as it turns out, there is quite a lot for Stendhal
						<emph>not</emph> to like about 
							Byron. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> On
								Byron's
							character flaws,  
								Stendhal writes that &#8220;Lord Byron could
							have pardoned Napoleon more easily if he had had a little of the
							colourlessness of Washington. Amusingly, it was not at all the despotic
							and odious part of Napoleon's character which displeased the English
							peer&#8221; (Lovell 197).
							He also presents a 
								Byron jealous of Brummell: &#8220;in his moments of
							dandyism, he always pronounced the name of Brummell with a mingled
							emotion of respect and jealousy&#8221; (201). </note>
					</p>
					<p>In any case, as we already know, 
							Beyle
						<emph>was</emph> on his knees inside the box of M. de Br&#234;me, if only in
						the form of the repressed impulse expressed in the letter to his cousin,
						Romain Colomb: &#8220;I was filled with timidity and affection: if I had
						dared, I would have burst into tears and kissed Lord Byron's
						hand&#8221; (Lovell 196).
						This is love at first sight &#8212;or, at least, &#8220;second glance&#8221;
						&#8212; and he is rendered speechless by the <foreign xml:lang="fr">coup de
							foudre</foreign> of this first sighting. But this speechlessness too is
						an active structuring impulse, just as his &#8220;timidity&#8221; reflects
						the impulse acting on him as a &#8220;wave of excitation in the
						nerve.&#8221; Whilst this restraint holds 
							Beyle back from outwardly going on his knees for
							Byron, the
						withheld emotion is later displayed in the autobiographical disclosure:
						not-daring-to is purely rhetorical, for 
							Stendhal does dare, if only in the disclosure. In
						this way, Stendhal's
						disclosure produces one of the ironies of the affect of the fan: that a
						moment of the display of intense emotion can also be a moment of
						withholding. Stendhal's
						disclosure thereby dramatizes a certain complication of the distinction
						between private feeling and public display that is central to the workings
						both of celebrity affect and the poetry of Byron as it is read.
							Byron's life and
						work habitually inspired such displays of emotion, such reworkings of the
						boundaries between public and private, and the spectacularly rhetorical
						disclosures of the heart that he referred to in <title level="m">Don
							Juan</title> as &#8220;The truth in masquerade&#8221; (XI, 37, 290,
							Byron 1986:
						476). A feature of that rhetorical sophistication is that Byron's poetry, to
						borrow Jerome McGann's
						memorable formulation, &#8220;is always, at whatever register, elaborating
						reciprocities with its audiences&#8221; (McGann 85-6).</p>
					<p>Celebrity culture enables &#8212;indeed would seem to demand &#8212;the
						mimicry of Romantic love, even in the space of a relationship between two
						men. (So much so that the cultural and discursive genre we refer to as
						&#8220;Byromania&#8221; also involved elaborate recantations, usually on the
						part of mature authors, such as Edward Bulwer-Lytton and Benjamin Disraeli,
						who looked back on their love of 
							Byron as a youthful folly [see Elfenbein].) But what kind
						of relationship between two men? In underscoring the proximity of the fan's
						devotion as a form of love and &#8220;Stendhalian eros,&#8221; I am not
						suggesting that  
							Stendhal's revelatory staging of intense feeling for Byron is intended as a

						<emph>not</emph> on his knees suggests Leo Bersani's &#8220;seductive and

						fucked&#8221; (<title level="a">Rectum</title> 212), unable to refuse the
						pleasures of &#8220;self-divestiture&#8221; (<title level="m">Homos</title>

						&#8220;self-shattering and solipsistic jouissance&#8221; (<title level="a"

					<p>The affect of the fan is proverbially like that of the lover, but also
							<emph>un</emph>like, perversely freighted as it is with all kinds of
						mobile identifications, impulses and intensities of emotion and desire that
						exceed the boundaries of traditional masculine homosociality and
						subjectivity yet which are not to be overdetermined by sexuality. The
						affective and discursive practices of Romantic fandom are vitally
						significant because they usher this impulsiveness into sociability, into a
						world where impulse is legible, meaningful and valuable, for all its
						contradictions. 
							Byron's scandalous celebrity licenses such perversity and
						inspires a re-imagining of author-reader relations, endowing them with new
						pleasures and sensations. The fandom it generates is a productive affective
						and social economy that spectacularizes the transformative agency of the
						reader. Far from entailing an exclusively passive position (in docile thrall
						to the sovereignty of author and text), fandom can be seen to transform a
						traditional textual economy of active and passive, thereby enabling
						reception as a mode of delirious productivity &#8212;proliferating often
						disobedient and indiscreet disclosures &#8212;as Stendhal's fan practices
						demonstrate in abundance.</p>

						Stendhal's numerous
						recollections are characterized by repetition, the habitual revisiting and
						restaging of the scene of the first sighting, and the connoisseurial
						selection and discrimination of &#8220;moments&#8221; to recount &#8212;
							Byron's
						&#8220;moments of genius&#8221; as well as more &#8220;prosaic
						moments&#8221; (Lovell 197).
						This devotional practice involves the multiplication of nuance and detail,
						to compare and contrast, enabling the obsessive return to the scene of
						encounter. As I mentioned earlier, these versions did not go unchallenged.
						In the years after 
							Byron's death, John
							Cam Hobhouse, 
							Byron's closest friend and executor, was fierce in his attempts
						to regulate the posthumous accounts that flooded the market, as well as the
						letters and memoirs that enabled people to profit from these memories.
						(Having said that, 
							Hobhouse's position was complicated and somewhat compromised by
						his own vested interest in always having to be seen to be Byron's first-best
						friend.) <note place="foot" resp="editors">
							Hobhouse's role in the
							destruction of 
								Byron's memoirs and the publication of Moore's subsequent
								<title level="m">Life</title> is illuminating here, suggesting how
							fraught this position could be. 
								Byron had originally given Moore the MS of his
							memoirs to raise money. Moore opposed the destruction of the memoirs (a
							campaign which 
								Hobhouse initiated and completed within three days of
							learning of 
								Byron's death), and wrote his <title level="m">Life</title>
							of Byron, which
							brought in the money that would have been his from the memoirs. 
								Hobhouse seems to have
							been a little bit jealous of Moore for having been entrusted with the
							MS, which possibly makes him suspect Moore's motives. As
								Hobhouse wrote in the
								<title level="a">Narrative of Events Connected with the Destruction
								of Lord
									Byron's Memoirs</title>, &#8220;Lord Byron made a
							present of himself to Mr. Moore, and Mr. Moore sold his Lordship to the
							booksellers&#8221; ( 
								Hobhouse III: 331). And in his diary of 14 May 1826:
							&#8220;Moore owned very frankly to me that he would make a book to get
							the money he wanted, but not a book of real merit as a Life of Lord Byron... . I
							am sorry that circumstances have made this interview necessary, but as I
							feel that Byron
							certainly intended a benefit to Moore, I cannot but assist him in some
							degree to gain his 2, 000 out of 
								Lord Byron's memory. That is his motive; he has
							no other.&#8221; (
								Hobhouse III: 134-5). >
								Hobhouse also had to contend with the publication of a
							collection of &#8220;religious conversations&#8221; with Byron as
							&#8220;one of the thousand and one squabbles which my intimacy [has]
							entailed upon me&#8221; (IV: 81). For a detailed analysis of this
							episode, see Hamilton.
						</note> As &#8220;keeper of the flame,&#8221; 
							Hobhouse could claim at least a legal obligation or
						entitlement to regard all memories of 
							Byron as a form of property. Less convincing are
						contemporary critics of celebrity who (without such cause) would naturalize
						this traditional economy of authorial sovereignty whereby the authorial
						image is understood to be the exclusive property of the author and to be
						controlled by the author. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Recent
							legal theory has challenged this idea of publicity as a form of
							property. As David Lange
							points out, &#8220;if the right of publicity was to be a new species of
							property it could in theory devolve and descend forever&#8221; (154).
						</note> As my account departs from such an understanding, I emphasize the
						expropriation of the author by the fan. <note place="foot"
							resp="editors"> The authorial image, like the star image, as Richard
							Dyer points out, includes &#8220;what people say or write about him or
							her, as critics or commentators, the way the image is used in other
							contexts such as advertisements, novels, pop songs, and finally the way
							the star can become part of the coinage of everyday speech&#8221; (3).
							Hence, the authorial image is not the exclusive property of the author
							nor is it controlled by the author. </note> For it is the fan who is the
						foregrounded subject, even in the gesture of self-abnegation: <quote
							rendition="#indent2"> what I know concerning that singular man is only
							the memory of what I have felt in his presence. How does one give an
							account of a memory without speaking of self, and how dare one speak of
							self after having named 
								>Lord Byron? (
								>Lovell 197)</quote><lb/> How dare one speak of self, but
						speak of himself  
							Stendhal does and must. In this spectacular subordination of fan
						to celebrity, the beloved celebrity is made over into the creature or the
						darling of the fan, through the self-same gestures of revelation that stage
						intimacy between 
							Byron and &#8220;self,&#8221; distinguish Stendhal as a fan and
						mark Byron with
						those distinguishing features of 
							Stendhal's love. What we see is Stendhal's display of the
						supreme prerogative of unveiling authorial presence, Stendhal's staging of
						privileged access,  
							Stendhal's narrative manipulation of the dynamic of presence and
						absence that is critical to celebrity affect's preoccupation with
						embodiment. In this way,  
							Stendhal's rendition of the Byronic conversation and
						recollection proceeds like the fan website, with the &#8220;interpolation of
						autobiographical example ... [implicitly declaring] this is my site, my
						contents ... my way&#8221; (Hoxter, quoted in Hills 91).</p>
					<p>The meeting between 
							Byron and  
							Stendhal is a close encounter between celebrity and fan, a
						sighting of the celebrity. But it is also a moment of social presentation:
						being introduced to a stranger. This drama of social presentation involves
						reading that stranger through social signs. For his part, Byron initially gets
						these signs wrong, as  
							Stendhal coolly informs us in <title level="a">
							Lord Byron en
							Italie</title> (1830): <quote rendition="#indent2"> [Lord Byron] had
							been informed that in the course of the evening he would probably be
							introduced to a stranger who had performed the celebrated campaign of
							Moscow, which still possessed the charm of novelty, as at that time we
							had not been spoiled by any romances on the subject. A fine-looking man,
							with a military appearance, happening to be one of your party, his
							Lordship naturally concluded that he was the hero. (quoted in Lovell 200)</quote><lb/>
						The &#8220;hero&#8221; is not the &#8220;fine-looking man, with a military
						appearance,&#8221; but  
							Stendhal, <note place="foot" resp="editors">
							Stendhal the man
							may not have had the &#8220;military appearance,&#8221; but his
							sentences do, as Anita Brookner suggests, in her subtle and appreciative
							account of  
							Stendhal's gift for a peculiar kind of emotion constrained by
							formality: &#8220;Hence too the depth and subtlety of the emotion which
							eventually goes into the novels disguised or wrapped up in short,
							military sentences&#8221; (<title level="m">Genius</title>, 36). </note>
						so Byron is
						mistaken. But only temporarily: &#8220;The next day, however, Byron was undeceived
						... [and] did me the honour to address me on the subject of Russia&#8221;
							(Lovell 200).</p>
					<p>The moment in the box is a moment of high emotion, but it is also constrained
						&#8212;and enabled &#8212;by social ritual. As we have seen, Stendhal's response to
							Byron is
						informed by a withholding of emotion: &#8220;if I had dared I would
						have.&#8221; However, this not-daring &#8220;timidity&#8221; is also an
						active structuring impulse, in play with &#8220;affection,&#8221; for Stendhal is
						&#8220;filled&#8221; with both. To conceive of fandom as a form of social
						ritual is to understand it as something more than a debased, excessive,
						inauthentic mode of emotion. Rather, it is to see it as a complex form of
						social modernity, aligned with new modes of social performance and
						presentation, affect and publicity, and to see it as an exemplary form of
						intimate publicity. For what marks the particular encounter between Stendhal and Byron is both the
						intensity of emotion and also the restraint with which it is controlled and
						produced: the ritualization of that emotion. As the social theorist Erving
						Goffman has suggested, &#8220;When in the idol's immediate presence we act
						with ritual care&#8221; (quoted in Smith 28).</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section">
					<head>V.</head>
					<p>We act with ritual care, but also with a sense of strategy. For once the
						introduction between  
							Stendhal and 
							Byron has been made, strategic skirmishes ensue on the subject
						of the recent Anglo-French hostilities. As 
							Stendhal writes: <quote rendition="#indent2"> I
							idolized Napoleon, and replied to his Lordship [Byron] as I should
							have done to a member of the legislative assembly who had exiled the
							ex-emperor to St. Helena. I subsequently discovered that Lord Byron was at
							once enthusiastic in favour of Napoleon, and jealous of his fame. He
							used to say, &#8220;Napoleon and myself are the only individuals who
							sign our names with the initials N.B.&#8221; (Noel Byron.)</quote>
						<quote rendition="#indent2"> My determination to be cold offers some
							explanation for the marked kindness with which, at the end of a few
							days, Lord Byron
							did me the favour to regard me. One evening, however, he spoke to me
							without cause of the immorality of the French character. I replied
							firmly and mentioned the hulks where the English had tortured French
							prisoners of war, of the deaths of Russian emperors, happening always at
							such a convenient time for English interests, of infernal machines, etc.
							etc. Our friends in the box imagined that the discussion which had taken
							place, and which, though polite and respectful on my part, had been
							rather warm, would prevent any further intimacy between us. They were
							mistaken. The next evening his Lordship took me by the arm, and walked
							me for an hour in the saloon of the Theatre de la Scala.</quote>
						<quote rendition="#indent2"> (<title level="a">Lord Byron en
								Italie,</title> 1830, quoted in 
								Lovell 1954: 200)</quote><lb/> This passage
						elaborates a gradual transformation from stranger to intimate, as each man
						is required to negotiate the often oblique social signs that the other puts
						into circulation. It is about the tactical manoeuvres of social affect and
						social intimacy, which involve emotional withholding: giving out coldness
						when one feels warmth. But it is also about the expectation that this
						paradoxical coldness will be read, and worked through, as indeed it is, when
							Stendhal discovers
						that Byron is not
						the typical &#8220;member of the legislative assembly who had exiled the
						ex-emperor to St Helena. I subsequently discovered that Lord Byron was at once
						enthusiastic in favour of Napoleon, and jealous of his fame.&#8221; This
						mutual love for Napoleon explains in retrospect that intriguing paradox of
						social emotion: &#8220;My determination to be cold offers some explanation
						for the marked kindness with which at the end of a few days, Lord Byron did me the
						favour to regard me.&#8221;  
							Stendhal is determined to be cold, and this results in kindness
						from Byron. Why? The
						discovery of a shared Napoleon-love not only rescues and redeems an awkward
						social moment, but also reconfigures the co-ordinates of a map of first
						impressions shared by the two men that assumes national identity to
						determine political identification. After the discovery, Byron rewards Stendhal with kindness
						for his loyalty to Napoleon, even when that loyalty has entailed coldness
						toward himself. The exchange is about the enigma of making a connection
						through being cold.  
							Stendhal's friends think they won't be friends but they are
						wrong, for Byron has
						taken his arm.</p>
					<p>These meetings occur in a relatively circumscribed social space, the theatre
						box of M. de Br&#234;me, an intriguing figure who as a consecrated priest,
						almoner of the ex-king and leader of the Italian Romantics, mixed exotic
						forms of Italian social and cultural capital. Clearly charmed, 
							Hobhouse gives a detailed
						account of his first impression of <quote rendition="#indent2"> Monsignore
							Lodovico de Br&#234;me, one of Napoleon's almoners for the Kingdom of
							Italy, whence his title. The son of a noble Piedmontese family, destined
							for the Church, who has been offered two bishoprics by Napoleon and one
							by the people, but wishes rather to unfrock himself than to put on the
							mitre. He is a young man about thirty, wears his dark hair combed
							upright, which gives him a wildness of expression not unlike that of
							Alfieri [the Italian Romantic poet]. He is, on the whole, one of the
							most attractive men I ever saw. He gave Lord Byron a most
							warm reception, and as Madame de St&#228;el had introduced me to him in
							her letter in favourable terms, was pointedly civil to me. He spoke with
							a certain degree of point on every subject, delivering his apothegems
							and ironies in the gravest tone, which made him quite irresistible.
								(Hobhouse I:
							40-41)</quote><lb/> Unable to resist, we might say smitten, 
							Hobhouse has his own moment
						of love-at-first-sight. Heady fan-love is in the air, and the scene takes on
						the aspects of a mid-summer Shakespearean romance of mistaken identities,
						multiple love objects and deliriously mobile desires, all predicated upon
						what Ren&#233; Girard refers to
						as the &#8220;idolatrous worship of otherness&#8221; (197). A sucker for
						grave ironies, Hobhouse
						sees in Br&#234;me the same combination of social, cultural and physical
						power associated with the Byronic aura. Br&#234;me’s &#8220;wildness of
						expression not unlike that of Alfieri&#8221; also mediates the Byronic aura
						(as Alfieri's likeness to 
							Byron was noted by contemporaries [see <title level="j"
							>BLJ</title> 9: 11]). It is as though 
							Hobhouse here displaces his own desire for Byron via Alfieri onto
						Br&#234;me, who is himself drifting in the homosocially shared trancelike
						obsession with Byron
						that he sponsors in his box. In this series of displacements, the cycle of
						mimetic desire is routed first through 
							Byron and now through Br&#234;me, to produce two
						couples of admirer and admiree: 
							Beyle and 
							Byron, 
							Hobhouse and Br&#234;me, with Napoleon and to a lesser extent
						Alfieri mediating idols in between.</p>
					<p>This circle of love recalls another one tenderly fantasized by Byron barely two years
						before, when he had written to 
							Hobhouse to break the news of his engagement to Annabella
						Milbanke. This extraordinarily moving letter entwines Byron's most gentle
						and optimistic feelings for Milbanke (&#8220;my intended&#8221;, before she
						becomes &#8220; <emph>that woman</emph> &#8221; [<title level="j"
							>BLJ</title> 5: 120]) within a textbook illustration of homosocial
						triangulation, when 
							Byron asks Hobhouse to be witness to the ceremony in the same breath as
						expressing the fond wish that he too might be married, so that they might
						share the experience, &#8220;like people electrified in company through the
						same chain&#8221; (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 4: 213). As it turned out,
							Hobhouse witnessed the
						marriage, the bitter separation and the never-ending degradation of
						&#8220;my intended,&#8221; Annabella Milbanke, into &#8220;the bitch my
						wife&#8221; (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 95), &#8220;that infernal
						fiend&#8221; (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 129), that &#8220;<foreign

								Crompton helpfully glosses 
								Byron's nasty little Italian neologism:
							&#8220;'Porca' means sow; 'buzzerena' is a Venetian dialect term derived
							from 'buggerone,' a 'sodomite'&#8221; (Crompton, 235, fn 83).</note> And here in these
						early weeks of exile, 
							Hobhouse joins hands to witness the electric chain of fan-love
						with the adoring Italian Romantics. As he wrote after Byron's death,
						&#8220;No human being could approach him without being sensible of this
						magical influence&#8221; (Hobhouse III: 41).<note place="foot" resp="editors"
							>Earlier in 1816, just before coming to Milan,

							at Lake Geneva with Percy
								Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley and Claire Clairmont from May
							until August. As 
								Byron was to write of this summer of love, when Shelley
							&#8220;dosed&#8221; him with Wordsworth as he was writing <title level="m"
								>Childe Harold III</title>, &#8220;I was half mad during the time of

						&#8220;electrified company&#8221; could also turn. <note place="foot"
							resp="editors"> And turn it did, quite badly, with the Italian
							Romantics. The morning after the magical night of October 1816 came in
							July 1818, when 
								Hobhouse's <title level="a">Essay on the Present Literature
								of Italy</title> appeared as part of his <title level="m">Historical
								illustrations of the fourth canto of Childe Harold: containing
								dissertations on the ruins of Rome; and an essay on Italian
								literature</title> (London: John Murray, 1818) and contained not a
							single mention of the irresistible Br&#234;me. Br&#234;me wrote to Byron to indicate
							his displeasure, and then 
								Hobhouse wrote back to 
								Byron: &#8220;Di Breme may be damned! ... Breme
							is vexed because I have ventured to tell some disagreeable truths about
							poor dear Bonaparte and because I have said nothing about his behissed
							comedy. You had better tell him so and then you will succeed to your
							heart's content in making him hate me as much as you have made me hate
							him&#8221; (quoted in Vincent 21). In fact, the author of the &#8220;Essay&#8221;
							was not Hobhouse but
							the exiled Italian patriot and poet Ugo Foscolo, whom Hobhouse had met in
								London, and who agreed to
							write the &#8220;Essay&#8221; on the condition of secrecy about his
							authorship. 
								Byron himself seemed to enjoy the falling out between Hobhouse and Br&#234;me.
							As he wrote to 
								Hobhouse on 3 August 1818, &#8220;Enclosed is Breme’s scrawl
							... he gives you devilish bitter words &#8212;and I long to see you by
							the ears &#8212;that I do.&#8212;&#8221; (<title level="j">BLJ</title>
							6: 63). And as he wrote to Guiseppino Albrizzi, the son of Countess
							Albrizzi, a major Venetian hostess, known as the Madame de Sta&#235;l of
							Italy: &#8220;Tell Hobhouse &#8212;his letter to De Breme has made a great
							Sensation &#8212;and is to be published in the Tuscan &amp; other
							Gazettes&#8221; (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 91). </note> As Girard writes, &#8220;the
						disquieting infrastructure of mimetic desire&#8221; entails the
						&#8220;necessarily jealous and conflictual nature of mimetic convergence on
						a single object&#8221; (197). Jealousy is alive and well for Hobhouse, both in Byron's life and
						death, and he was notoriously jealous of other pretenders (such as Thomas
						Moore) to the title of Byron's first-best friend (see Hamilton). Despite these rivalries, he acknowledged
						that Byron's
						&#8220;power of attaching those about him to his person was such as no one I
						knew possessed&#8221; (Hobhouse I: 41).</p>
					<p>
						Girard writes about the love
						triangle using fan-love &#8212;the &#8220;idolatrous worship of
						otherness&#8221; &#8212;as his model for all desire. Likewise, what Bersani
						says about sexual desire also holds true of fan-love in this giddy scene of
						homosocial desire: &#8220;Displacement is endemic to sexuality&#8221; and
						&#8220;sexual desire initiates, indeed can be recognized by, an agitated
						fantasmatic activity in which original (but from the start, unlocatable)
						objects of desire get lost in the images they generate&#8221; (221). The
						confusion is such that objects of hero worship become confused with
						appropriate objects of desire. Napoleon was particularly vulnerable to such
						confusions and displacements, and offers the exemplary case in point here.
						The case is dramatized with spectacular force and piquancy in the bedroom
						farces of Stendhal's
							<title level="m">The Red and the Black</title> (1830), where a portrait
						of Napoleon hidden under the bed of Julien Sorel in the home of his
						Ultra-Royalist employer is mistakenly thought to be a portrait of an
						unidentified secret lover, and Hazlitt's <title level="a">Liber Amoris</title> (1823), where H.
						is simultaneously the rival of a bust of Napoleon for the affections of S.,
						&#8220;She is my heart's idol,&#8221;, and the rival of S. herself for that
						precious little bust of Napoleon, &#8220;the god of my idolatry&#8221;
							(Hazlitt 45, 28).
						Struggling in the box at La Scala to maintain the line between homosocial
						and homoerotic desire, it is perhaps just as well that, as Stendhal writes,
						&#8220;The company there assembled consists entirely of men of letters. No
						woman ever passes the threshold&#8221; (Stendhal, <title level="m">Rome</title> 64). And
						sure enough, Stendhal
						presents Byron
						&#8220;declin[ing] the honour&#8221; of introductions to the
						&#8220;assemblage of lovely women as that which chance had collected in
							Milan&#8221; (Lovell 202).</p>
					<p>This is, then, a highly gendered, male-homosocial space. It is an
						aristocratic social space, but also a cosmopolitan one, and a specifically
						Italian form of cosmopolitanism, as Stendhal is at pains to point out, noting the
						social genre of meeting in the box of the aristocrat as a particular form of
						Italian warmth and informality: &#8220;This Italian custom, not generally
						followed in France, banished all ceremony. The affectation that chills the
						atmosphere of a French saloon is unknown in the society of Milan.&#8221; As his dismissive
						remarks about French social custom underscore, Stendhal, like Byron, is in happy
						self-exile from his own country (&#8220;his blood / Is all meridian&#8221;
							[<title level="a">Stanzas to the Po</title> ], and he will eventually
						have inscribed on his gravestone &#8220;Arrigo Beyle, Milanese&#8221;). In this congenial setting, Stendhal and Byron rewrite the
						hoary old script of chilly Anglo-French hostilities into a congenial
						dialogue of transnational camaraderie, hosted by the Italian informality of
						the box of M. Br&#234;me, which welcomes exiles, and the saloon of La Scala.
						They too might have been trapped as prisoners of memories of war, but they
						move beyond these dim, shabby &#8220;hulks&#8221; into the light, bright and
						airy, liberal and cosmopolitan, space of the box at La Scala. <note
							place="foot" resp="editors"> As a radical Whig who opposed the Congress
							devised by the Liverpool administration, Hobhouse also thrived in this space: &#8220;A
							persuasion that I am of the Liberal English and, more than all, have a
							hatred of the Congress Castlereagh system, gives me a willing audience
							in this place, which is not elsewhere found, at least I have not found
							it&#8221; (Hobhouse
							II: 47). </note>
					</p>
					<p>The meeting between Byron and Stendhal dramatizes the poignant liminality of this historical
						moment when Stendhal,
							Byron and
						Napoleon are all freshly exiled, Napoleon himself living on in the period
						that can only just be referred to as post-Napoleonic, so that Stendhal's store of
						Napoleonic reminiscences &#8220;still possessed the charm of novelty&#8221;
							(<title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence,</title> 1817, quoted in
							Lovell 200). The spectres
						of &#8220;hulks&#8221; and torture and &#8220;infernal machines&#8221; of
						recent military conflict, that loom early in the conversation and chill the
						air (making it &#8220;rather warm&#8221; in the sense of unfriendly),
						disintegrate under the spell of an ecumenical Napoleonic aura that banishes
						these bad memories and baleful animosities as so many gloomy ghosts at the
						table. This reminds us of the powerful mediating force that Napoleon was
						throughout Europe as &#8220;an embodiment of liberty and opposition to
						monarchical power&#8221; (Bainbridge 137) both while he was in power and
						after. (Of course, Napoleon was also for many the contemporary embodiment of
						despotism. And Byron, who could be full of adoration for Napoleon, was also of
						course famously ambivalent about him and so could be very critical too. But
						that's another story.) <note place="foot" resp="editors"> This
							ambivalence is manifest in the <title level="a">Ode to Napoleon</title>
							(1814), written on the occasion of the first abdication. For a
							compelling analysis of Byron's ambivalent relation to Napoleon in the
							&#8220;Ode&#8221; and elsewhere, see Bainbridge 134-52. On the diversity
							of views amongst English sympathizers with Napoleon, see the classic
							study by E. Tangye Lean,

								Diasaffection 1760-1960</title>. </note></p>
					<p>For all his later attacks on Stendhal, Hobhouse &#8212;also a lover of Napoleon &#8212;entered a highly
						appreciative account in his diaries of the anecdotes that Stendhal gave them of
						Napoleon. Stendhal, who
						had been in charge of dispatches, tells of the Emperor Francis carefully
						cutting the seal off dispatches from Napoleon for his Minister, and then
						&#8220;rubbing it against his clothes, smelling it, and giving it its due
						praise. The eagle was well done, the sword perfect&#8221; (Hobhouse I: 52-3). He tells
						of how Napoleon &#8220;never would pronounce the word Kaluga&#8221; (a key
						site in the retreat from Moscow), &#8220;but called it sometimes Caligula,
						sometimes Salamanca,&#8221; and how &#8220;[h]is attendants, who knew what
						he meant, went on writing or listening without making any remark&#8221;
						(53). And he tells of how he was there during the retreat from Moscow
						(&#8220;as the reader of any given five pages of his writing will not fail
						to discover&#8221; [James
						188]), and of how during the retreat &#8220;the soldiers burst into
						tears&#8221; (54).</p>
					<p>In this encounter in the box at La Scala, the stranger who is being
						introduced is well-known at a distance but can still be introduced into a
						relatively closed circle, according to traditional social protocols. As
						such, the encounter dramatizes a transitional moment in the history of
						celebrity, which is the transition between the domain of the social and what
							Chris Rojek refers to as
						the &#8220;para-social&#8221;, interactions that occur at a social distance
						with people we don't know (Rojek 52). This is not strictly an interface between the poet
						and the anonymous public, for the box of M. de Br&#234;me is a kind of
						liminal space between the traditional, known audience of social equals, and
						the wider, anonymous public that literature is moving towards. It is an
						extremely privileged social space, too, that mixes old social class and old
						money. As Stendhal
						observed, &#8220;A box at La Scala is treated as freehold property, like a
						house, and may change hands for as much as twenty-five thousand
						francs&#8221; (Stendhal, <title level="m">Rome</title> 24-5). Indeed, after the
						original theatre of Milan (the
						Teatro Regio Ducale) had burned down in 1776, it was the owners of the boxes
						who lobbied Archduke Ferdinand to build a new one, and it was the sale of
						new boxes that financed the building of La Scala to replace it. The box at
						La Scala emblematises the particular conjunction of social, economic and
						cultural power that M. de Br&#234;me embodied.</p>
					<p>Not only Byron, but
							Byron's poetry
						itself charms the box of M. de Br&#234;me, as their host M. de Br&#234;me
						points out: &#8220;So keenly are his works relished by those of his friends
						who know English that, without ever mentioning it, we are endlessly showing
						him our private admiration&#8221; (
							Lovell 206). This reserve about Byron's poetry is
						maintained apparently even despite the fact that they have an Italian poet
						in their midst, &#8220;the celebrated Monti,&#8221; who &#8220;graciously
						recited [his poetry] for us,&#8221; and who puts &#8220;Lord Byron ... in
						raptures.&#8221; So relished, so precious is Byron's poetry that it
						has the power to become an object of the unspoken in this circle of socially
						elite men who count a poet among their number. They negotiate this desire,
						and Byron's charm,
						through feats of &#8220;private admiration.&#8221; Again, like Stendhal not daring to
						kiss Byron's hand,
						we see another form of restraint in this meeting with Byron. As we've seen,
						celebrity culture works not always or only in terms of the spectacular
						displays of outrageous affection. It is marked, too, with the protocols of
						an elite social culture of discretion. And 
							Stendhal's discretion is rewarded. For, after the
						poetry recitation: &#8220;From that day, I passed almost every evening with
							Lord
						Byron&#8221; (Lovell
						197).</p>
				</div>

					<head>VI.</head>
					<p>In Stendhal's 1829
						letter to Colomb, Byron and Stendhal make their farewells at the end of a delightful
						evening. The recollection is marked by one last moment of self-deprecation,
						as Stendhal responds to
							Byron's request
						for street directions: <quote rendition="#indent2">
							Lord Byron asked
							me, as the only one who knew English, to tell him the names of the
							streets that he would have to pass through on the way back to his inn.
							It was at the other end of town, near the fortress. I saw that he would
							go astray: in that part of Milan, at midnight, all the shops were closed. He would
							wander amidst empty and ill-lit streets, and without knowing a word of
							the language! In my devoted affection I was so foolish as to advise him
							to take a carriage. At once a shade of haughtiness passed over his face:
							he gave me to understand, with all necessary politeness, that what he
							wanted of me was the names of the streets, and not advice as to how to
							use them. He left the box, and I understood why he had reduced it to
							silence. (Lovell
							196)</quote><lb/> In this brilliant moment, when Stendhal advises Byron to take a
						carriage, Stendhal
						fantasizes being Byron's chaperone, and Byron a stranger in need of protection. Byron declines his
						advice, and the anecdote ends as it opened with Byron reducing the box
						to silence. Another masterful Stendhalian ending that eludes closure:
						returning to the anecdote's beginning &#8212;to that &#8220;sort of solemn
						and awkward air&#8221; and that fraught form of silence that opens the
						encounter &#8212;the ending transforms this awkwardness by turning it into a
						moment of comedy.</p>
					<p>But the story does not end there, for there are other versions of that
						evening that end more optimistically and keep the electrified company there
						despite Byron's
						departure. Later that very same evening, as the 1824 letter to Louise S.
						Belloc recounts, Byron strolls with Stendhal around the &#8220;immense and solitary foyer of La
						Scala.&#8221; This time, Byron is successfully transformed from stranger into intimate.
						Again, memories of Napoleon are the currency of this transformation, which
						is aided by the social lubricant of their mutual devotion: <quote
							rendition="#indent2"> I had the good fortune to excite his curiosity, in
							giving him some personal details concerning Napoleon and the retreat
							from Moscow, which in 1816 were not yet commonplace. This species of
							merit procured for me many strolls t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te, in the
							immense and solitary foyer of Scala. (Lovell, 197-8)</quote><lb/> Once again, the
						curtain parts, and the scene of the fan's love at second glance is
						consecrated. The supreme transformation of the stranger to intimate occurs
						as Stendhal and Byron share
						&#8220;strolls t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te.&#8221; What we also note, as the
						curtains part, is the particular kind of social space that stages&#8212;and
						houses&#8212;this transformation from stranger to intimate: &#8220;the
						immense and solitary foyer of Scala.&#8221; This paradoxical figure
						encapsulates marvellously the transformative effect of celebrity as a mode
						of publicity, a mode of intimacy, a mode of public intimacy. That this
						immense public social space should also be nonetheless so
						&#8220;solitary&#8221; enables it to host and to hold and to bear witness to
						all the paradoxes of intimate strangeness that attend the meeting between
							Byron and his
						enraptured fan of &#8220;a hundred irresistible impulses.&#8221;</p>
