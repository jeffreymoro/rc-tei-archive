         <div type="abstract">
            <p rend="noCount">This essay investigates how the concept of fandom might make sense of a reading practice that emerged in the romantic period, the practice of visiting places associated with authors and their works in order to re-read their works in situ.  Focussing on Lady Frances Shelley as a typical romantic literary tourist, the essay considers the ways in which she (and by extension others) produced new constructions of reading and the reader in response to the emergent figure of the romantic author. Shelley's various accounts of visiting romantic locales associated with Rousseau, Scott and Byron not only provides a conspectus of possible tourist-stances and practices but suggests that romantic readers strove to represent themselves on a footing not only of intimacy but of social equality with the author, re-establishing a sense of a coterie audience in the face of the realities of an increasingly heterogenous mass reading public.</p>

				<p>So <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Henri Beyle</name> recalls his introduction to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
						type="person">Lord Byron</name> in <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name> in October 1816 in the theatre of La Scala,
					in the box of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>'s friend, Monsieur Ludovic de Br&#234;me: &#8220;I
					entered M. de Br&#234;me's box on my return from an excursion on Lake Como. I found that the gathering had a sort of solemn and
					awkward air: everybody was silent. I was listening to the music when M. de Br&#234;me said to me, indicating my neighbour,
					'Monsieur <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>, this is <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
						>Lord Byron</name>'.&#8221; (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 196) At this moment, <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is freshly exiled and just arrived in Italy, trailing scandalous
					celebrity and the opening flourishes of &#8220;[t]he pageant of his bleeding heart&#8221; (<name ref="#ArnoldMatthew"
						type="person">Arnold</name>, <title level="a">Stanzas</title>) that came with the separation from his wife, Annabella
					Milbanke, the ensuing public scandal, and the flight from England. After travelling via Switzerland, where he stayed with Percy
					Bysshe and Mary Shelley at Lake Geneva, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> has been just over a week in
					Italy, where he was to live for the rest of his life. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>, also in exile,
					has been mainly in <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name> since 1813, when he took leave from Napoleon's army after the
					retreat from Moscow, and where he would spend the next seven years. When they meet, Monsieur <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
						type="person">Beyle</name> is still just <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>, not yet '<name
						ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>,' as he will soon become when he adopts this pseudonym for the first
					time as the author of <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</title> (1817), in which he will recount a different
					version of this first meeting with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8212;one of many, as it turns
					out, in private letters and published texts.</p>
				<p>While Monsieur <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> is still <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
						>Beyle</name>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> is for <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
						type="person">Beyle</name> very much the author identified with his works: &#8220;At that time I was mad about <title
						level="m">Lara</title>. From the second glance, I no longer saw <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
					as he really was, but as I thought the author of <title level="m">Lara</title> should be&#8221; (<name ref="#LovellErnest"
						type="person">Lovell</name> 196). Here, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> registers both the power
					and the radical partiality that marks the gaze of the fan, in the form of this &#8220;second glance&#8221; and its prerogative to
					wilfully misread. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>'s &#8220;second glance&#8221; enacts what <name
						ref="#MillerDA" type="person">D. A. Miller</name> has referred to as the &#8220;Stendhalian eros [that] would seem to depend
					on love plots engendered from misjudgements and blind spots. Error, as it were, permits the narrateable movement of errantry
					(wandering, elapsing, delaying) in which finally comes to lie the erotic&#8221; (225). Indeed, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
						type="person">Stendhal</name>'s fondness for irony means that he congenially <emph>throws</emph> such blind spots and errors
					to his correspondents and readers as though they were gifts. <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s generous capacity for error in relation to dates, for example,
						is registered in the letter to Colomb, where the meeting of October 1816 is misremembered as occurring in &#8220;the autumn of
						1812&#8221; (see <name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 196), and in the famous misdating of the 1816 meeting
						that is included in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</title>. </note>
				</p>
				<p>This essay examines the love plots and errantry that proliferate in <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s
					recollections of his meeting with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
						type="person">Stendhal</name>'s work and life (and the intermediating code of &#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr"
					>beylisme</foreign>&#8221;) is associated most famously with &#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">la chasse au bonheur</foreign>&#8221;
					(&#8220;the pursuit of happiness&#8221;). As I wish to suggest, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s
					recollections of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> are marked by the happy over-investment of affect
					that has come to be identified with fan practices. A significant feature of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
						>Stendhal</name>'s account of the meeting is that his emotion is produced after the event, in the act of recollection. The
					recollections embody, then, a typically Stendhalian concern with the fraught interrelation between desire and memory. For the
					historical figure of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Henri Beyle</name> has offered the consummate allegory of the
					distortions of memory, and of the contradictions between reason and feeling that memory dramatizes. In <name ref="#SebaldWG"
						type="person">W. G. Sebald</name>'s historical fiction, <title level="a">
						<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>, or Love is a Madness Most Discreet</title> (included in <title
						level="m">Vertigo</title>), <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> is made to offer &#8220;eloquent proof
					of the various difficulties entailed in the act of recollection&#8221; (<name ref="#SebaldWG" type="person">Sebald</name> 5).
					Likewise, the fan <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> who meets <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
						type="person">Byron</name> embodies love as a madness most discreet: &#8220;if I had dared, I would have burst into tears and
					kissed <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'s hand&#8221; (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person"
						>Lovell</name> 196).</p>
				<p>In the first full-length biography of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, <title level="m">
						<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Henry Beyle</name> (otherwise De Stendahl [sic]) A Critical and Biographical
						Study</title> (1874), <name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald">Andrew Archibald Paton</name> foregrounds such contradictions between
					reason and feeling as vital to his subject: &#8220;<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> was a man of genius,
					but he had a hundred irresistible impulses which could not be squared with reason&#8221; (9). <note n="2" place="foot"
						resp="editors">
						<name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald" type="person">Paton</name>'s biography displayed a certain contradictory charm itself, as
							<name ref="#JamesHenry" type="person">Henry James</name> noted in a review in the <title level="j">Nation</title> (17
						September 1874): &#8220;It contains hardly an opinion which is not ludicrously erratic, and hardly a quotation, a foreign
						phrase, or a proper name which is not misspelled or misprinted. But the author writes with a garrulous <foreign xml:lang="fr">
							bonhomie</foreign> &#8212;that of an easy-going cosmopolite ... &#8212;which will soften the edge of the reader's
						displeasure; and he is to be thanked at any rate for bringing <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> once
						more before the world&#8221; (<name ref="#JamesHenry" type="person">James</name> 187). </note> As I wish to suggest, it is
					precisely such &#8220;irresistible impulses&#8221; that make up the affective repertoire of fan culture. And nowhere are these
					impulses offered more readily than in these recollections by <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, the
					master of memory and emotion. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s response to <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is informed both impulsively and masterfully by a withholding or
					disguising of emotion. As <name ref="#JamesHenry" type="person">Henry James</name> wrote in his (<emph>un</emph>withholding and
					rather mixed) review of <name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald" type="person">Paton</name>'s biography, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
						type="person">Stendhal</name>'s work has &#8220;that singular something ... &#8212;a kind of painful tension of feeling under
					the disguise of the coolest and easiest style&#8221; (<name ref="#JamesHenry" type="person">James</name> 189). The beauty of the
					impulse, and its significance as a way of illuminating fan practices, is that it occupies a liminal position between the desire to
					act and the act itself. By narrowing the distinction between desire and act &#8212;as mere as &#8220;a wave of excitation in the
					nerve&#8221; (OED) or an &#8220;influence acting upon the mind&#8221; (<name ref="#JohnsonSamuel" type="person">Johnson</name> 1:
					954) &#8212;the category of the impulse enables a focus upon the mobility and changeability of desire. In this way, <name
						ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s impulse to burst into tears and kiss <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'s hand is both expressed and checked.</p>
				<p>The impulse is a very similar emotional creature to the sensation. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>
					was a keen follower of the sensationalism of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">id&#233;ologues</foreign> &#8212; materialist philosophers
					and psychologists such as Condorect, Condillac, Tracy, and <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s revered
					Cabanis, the physician and materialist philosopher from whom he borrowed his &#8220;woman's skin&#8221;: &#8220;I will borrow for
					an instant the language of Cabanis. I have too fine a skin, a woman's skin ...; I graze my fingers, which are very fine, for a
					trifle; in a word, the surface of my body is feminine&#8221; (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>,
						<title level="m">Life</title> 120). Revolutionaries and Republicans with a total system that conceived of personal happiness
					as an effect of political liberty, the <foreign xml:lang="fr"> id&#233;ologues</foreign> disregarded the question of classical
					form when it came to literature and emphasized the effect of the literary work upon reason, sensibility and imagination &#8212;its
					status, in other words, as sensation.</p>
				<p>As I will argue in this essay, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s emphasis on sensation is also
					legible in relation to the forms of celebrity culture. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s
					recollections of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> offer a different way of approaching the classic
					Stendhalian affective repertoire of sensation; the pursuit of happiness; the <foreign xml:lang="fr">mal du si&#232;cle</foreign>;
					and the intrigued and intriguing engagement with memory and love. I read <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
						>Stendhal</name>'s recollections as the revelatory staging of a close encounter between celebrity and fan, and I argue that
						<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections suggest how practices of sensation can be
					understood as part of the affective routines of the fan that are such a vital part of celebrity culture. This essay explores,
					then, this constellation of interests in memory, sensation and love, by examining <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
						>Stendhal</name>'s recollections of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> in relation to the
					productivity and affectivity of the fan. Hence, my emphasis is primarily on the fan, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
						>Stendhal</name>, rather than on the celebrity, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. Focusing on the
					meeting between <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
						>Byron</name> as a particular form of ritualized sociable encounter in the box at La Scala, I examine how <name
						ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recounting of this meeting enacts celebrity culture's transformation
					of stranger to intimate, and how the fan-celebrity relation between <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>
					and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is mediated both by the social materiality of place and by a
					shared devotion to another contemporary idol, Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
				<p><name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections come to us in various textual forms, and are produced
					over about fifteen years from 1817&#8212;1832, in private correspondence, autobiographical fragments and published texts
					(collected in <name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 1954: 196-206). <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

				<div>
					<head>II.</head>
					<p>The meeting between <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name> was destined to be: a match made in heaven on account of worldliness, a shared love of
						Napoleon, a keen interest in the fraught pains and pleasures of amorous memory, and in sensation. Sensation, after all, is
						what <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> found in the poetry of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>: &#8220;Since my first childhood imaginings, I have found a sensation, comparable by its
						immensity and its tenacity, triumphing over all other memories, only in the poems of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Lord <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
						</name>&#8221; (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>
						<title level="m">Roman Journal</title>, 21). With this marvellous billow of ambiguity that attends the Romantic invocation of
						childhood, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> suggests both that the sensation of <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry is the only thing that compares with &#8220;childhood
						imaginings&#8221; <emph>and</emph> that even childhood itself could only imagine the &#8220;sensation&#8221; that <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry later realized. Here, the poems of <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> are not so much the secondary compensation for a lost
						childhood as the sensation that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> has been searching for since
						childhood. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry is the long-lost discovery that transcends
						&#8220;childhood imaginings,&#8221; even as it is augured and desired through them. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry is the sensation that makes this precocious life worth the wait. In such a way, <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> suggests, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
							>Byron</name> retrospectively creates his readers and authors their earliest and most precocious longings.</p>
					<p>As <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> eloquently elaborates, it is the sensation of the poetry
						itself, and not the moral or the truth it represents, which matters, and which so moved <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>'s early readers, for better and worse. As a later reader, <name ref="#ArnoldMatthew"
							type="person">Matthew Arnold</name>, wrote in one of his tributes written in that ambivalent moment of <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s re-evaluation that occurs around 1850: <quote>
							<lg type="stanza">
								<l rend="indent2"> He taught us nothing; but our soul</l>
								<l rend="indent2"> Has <emph>felt</emph> him like the thunder's roll.</l>
							</lg> (<title level="a">Memorial Verses, April 1850</title> 270) </quote> In this aptly sensational meteorological figure,
							<name ref="#ArnoldMatthew" type="person">Arnold</name> suggests how &#8220;<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>'s force&#8221; (272) licensed the deeply participatory reading practices that privileged the
						corporeal and emotional effects of the poetry upon the reader (&#8220;With shivering heart ... with reverential awe&#8221;). A
						privileged topos of celebrity culture is reading &#8212;private, transportable and what <name ref="#RanciereJacques"
							type="person">Jacques Ranci&#232;re</name> terms &#8220;random&#8221; reading experiences (<name ref="#RanciereJacques"
							type="person">Ranci&#232;re</name> 14), and the sensations that are affected through these reading experiences.</p>
					<p>The culture of celebrity that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry both authorizes and is
						expropriated by places a premium on sharing such readerly sensations with the author himself: &#8220;As I told him [<name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>] this one day in Venice, quoting <title level="m">The
							Giaour</title>, he replied, 'That is why it is full of dotted lines. The moment the experience of the age of reason can
						attack one of my images, I abandon it, I don't want the reader to find the same sensations in my work as at the Stock
						Exchange'&#8221; (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, <title level="m">Roman Journal</title> 21).
						Here, as <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is made to corroborate the fan's sensation, he produces
						a distinction between reason and sensation and adopts a characteristically anti-commercial stance. Ironically, these very
						sensations that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> identifies as constitutively opposed to the
						Stock Exchange are in fact dependant upon such commercial institutions. For it is only through highly-developed capitalist
						relations of production and consumption that the particular sensations of print culture and celebrity culture can be
						disseminated as the commodified cultural pleasures &#8220;full of dotted lines&#8221; that they are. <note n="5" place="foot"
							resp="editors"> On <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s relation to the commercial entailments

					</p>
					<p>Against the clich&#233;s of celebrity culture as gushy and excessive, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
							>Stendhal</name>'s meeting with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is marked primarily by
						&#8220;timidity&#8221; and suggests an encounter that is restrained, discreet and even courtly. Indeed, it is so restrained
						that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is rendered speechless: &#8220;Since the conversation had
						languished, M. de Br&#234;me sought to make me speak. This was impossible for me&#8221; (<name ref="#LovellErnest"
							type="person">Lovell</name> 196). But even in silence, there is clich&#233; and emotion and gushiness enough. For when
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> recovers himself sufficiently to be able to speak, he goes
						on to share with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> &#8220;the finest conversation I have ever
						known in my life; a volcano of new ideas and generous sentiments, so mingled that one believed himself to be enjoying them for
						the very first time&#8221; (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 198). Recounting this moment of the social
						sublime, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> subtly draws attention to the difference between
						illusion and reality, and between the past moment of high emotion and the present moment of sober recollection. However, he
						also suggests that this distinction is barely legible and, in the end, rather negligible. For the impulse of the passage is to
						catapult the speaker and the reader of the present moment of recollection back into the past as experienced.</p>
					<p>
						<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name> offer an abbreviated form of &#8220;the exact and scientific description of a brand of
						madness&#8221; that is produced in <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s 1822 work <title level="m"
							>Love</title> (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, <title level="m">Love</title> 25). As with
							<title level="m">Love</title>, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections work to
						demonstrate the specificity of literary representation as distinct from scientific description, but they also show how
						nonetheless emotion can be imbricated with cognition. The cognitive literary critic <name ref="#WaughPatricia" type="person"
							>Patricia Waugh</name> has referred to the unique capacity of literature to &#8220;embody ... the problem of
						knowledge&#8221; by enabling the tension between the subjective and objective points of view to be experienced (<name
							ref="#WaughPatricia" type="person">Waugh</name> 1999: 51, 52). <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
							>Stendhal</name>'s recollections do this too. By inhabiting, in the form of the recollection, both the first-person and
						third-person perspective, and thereby splitting the subject between present and past, they enable the tension between past and
						present to be experienced. This suggests an alternative way of approaching <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
							>Stendhal</name>'s famous disrespect for chronology. Far from casually disregarding chronology, <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> was acutely aware of chronology as a rhetorical convention of
						narrative &#8212; indeed as a rhetorical effect of narrative &#8212;and displayed this awareness in direct addresses to the
						reader: &#8220;After all these observations, I will now be born&#8221; (21), he writes in his autobiography, <title level="m"
							>The Life of Henri Brulard</title> (completed in 1836 and published posthumously in 1890). In this way, he draws attention
						to the tensions and distortions between past and present that are created by the act of retrospective narration.</p>
					<p>We know, then, that these &#8220;new ideas and generous sentiments&#8221; <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
							>Stendhal</name> claims to enjoy in conversation with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> can't
						be so new, if <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is not enjoying them for the first time. But what
						really matters here is the feeling itself &#8212;the sensation. This sensational affective regime of the fan is a fetishistic
						regime. For <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s statement &#8212;&#8220;a volcano of new ideas and
						generous sentiments, so mingled that one believed himself to be enjoying them for the very first time&#8221; &#8212;does not
						so much produce a redeeming and enlightening epistemological distinction between the original and the copy, reason and
						emotion, as recapitulate what <name ref="#&#381;i&#382;ekSlavoj" type="person">Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek</name> refers to as
						&#8220;the formula of fetishism&#8221;: &#8220;I know, but nevertheless ...&#8221;. <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
							These are the words (&#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">Je sais bien, mais quand m&#234;me</foreign>&#8221;) of Octave

						entry into social life of the intense affectivity of fandom, or what <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
							>Stendhal</name>'s contemporaries termed &#8220;idol worship.&#8221;</p>
					<p>Fandom would seem to proceed, then, according to the fetishistic logic that <name ref="#SchorNaomi" type="person">Naomi
							Schor</name> refers to as &#8220;a perpetual oscillation between two incompatible beliefs&#8221; (<name ref="#SchorNaomi"
							type="person">Schor</name> 114). It is this logic of fetishism that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
							>Stendhal</name>'s narrative draws attention to in that earlier moment when he says: &#8220;At that time I was mad about
							<title level="m">Lara</title>. From the second glance, I no longer saw <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
							>Byron</name> as he really was, but as I thought the author of <title level="m">Lara</title> should be.&#8221; This is
						both the knowledge of hindsight (<emph>Only now do I realize I no longer saw <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
								>Byron</name> as he really was</emph>), and the knowledge that is fetishism's disavowal (<emph>I knew my <name
								ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> was the <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
								>Byron</name> I thought he should be rather than the <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> he
							was, but nevertheless</emph>).</p>
					<p>
						<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections participate in the genre of the celebrity
						sighting or what <name ref="#RojekChris" type="person">Chris Rojek</name> has referred to as the &#8220;out-of-face
						encounter&#8221; between celebrity and fan (17). As the dynamic of presence and absence is critical to celebrity affect, the
						textual revisitation of the &#8220;out-of-face&#8221; encounter is about staging the author's presence as a moment of private
						life and staging familiarity with the author. The genre of the celebrity sighting dramatizes celebrity culture's preoccupation
						with embodiment, which is predicated upon distance (see <name ref="#RojekChris" type="person">Rojek</name> 12). As such, it
						engages one of the most striking ironies of celebrity culture, which is that the desire for intimacy increases as access
						becomes more unattainable and distance greater. For this reason, technologies of simulation become more prolific in the labour
						of transforming the distant celebrity stranger into an intimate, predicated as they are upon the disavowal of the distance
						that they in fact materialize. The genre of &#8220;conversations of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
							>Byron</name>&#8221; speaks to celebrity culture's premium upon embodiment and authorial presence, and to a certain
						disavowal of textual mediation. As <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s conversations speak the
						genre, they present the exquisitely productive power of textual mediation in conjuring authorial presence.</p>

						<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s celebrity sighting of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name> is a moment of high emotion. Most significantly, this is a moment of emotion shared between two
						men, one of whom presents himself with the intensity of a lover. This moment encapsulates a particular intensity of emotion
						that informs the proverbial devotion of fan to idol, and which mimics the gestures and emotional intensities of Romantic love.
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s episodic narratives mimic, too, the narrative that Roland
						Barthes has analysed in <title level="m">A Lover's Discourse</title> as the &#8220;scene&#8221; of &#8220;love at first
						sight&#8221;: <quote rendition="#indent2"> the first thing we love is <emph>a scene</emph>. For love at first sight requires

							ever been seen is discovered in its entirety, and then devoured by the eyes: what is immediate stands for what is
							fulfilled: I am initiated: the scene <emph>consecrates</emph> the object I am going to love. (Barthes 192)</quote><lb/> In
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s love-at-first-sighting of <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, the scene is set at La Scala, <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place"
							>Milan</name>, where the curtains part, and what takes place off-stage &#8212;more precisely in the box of M. de
						Br&#234;me &#8212;is moved to centre-stage. (&#8220;I entered M. de Br&#234;me's box on my return from an excursion on Lake
						Como. I found that the gathering had a sort of solemn and awkward air: everybody was silent. I was listening to the music when
						M. de Br&#234;me said to me, indicating my neighbour, 'Monsieur <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>,
						this is <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'.&#8221;)</p>
					<p>As <name ref="#MoonMichael" type="person">Michael Moon</name> notes of Barthes' scene of ravishment, the scene of

							ref="#MoonMichael" type="person">Moon</name> 6). For <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, as he
						writes in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence</title>, it was love at first sight for the scene itself a few weeks
						earlier, when he returned to La Scala after a brief absence from <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>, but presents
						it as though for the very first time, devouring it with his eyes: <quote rendition="#indent2">I was limp with exhaustion; but

							*************************************************************</quote>
						<quote rendition="#indent2"> (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 5: 125)</quote><lb/> The privately owned boxes (<foreign

							<foreign xml:lang="fr">Rendez-vous</foreign> to conduct business and pleasure were lavishly decorated affairs that
						functioned as multi-purpose sociable spaces within the theatre. As Robert Alter elaborates, &#8220;a box at La Scala was more
						like a small parlor than the little overhanging pockets jammed with fixed seats of modern theatres. A party of eight or ten
						could comfortably deploy themselves where they chose, around a pedestal table convenient for reading and card playing, in
						movable chairs by the railing, or on the cushions of the divan set against one wall of the box. This meant that a party at La
						Scala was very much a social group whose activities were limited neither in nature nor duration by the performance on the
						stage below&#8221; (134).</p>
					<p>Taking place on-stage that night of 23 October 1816 was a performance of the opera <title level="m">Elena</title>, a success of
						that season, by Johann Simon Mayr (1763-1845), himself a successful opera composer despite being later eclipsed by the
						renowned Gioacchino Rossini (1792-1868). <note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rossini became the young idol of the Italian

					<p>For all its ravishing social sublimity, the celebrity sighting delivers nevertheless an emphatically different kind of
						ravishment to the love-at-first-sighting. The celebrity sighting is very much a second sight, a &#8220;second-order
						intimacy&#8221; (<name ref="#TurnerGraeme" type="person">Turner</name> 92-3), the deliriously misprisioning sight of what
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> refers to as the &#8220;second glance.&#8221; The celebrity
						is always already known, and so a certain belatedness is at play. Such belatedness also marks the post-Napoleonic social,
						affective and psychic armature of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">mal du si&#232;cle</foreign>, that constitutive feature of French
						Romanticism, with its nostalgic but inhibited desire for the great gesture, compromised by suspicion of gallantry (see
						Brookner, <title level="m">Romanticism</title>, 41ff).</p>
					<p>
						<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s biographer, <name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald" type="person"
							>Paton</name>, would beg to differ from a reading of the meeting between <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
							>Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as a scene of ravishment and idol
						worship: &#8220;But <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> was not on his knees before <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, as if he had been an idol, like thousands of others, whose
						admiration of his verses made them blind to all the personal defects of the man; and <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
							type="person">Beyle</name> tells us roundly that those who saw him close at hand considered him haughty, and even a little
						mad&#8221; (<name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald" type="person">Paton</name> 1874: 122). Indeed, in another recollection of <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, the 20 October 1816 letter to Louis Crozet, <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> refers to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
							>Byron</name> as &#8220;the original of Lovelace,&#8221; and, in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence in
							1817</title> (1817), as &#8220;the most amiable monster that I have ever seen&#8221; (quoted in <name ref="#LovellErnest"
							type="person">Lovell</name> 196). Celebrity affect is, after all, an ambivalent mode of affect. &#8220;The purpose of
						gossip about celebrities,&#8221; as Graeme <name ref="#TurnerGraeme" type="person">Turner</name> points out, &#8220;is not to
						elevate or idealize them as exemplary individuals&#8221; (107); it is about &#8220;modelling, fantasy and
						identification&#8221; (<name ref="#GamsonJoshua" type="person">Gamson</name>, quoted in <name ref="#TurnerGraeme"
							type="person">Turner</name> 110). As a practice of the fan's identity work, gossip involves, then, the production of
						identity through <emph>dis</emph>-identification as much as identification with such amiable monsters. The fan's obsessive
						preoccupation with the private life of the celebrity necessarily entails revealing the bad, the mad and the dangerous to know.
						And, as it turns out, there is quite a lot for <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>

							of Washington. Amusingly, it was not at all the despotic and odious part of Napoleon's character which displeased the

							always pronounced the name of Brummell with a mingled emotion of respect and jealousy&#8221; (201). </note>
					</p>
					<p>In any case, as we already know, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>
						<emph>was</emph> on his knees inside the box of M. de Br&#234;me, if only in the form of the repressed impulse expressed in
						the letter to his cousin, Romain Colomb: &#8220;I was filled with timidity and affection: if I had dared, I would have burst
						into tears and kissed <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'s hand&#8221; (<name
							ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 196). This is love at first sight &#8212;or, at least, &#8220;second
						glance&#8221; &#8212; and he is rendered speechless by the <foreign xml:lang="fr">coup de foudre</foreign> of this first
						sighting. But this speechlessness too is an active structuring impulse, just as his &#8220;timidity&#8221; reflects the
						impulse acting on him as a &#8220;wave of excitation in the nerve.&#8221; Whilst this restraint holds <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> back from outwardly going on his knees for <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, the withheld emotion is later displayed in the autobiographical
						disclosure: not-daring-to is purely rhetorical, for <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> does dare,
						if only in the disclosure. In this way, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s disclosure produces
						one of the ironies of the affect of the fan: that a moment of the display of intense emotion can also be a moment of
						withholding. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s disclosure thereby dramatizes a certain
						complication of the distinction between private feeling and public display that is central to the workings both of celebrity
						affect and the poetry of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as it is read. <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s life and work habitually inspired such displays of emotion, such
						reworkings of the boundaries between public and private, and the spectacularly rhetorical disclosures of the heart that he
						referred to in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> as &#8220;The truth in masquerade&#8221; (XI, 37, 290, <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> 1986: 476). A feature of that rhetorical sophistication is that
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry, to borrow <name ref="#McGannJerome" type="person"
							>Jerome McGann</name>'s memorable formulation, &#8220;is always, at whatever register, elaborating reciprocities with its
						audiences&#8221; (<name ref="#McGannJerome" type="person">McGann</name> 85-6).</p>
					<p>Celebrity culture enables &#8212;indeed would seem to demand &#8212;the mimicry of Romantic love, even in the space of a
						relationship between two men. (So much so that the cultural and discursive genre we refer to as &#8220;Byromania&#8221; also
						involved elaborate recantations, usually on the part of mature authors, such as Edward Bulwer-Lytton and Benjamin Disraeli,
						who looked back on their love of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as a youthful folly [see <name
							ref="#ElfenbeinAndrew" type="person">Elfenbein</name>].) But what kind of relationship between two men? In underscoring
						the proximity of the fan's devotion as a form of love and &#8220;Stendhalian eros,&#8221; I am not suggesting that <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s revelatory staging of intense feeling for <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is intended as a kind of unmasking of himself and his feeling as
						self-evidently homosexual <note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Not that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
								>Stendhal</name> does not have his own homosexual fans, such as the openly homosexual Second Empire dandy Jean Lorrain
							(1855-1906), who paid his homage by adopting the effeminate, diminutive <emph> nom-de-plume</emph>
							&#8220;Stendhaletta&#8221;. As Rhonda Garelick writes, the &#8220;[h]eavily rouged, powdered, openly gay&#8221; Lorrain,
							who presented himself not as a man of fashion but as a <foreign xml:lang="fr">femme du monde</foreign>, was also the
							author of an initiatory fashion text that identifies fashion with cultural memory, <title level="m">
								<foreign xml:lang="fr">La nostalgie de la beaut&#233;</foreign>
							</title> (1912). See Garelick 43-6. Proust challenged Lorrain to a duel after Lorrain publicly implicated Proust as a
							homosexual. See <name ref="#NyeRobertA" type="person">Nye</name> 122-3. </note> &#8212;or even indeed as definitively
							<emph>sexual</emph> (as though what is being revealed here is a knowable and consolidated sexual identity rather than the
						desiring play of eroticised identifications and investments) &#8212;although it is certainly, in all its mobility and
						intensity, very queer. And even though <name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald" type="person">Paton</name>'s image of <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>
						<emph>not</emph> on his knees suggests Leo Bersani's &#8220;seductive and intolerable image of a grown man, legs high in the
						air, unable to refuse the suicidal ecstasy of being a woman&#8221;, that is, of &#8220;getting fucked&#8221; (<title level="a"
							>Rectum</title> 212), unable to refuse the pleasures of &#8220;self-divestiture&#8221; (<title level="m">Homos</title>
						128), and of willingly sacrificing disciplined self-mastery for &#8220;self-shattering and solipsistic jouissance&#8221;
							(<title level="a">Rectum</title> 222).</p>
					<p>The affect of the fan is proverbially like that of the lover, but also <emph>un</emph>like, perversely freighted as it is with
						all kinds of mobile identifications, impulses and intensities of emotion and desire that exceed the boundaries of traditional
						masculine homosociality and subjectivity yet which are not to be overdetermined by sexuality. The affective and discursive
						practices of Romantic fandom are vitally significant because they usher this impulsiveness into sociability, into a world
						where impulse is legible, meaningful and valuable, for all its contradictions. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>'s scandalous celebrity licenses such perversity and inspires a re-imagining of author-reader
						relations, endowing them with new pleasures and sensations. The fandom it generates is a productive affective and social
						economy that spectacularizes the transformative agency of the reader. Far from entailing an exclusively passive position (in
						docile thrall to the sovereignty of author and text), fandom can be seen to transform a traditional textual economy of active
						and passive, thereby enabling reception as a mode of delirious productivity &#8212;proliferating often disobedient and
						indiscreet disclosures &#8212;as <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s fan practices demonstrate in
						abundance.</p>

						<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s numerous recollections are characterized by repetition, the

						genius&#8221; as well as more &#8220;prosaic moments&#8221; (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 197). This
						devotional practice involves the multiplication of nuance and detail, to compare and contrast, enabling the obsessive return

					<p>The meeting between <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
							type="person">Stendhal</name> is a close encounter between celebrity and fan, a sighting of the celebrity. But it is also
						a moment of social presentation: being introduced to a stranger. This drama of social presentation involves reading that

						the subject of Russia&#8221; (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 200).</p>
					<p>The moment in the box is a moment of high emotion, but it is also constrained &#8212;and enabled &#8212;by social ritual. As we
						have seen, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s response to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name> is informed by a withholding of emotion: &#8220;if I had dared I would have.&#8221; However,

							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is &#8220;filled&#8221; with both. To conceive of fandom as a form
						of social ritual is to understand it as something more than a debased, excessive, inauthentic mode of emotion. Rather, it is
						to see it as a complex form of social modernity, aligned with new modes of social performance and presentation, affect and
						publicity, and to see it as an exemplary form of intimate publicity. For what marks the particular encounter between <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
						is both the intensity of emotion and also the restraint with which it is controlled and produced: the ritualization of that
						emotion. As the social theorist Erving Goffman has suggested, &#8220;When in the idol's immediate presence we act with ritual
						care&#8221; (quoted in <name ref="#SmithGreg" type="person">Smith</name> 28).</p>

							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> was at once enthusiastic in favour of Napoleon, and jealous
						of his fame.&#8221; This mutual love for Napoleon explains in retrospect that intriguing paradox of social emotion: &#8220;My
						determination to be cold offers some explanation for the marked kindness with which at the end of a few days, <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> did me the favour to regard me.&#8221; <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is determined to be cold, and this results in kindness from <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. Why? The discovery of a shared Napoleon-love not only rescues and
						redeems an awkward social moment, but also reconfigures the co-ordinates of a map of first impressions shared by the two men
						that assumes national identity to determine political identification. After the discovery, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name> rewards <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> with kindness for his
						loyalty to Napoleon, even when that loyalty has entailed coldness toward himself. The exchange is about the enigma of making a
						connection through being cold. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s friends think they won't be
						friends but they are wrong, for <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> has taken his arm.</p>
					<p>These meetings occur in a relatively circumscribed social space, the theatre box of M. de Br&#234;me, an intriguing figure who
						as a consecrated priest, almoner of the ex-king and leader of the Italian Romantics, mixed exotic forms of Italian social and
						cultural capital. Clearly charmed, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> gives a detailed account of his
						first impression of <quote rendition="#indent2"> Monsignore Lodovico de Br&#234;me, one of Napoleon's almoners for the Kingdom
							of Italy, whence his title. The son of a noble Piedmontese family, destined for the Church, who has been offered two
							bishoprics by Napoleon and one by the people, but wishes rather to unfrock himself than to put on the mitre. He is a young
							man about thirty, wears his dark hair combed upright, which gives him a wildness of expression not unlike that of Alfieri
							[the Italian Romantic poet]. He is, on the whole, one of the most attractive men I ever saw. He gave <name
								ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> a most warm reception, and as Madame de St&#228;el had
							introduced me to him in her letter in favourable terms, was pointedly civil to me. He spoke with a certain degree of point
							on every subject, delivering his apothegems and ironies in the gravest tone, which made him quite irresistible. (<name
								ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> I: 40-41)</quote><lb/> Unable to resist, we might say smitten,
							<name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> has his own moment of love-at-first-sight. Heady fan-love is in
						the air, and the scene takes on the aspects of a mid-summer Shakespearean romance of mistaken identities, multiple love
						objects and deliriously mobile desires, all predicated upon what <name ref="#GirardRene" type="person">Ren&#233; Girard</name>
						refers to as the &#8220;idolatrous worship of otherness&#8221; (197). A sucker for grave ironies, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam"
							type="person">Hobhouse</name> sees in Br&#234;me the same combination of social, cultural and physical power associated
						with the Byronic aura. Br&#234;me’s &#8220;wildness of expression not unlike that of Alfieri&#8221; also mediates the Byronic
						aura (as Alfieri's likeness to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> was noted by contemporaries [see
							<title level="j">BLJ</title> 9: 11]). It is as though <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> here
						displaces his own desire for <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> via Alfieri onto Br&#234;me, who is
						himself drifting in the homosocially shared trancelike obsession with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
							>Byron</name> that he sponsors in his box. In this series of displacements, the cycle of mimetic desire is routed first
						through <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and now through Br&#234;me, to produce two couples of
						admirer and admiree: <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> and Br&#234;me, with Napoleon and
						to a lesser extent Alfieri mediating idols in between.</p>
					<p>This circle of love recalls another one tenderly fantasized by <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
						barely two years before, when he had written to <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> to break the news
						of his engagement to Annabella Milbanke. This extraordinarily moving letter entwines <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"

						becomes &#8220; <emph>that woman</emph> &#8221; [<title level="j">BLJ</title> 5: 120]) within a textbook illustration of
						homosocial triangulation, when <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> asks <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam"
							type="person">Hobhouse</name> to be witness to the ceremony in the same breath as expressing the fond wish that he too
						might be married, so that they might share the experience, &#8220;like people electrified in company through the same
						chain&#8221; (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 4: 213). As it turned out, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person"

							<name ref="#GirardRene" type="person">Girard</name> writes, &#8220;the disquieting infrastructure of mimetic desire&#8221;
						entails the &#8220;necessarily jealous and conflictual nature of mimetic convergence on a single object&#8221; (197). Jealousy
						is alive and well for <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name>, both in <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>'s life and death, and he was notoriously jealous of other pretenders (such as Thomas Moore) to
						the title of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s first-best friend (see <name ref="#HamiltonIan"
							type="person">Hamilton</name>). Despite these rivalries, he acknowledged that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>'s &#8220;power of attaching those about him to his person was such as no one I knew
						possessed&#8221; (<name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> I: 41).</p>
					<p>
						<name ref="#GirardRene" type="person">Girard</name> writes about the love triangle using fan-love &#8212;the &#8220;idolatrous
						worship of otherness&#8221; &#8212;as his model for all desire. Likewise, what Bersani says about sexual desire also holds
						true of fan-love in this giddy scene of homosocial desire: &#8220;Displacement is endemic to sexuality&#8221; and
						&#8220;sexual desire initiates, indeed can be recognized by, an agitated fantasmatic activity in which original (but from the
						start, unlocatable) objects of desire get lost in the images they generate&#8221; (221). The confusion is such that objects of
						hero worship become confused with appropriate objects of desire. Napoleon was particularly vulnerable to such confusions and
						displacements, and offers the exemplary case in point here. The case is dramatized with spectacular force and piquancy in the
						bedroom farces of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s <title level="m">The Red and the
							Black</title> (1830), where a portrait of Napoleon hidden under the bed of Julien Sorel in the home of his Ultra-Royalist
						employer is mistakenly thought to be a portrait of an unidentified secret lover, and <name ref="#HazlittWilliam" type="person"
							>Hazlitt</name>'s <title level="a">Liber Amoris</title> (1823), where H. is simultaneously the rival of a bust of Napoleon
						for the affections of S., &#8220;She is my heart's idol,&#8221;, and the rival of S. herself for that precious little bust of
						Napoleon, &#8220;the god of my idolatry&#8221; (<name ref="#HazlittWilliam" type="person">Hazlitt</name> 45, 28). Struggling
						in the box at La Scala to maintain the line between homosocial and homoerotic desire, it is perhaps just as well that, as
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> writes, &#8220;The company there assembled consists entirely
						of men of letters. No woman ever passes the threshold&#8221; (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>,
							<title level="m">Rome</title> 64). And sure enough, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> presents
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> &#8220;declin[ing] the honour&#8221; of introductions to the

							(<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 202).</p>
					<p>This is, then, a highly gendered, male-homosocial space. It is an aristocratic social space, but also a cosmopolitan one, and a
						specifically Italian form of cosmopolitanism, as <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is at pains to
						point out, noting the social genre of meeting in the box of the aristocrat as a particular form of Italian warmth and
						informality: &#8220;This Italian custom, not generally followed in France, banished all ceremony. The affectation that chills
						the atmosphere of a French saloon is unknown in the society of <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>.&#8221; As his
						dismissive remarks about French social custom underscore, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, like
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, is in happy self-exile from his own country (&#8220;his
						blood / Is all meridian&#8221; [<title level="a">Stanzas to the Po</title> ], and he will eventually have inscribed on his
						gravestone &#8220;Arrigo Beyle, <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>ese&#8221;). In this congenial setting, <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
						rewrite the hoary old script of chilly Anglo-French hostilities into a congenial dialogue of transnational camaraderie, hosted
						by the Italian informality of the box of M. Br&#234;me, which welcomes exiles, and the saloon of La Scala. They too might have
						been trapped as prisoners of memories of war, but they move beyond these dim, shabby &#8220;hulks&#8221; into the light,
						bright and airy, liberal and cosmopolitan, space of the box at La Scala. <note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors"> As a
							radical Whig who opposed the Congress devised by the Liverpool administration, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person"
								>Hobhouse</name> also thrived in this space: &#8220;A persuasion that I am of the Liberal English and, more than all,

					</p>
					<p>The meeting between <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
							type="person">Stendhal</name> dramatizes the poignant liminality of this historical moment when <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and
						Napoleon are all freshly exiled, Napoleon himself living on in the period that can only just be referred to as
						post-Napoleonic, so that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s store of Napoleonic reminiscences
						&#8220;still possessed the charm of novelty&#8221; (<title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence,</title> 1817, quoted in <name
							ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 200). The spectres of &#8220;hulks&#8221; and torture and &#8220;infernal
						machines&#8221; of recent military conflict, that loom early in the conversation and chill the air (making it &#8220;rather
						warm&#8221; in the sense of unfriendly), disintegrate under the spell of an ecumenical Napoleonic aura that banishes these bad
						memories and baleful animosities as so many gloomy ghosts at the table. This reminds us of the powerful mediating force that
						Napoleon was throughout Europe as &#8220;an embodiment of liberty and opposition to monarchical power&#8221; (Bainbridge 137)
						both while he was in power and after. (Of course, Napoleon was also for many the contemporary embodiment of despotism. And
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, who could be full of adoration for Napoleon, was also of
						course famously ambivalent about him and so could be very critical too. But that's another story.) <note n="20" place="foot"
							resp="editors"> This ambivalence is manifest in the <title level="a">Ode to Napoleon</title> (1814), written on the
							occasion of the first abdication. For a compelling analysis of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
								>Byron</name>'s ambivalent relation to Napoleon in the &#8220;Ode&#8221; and elsewhere, see Bainbridge 134-52. On the

					<p>For all his later attacks on <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam"
							type="person">Hobhouse</name> &#8212;also a lover of Napoleon &#8212;entered a highly appreciative account in his diaries
						of the anecdotes that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> gave them of Napoleon. <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, who had been in charge of dispatches, tells of the Emperor
						Francis carefully cutting the seal off dispatches from Napoleon for his Minister, and then &#8220;rubbing it against his
						clothes, smelling it, and giving it its due praise. The eagle was well done, the sword perfect&#8221; (<name
							ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> I: 52-3). He tells of how Napoleon &#8220;never would pronounce the
						word Kaluga&#8221; (a key site in the retreat from Moscow), &#8220;but called it sometimes Caligula, sometimes
						Salamanca,&#8221; and how &#8220;[h]is attendants, who knew what he meant, went on writing or listening without making any
						remark&#8221; (53). And he tells of how he was there during the retreat from Moscow (&#8220;as the reader of any given five
						pages of his writing will not fail to discover&#8221; [<name ref="#JamesHenry" type="person">James</name> 188]), and of how
						during the retreat &#8220;the soldiers burst into tears&#8221; (54).</p>
					<p>In this encounter in the box at La Scala, the stranger who is being introduced is well-known at a distance but can still be
						introduced into a relatively closed circle, according to traditional social protocols. As such, the encounter dramatizes a
						transitional moment in the history of celebrity, which is the transition between the domain of the social and what <name
							ref="#RojekChris" type="person">Chris Rojek</name> refers to as the &#8220;para-social&#8221;, interactions that occur at
						a social distance with people we don't know (<name ref="#RojekChris" type="person">Rojek</name> 52). This is not strictly an
						interface between the poet and the anonymous public, for the box of M. de Br&#234;me is a kind of liminal space between the
						traditional, known audience of social equals, and the wider, anonymous public that literature is moving towards. It is an
						extremely privileged social space, too, that mixes old social class and old money. As <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
							type="person">Stendhal</name> observed, &#8220;A box at La Scala is treated as freehold property, like a house, and may
						change hands for as much as twenty-five thousand francs&#8221; (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>,
							<title level="m">Rome</title> 24-5). Indeed, after the original theatre of <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>
						(the Teatro Regio Ducale) had burned down in 1776, it was the owners of the boxes who lobbied Archduke Ferdinand to build a
						new one, and it was the sale of new boxes that financed the building of La Scala to replace it. The box at La Scala
						emblematises the particular conjunction of social, economic and cultural power that M. de Br&#234;me embodied.</p>
					<p>Not only <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, but <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
							>Byron</name>'s poetry itself charms the box of M. de Br&#234;me, as their host M. de Br&#234;me points out: &#8220;So
						keenly are his works relished by those of his friends who know English that, without ever mentioning it, we are endlessly
						showing him our private admiration&#8221; (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 206). This reserve about
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry is maintained apparently even despite the fact that
						they have an Italian poet in their midst, &#8220;the celebrated Monti,&#8221; who &#8220;graciously recited [his poetry] for
						us,&#8221; and who puts &#8220;<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> ... in raptures.&#8221; So
						relished, so precious is <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry that it has the power to
						become an object of the unspoken in this circle of socially elite men who count a poet among their number. They negotiate this
						desire, and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s charm, through feats of &#8220;private
						admiration.&#8221; Again, like <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> not daring to kiss <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s hand, we see another form of restraint in this meeting with
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. As we've seen, celebrity culture works not always or only
						in terms of the spectacular displays of outrageous affection. It is marked, too, with the protocols of an elite social culture
						of discretion. And <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s discretion is rewarded. For, after the
						poetry recitation: &#8220;From that day, I passed almost every evening with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"

							midnight, all the shops were closed. He would wander amidst empty and ill-lit streets, and without knowing a word of the
							language! In my devoted affection I was so foolish as to advise him to take a carriage. At once a shade of haughtiness
							passed over his face: he gave me to understand, with all necessary politeness, that what he wanted of me was the names of
							the streets, and not advice as to how to use them. He left the box, and I understood why he had reduced it to silence.

						enraptured fan of &#8220;a hundred irresistible impulses.&#8221;</p>
