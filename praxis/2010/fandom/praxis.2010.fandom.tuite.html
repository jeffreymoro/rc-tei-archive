            <p class="noCount">This essay investigates how the concept of fandom might make sense of a reading practice
               that emerged in the romantic period, the practice of visiting places associated with
               authors and their works in order to re-read their works in situ. Focussing on Lady
               Frances Shelley as a typical romantic literary tourist, the essay considers the ways
               in which she (and by extension others) produced new constructions of reading and the
               reader in response to the emergent figure of the romantic author. Shelley's various
               accounts of visiting romantic locales associated with Rousseau, Scott and Byron not
               only provides a conspectus of possible tourist-stances and practices but suggests
               that romantic readers strove to represent themselves on a footing not only of intimacy
               but of social equality with the author, re-establishing a sense of a coterie audience
               in the face of the realities of an increasingly heterogenous mass reading public.</p>

               <p>So Henri Beyle recalls his introduction to Lord Byron in Milan in October 1816 in
                  the theatre of La Scala, in the box of Beyle's friend, Monsieur Ludovic de Brême:
                  “I entered M. de Brême's box on my return from an excursion on Lake Como. I found
                  that the gathering had a sort of solemn and awkward air: everybody was silent. I was
                  listening to the music when M. de Brême said to me, indicating my neighbour, 'Monsieur
                  Beyle, this is Lord Byron'.” (Lovell 196) At this moment, Byron is freshly exiled
                  and just arrived in Italy, trailing scandalous celebrity and the opening flourishes
                  of “[t]he pageant of his bleeding heart” (Arnold, 
                  “Stanzas”
                  ) that came with the separation from his wife, Annabella Milbanke, the ensuing public
                  scandal, and the flight from England. After travelling via Switzerland, where he stayed
                  with Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley at Lake Geneva, Byron has been just over a week
                  in Italy, where he was to live for the rest of his life. Beyle, also in exile, has
                  been mainly in Milan since 1813, when he took leave from Napoleon's army after the
                  retreat from Moscow, and where he would spend the next seven years. When they meet,
                  Monsieur Beyle is still just Beyle, not yet 'Stendhal,' as he will soon become when
                  he adopts this pseudonym for the first time as the author of <em>Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</em> (1817), in which he will recount a different version of this first meeting with Byron—one
                  of many, as it turns out, in private letters and published texts.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While Monsieur Beyle is still Beyle, Lord Byron is for Beyle very much the author
                     identified with his works: “At that time I was mad about <em>Lara</em>. From the second glance, I no longer saw Byron as he really was, but as I thought
                     the author of <em>Lara</em> should be” (Lovell 196). Here, Beyle registers both the power and the radical partiality
                     that marks the gaze of the fan, in the form of this “second glance” and its prerogative
                     to wilfully misread. Beyle's “second glance” enacts what D. A. Miller has referred
                     to as the “Stendhalian eros [that] would seem to depend on love plots engendered from
                     misjudgements and blind spots. Error, as it were, permits the narrateable movement
                     of errantry (wandering, elapsing, delaying) in which finally comes to lie the erotic”
                     (225). Indeed, Stendhal's fondness for irony means that he congenially <em>throws</em> such blind spots and errors to his correspondents and readers as though they were
                     gifts.

                              in “the autumn of 1812” (see Lovell 196), and in the famous misdating of the 1816
                              meeting that is included in Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817.</span></div>

               <p>This essay examines the love plots and errantry that proliferate in Stendhal's recollections
                  of his meeting with Byron. Stendhal's work and life (and the intermediating code of
                  “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beylisme</span>”) is associated most famously with “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la chasse au bonheur</span>” (“the pursuit of happiness”). As I wish to suggest, Stendhal's recollections of
                  Byron are marked by the happy over-investment of affect that has come to be identified
                  with fan practices. A significant feature of Stendhal's account of the meeting is
                  that his emotion is produced after the event, in the act of recollection. The recollections
                  embody, then, a typically Stendhalian concern with the fraught interrelation between
                  desire and memory. For the historical figure of Henri Beyle has offered the consummate
                  allegory of the distortions of memory, and of the contradictions between reason and
                  feeling that memory dramatizes. In W. G. Sebald's historical fiction, 
                  “Beyle, or Love is a Madness Most Discreet”
                  (included in <em>Vertigo</em>), Beyle is made to offer “eloquent proof of the various difficulties entailed in
                  the act of recollection” (Sebald 5). Likewise, the fan Beyle who meets Byron embodies
                  love as a madness most discreet: “if I had dared, I would have burst into tears and
                  kissed Lord Byron's hand” ( Lovell 196).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the first full-length biography of Stendhal, <em>Henry Beyle (otherwise De Stendahl [sic]) A Critical and Biographical Study</em> (1874), Andrew Archibald Paton foregrounds such contradictions between reason and
                     feeling as vital to his subject: “Beyle was a man of genius, but he had a hundred
                     irresistible impulses which could not be squared with reason” (9). 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Paton's biography displayed a certain contradictory charm itself, as Henry James noted
                              in a review in the Nation (17 September 1874): “It contains hardly an opinion which
                              is not ludicrously erratic, and hardly a quotation, a foreign phrase, or a proper
                              name which is not misspelled or misprinted. But the author writes with a garrulous
                              bonhomie —that of an easy-going cosmopolite ... —which will soften the edge of the
                              reader's displeasure; and he is to be thanked at any rate for bringing Beyle once
                              more before the world” (James 187).</span></div>
                     </div> As I wish to suggest, it is precisely such “irresistible impulses” that make up the
                     affective repertoire of fan culture. And nowhere are these impulses offered more readily
                     than in these recollections by Stendhal, the master of memory and emotion. Stendhal's
                     response to Byron is informed both impulsively and masterfully by a withholding or
                     disguising of emotion. As Henry James wrote in his (<em>un</em>withholding and rather mixed) review of Paton's biography, Stendhal's work has “that
                     singular something ... —a kind of painful tension of feeling under the disguise of
                     the coolest and easiest style” (James 189). The beauty of the impulse, and its significance
                     as a way of illuminating fan practices, is that it occupies a liminal position between
                     the desire to act and the act itself. By narrowing the distinction between desire
                     and act —as mere as “a wave of excitation in the nerve” (OED) or an “influence acting
                     upon the mind” (Johnson 1: 954) —the category of the impulse enables a focus upon
                     the mobility and changeability of desire. In this way, Stendhal's impulse to burst
                     into tears and kiss Lord Byron's hand is both expressed and checked.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The impulse is a very similar emotional creature to the sensation. Stendhal was a
                  keen follower of the sensationalism of the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">idéologues</span> — materialist philosophers and psychologists such as Condorect, Condillac, Tracy,
                  and Stendhal's revered Cabanis, the physician and materialist philosopher from whom
                  he borrowed his “woman's skin”: “I will borrow for an instant the language of Cabanis.
                  I have too fine a skin, a woman's skin ...; I graze my fingers, which are very fine,
                  for a trifle; in a word, the surface of my body is feminine” (Stendhal, <em>Life</em> 120). Revolutionaries and Republicans with a total system that conceived of personal
                  happiness as an effect of political liberty, the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">idéologues</span> disregarded the question of classical form when it came to literature and emphasized
                  the effect of the literary work upon reason, sensibility and imagination —its status,
                  in other words, as sensation.</p>
               <p>As I will argue in this essay, Stendhal's emphasis on sensation is also legible in
                  relation to the forms of celebrity culture. Stendhal's recollections of Byron offer
                  a different way of approaching the classic Stendhalian affective repertoire of sensation;
                  the pursuit of happiness; the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mal du siècle</span>; and the intrigued and intriguing engagement with memory and love. I read Stendhal's
                  recollections as the revelatory staging of a close encounter between celebrity and
                  fan, and I argue that Stendhal's recollections suggest how practices of sensation
                  can be understood as part of the affective routines of the fan that are such a vital
                  part of celebrity culture. This essay explores, then, this constellation of interests
                  in memory, sensation and love, by examining Stendhal's recollections of Byron in relation
                  to the productivity and affectivity of the fan. Hence, my emphasis is primarily on
                  the fan, Stendhal, rather than on the celebrity, Byron. Focusing on the meeting between
                  Stendhal and Byron as a particular form of ritualized sociable encounter in the box
                  at La Scala, I examine how Stendhal's recounting of this meeting enacts celebrity
                  culture's transformation of stranger to intimate, and how the fan-celebrity relation
                  between Stendhal and Byron is mediated both by the social materiality of place and
                  by a shared devotion to another contemporary idol, Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

                     </div> With the exception of <em>Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</em> (1817), all of these accounts take their place within the flood of published recollections
                     that appear in the wake of Byron's death in April 1824. These comprise the new genres
                     of the “conversations of Byron” and “recollections of Byron,” which included recollections
                     by such figures as Thomas Medwin, Lady Blessington, John Galt, Thomas Moore and, some
                     time later, Teresa Guiccioli. Stendhal's recollections, like those of almost everyone
                     else, did not go uncontested. In particular, John Cam Hobhouse, Byron's closest friend
                     and executor, who accompanied Byron during these encounters in Milan, described Stendhal's
                     eye-witness account, 
                     “<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Lord Byron en Italie, récit d'un témoin oculaire</span>”
                      (1830), as “a tissue of fictions.”

                              Frenchman,” 372-95. Moore's highly unsympathetic account of Stendhal takes its cues
                              from Hobhouse and reads Stendhal's recollections as “published exploitation” (374).

                  pains and pleasures of amorous memory, and in sensation. Sensation, after all, is
                  what Stendhal found in the poetry of Byron: “Since my first childhood imaginings,
                  I have found a sensation, comparable by its immensity and its tenacity, triumphing
                  over all other memories, only in the poems of Lord Byron ” ( Stendhal <em>Roman Journal</em>, 21). With this marvellous billow of ambiguity that attends the Romantic invocation
                  of childhood, Stendhal suggests both that the sensation of Byron's poetry is the only
                  thing that compares with “childhood imaginings” <em>and</em> that even childhood itself could only imagine the “sensation” that Byron's poetry
                  later realized. Here, the poems of Lord Byron are not so much the secondary compensation
                  for a lost childhood as the sensation that Stendhal has been searching for since childhood.
                  Byron's poetry is the long-lost discovery that transcends “childhood imaginings,”
                  even as it is augured and desired through them. Byron's poetry is the sensation that
                  makes this precocious life worth the wait. In such a way, Stendhal suggests, Byron
                  retrospectively creates his readers and authors their earliest and most precocious
                  longings.</p>
               <p>As Stendhal eloquently elaborates, it is the sensation of the poetry itself, and not
                  the moral or the truth it represents, which matters, and which so moved Byron's early
                  readers, for better and worse. As a later reader, Matthew Arnold, wrote in one of
                  his tributes written in that ambivalent moment of Byron's re-evaluation that occurs
                  around 1850: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">He taught us nothing; but our soul</div>
                     <div class="l">Has <em>felt</em> him like the thunder's roll.</div>
                  </div> (
                  “Memorial Verses, April 1850”
                  270)</blockquote>
               <p> In this aptly sensational meteorological figure, Arnold suggests how “Byron's force”
                  (272) licensed the deeply participatory reading practices that privileged the corporeal
                  and emotional effects of the poetry upon the reader (“With shivering heart ... with
                  reverential awe”). A privileged topos of celebrity culture is reading —private, transportable
                  and what Jacques Rancière terms “random” reading experiences (Rancière 14), and the
                  sensations that are affected through these reading experiences.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The culture of celebrity that Byron's poetry both authorizes and is expropriated by
                     places a premium on sharing such readerly sensations with the author himself: “As
                     I told him [ Byron] this one day in Venice, quoting <em>The Giaour</em>, he replied, 'That is why it is full of dotted lines. The moment the experience of
                     the age of reason can attack one of my images, I abandon it, I don't want the reader
                     to find the same sensations in my work as at the Stock Exchange'” (Stendhal, <em>Roman Journal</em> 21). Here, as Byron is made to corroborate the fan's sensation, he produces a distinction
                     between reason and sensation and adopts a characteristically anti-commercial stance.
                     Ironically, these very sensations that Byron identifies as constitutively opposed
                     to the Stock Exchange are in fact dependant upon such commercial institutions. For
                     it is only through highly-developed capitalist relations of production and consumption
                     that the particular sensations of print culture and celebrity culture can be disseminated
                     as the commodified cultural pleasures “full of dotted lines” that they are.

               <p>Against the clichés of celebrity culture as gushy and excessive, Stendhal's meeting
                  with Byron is marked primarily by “timidity” and suggests an encounter that is restrained,
                  discreet and even courtly. Indeed, it is so restrained that Stendhal is rendered speechless:
                  “Since the conversation had languished, M. de Brême sought to make me speak. This
                  was impossible for me” (Lovell 196). But even in silence, there is cliché and emotion
                  and gushiness enough. For when Stendhal recovers himself sufficiently to be able to
                  speak, he goes on to share with Byron “the finest conversation I have ever known in
                  my life; a volcano of new ideas and generous sentiments, so mingled that one believed
                  himself to be enjoying them for the very first time” ( &gt;Lovell 198). Recounting this
                  moment of the social sublime, Stendhal subtly draws attention to the difference between
                  illusion and reality, and between the past moment of high emotion and the present
                  moment of sober recollection. However, he also suggests that this distinction is barely
                  legible and, in the end, rather negligible. For the impulse of the passage is to catapult
                  the speaker and the reader of the present moment of recollection back into the past
                  as experienced.</p>
               <p>Stendhal's recollections of Byron offer an abbreviated form of “the exact and scientific
                  description of a brand of madness” that is produced in Stendhal's 1822 work <em>Love</em> ( Stendhal, <em>Love</em> 25). As with <em>Love</em>, Stendhal's recollections work to demonstrate the specificity of literary representation
                  as distinct from scientific description, but they also show how nonetheless emotion
                  can be imbricated with cognition. The cognitive literary critic Patricia Waugh has
                  referred to the unique capacity of literature to “embody ... the problem of knowledge”
                  by enabling the tension between the subjective and objective points of view to be
                  experienced (Waugh 1999: 51, 52). Stendhal's recollections do this too. By inhabiting,
                  in the form of the recollection, both the first-person and third-person perspective,
                  and thereby splitting the subject between present and past, they enable the tension
                  between past and present to be experienced. This suggests an alternative way of approaching
                  Stendhal's famous disrespect for chronology. Far from casually disregarding chronology,
                  Stendhal was acutely aware of chronology as a rhetorical convention of narrative —
                  indeed as a rhetorical effect of narrative —and displayed this awareness in direct
                  addresses to the reader: “After all these observations, I will now be born” (21),
                  he writes in his autobiography, <em>The Life of Henri Brulard</em> (completed in 1836 and published posthumously in 1890). In this way, he draws attention
                  to the tensions and distortions between past and present that are created by the act
                  of retrospective narration.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>We know, then, that these “new ideas and generous sentiments” Stendhal claims to enjoy
                     in conversation with Byron can't be so new, if Stendhal is not enjoying them for the
                     first time. But what really matters here is the feeling itself —the sensation. This
                     sensational affective regime of the fan is a fetishistic regime. For Stendhal's statement
                     —“a volcano of new ideas and generous sentiments, so mingled that one believed himself
                     to be enjoying them for the very first time” —does not so much produce a redeeming
                     and enlightening epistemological distinction between the original and the copy, reason
                     and emotion, as recapitulate what Slavoj Žižek refers to as “the formula of fetishism”:
                     “I know, but nevertheless ...”.

                              of these words as the “formula of fetishism”, see Žižek 245. See also Schor 113-116.</span></div>

                        but nevertheless</em>.) Such a vindication of affect in the face of disbelieving reality works to consecrate
                     the entry into social life of the intense affectivity of fandom, or what Stendhal's
                     contemporaries termed “idol worship.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>Fandom would seem to proceed, then, according to the fetishistic logic that Naomi
                  Schor refers to as “a perpetual oscillation between two incompatible beliefs” (Schor
                  114). It is this logic of fetishism that Stendhal's narrative draws attention to in
                  that earlier moment when he says: “At that time I was mad about <em>Lara</em>. From the second glance, I no longer saw Byron as he really was, but as I thought
                  the author of <em>Lara</em> should be.” This is both the knowledge of hindsight (<em>Only now do I realize I no longer saw Byron as he really was</em>), and the knowledge that is fetishism's disavowal (<em>I knew my Byron was the Byron I thought he should be rather than the Byron he was,
                     but nevertheless</em>).</p>
               <p>Stendhal's recollections participate in the genre of the celebrity sighting or what
                  Chris Rojek has referred to as the “out-of-face encounter” between celebrity and fan
                  (17). As the dynamic of presence and absence is critical to celebrity affect, the
                  textual revisitation of the “out-of-face” encounter is about staging the author's
                  presence as a moment of private life and staging familiarity with the author. The
                  genre of the celebrity sighting dramatizes celebrity culture's preoccupation with
                  embodiment, which is predicated upon distance (see Rojek 12). As such, it engages
                  one of the most striking ironies of celebrity culture, which is that the desire for
                  intimacy increases as access becomes more unattainable and distance greater. For this
                  reason, technologies of simulation become more prolific in the labour of transforming
                  the distant celebrity stranger into an intimate, predicated as they are upon the disavowal
                  of the distance that they in fact materialize. The genre of “conversations of Byron”
                  speaks to celebrity culture's premium upon embodiment and authorial presence, and
                  to a certain disavowal of textual mediation. As Stendhal's conversations speak the
                  genre, they present the exquisitely productive power of textual mediation in conjuring
                  authorial presence.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">III.</span></h2>
               <p>Stendhal's celebrity sighting of Byron is a moment of high emotion. Most significantly,
                  this is a moment of emotion shared between two men, one of whom presents himself with
                  the intensity of a lover. This moment encapsulates a particular intensity of emotion
                  that informs the proverbial devotion of fan to idol, and which mimics the gestures
                  and emotional intensities of Romantic love. Stendhal's episodic narratives mimic,
                  too, the narrative that Roland Barthes has analysed in <em>A Lover's Discourse</em> as the “scene” of “love at first sight”: <span class="indent2">the first thing we love is <em>a scene</em>. For love at first sight requires the very scene of its suddenness (what makes me
                     irresponsible, subject to fatality, swept away, ravished): and of all the arrangements
                     of objects, it is the scene which seems to be seen best for the first time: a curtain
                     parts: what had not yet ever been seen is discovered in its entirety, and then devoured
                     by the eyes: what is immediate stands for what is fulfilled: I am initiated: the scene
                     <em>consecrates</em> the object I am going to love. (Barthes 192)</span><br/> In Stendhal's love-at-first-sighting of Byron, the scene is set at La Scala, Milan,
                  where the curtains part, and what takes place off-stage —more precisely in the box
                  of M. de Brême —is moved to centre-stage. (“I entered M. de Brême's box on my return
                  from an excursion on Lake Como. I found that the gathering had a sort of solemn and
                  awkward air: everybody was silent. I was listening to the music when M. de Brême said
                  to me, indicating my neighbour, 'Monsieur Beyle, this is Lord Byron'.”)</p>
               <p>As Michael Moon notes of Barthes' scene of ravishment, the scene of love-at-first-sight
                  requires not so much the “beloved-at-first-sight” as “the scene itself” (Moon 6).
                  For Stendhal, as he writes in <em>Rome, Naples and Florence</em>, it was love at first sight for the scene itself a few weeks earlier, when he returned
                  to La Scala after a brief absence from Milan, but presents it as though for the very
                  first time, devouring it with his eyes: <span class="indent2">I was limp with exhaustion; but I dragged myself straight off to La Scala ... and
                     there, at one stroke, lay the justification of my journey. My senses were so weary

                     most exotic intricacy of an oriental imagination may evolve, all that is most baroque

                     be coaxed into reality through the symbolism of characters who have not merely the
                     costume, but the very faces and gestures of their make-belief and alien lands ...

               <p> <span class="indent2">(25 September 1816; <em>Rome</em> 6-7)</span><br/> Byron is also impressed by the multiple uses to which La Scala generously put itself
                  for Milan society: </p>
               <blockquote class="indent2"> All society in Milan is carried on at the opera: they have private boxes, where they
                  play cards, or talk, or any thing else; but (except at the Cassino) there are no open
                  houses, or balls, &amp;c., &amp;c. *************************************************************</blockquote>
               <p> <span class="indent2">(<em>BLJ</em> 5: 125)</span><br/> The privately owned boxes (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="it" lang="it">palchi</span>) where elite Milanese like M. de Brême would <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Rendez-vous</span> to conduct business and pleasure were lavishly decorated affairs that functioned
                  as multi-purpose sociable spaces within the theatre. As Robert Alter elaborates, “a
                  box at La Scala was more like a small parlor than the little overhanging pockets jammed
                  with fixed seats of modern theatres. A party of eight or ten could comfortably deploy
                  themselves where they chose, around a pedestal table convenient for reading and card
                  playing, in movable chairs by the railing, or on the cushions of the divan set against
                  one wall of the box. This meant that a party at La Scala was very much a social group
                  whose activities were limited neither in nature nor duration by the performance on
                  the stage below” (134).</p>

               <p>For all its ravishing social sublimity, the celebrity sighting delivers nevertheless
                  an emphatically different kind of ravishment to the love-at-first-sighting. The celebrity
                  sighting is very much a second sight, a “second-order intimacy” ( Turner 92-3), the
                  deliriously misprisioning sight of what Stendhal refers to as the “second glance.”
                  The celebrity is always already known, and so a certain belatedness is at play. Such
                  belatedness also marks the post-Napoleonic social, affective and psychic armature
                  of the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mal du siècle</span>, that constitutive feature of French Romanticism, with its nostalgic but inhibited
                  desire for the great gesture, compromised by suspicion of gallantry (see Brookner,
                  <em>Romanticism</em>, 41ff).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Stendhal's biographer, Paton, would beg to differ from a reading of the meeting between
                     Stendhal and Byron as a scene of ravishment and idol worship: “But Beyle was not on
                     his knees before Byron, as if he had been an idol, like thousands of others, whose
                     admiration of his verses made them blind to all the personal defects of the man; and
                     Beyle tells us roundly that those who saw him close at hand considered him haughty,
                     and even a little mad” ( Paton 1874: 122). Indeed, in another recollection of Byron,
                     the 20 October 1816 letter to Louis Crozet, &gt;Beyle refers to Byron as “the original
                     of Lovelace,” and, in <em>Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</em> (1817), as “the most amiable monster that I have ever seen” (quoted in Lovell 196).
                     Celebrity affect is, after all, an ambivalent mode of affect. “The purpose of gossip
                     about celebrities,” as Graeme Turner points out, “is not to elevate or idealize them
                     as exemplary individuals” (107); it is about “modelling, fantasy and identification”
                     (Gamson, quoted in Turner 110). As a practice of the fan's identity work, gossip involves,
                     then, the production of identity through <em>dis</em>-identification as much as identification with such amiable monsters. The fan's obsessive
                     preoccupation with the private life of the celebrity necessarily entails revealing
                     the bad, the mad and the dangerous to know. And, as it turns out, there is quite a
                     lot for Stendhal <em>not</em> to like about Byron.

                              more easily if he had had a little of the colourlessness of Washington. Amusingly,
                              it was not at all the despotic and odious part of Napoleon's character which displeased
                              the English peer” (Lovell 197). He also presents a Byron jealous of Brummell: “in
                              his moments of dandyism, he always pronounced the name of Brummell with a mingled
                              emotion of respect and jealousy” (201). </span></div>

               </div>
               <p>In any case, as we already know, Beyle <em>was</em> on his knees inside the box of M. de Brême, if only in the form of the repressed
                  impulse expressed in the letter to his cousin, Romain Colomb: “I was filled with timidity
                  and affection: if I had dared, I would have burst into tears and kissed Lord Byron's
                  hand” (Lovell 196). This is love at first sight —or, at least, “second glance” — and
                  he is rendered speechless by the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de foudre</span> of this first sighting. But this speechlessness too is an active structuring impulse,
                  just as his “timidity” reflects the impulse acting on him as a “wave of excitation
                  in the nerve.” Whilst this restraint holds Beyle back from outwardly going on his
                  knees for Byron, the withheld emotion is later displayed in the autobiographical disclosure:
                  not-daring-to is purely rhetorical, for Stendhal does dare, if only in the disclosure.
                  In this way, Stendhal's disclosure produces one of the ironies of the affect of the
                  fan: that a moment of the display of intense emotion can also be a moment of withholding.
                  Stendhal's disclosure thereby dramatizes a certain complication of the distinction
                  between private feeling and public display that is central to the workings both of
                  celebrity affect and the poetry of Byron as it is read. Byron's life and work habitually
                  inspired such displays of emotion, such reworkings of the boundaries between public
                  and private, and the spectacularly rhetorical disclosures of the heart that he referred
                  to in <em>Don Juan</em> as “The truth in masquerade” (XI, 37, 290, Byron 1986: 476). A feature of that rhetorical
                  sophistication is that Byron's poetry, to borrow Jerome McGann's memorable formulation,
                  “is always, at whatever register, elaborating reciprocities with its audiences” (McGann
                  85-6).</p>

                     it is certainly, in all its mobility and intensity, very queer. And even though Paton's
                     image of Stendhal <em>not</em> on his knees suggests Leo Bersani's “seductive and intolerable image of a grown man,
                     legs high in the air, unable to refuse the suicidal ecstasy of being a woman”, that
                     is, of “getting fucked” (
                     “Rectum”
                      212), unable to refuse the pleasures of “self-divestiture” (<em>Homos</em> 128), and of willingly sacrificing disciplined self-mastery for “self-shattering and

               <p>The affect of the fan is proverbially like that of the lover, but also <em>un</em>like, perversely freighted as it is with all kinds of mobile identifications, impulses

                  homosociality and subjectivity yet which are not to be overdetermined by sexuality.
                  The affective and discursive practices of Romantic fandom are vitally significant
                  because they usher this impulsiveness into sociability, into a world where impulse
                  is legible, meaningful and valuable, for all its contradictions. Byron's scandalous
                  celebrity licenses such perversity and inspires a re-imagining of author-reader relations,
                  endowing them with new pleasures and sensations. The fandom it generates is a productive
                  affective and social economy that spectacularizes the transformative agency of the
                  reader. Far from entailing an exclusively passive position (in docile thrall to the
                  sovereignty of author and text), fandom can be seen to transform a traditional textual
                  economy of active and passive, thereby enabling reception as a mode of delirious productivity

                     In the years after Byron's death, John Cam Hobhouse, Byron's closest friend and executor,

                     as well as the letters and memoirs that enabled people to profit from these memories.
                     (Having said that, Hobhouse's position was complicated and somewhat compromised by

                              Byron had originally given Moore the MS of his memoirs to raise money. Moore opposed

               <p>The moment in the box is a moment of high emotion, but it is also constrained —and
                  enabled —by social ritual. As we have seen, Stendhal's response to Byron is informed
                  by a withholding of emotion: “if I had dared I would have.” However, this not-daring
                  “timidity” is also an active structuring impulse, in play with “affection,” for Stendhal
                  is “filled” with both. To conceive of fandom as a form of social ritual is to understand
                  it as something more than a debased, excessive, inauthentic mode of emotion. Rather,
                  it is to see it as a complex form of social modernity, aligned with new modes of social
                  performance and presentation, affect and publicity, and to see it as an exemplary
                  form of intimate publicity. For what marks the particular encounter between Stendhal
                  and Byron is both the intensity of emotion and also the restraint with which it is
                  controlled and produced: the ritualization of that emotion. As the social theorist
                  Erving Goffman has suggested, “When in the idol's immediate presence we act with ritual
                  care” (quoted in Smith 28).</p>

               <p>We act with ritual care, but also with a sense of strategy. For once the introduction
                  between Stendhal and Byron has been made, strategic skirmishes ensue on the subject
                  of the recent Anglo-French hostilities. As Stendhal writes: <span class="indent2">I idolized Napoleon, and replied to his Lordship [Byron] as I should have done to
                     a member of the legislative assembly who had exiled the ex-emperor to St. Helena.
                     I subsequently discovered that Lord Byron was at once enthusiastic in favour of Napoleon,
                     and jealous of his fame. He used to say, “Napoleon and myself are the only individuals
                     who sign our names with the initials N.B.” (Noel Byron.)</span> <span class="indent2">My determination to be cold offers some explanation for the marked kindness with which,
                     at the end of a few days, Lord Byron did me the favour to regard me. One evening,
                     however, he spoke to me without cause of the immorality of the French character. I
                     replied firmly and mentioned the hulks where the English had tortured French prisoners
                     of war, of the deaths of Russian emperors, happening always at such a convenient time
                     for English interests, of infernal machines, etc. etc. Our friends in the box imagined
                     that the discussion which had taken place, and which, though polite and respectful
                     on my part, had been rather warm, would prevent any further intimacy between us. They
                     were mistaken. The next evening his Lordship took me by the arm, and walked me for
                     an hour in the saloon of the Theatre de la Scala.</span> <span class="indent2">(
                     “Lord Byron en Italie,”
                     1830, quoted in Lovell 1954: 200)</span><br/> This passage elaborates a gradual transformation from stranger to intimate, as each
                  man is required to negotiate the often oblique social signs that the other puts into
                  circulation. It is about the tactical manoeuvres of social affect and social intimacy,
                  which involve emotional withholding: giving out coldness when one feels warmth. But
                  it is also about the expectation that this paradoxical coldness will be read, and
                  worked through, as indeed it is, when Stendhal discovers that Byron is not the typical
                  “member of the legislative assembly who had exiled the ex-emperor to St Helena. I
                  subsequently discovered that Lord Byron was at once enthusiastic in favour of Napoleon,
                  and jealous of his fame.” This mutual love for Napoleon explains in retrospect that
                  intriguing paradox of social emotion: “My determination to be cold offers some explanation
                  for the marked kindness with which at the end of a few days, Lord Byron did me the
                  favour to regard me.” Stendhal is determined to be cold, and this results in kindness
                  from Byron. Why? The discovery of a shared Napoleon-love not only rescues and redeems
                  an awkward social moment, but also reconfigures the co-ordinates of a map of first
                  impressions shared by the two men that assumes national identity to determine political
                  identification. After the discovery, Byron rewards Stendhal with kindness for his
                  loyalty to Napoleon, even when that loyalty has entailed coldness toward himself.
                  The exchange is about the enigma of making a connection through being cold. Stendhal's
                  friends think they won't be friends but they are wrong, for Byron has taken his arm.</p>
               <p>These meetings occur in a relatively circumscribed social space, the theatre box of
                  M. de Brême, an intriguing figure who as a consecrated priest, almoner of the ex-king
                  and leader of the Italian Romantics, mixed exotic forms of Italian social and cultural
                  capital. Clearly charmed, Hobhouse gives a detailed account of his first impression
                  of <span class="indent2">Monsignore Lodovico de Brême, one of Napoleon's almoners for the Kingdom of Italy,
                     whence his title. The son of a noble Piedmontese family, destined for the Church,
                     who has been offered two bishoprics by Napoleon and one by the people, but wishes
                     rather to unfrock himself than to put on the mitre. He is a young man about thirty,
                     wears his dark hair combed upright, which gives him a wildness of expression not unlike
                     that of Alfieri [the Italian Romantic poet]. He is, on the whole, one of the most
                     attractive men I ever saw. He gave Lord Byron a most warm reception, and as Madame
                     de Stäel had introduced me to him in her letter in favourable terms, was pointedly
                     civil to me. He spoke with a certain degree of point on every subject, delivering
                     his apothegems and ironies in the gravest tone, which made him quite irresistible.
                     (Hobhouse I: 40-41)</span><br/> Unable to resist, we might say smitten, Hobhouse has his own moment of love-at-first-sight.
                  Heady fan-love is in the air, and the scene takes on the aspects of a mid-summer Shakespearean
                  romance of mistaken identities, multiple love objects and deliriously mobile desires,
                  all predicated upon what René Girard refers to as the “idolatrous worship of otherness”
                  (197). A sucker for grave ironies, Hobhouse sees in Brême the same combination of
                  social, cultural and physical power associated with the Byronic aura. Brême’s “wildness
                  of expression not unlike that of Alfieri” also mediates the Byronic aura (as Alfieri's
                  likeness to Byron was noted by contemporaries [see <em>BLJ</em> 9: 11]). It is as though Hobhouse here displaces his own desire for Byron via Alfieri
                  onto Brême, who is himself drifting in the homosocially shared trancelike obsession
                  with Byron that he sponsors in his box. In this series of displacements, the cycle
                  of mimetic desire is routed first through Byron and now through Brême, to produce
                  two couples of admirer and admiree: Beyle and Byron, Hobhouse and Brême, with Napoleon
                  and to a lesser extent Alfieri mediating idols in between.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This circle of love recalls another one tenderly fantasized by Byron barely two years
                     before, when he had written to Hobhouse to break the news of his engagement to Annabella
                     Milbanke. This extraordinarily moving letter entwines Byron's most gentle and optimistic
                     feelings for Milbanke (“my intended”, before she becomes “ <em>that woman</em> ” [<em>BLJ</em> 5: 120]) within a textbook illustration of homosocial triangulation, when Byron asks
                     Hobhouse to be witness to the ceremony in the same breath as expressing the fond wish
                     that he too might be married, so that they might share the experience, “like people
                     electrified in company through the same chain” (<em>BLJ</em> 4: 213). As it turned out, Hobhouse witnessed the marriage, the bitter separation
                     and the never-ending degradation of “my intended,” Annabella Milbanke, into “the bitch
                     my wife” (<em>BLJ</em> 6: 95), “that infernal fiend” (<em>BLJ</em> 6: 129), that “<span xml:lang="it" lang="it" class="foreign">Porca buzzerena</span>” (<em>BLJ</em> 6: 131), or sodomite sow.

                     “No human being could approach him without being sensible of this magical influence”
                     (Hobhouse III: 41).

                              homosocially configured magic circle of love, when he spent the summer at Lake Geneva
                              with Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley and Claire Clairmont from May until August.
                              As Byron was to write of this summer of love, when Shelley “dosed” him with Wordsworth
                              as he was writing Childe Harold III, “I was half mad during the time of its composition,

                              night of October 1816 came in July 1818, when Hobhouse's 
                              “Essay on the Present Literature of Italy”
                              appeared as part of his Historical illustrations of the fourth canto of Childe Harold:
                              containing dissertations on the ruins of Rome; and an essay on Italian literature

                     </div> As Girard writes, “the disquieting infrastructure of mimetic desire” entails the “necessarily
                     jealous and conflictual nature of mimetic convergence on a single object” (197). Jealousy
                     is alive and well for Hobhouse, both in Byron's life and death, and he was notoriously
                     jealous of other pretenders (such as Thomas Moore) to the title of Byron's first-best
                     friend (see Hamilton). Despite these rivalries, he acknowledged that Byron's “power
                     of attaching those about him to his person was such as no one I knew possessed” (Hobhouse
                     I: 41).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Girard writes about the love triangle using fan-love —the “idolatrous worship of otherness”
                  —as his model for all desire. Likewise, what Bersani says about sexual desire also
                  holds true of fan-love in this giddy scene of homosocial desire: “Displacement is
                  endemic to sexuality” and “sexual desire initiates, indeed can be recognized by, an
                  agitated fantasmatic activity in which original (but from the start, unlocatable)
                  objects of desire get lost in the images they generate” (221). The confusion is such
                  that objects of hero worship become confused with appropriate objects of desire. Napoleon
                  was particularly vulnerable to such confusions and displacements, and offers the exemplary
                  case in point here. The case is dramatized with spectacular force and piquancy in
                  the bedroom farces of Stendhal's <em>The Red and the Black</em> (1830), where a portrait of Napoleon hidden under the bed of Julien Sorel in the
                  home of his Ultra-Royalist employer is mistakenly thought to be a portrait of an unidentified
                  secret lover, and Hazlitt's 
                  “Liber Amoris”
                  (1823), where H. is simultaneously the rival of a bust of Napoleon for the affections
                  of S., “She is my heart's idol,”, and the rival of S. herself for that precious little
                  bust of Napoleon, “the god of my idolatry” (Hazlitt 45, 28). Struggling in the box
                  at La Scala to maintain the line between homosocial and homoerotic desire, it is perhaps
                  just as well that, as Stendhal writes, “The company there assembled consists entirely
                  of men of letters. No woman ever passes the threshold” (Stendhal, <em>Rome</em> 64). And sure enough, Stendhal presents Byron “declin[ing] the honour” of introductions
                  to the “assemblage of lovely women as that which chance had collected in Milan” (Lovell
                  202).</p>

                  <p>This is, then, a highly gendered, male-homosocial space. It is an aristocratic social
                     space, but also a cosmopolitan one, and a specifically Italian form of cosmopolitanism,
                     as Stendhal is at pains to point out, noting the social genre of meeting in the box
                     of the aristocrat as a particular form of Italian warmth and informality: “This Italian
                     custom, not generally followed in France, banished all ceremony. The affectation that
                     chills the atmosphere of a French saloon is unknown in the society of Milan.” As his
                     dismissive remarks about French social custom underscore, Stendhal, like Byron, is
                     in happy self-exile from his own country (“his blood / Is all meridian” [
                     “Stanzas to the Po”
                      ], and he will eventually have inscribed on his gravestone “Arrigo Beyle, Milanese”).
                     In this congenial setting, Stendhal and Byron rewrite the hoary old script of chilly
                     Anglo-French hostilities into a congenial dialogue of transnational camaraderie, hosted
                     by the Italian informality of the box of M. Brême, which welcomes exiles, and the
                     saloon of La Scala. They too might have been trapped as prisoners of memories of war,
                     but they move beyond these dim, shabby “hulks” into the light, bright and airy, liberal
                     and cosmopolitan, space of the box at La Scala.

                     himself living on in the period that can only just be referred to as post-Napoleonic,
                     so that Stendhal's store of Napoleonic reminiscences “still possessed the charm of
                     novelty” (<em>Rome, Naples and Florence,</em> 1817, quoted in Lovell 200). The spectres of “hulks” and torture and “infernal machines”
                     of recent military conflict, that loom early in the conversation and chill the air
                     (making it “rather warm” in the sense of unfriendly), disintegrate under the spell

                     as so many gloomy ghosts at the table. This reminds us of the powerful mediating force
                     that Napoleon was throughout Europe as “an embodiment of liberty and opposition to
                     monarchical power” (Bainbridge 137) both while he was in power and after. (Of course,
                     Napoleon was also for many the contemporary embodiment of despotism. And Byron, who
                     could be full of adoration for Napoleon, was also of course famously ambivalent about
                     him and so could be very critical too. But that's another story.)

                              134-52. On the diversity of views amongst English sympathizers with Napoleon, see
                              the classic study by E. Tangye Lean, The Napoleonists: A Study in Political Diasaffection

               <p>For all his later attacks on Stendhal, Hobhouse —also a lover of Napoleon —entered
                  a highly appreciative account in his diaries of the anecdotes that Stendhal gave them
                  of Napoleon. Stendhal, who had been in charge of dispatches, tells of the Emperor
                  Francis carefully cutting the seal off dispatches from Napoleon for his Minister,
                  and then “rubbing it against his clothes, smelling it, and giving it its due praise.
                  The eagle was well done, the sword perfect” (Hobhouse I: 52-3). He tells of how Napoleon
                  “never would pronounce the word Kaluga” (a key site in the retreat from Moscow), “but
                  called it sometimes Caligula, sometimes Salamanca,” and how “[h]is attendants, who
                  knew what he meant, went on writing or listening without making any remark” (53).
                  And he tells of how he was there during the retreat from Moscow (“as the reader of
                  any given five pages of his writing will not fail to discover” [James 188]), and of
                  how during the retreat “the soldiers burst into tears” (54).</p>
               <p>In this encounter in the box at La Scala, the stranger who is being introduced is
                  well-known at a distance but can still be introduced into a relatively closed circle,
                  according to traditional social protocols. As such, the encounter dramatizes a transitional
                  moment in the history of celebrity, which is the transition between the domain of
                  the social and what Chris Rojek refers to as the “para-social”, interactions that
                  occur at a social distance with people we don't know (Rojek 52). This is not strictly
                  an interface between the poet and the anonymous public, for the box of M. de Brême
                  is a kind of liminal space between the traditional, known audience of social equals,
                  and the wider, anonymous public that literature is moving towards. It is an extremely
                  privileged social space, too, that mixes old social class and old money. As Stendhal
                  observed, “A box at La Scala is treated as freehold property, like a house, and may
                  change hands for as much as twenty-five thousand francs” (Stendhal, <em>Rome</em> 24-5). Indeed, after the original theatre of Milan (the Teatro Regio Ducale) had
                  burned down in 1776, it was the owners of the boxes who lobbied Archduke Ferdinand
                  to build a new one, and it was the sale of new boxes that financed the building of
                  La Scala to replace it. The box at La Scala emblematises the particular conjunction
                  of social, economic and cultural power that M. de Brême embodied.</p>
               <p>Not only Byron, but Byron's poetry itself charms the box of M. de Brême, as their
                  host M. de Brême points out: “So keenly are his works relished by those of his friends
                  who know English that, without ever mentioning it, we are endlessly showing him our
                  private admiration” ( Lovell 206). This reserve about Byron's poetry is maintained
                  apparently even despite the fact that they have an Italian poet in their midst, “the
                  celebrated Monti,” who “graciously recited [his poetry] for us,” and who puts “Lord
                  Byron ... in raptures.” So relished, so precious is Byron's poetry that it has the
                  power to become an object of the unspoken in this circle of socially elite men who
                  count a poet among their number. They negotiate this desire, and Byron's charm, through
                  feats of “private admiration.” Again, like Stendhal not daring to kiss Byron's hand,
                  we see another form of restraint in this meeting with Byron. As we've seen, celebrity
                  culture works not always or only in terms of the spectacular displays of outrageous
                  affection. It is marked, too, with the protocols of an elite social culture of discretion.
                  And Stendhal's discretion is rewarded. For, after the poetry recitation: “From that
                  day, I passed almost every evening with Lord Byron” (Lovell 197).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">VI.</span></h2>
               <p>In Stendhal's 1829 letter to Colomb, Byron and Stendhal make their farewells at the
                  end of a delightful evening. The recollection is marked by one last moment of self-deprecation,
                  as Stendhal responds to Byron's request for street directions: <span class="indent2">Lord Byron asked me, as the only one who knew English, to tell him the names of the
                     streets that he would have to pass through on the way back to his inn. It was at the
                     other end of town, near the fortress. I saw that he would go astray: in that part
                     of Milan, at midnight, all the shops were closed. He would wander amidst empty and
                     ill-lit streets, and without knowing a word of the language! In my devoted affection
                     I was so foolish as to advise him to take a carriage. At once a shade of haughtiness
                     passed over his face: he gave me to understand, with all necessary politeness, that
                     what he wanted of me was the names of the streets, and not advice as to how to use
                     them. He left the box, and I understood why he had reduced it to silence. (Lovell
                     196)</span><br/> In this brilliant moment, when Stendhal advises Byron to take a carriage, Stendhal
                  fantasizes being Byron's chaperone, and Byron a stranger in need of protection. Byron
                  declines his advice, and the anecdote ends as it opened with Byron reducing the box
                  to silence. Another masterful Stendhalian ending that eludes closure: returning to
                  the anecdote's beginning —to that “sort of solemn and awkward air” and that fraught
                  form of silence that opens the encounter —the ending transforms this awkwardness by
                  turning it into a moment of comedy.</p>
               <p>But the story does not end there, for there are other versions of that evening that
                  end more optimistically and keep the electrified company there despite Byron's departure.
                  Later that very same evening, as the 1824 letter to Louise S. Belloc recounts, Byron
                  strolls with Stendhal around the “immense and solitary foyer of La Scala.” This time,
                  Byron is successfully transformed from stranger into intimate. Again, memories of
                  Napoleon are the currency of this transformation, which is aided by the social lubricant
                  of their mutual devotion: <span class="indent2">I had the good fortune to excite his curiosity, in giving him some personal details
                     concerning Napoleon and the retreat from Moscow, which in 1816 were not yet commonplace.
                     This species of merit procured for me many strolls tête-à-tête, in the immense and
                     solitary foyer of Scala. (Lovell, 197-8)</span><br/> Once again, the curtain parts, and the scene of the fan's love at second glance is
                  consecrated. The supreme transformation of the stranger to intimate occurs as Stendhal
                  and Byron share “strolls tête-à-tête.” What we also note, as the curtains part, is
                  the particular kind of social space that stages—and houses—this transformation from
                  stranger to intimate: “the immense and solitary foyer of Scala.” This paradoxical
                  figure encapsulates marvellously the transformative effect of celebrity as a mode
                  of publicity, a mode of intimacy, a mode of public intimacy. That this immense public
                  social space should also be nonetheless so “solitary” enables it to host and to hold
                  and to bear witness to all the paradoxes of intimate strangeness that attend the meeting
                  between Byron and his enraptured fan of “a hundred irresistible impulses.”</p>

               in the letter to Colomb, where the meeting of October 1816 is misremembered as occurring
               in “the autumn of 1812” (see Lovell 196), and in the famous misdating of the 1816
               meeting that is included in <em>Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               in a review in the <em>Nation</em> (17 September 1874): “It contains hardly an opinion which is not ludicrously erratic,
               and hardly a quotation, a foreign phrase, or a proper name which is not misspelled
               or misprinted. But the author writes with a garrulous <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">bonhomie</span> —that of an easy-going cosmopolite ... —which will soften the edge of the reader's
               displeasure; and he is to be thanked at any rate for bringing Beyle once more before
               the world” (James 187).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Except where indicated, I take my primary quotations of Stendhal from <em>His Very Self and Voice: Collected Conversation of Lord Byron </em>, ed. Ernest J. Lovell (New York: Macmillan, 1954), 196-206. For readers who wish
               to consult directly the relevant published works by Stendhal (and by others who use
               material provided by Stendhal), I list them here as follows, more or less and as far
               as possible in chronological order given that the constant reworking of these recollections
               makes a chronology difficult to sustain: <em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Rome, Naples et Florence en 1817</span></em> (1817); 
               “<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Lord Byron en Italie, récit d'un témoin oculaire</span>,”
               published originally in <em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Revue de Paris</span></em>, March 1830, later included in <em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Racine et Shakespeare</span></em> (1830), published in English in <em>The Foreign Literary Gazette</em>, reprinted in <em>The Mirror</em>, and then in John Galt's <em>The Life of Lord Byron </em> (London: Colburn &amp; Bentley, 1830); 
               “<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Lord Byron en Italie</span>”
               is a reworked version of a narrative given upon request to Louise Swanton-Belloc (1796-1881),
               who included it in <em>Lord Byron</em>, par Mme. Louise Sw.-Belloc, 2 vols (Paris: Antoine-Augustin Renouard, 1824); <em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Souvenirs d'Egotisme</span></em>, the autobiographical fragment written in 1832 an first published in 1892. The letters
               to Louis Crozet (20 Oct. 1816) and Louise Belloc (24 Sept. 1824) are included in <em>Correspondance</em>, ed. Henri Martineau and V. Del Litto, 3 vols. (Paris: Bibliothèque de la Pléiade,
               1962-1968): to Crozet, I: 831-835 (letter no. 608); Belloc, II: 42-46 (letter no.
               771). The letter to Stendhal's cousin and executor, Romain Colomb (24 August 1829),
               is included in <em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Correspondence Inédite</span></em> (Paris, 1855), II, 71. Prior to the meeting with Byron that is recounted in the letter
               to Crozet of October 20, Stendhal writes to Crozet over four letters (of 28 September;
               30 Sept; 2 Oct; 16-17 October, and five if we include the letter of Oct 20 after the
               meeting, about Byron's significance for “<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">[l]e systéme romantique</span>” (827) and “<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">les passions énergiques</span>” in a discussion of Francis Jeffrey, Romanticism and the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> (See <em>Correspondance</em>, I: 818-835). For an analysis, see Wu 2007. Of particular interest here in regard
               to sensation and celebrity is the discussion of Jeffrey on contemporary poetry's “pursuit
               of her new idol of strong emotion”.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Hobhouse is quoted from an undated MS in the John Murray archive in Doris Langley
               Moore's <em>The Late Lord Byron: Posthumous Dramas</em> (372). See Moore, Chapter XI, “An Imaginative Frenchman,” 372-95. Moore's highly
               unsympathetic account of Stendhal takes its cues from Hobhouse and reads Stendhal's
               recollections as “published exploitation” (374). For an analysis of Hobhouse and Moore,
               see Jonathan Keates's biography <em>Stendhal </em> (186-94). Keates traces the chronology of textual production of the different versions
               of the meeting, and claims that “[t]here is no hard evidence ... with which to catch
               Stendhal in quite so blatant an act as that of faking Byron” (190). For his part,
               Byron wrote to thank Stendhal for the praise he received in <em>Rome, Naples and Florence</em>: “Sir, At present, [now?] that I know to whom I am indebted for a very flattering
               mention in the 'Rome, Naples, and Florence in 1817, by Mons. Stendhal,' it is fit
               that I should return my thanks ... to Mons. Beyle, with whom I had the honour of being
               acquainted in Milan in 1816.” (Genoa, May 29, 1823, <em>BLJ</em> 10: 189) Byron also took the opportunity to defend Walter Scott against the attack
               Stendhal had made on him in the same work.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Rossini became the young idol of the Italian opera-going public virtually overnight
               in 1813 with the success of <em>Tancredi</em>, which Byron and Hobhouse saw in Venice in November 1816, performed, as Hobhouse
               writes, by “the famous Marchesini [who] delighted me, and indeed affected us both,
               more than [Angelica] Catalani” (Hobhouse I: 61). As Benjamin Walton notes, Rossini
               was “the Scott, Byron or Napoleon of music, depending on the fancy of individual critics”
               (Walton 82). Despite Rossini's enormous popularity, however, in 1816 he endured the
               scandalous failure of the first performance of <em>The Barber of Seville</em> in Rome on Feb 26 1816. (The second performance, in Bologna, was a big success.)
               Stendhal writes about the episode in his <em>Vie de Rossini </em> (1823), itself a scandalously plagiarized text “cribbed” from Guiseppe Carpani's
               <em>Rossiane</em>. See Walton on the mixed reception of Rossini in London. To note another Napoleonic
               intertext: Rossini's father, the town trumpeter, very famously welcomed the Napoleonic

               Some of the Italians liked him —others called his performance “seccatura” (a devilishly

               the English peer” (Lovell 197). He also presents a Byron jealous of Brummell: “in

               subsequent <em>Life</em> is illuminating here, suggesting how fraught this position could be. Byron had originally
               given Moore the MS of his memoirs to raise money. Moore opposed the destruction of
               the memoirs (a campaign which Hobhouse initiated and completed within three days of
               learning of Byron's death), and wrote his <em>Life</em> of Byron, which brought in the money that would have been his from the memoirs. Hobhouse
               seems to have been a little bit jealous of Moore for having been entrusted with the
               MS, which possibly makes him suspect Moore's motives. As Hobhouse wrote in the 
               “Narrative of Events Connected with the Destruction of Lord Byron's Memoirs”
               , “Lord Byron made a present of himself to Mr. Moore, and Mr. Moore sold his Lordship
               to the booksellers” ( Hobhouse III: 331). And in his diary of 14 May 1826: “Moore
               owned very frankly to me that he would make a book to get the money he wanted, but
               not a book of real merit as a Life of Lord Byron... . I am sorry that circumstances
               have made this interview necessary, but as I feel that Byron certainly intended a
               benefit to Moore, I cannot but assist him in some degree to gain his 2, 000 out of
               Lord Byron's memory. That is his motive; he has no other.” ( Hobhouse III: 134-5).
               &gt; Hobhouse also had to contend with the publication of a collection of “religious
               conversations” with Byron as “one of the thousand and one squabbles which my intimacy
               [has] entailed upon me” (IV: 81). For a detailed analysis of this episode, see Hamilton.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               homosocially configured magic circle of love, when he spent the summer at Lake Geneva
               with Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley and Claire Clairmont from May until August.
               As Byron was to write of this summer of love, when Shelley “dosed” him with Wordsworth
               as he was writing <em>Childe Harold III</em>, “I was half mad during the time of its composition, between metaphysics, mountains,
               lakes, love inextinguishable.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               night of October 1816 came in July 1818, when Hobhouse's 
               “Essay on the Present Literature of Italy”
               appeared as part of his <em>Historical illustrations of the fourth canto of Childe Harold: containing dissertations
                  on the ruins of Rome; and an essay on Italian literature</em> (London: John Murray, 1818) and contained not a single mention of the irresistible
               Brême. Brême wrote to Byron to indicate his displeasure, and then Hobhouse wrote back
               to Byron: “Di Breme may be damned! ... Breme is vexed because I have ventured to tell
               some disagreeable truths about poor dear Bonaparte and because I have said nothing
               about his behissed comedy. You had better tell him so and then you will succeed to
               your heart's content in making him hate me as much as you have made me hate him” (quoted
               in Vincent 21). In fact, the author of the “Essay” was not Hobhouse but the exiled
               Italian patriot and poet Ugo Foscolo, whom Hobhouse had met in London, and who agreed
               to write the “Essay” on the condition of secrecy about his authorship. Byron himself
               seemed to enjoy the falling out between Hobhouse and Brême. As he wrote to Hobhouse
               on 3 August 1818, “Enclosed is Breme’s scrawl ... he gives you devilish bitter words
               —and I long to see you by the ears —that I do.—” (<em>BLJ</em> 6: 63). And as he wrote to Guiseppino Albrizzi, the son of Countess Albrizzi, a major
               Venetian hostess, known as the Madame de Staël of Italy: “Tell Hobhouse —his letter
               to De Breme has made a great Sensation —and is to be published in the Tuscan &amp; other
               Gazettes” (<em>BLJ</em> 6: 91).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               audience in this place, which is not elsewhere found, at least I have not found it”
