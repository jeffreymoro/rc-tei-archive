         	<p rend="noCount">This essay investigates how the concept of fandom might make sense of a reading practice that emerged in the romantic period, the practice of visiting places associated with authors and their works in order to re-read their works in situ.  Focussing on Lady Frances Shelley as a typical romantic literary tourist, the essay considers the ways in which she (and by extension others) produced new constructions of reading and the reader in response to the emergent figure of the romantic author. Shelley's various accounts of visiting romantic locales associated with Rousseau, Scott, and Byron not only provides a conspectus of possible tourist-stances and practices but suggests that romantic readers strove to represent themselves on a footing not only of intimacy but of social equality with the author, re-establishing a sense of a coterie audience in the face of the realities of an increasingly heterogenous mass reading public.</p>

				<p>As <name ref="#EisnerEric" type="person">Eric Eisner</name> has remarked, the Romantic period saw an unprecedented explosion of
					what we would now recognise as &#8220;fan practices&#8221;: &#8220;admirers collected autographs, souvenirs, portraits, and relics
					of celebrity writers, artists, performers, military heroes, and athletes;&#8221; &#8220;visited the homes and haunts of
					celebrities;&#8221; imitated celebrities, and fantasised about becoming their intimates; wrote fan mail, and formed communities of
					like-minded devotees (&#8220;Introduction&#8221;). Taken together, these practices arguably mark the beginning of what would
					become a mass-cultural phenomenon over the later nineteenth century. This essay therefore addresses itself to a series of
					questions which transfer some of the preoccupations of recent scholarship on contemporary fandom back to the moment of its
					inception. <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Scholarship of what we might broadly consider &#8220;literary&#8221; fandom
						has hitherto largely concentrated on modern popular cultural artefacts rather than the consumption of celebrity authors,
						perhaps because with a couple of notable exceptions such as J.K. Rowling, authors are not today&#8217;s super-celebrities.
						Fandom has largely been discussed in relation to such disparate genres and cult phenomena as Hollywood film, soap opera,
						science fiction, <title type="m">Star Trek</title>, <title type="m">The Lord of the Rings</title>, Harry Potter and <title
							type="m">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</title>. Fan magazines, fictions, canons, discourse, identities, communities, and
						practices have been written about from a variety of perspectives ranging from the psychological to reader response. </note>
					Specifically, what different modes of demonstrating appreciation were precipitated around literary figures between the 1770s and
					the 1830s? How might the concept of &#8220;fandom&#8221; help us to make sense of one enduring material reading practice that
					became newly prominent at this time&#8212;namely, the practice of visiting places associated with authors and their works in order
					to re-read texts <foreign xml:lang="la">in situ</foreign>? And how might attending to that practice of fandom illuminate further
					the development of a new reading culture in the period?</p>
				<p>To attend to the fan rather than the celebrity (although, as I&#8217;ll be discussing below, the two are sometimes one and the same
					person) is a relatively novel departure for romantic scholarship. Understandably, perhaps, romantic scholarship has found it much
					more attractive to identify or ally itself with two variant forms of romantic authorial celebrity, the neglected genius,
					associated especially with Keats, and the sexy superstar, embodied by <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
						>Byron</name>. As an academic, it is particularly seductive to ally oneself with the figure of the neglected genius writing
					for posterity, a figure which, as <name ref="#BennettAndrew" type="person">Andrew Bennett</name> has noted, is the default setting
					for romantic poetics; after all, many of us are neglected geniuses ourselves, teaching a rather unenthusiastic posterity. The
					persistent interest in romantic authors&#8217; self-depiction as suffering constitutively or playfully from an anxiety of
					authorship is another variant of this critical tendency. <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">For an influential study of <name
							ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>&#8217;s anxiety of authorship, for example, see <name ref="#FerrisIna"
							type="person">Ferris</name>.</note>Alternatively, in the climate of today&#8217;s celebrity culture, it has become
					possible to rediscover <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as a necessary precondition for Mick Jagger,
					as the first famous poet to inspire certain modes of feeling on an international scale. <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"
						>For studies of Byronic celebrity see, for example, <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name>
						<title type="a">Transfiguring;</title>
						<name ref="#WilsonFrances" type="person">Wilson</name>; <name ref="#MoleThomas" type="person">Mole</name>.</note>Tellingly,
					even the scholarship on <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s celebrity has displayed a marked
					tendency to twist away from the fact of his huge fame to concentrate instead upon the ways in which (allegedly) <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> never fully or willingly occupied it, preferring to ironise his
					massively popular public persona in a suitably &#8220;romantic&#8221; and, let it be whispered, attractively elitist and
					aristocratic fashion (see <name ref="#ChristensenJerome" type="person">Christensen</name>; <name ref="#BennettAndrew"
						type="person">Bennett</name>). The scholarship on <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s
					celebrity additionally typically, if inexplicitly, describes the madness that endeavouring either to master or emulate <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> might threaten; how much safer and more respectable to be his <name
						ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> than to be just another one amongst his many unhappy shadowers, amongst
					them Caroline Lamb, Claire Clairmont, <name ref="#ClareJohn" type="person">John Clare</name>, and <name
						ref="#BrydgesSamuelEgerton" type="person">Samuel Egerton Brydges</name>. <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> For <name
							ref="#ClareJohn" type="person">John Clare</name>&#8217;s relation to Byronic celebrity, see, for example, <name
							ref="#MartinPhilipW" type="person">Martin</name>, <name ref="#GoldsmithJasonN" type="person">Goldsmith</name>; for Lamb
						see <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name>, <name ref="#SoderholmJames" type="person">Soderholm</name>; for
						Wilson see <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name>. </note>(The alternative available role, to construct
					oneself as an efficient and commercial sponger off the noble Lord in the manner of a Harriette Wilson, Leigh Hunt or a John
					Murray, is probably nearer the mark for the modern critic, but possibly represents an even more unwelcome and unromantic
					construction of the academic enterprise.) Such writing on Byron has only partially acknowledged that there is no such thing as the
					celebrity without the fan; as <name ref="#EisnerEric" type="person">Eisner</name> notes, literary celebrity &#8220;is not simply
					one form of authorship, but rather…a form of the relationship between writers and readers&#8221; (<name ref="#EisnerEric"
						type="person">Eisner</name> 3). If and when the fan <emph>is</emph> acknowledged, he or she often appears as a flattering
					avatar for the scholar, a special, tormented, and intimate soul (<name ref="#SoderholmJames" type="person">Soderholm</name>). In
					short, the fan is an embarrassment, and the fan in the academic even more so. Supposedly na&#239;ve, obsessive, desirous, and
					dangerously predatory, the fan has arguably hitherto been the abjected of the history of romantic culture and of romantic
					criticism itself, both in criticism written during the period and that produced since.</p>
				<p>My focus in this essay, however, is on the case-history of a romantic fan who was neither na&#239;ve, obsessive, desirous, nor
					predatory (shortcomings which, may, of course, disqualify her from the status of fan in some eyes). Charming, lively, beautiful,
					humorous, well-read yet unintellectual, and a crashing snob, Lady Frances Shelley counted amongst the amusements of her life the
					pleasures of literary fandom. Her diary and letters, unpublished until the early twentieth century, supply a first-hand
					description of multiple instances of a particular mode of reading that emerged in the period&#8212;the idea of reading authors in
					and against places associated with them, combining literary connoisseurship with dilettante travel. Her accounts of this practice
					exemplify what a variety of site-specific modes of appreciating the literary the romantics developed, and they also suggest some
					of the disparate and unevenly operating factors that underlay them. My discussion therefore follows in her well-shod footsteps
					across England, Scotland, Germany, Switzerland and Italy over the years between 1815 and 1854, considering not only what she does
					say and do as a literary tourist, but what she doesn&#8217;t choose to do, for both are equally telling.</p>
				<p>I have chosen to concentrate on Lady Shelley as a central consciousness largely for her conventionality and typicality, something
					for which I imagine she would not have thanked me. Unhampered by literary ambition and anxiety, she was not weighed down by the
					need to produce competitively fine writing for a public beyond her own immediate circle; she was cheerfully unobsessed by any of
					the literary lions she met or pursued; and she was markedly mobile in her ability to occupy a variety of possible tourist stances
					and fan pleasures. Reviewing her diary and letters on their publication in 1912, the <title type="j"><name ref="#NewYorkUS"
							type="place">New York</name> Times</title> took the view that she was not romantic or enthusiastic enough, remarking that
					&#8220;mostly the impressions are too matter-of-factly recorded, and lead one to conclude that Lady Shelley generally recorded
					inferences which others around her had expressed&#8221;; the writer was especially cutting about her account of her visit to <name
						ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>&#8217;s house on the &#206;le St Pierre&#8212;&#8220;matter of fact
					and almost schoolgirlish.&#8221; These strictures usefully identify her as disappointingly commonplace in her sentiments and
					commentary. <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
						<title type="j"><name ref="#NewYorkUS" type="place">New York</name> Times</title> Sunday, August 12, 1912. </note>As such, she
					serves here as a conveniently representative case-study in romantic literary fandom of the fairly casual and thoroughly ordinary
					sort, always bearing in mind the proviso that, as I&#8217;ll be noting below, her stances and destinations are determined both by
					her class status as an aristocrat and by her gender.</p>
				<p>To attend to Shelley&#8217;s literary pleasures is to discover something of how romantic readers produced new constructions of
					themselves in relation to the emergent romantic author. Recent scholarship has been interested not only in the emergence of new
					models of authorship but in how this was produced in response to a new literary marketplace, a reading-boom, defined by a vastly
					expanded literacy and mass print-production. Although, following from <name ref="#DarntonRobert" type="person">Robert
						Darnton</name>&#8217;s pioneering work, there have been a number of recent influential studies of romantic readership and
					romantic reading practices, most notably by scholars such as <name ref="#StClairWilliam" type="person">William St Clair</name> and
						<name ref="#JacksonHJ" type="person">H.J. Jackson</name>, scholarship has only just begun systematically to investigate how
					individual romantic readers constructed themselves as such in relation to the romantic author. <note n="6" place="foot"
						resp="editors">Particularly pertinent to my argument here is <name ref="#DarntonRobert" type="person">Robert
						Darnton</name>&#8217;s essay <title type="a">Readers Respond to <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>:
							The Fabrication of Romantic Sensitivity</title> which explored the possibility of constructing a history of a new romantic
						reading experience through a case-study of one reader of <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>. Others
						have also described emergent modes of reading in the period. <name ref="#AltickRichard" type="person">Altick</name> looked at
						the emergence of a mass reading public; <name ref="#SutherlandKathryn" type="person">Sutherland</name> early surveyed the
						reading-boom; <name ref="#LynchDeidre" type="person">Lynch</name> argues that the trope of reading and re-reading in the
						contemporaneous novel is evidence that reading became a technique of romantic identity-production, noting &#8220;a new
						insistence on distinguishing between styles of reading and on propagating the decorums that separate one reader&#8217;s
						refined receptiveness to literary meanings from another, vulgar reader&#8217;s avid following of fashion&#8221; (127), an
						insistence that, as I shall be arguing below, characterises the contemporary discourse of literary tourism as well.</note>I
					have argued elsewhere that literary tourism developed in response to a variety of stimuli&#8212;the need to model the romantic
					self, for example, to which both <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name> and <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> were so important; the desire to verify a national landscape mapped
					within a newly national literature; the desire to assert a fictional intimacy and kinship between the author and reader which
					bridged the alienation of print culture. But here I want to concentrate on the relation between the development of literary
					tourism and the development of the romantic reader. Shelley&#8217;s account of herself as a reader-tourist revealingly suggests
					that romantic readers strove to represent themselves as on a footing not only of intimacy but of social equality with the author,
					to re-establish a sense of a coterie audience in the face of the realities of a mass heterogenous reading public.</p>

					<p>For those unacquainted with her, Frances Shelley was born in 1787, the daughter of Thomas Winckley of Preston and connected
						through her mother to the Dalrymples. Against her family’s advice, in 1807 she married Sir John Shelley, gamester,
						horse-fancier, and friend of the heir to the throne, with whom she seems to have been happy. She was thus a member of the
						upper ten thousand, with the entr&#233;e into the highest circles. A noted beauty, accomplished conversationalist, and an
						amateur musician with literary interests and connections (including her distant relative <name ref="#ShelleyPercyBysshe"
							type="person">Percy Bysshe Shelley</name>), she moved for the most part in high Tory circles. She was introduced to <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> through his sister, became a longtime intimate and passionate
						hero-worshipper (indeed a fan) of the Duke of Wellington, and was socially prominent enough for Victoria to come to pay her
						respects on her deathbed in 1873. Courtesy of these connections, in July 1815 she made her way to the Continent in pursuit of
						a long-held ambition and arrived at Paris in the immediate aftermath of Waterloo, where she met, amongst many others, <name
							ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Sir Walter Scott</name>. Like many others, including <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>, <name ref="#ShelleyPercyBysshe" type="person">Percy Bysshe Shelley</name>, and their
						companions and hangers-on, she took the opportunity afforded by the cessation of war to travel to Italy via Geneva, her stay
						in the summer of 1816 coinciding with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s occupancy of the
						Villa Diodati in Cologny; her tour of the locality corresponded at many points with the excursions that <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> was making with the Shelleys and <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam"
							type="person">Hobhouse</name> to sites associated with <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name> and
						others, which he wrote up in <title type="m">Childe Harold&#8217;s Pilgrimage III</title>. In 1819 she made the tour of
						Scotland, and, meeting up again with <name ref="#ScottWalter">Scott</name>, was invited to stay at his show-home Abbotsford,
						then in the throes of alteration and extension. In 1834, she made another trip to the Continent, and repeated it for one last
						time in 1853. On these trips she made a series of excursions to sites associated with poets of an earlier age&#8212;most
						especially to locales associated with Ariosto, Petrarch and Tasso &#8212;which she seems to have understood in part as
						repetitions of literary pilgrimages earlier made by <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and recorded
						in <title type="m">Childe Harold&#8217;s Pilgrimage IV</title>. and in this, again, she was thoroughly conventional for her
						time. In the course of these travels, she therefore traversed a variety of sites associated with three of the four romantic
						figures &#8212; <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>, <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person"
							>Scott</name>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, and Burns&#8212;who elicited the highest
						levels of romantic fandom and tourism.</p>

					<head>II. On holiday with <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>, 1816</head>
					<p>Driving along the margins of Lake Geneva on her way from Besan&#231;on to Neuch&#226;tel in 1816, Frances Shelley&#8217;s party
						passed through M&#244;tiers-Travers. M&#244;tiers-Travers was where <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person"
							>Rousseau</name> had spent some time living in retirement, where he received many visitors, including the young James
						Boswell, and from which he was, famously, driven out by the villagers in May 1765. In 1816, the house itself had shared that
						fame for some time, in large part because there were a number of important engravings in circulation which illustrated <name
							ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>&#8217;s <title type="m">Confessions</title> and represented his
						various houses, most particularly, the four volume publication by <name ref="#LabordeJean-BenjamindeM" type="person"
							>Jean-Benjamin de Laborde</name> and Beat Fidel Zurlauben, <foreign xml:lang="fr">
							<title type="m">Tableaux topographiques, pittoresques, physiques, historiques, moraux, politiques, litt&#233;raires de la
								Suisse</title>
						</foreign>(c. 1784), which included no fewer than four engravings relating to <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person"
							>Rousseau</name>&#8217;s life in the village. (The publication in 1819 of de Last&#8217;s and Lameau&#8217;s <foreign
							xml:lang="fr">
							<title type="m">Vues de differentes habitations de J.J. <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>
							</title>
						</foreign>would expand this canon.) Shelley&#8217;s account makes it plain that she was aware both of the story and of the
						house. She notes that &#8220;we passed the house in which [ <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name> ]
						had lived&#8221; (<name ref="#EdgcumbeRichard">Edgcumbe</name> 1: 219) and further remarks that &#8220;when we came to
						Motiers-Travers we longed to live there, and fully understood <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person"
						>Rousseau</name>&#8217;s regret at being driven from it&#8221; (<name ref="#EdgcumbeRichard" type="person">Edgcumbe</name> 1:
						219). Shelley&#8217;s self-placing as <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name> is brief but typical of
						the self-representation of contemporary tourists. Such pilgrims aspired both to &#8220;be&#8221; <name
							ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name> and to join the select club of those who could boast a sufficiency
						of Rousseauistic sensibility. However, the locus classicus for this sort of self-identification with <name
							ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name> was not M&#244;tiers-Travers but the little &#206;le St Pierre,
						located in the Lac de Bienne, where <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name> had spent a few short but
						idyllic months writing his <title type="m">Confessions</title> and collecting material for the <foreign xml:lang="fr">
							<title type="m">R&#234;veries d&#8217;un Promeneur Solitaire</title>
						</foreign>before being forced to leave there, too, in October 1765.</p>

					<p>The experience of visiting the &#206;le St Pierre seems to have been particularly powerful for contemporaries&#8212;there is
						much more written about it than about any other <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name> site&#8212;and
						looking at a few of the many visitors&#8217; accounts extant allow us to get a flavour of the experience <name
							ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>&#8217;s many fans were seeking. Shelley&#8217;s own narrative of
						her visit may most usefully be understood in relation to the accounts of other contemporary visitors, who wrote about the
						experience at enthusiastic length. For example, <name ref="#MatthissonFriedrichvon" type="person">Friedrich von
							Matthisson</name>&#8217;s account of his trip to the &#206;le, made some time between 1785 and 1794, makes plain the ways
						in which <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>&#8217;s autobiography powerfully mapped and narrated
						place for the tourist, allowing the recreational insertion of the reader-tourist&#8217;s body and sensibility within the
						author&#8217;s; <name ref="#MatthissonFriedrichvon" type="person">Matthisson</name>&#8217;s identification of the pleasures of
						reading &#8220;on the very spot&#8221; as a form of touristic &#8220;self-forgetfulness&#8221; as well as a self-amplification
						underscores how this reading practice was designed to meld reader and author together: <quote rendition="#indent2">How deeply
							were we affected with reading this most interesting writer&#8217;s description of St Peter&#8217;s Island on the very
							spot. What a melancholy delight did we feel in following his footsteps from the room he inhabited, to the orchard, where,
							with his bag girt round him, he often gathered fruit in company with his honest domestics: then to the hills, the meads
							and the groves where first, with Linnaeus in his hands, he studies the distinction of the genus of plants, till we come to
							the very spot on the shore, where on a fine evening he would stretch himself, contented and happy, with his eyes fixed on
							the flood, in the sweet calm of self-forgetfulness. (<name ref="#MatthissonFriedrichvon" type="person">Matthisson</name>

						<lb/>Such representations of a ghostly figure of &#8220;<name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>&#8221;
						as a double for the reader-tourist were common. So was the, at first glance, rather paradoxical construction of this
						experience as not simply one-to-one, but communal. The young German <name ref="#StolbergFriedrich" type="person">Friedrich
							Stolberg</name>, for example, more explicitly describes a conversation with his friends on a very similar walk in 1791:
							<quote rendition="#indent2"><lb/>Here, said we, did the pensive <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Jean
								Jacques</name> ruminate. On this steep height, and, glowing with all the delightful sweets of rectitude, he
							contemplated the clear waters of the lake. Here he did calm his ardent sensibility, by viewing the dewy plants, which he
							took so much pleasure to collect. Under this rock, reclining in a boat, he touched the soft flute. Yonder is the
							diminutive island, which he peopled with rabbits: that small spot, which, comparatively, makes the mother island a
							continent...</quote>
						<lb/>
						<quote rendition="#indent2">As we left the island, we were awakened by the recollection of what must have been the sensation
							of <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>, when he was obliged to leave this place of refuge...
								(<name ref="#StolbergFriedrich" type="person">Stolberg</name> 1:142-3)</quote>
						<lb/>A third young man, <name ref="#KaramziNikolaiM" type="person">Nikolai Karamzin</name>, may serve as a final example, if
						only because he wrote at such length and performed these emotional evolutions so thoroughly. Visiting in 1790, he both
						simulates <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name> by re-experiencing <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques"
							type="person">Rousseau</name>istic emotions on the spot, and extends this to summoning a fanciful vision of the
						philosopher: <quote rendition="#indent2"><lb/>Not long ago I went to the island of St Pierre, where the greatest writer of the
							eighteenth century took refuge from the wickedness and intolerance of mankind, which, like the Furies, drove him from
							place to place. It was a beautiful day. Within a few hours I had wandered about the entire island, seeking everywhere
							traces of Geneva&#8217;s citizen and philosopher, beneath the boughs of ancient beech and chestnut trees, in the beautiful
							walks of the dark forest, in the faded meadows and rocky prominences of the shore.</quote>
						<lb/>
						<quote rendition="#indent2">&#8220;Here&#8221; I thought, &#8220;here, forgetting cruel and ungrateful people&#8212;
							ungrateful and cruel! My God! How sad it is to feel and to write!&#8212;here, forgetting all worldly tumult, he enjoyed
							the tranquil evening of life in solitude. Here his soul rested from its mighty labours. Here he found peace in quiet and
							sweet repose! Where is he? Everything remains as it was, but he is gone &#8212;gone!&#8221;</quote>
						<lb/>
						<quote rendition="#indent2">Now I thought I heard the forest and meadow sigh, or were they only repeating the deep sigh of my
							heart? I glanced about me. The entire island seemed in mourning...I sat down upon the shore...My fancy imagined a boat
							gliding over the placid waters, moved by a gentle breeze which guided it in place of a helmsman. In the boat lay [the aged
								<name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>,] a venerable old man in Armenian dress; his eyes, fixed
							on heaven, reflected a noble soul, depth of thought, and pensiveness. (<name ref="#KaramziNikolaiM" type="person"
								>Karamzin</name> 162-3)</quote>
						<lb/>
						<name ref="#KaramziNikolaiM" type="person">Karamzin</name>&#8217;s experience is wholeheartedly sentimental and pleasingly
						typical in its final fanciful summoning of <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name> to inhabit the
						emptiness of the island in his daydream. The thoroughly paradoxical quality of this Rousseauistic tourist experience as at
						once empty, solitary, alienated, private, and &#8220;of the heart,&#8221; while nonetheless full, communal, performative,
						cosmopolitan, and print-based, is epitomised in <name ref="#KaramziNikolaiM" type="person">Karamzin</name>&#8217;s anecdote of
						his encounter with an equally young Englishman: <quote rendition="#indent2"><lb/>As I sat meditating, I suddenly saw a young
							man, with a round hat pulled down over his eyes, approaching me with unhurried steps. In his right hand he was carrying a
							book. He stopped, looked at me, and said, &#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">Vous pensez &#224; lui</foreign>.&#8221; Then he
							walked away with the same unhurried steps. (163)</quote>
						<lb/> This moment when the solitary fan turns out to have company, and company of a congenial kind, demonstrates the way that
						this sort of fandom is imagined as ambiguously intimate <emph>and</emph> communal, original <emph>and</emph> derivative.</p>
					<p>The presence of others was in practice essential to the experience, because it described an exclusive club of admirers. This
						club was most vividly evidenced in the habit (prevalent before the institution of a visitors&#8217; book) of writing lengthy
						inscriptions on the walls of the pavilion and of <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>&#8217;s
						bedroom. This practice of inscription on literary sites was widespread at the time; the sentimental graffiti on the &#206;le
						St Pierre are especially well-documented and it is clear that <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>
						inspired a particular mode of verse-inscription which was designed to perform an intimate identification between author and
						reader to other readers. <note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> For a discussion of the practice of inscription and
							associated practices at writers&#8217; graves as acts of readerly aggression, which makes a suggestive companion-piece to
							the practice I&#8217;m describing here, see <name ref="#MatthewsSamantha" type="person">Matthews</name>. </note>Such
						verses universally describe a romantic privacy of physical encounter. The privacy was manifestly a fiction &#8212;not only
						were the inscriptions there intended for all to see who cared to look, but travellers&#8217; accounts and later, guidebooks,
						often quoted them at length. <name ref="#GauthierMadamede" type="person">Madame de Gauthier</name>, for instance, who was

						<name ref="#WagnerFSigismond" type="person">Sigismond Wagner</name>&#8217;s guidebook, first published in 1798, reinforces
						this convention. <name ref="#WagnerFSigismond" type="person">Wagner</name> had acted as guide to the island for a number of
						years, before writing it, so it is reasonable to assume that it embodies the tourist experience that was being delivered at
						the time. He describes &#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">une foule de noms et d&#8217;inscriptions, dont les murs de la rotunde
							sont couverts au-dedans et au-dehors</foreign>&#8221;, which, he says, &#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">attestent la vive

						covered above and below...attest to the vivid impression which this place produces on all who come to visit it&#8221;]. He
						dwells upon the inscriptions both in the pavilion and the bedroom as evidence of the sheer volume of Rousseauistic experience
						supplied by the island to readers of many nationalities, but he also spends time listing the eminent names amongst these
						graffiti, including Pitt the Younger, Immanuel Kant, the Empresses Josephine and Marie-Louise, and Napoleon himself. Those
						inscriptions he chooses to transcribe are striking in their insistence upon tourism as romantic substitution and encounter,
						replicating and pre-scripting the experiences already noted above as occurring in travel-writing. The first reads: <quote>

					<p>Shelley herself made the trip on July 15 1816, a day characteristic of the awful weather of the summer of 1816. Her diary

							<name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>&#8217;s room is merely four bare walls, with a stove in it.

							the court there is a wood, in which stands a small pavilion surrounded by grass, with oaks and beeches close at hand. In

						<lb/>Shelley&#8217;s playfulness about the failure of sentiment on this occasion nonetheless stands as a pointer to the

					<p><name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>&#8217;s ghostliness was both convenient and inconvenient to
						fandom. It was convenient in the sense that there was no obstacle in the shape of the living celebrity to the
						tourist-experiment of &#8220;being&#8221; <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>. Indeed, <name
							ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>&#8217;s ghost could be ventriloquised to approve of the romantic
						sensibility that these writers variously set out to inhabit and display, whether in handwritten inscriptions, in their letters
						and travel diaries, or through a full-blown print guidebook. It was inconvenient in the sense that, unlike a living celebrity,
						he could not be viewed and pursued in person. Death was not yet a drawback in the cases of <name ref="#ScottWalter"
							type="person">Sir Walter Scott</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>, the leading
						poetic celebrities of the age. Shelley&#8217;s interest in both of these figures provides evidence of other possible modes and
						practices of fandom.</p>
					<p>In July 1819, Shelley renewed her hitherto slight acquaintance with the Minstrel of the North, and was subsequently invited to
						pay a visit to the literary lion&#8217;s show-home, Abbotsford, still under construction. <name ref="#ScottWalter"
							type="person">Scott</name> acted as her guide over Melrose Abbey, famous in itself, but also as the setting for part of
						his best-selling poem <title level="m">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title> (1805), and he also drove her over to Dryburgh
						Abbey, another favourite Gothic ruin (where he would eventually be buried). A few days were spent at Abbotsford, admiring the
						house, its curiosities, and the anecdotal and complimentary conversation of its owner, before leaving for Edinburgh. <figure

						</figure> Her diary records three remarks of note with regard to <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>. The
						first, made in August 1815 at Paris when they first found themselves in each other&#8217;s company at a picnic, endeavours
						with only moderate success to collate the poet with his poetry&#8212;an exercise in making romantic authorship in a way
						already possible around the <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> of <title level="m">The
							Corsair</title>: disappointed in his appearance (&#8220;not prepossessing...a club-foot, white eyelashes, and a clumsy
						figure. He has no expression when his face is in repose&#8221; <name ref="#EdgcumbeRichard" type="person">Edgcumbe</name>
						1:139), she was more taken with his talk, because it was more poetic: &#8220;His conversation reminds me of his
						poems&#8212;the same ideas and images recurring&#8212;and often the same careless manner of expressing them&#8221; (<name
							ref="#EdgcumbeRichard" type="person">Edgcumbe</name> 1:139). The second, made during her visit to the North, is a comment
						that the Border landscape owed all its charms to <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>&#8217;s powers of
						description, and that it was in danger of being in itself anti-climactic: <quote rendition="#indent2"><lb/>There is not a spot
							mentioned by this romantic poet which does not owe its renown for beauty and charm to the exquisite description of it, as
							seen through his magic glass. As in a highly skilled miniature every blemish of complexion vanished without destroying the
							likeness, so is it with <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>&#8217;s descriptions. Although they are
							accurate, the poet heightens every beauty and conceals every defect. (<name ref="#EdgcumbeRichard" type="person"
								>Edgcumbe</name> 2:43)</quote>
						<lb/>This sense of viewing a visually uninteresting landscape made romantic purely by superimposed literary association was
						not confined to Lady Shelley; <name ref="#IrvingWashington" type="person">Washington Irving</name>, visiting three years
						earlier, and undergoing much the same routine of guided visits, seems equally to have experienced the same initial
						disappointment in the landscape: <quote rendition="#indent2"><lb/>I gazed about me with mute surprise, I may almost say, with
							disappointment. I beheld a mere succession of grey waving hills, line beyond line, as far as my eye could reach,
							monotonous in their aspect, and so destitute of trees, that one could almost see a stout fly walking along their profile;
							and the far-famed Tweed appeared a naked stream, flowing between bare hills, without a tree or a thicket on its banks; and
							yet, such had been the magic web of poetry and romance thrown over the whole, that it had a greater charm for me than the
							richest scenery...(<name ref="#IrvingWashington" type="person">Irving</name> 17)</quote>
						<lb/>The third remark of note that Shelley makes amplifies this sense of <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person"
						>Scott</name>&#8217;s &#8220;magic&#8221;, but characterises it rather less generously as the reader&#8217;s power to conjure
						up from the landscape, and Edinburgh in particular, fictional characters drawn from <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person"
							>Scott</name>&#8217;s oeuvre: &#8220;The Castle, Arthur&#8217;s Seat, and Salisbury Crags, conjured up fairy visions of
						historic, classic, and poetic interest, all equally absorbing. As in a vision, I saw one form succeeding another &#8212;the
						unfortunate Mary, the poetic Marmion, and the fascinating Effie Deans&#8221; (<name ref="#EdgcumbeRichard" type="person"
							>Edgcumbe</name> 2:54).</p>
					<p>Taken together, Shelley&#8217;s remarks suggest some of the resistance that the figure of <name ref="#ScottWalter"
							type="person">Scott</name> put up to the early culture of romantic fandom. Unlike <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>, although famous and sought after, he was not personally exciting to the fan, and he offered
						none of the extremer emotional pleasures of &#8220;being&#8221; the author that <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person"
							>Rousseau</name> had and that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> would. <note n="8"
							place="foot" resp="editors">
							<name ref="#McDayterGhislaine" type="person">McDayter</name> notes in passing that <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person"
								>Scott</name> did not elicit the sort of fandom that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
							did, and attributes this to the fact that his &#8220;role in cultural production never challenged the fragile lines which
							had been drawn between the literary and the real&#8221; (60n.). Although this explanation is open to question because of
								<name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>&#8217;s re-description of history as fiction, it is undoubtedly

						tourist-practices associated with them seem calculated as much to describe the reader&#8217;s imaginative flair as the
						writer&#8217;s. Where they discuss <name ref="#ScottWalter">Scott</name>&#8217;s &#8220;magic powers&#8221;, both <name
							ref="#IrvingWashington" type="person">Washington Irving</name> and Shelley verge on charging him with fraud, promising the

							advantage of this opportunity to express the very great pleasure which we have derived from our tour in Scotland. That
							pleasure is in a great measure due to the romantic interest given to every mountain and glen that you have mentioned,

							in song have but small attraction for me...In the neighbourhood of Abbotsford, as seen through your magic glass, I wished
							to have been born in some Highland glen before the &#8217;45...But I must confess to you that the scenery of Scotland is,

						<lb/>Shelley&#8217;s compliment to <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name> is double-edged&#8212;on the one hand,
						she thanks him for giving &#8220;romantic interest&#8221; to the landscape; on the other, she suggests that she has a more
						romantic taste in scenery than he must have, preferring the genuinely sublime to the poetically exaggerated. This slight
						condescension reverberates too in her estimate of the social pretensions of Abbotsford (&#8220;[it] has the appearance of a
						castle built of pastry&#8212;something like those we see on a supper table. But one must not quiz the castle or criticise the
						whims of such a genius&#8221; (<name ref="#EdgcumbeRichard" type="person">Edgcumbe</name> 2:46). And it colours her account of

					<head>IV. Running after <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, 1834</head>
					<p>In December 1813, when she first met him, Shelley was decidedly not one of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
							>Byron</name>&#8217;s many fans. She recorded her first verdict on the poet then working on <title level="m">The
							Corsair</title> thus: &#8220;He is decidedly handsome, and can be very agreeable. He seems to be easily put out by
						trifles, and, at times, looks terribly savage&#8221; (<name ref="#EdgcumbeRichard" type="person">Edgcumbe</name> 1:52). (She
						did him the justice, however, of saying that he had been very patient with his young nephews and nieces). Accompanying Augusta
						Leigh to pay a formal visit to Lady Byron and her new husband on the occasion of their marriage in April 1815, she had a very
						uncomfortable time of it, offering congratulations that were coldly received by <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name> with a &#8220;demoniacal&#8221; expression, and summing up her experience by remarking that
						&#8220;I felt like a young person who has inadvertently dipped her finger into boiling water&#8221; (81, 82). She coincided
						with the poet again in Lady Dalrymple Hamilton&#8217;s salon in Geneva in 1816, after he had left England in the wake of the
						scandal of his separation from his wife, and expressed much the same views in much the same language, amplified with
						incredulity at the fan phenomenon that surrounded him at the time: <quote rendition="#indent2">
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> looked in for a moment, but on seeing so many people he
							went away without speaking to anyone. He was evidently very much put out by something; and the expression on his face was
							somewhat demoniacal. What a strange person! They say he will have nothing to say to the crowds of English who almost dog
							his footsteps. (236)</quote>
						<lb/>Given this pronounced distaste for the person of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, it is all
						the more striking that following his death (an occasion marked for her by Sir Humphrey Davy inscribing verses &#8220;On the
						Death of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>&#8221; in her album [2:123]), she would become a
						completely conventional <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> fan; once his living and embarrassing
						social person was out of the way, it seems, her acquaintance with this celebrity at last became desirable. It is
						well-documented that post-Napoleonic travellers on the Continent would come to see the landscape through which they passed
						through <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s eyes and to ape his emotional stances courtesy
						of <title level="m">Childe Harold&#8217;s Pilgrimage III</title> and <title level="m">IV</title>. which would eventually be
						conveniently extracted into Murray&#8217;s guidebooks (<name ref="#BuzardJames" type="person">Buzard</name> 125-30). <name
							ref="#BrydgesSamuelEgerton" type="person">Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges</name>, for example, noted in the same year that
						Shelley would set off on her travels again, 1834, that &#8220;[ <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
						>Byron</name>&#8217;s] spirit always haunts me on the lake of Geneva; and I behold him forever floating on its waves in all
						the shadowy brilliance of his imaginations...[I] behold him at Venice, at Ravenna, at Ferrara, at Florence, at Rome, and at
						Pisa; and I see him enter the soul of Dante, to wander with him in his exile among the sombre woods&#8221; (<name
							ref="#BrydgesSamuelEgerton" type="person">Brydges</name> 256-7). This effect was very strong in relation to literary
						sites, partly because one of the projects of <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> could be said to be to provide <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> with the chance to strike canonical fan postures at European
						writers&#8217; houses and haunts, thus inserting him within a cosmopolitan classical poetic tradition. Recapitulating <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s tourist itinerary, tourists therefore engaged in the
						exercise of &#8220;being&#8221; <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> not so much as an author (as
						with <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>), but as a prototypical romantic fan.</p>
					<p>Shelley&#8217;s visit to the continent is accordingly marked by a tendency to refer her sightseeing experiences to those
						represented as <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s in <title level="m">Childe Harold&#8217;s
							Pilgrimage IV</title>. Describing her visit to Ariosto&#8217;s house, she frames the experience in terms of <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s literary celebrity and fandom: <quote rendition="#indent2"
							>In Ariosto&#8217;s house I visited the room in which he was born and in which he died. It was here that he wrote in
							winter. In summer-time he sat on a bench in the garden, with a candle beside him after dark. Everything remains exactly as
							it was in his time. The garden is about thirty feet square; thus confirming what I have often observed&#8212;since the
							days when <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> wrote <title level="a">The Corsair</title> in his
							sister&#8217;s small cottage on Newmarket Heath&#8212; that real creative genius is not dependent on its environments, and
							that a poet&#8217;s fancy is often more brilliant when the mind is not distracted by exterior objects... The people here
							tell us that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> shut himself up for a whole day in this
							damp place! He has cut his name on the stone outside. The names of Samuel Rogers, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam"
								type="person">Hobhouse</name>, and Casimir de la Vigne, prove that this much ridiculed custom is, after all, natural
							to the whole human race. Following the example of others, my son Frederick added the name of Shelley. This may in future
							be mistaken for the name of my young kinsman, <name ref="#ShelleyPercyBysshe" type="person">Percy Bysshe</name>, by future
							pilgrims to this shrine... (<name ref="#EdgcumbeRichard" type="person">Edgcumbe</name> 2:234)</quote>
						<lb/>This meditation on the nature of fandom is wonderfully snobbish in its implicit argument that if the aristocratic <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and other celebrities can practise fan inscription, then it will
						be all right for her son to do so, especially since he is the kinsman of a literary celebrity himself. (It is, however,
						noticeable that she excludes herself from this practice of inscription; though it would become much more common later in the
						century for women to compose tribute poetry and album verses, they seem rarely to have found it socially possible to cut
						graffiti). <figure n="4">

							<figDesc>Petrarch&#8217;s house at Arqu&#224;. From the author&#8217;s own collection.</figDesc>
						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>Nor is this the sole example of Shelley&#8217;s appeal to the Byronic to license her fandom. When she visits Petrarch&#8217;s
						house at Arqu&#224;, she is equally aware of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s previous
						visit, recorded in <title level="m">Childe Harold IV</title>. and goes out of her way to look for its physical traces: <quote
							rendition="#indent2">Petrarch&#8217;s home has been so accurately and so beautifully described by <name
								ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, that I fully expected to find his name among those who have
							visited this romantic spot; but there was no trace of it. (2:238)</quote>
						<lb/>On this occasion, she is obliged to make do with a different celebrity-fan as a model in his place: &#8220;Alfieri has
						written a sonnet on the wall, but it has been scribbled over and much damaged. It is now protected by a glass frame&#8221;
						(2:238). Venice is not only suffused for her with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, whom she
						reads on the spot (&#8220;Every spot is vivified by the author of <title level="a">Childe Harold,</title> and is reminiscent
						of his tragedies&#8221; [2:241]), but is also authoritatively signed by <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
							>Byron</name>, something she records with some satisfaction: &#8220;We saw the &#8216;Bridge of Sighs,&#8217; which is now
						no longer open to the public. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, according to his usual practice,
						has inscribed his name here&#8221; (2:243). Running through these scattered remarks is a recurring sense of privilege
						&#8212;in this case, the satisfaction with which she records that this signature of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s is not available to the general public. It reiterates that sense of being in a
						distinguished fan club that I&#8217;ve already noted as operating in the case of <name ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person"
							>Rousseau</name>, with the twist that its exclusivity is here not merely a matter of exhibiting enough fine feeling but
						having the social clout to gain access to closed sites.</p>
					<p>For Shelley, the traces of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s pilgrimage as a celebrity fan
						legitimate her own practice of literary tourism and associated practices of fandom; equally, the stories retailed in <title
							level="m">Childe Harold</title> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s tragedies help
						her to experience these locales as vivid and colourful. This latter effect, sadly, was not proof against time and grief over
						Wellington&#8217;s death. One last snapshot gives us Lady Frances Shelley in August 1853 trying to access the same reading
						experience while travelling along the Rhine: <quote rendition="#indent2">I read the third canto of <title level="a">Childe
								Harold</title> on the scene itself, but the romance had faded, and I sadly wanted &#8220;the hand to clasp in
							mine!&#8221;</quote>
						<lb/>
						<quote rendition="#indent2">Alas! I now see things as they are, and not as they used to be when I cast around them a halo of
							historical and legendary romance. Every castle and every rock has been so often described, that the subject is worn
							threadbare. (2:321)</quote>
						<lb/>Shelley herself does not attribute this failure of romance primarily to age and sorrow, but to the wear and tear of
						clich&#233; &#8212;the subject has become too common, the genre too well-used, perhaps the landscape had become too well-used
						as well. Writing and travelling in 1853, the age of the railway, mass leisure travel, and Murray&#8217;s guidebooks, was
						another thing to writing and travelling in the age of the carriage.</p>

					<head>V. Loch Katrine Unvisited, 1819</head>
					<p>Shelley&#8217;s sense of clich&#233; may also have been one reason for her surprising failure to visit one famous literary
						locale, Loch Katrine and the Trossachs, the celebrated setting of <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>&#8217;s
						poem <title level="m">The Lady of the Lake</title> (1810). After her visit to Abbotsford in 1819, Shelley travelled on up into
						the Highlands. One of the standard destinations of the time would have been the Trossachs and Loch Katrine, and these were not
						much out of her route. Popular as a beauty spot even before 1810, largely because this wooded gorge was so uncharacteristic of
						the surrounding bare Highland scenery, with the publication of <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>&#8217;s
						poem it was flooded with enthusiastic tourists. <figure n="5">
							<graphic url="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/images/Ellen_s_Isle_Loch_KatrineThumb.jpg" width="750px"/>
							<figDesc>&#8220;Ellen&#8217;s Isle, Loch Katrine&#8221; by Henry B. Wimbush. Postcard c. 1905. Author&#8217;s own
								collection.</figDesc>
						</figure> Two satirical accounts of visiting the Trossachs throw a sidelight on Shelley&#8217;s decision not to visit Loch
						Katrine. The first is by James Hogg, a friend and critic of <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>, who published
						a long, sardonic, and fictional account of the experience of visiting Loch Katrine entitled <title level="a">Malise&#8217;s
							Journey to the Trossacks</title> in the periodical <title level="j">The Spy</title> for 1811. <title level="a"
							>Malise</title> is represented discussing his projected journey with an old Highlander: <quote rendition="#indent2"
							><lb/>He said, I was right to do so, else I would not be in the fashion, but it was a sign, I was too idle, and had very
							little to do at home; but that a Mr <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name> had put all the people mad by
							printing a <emph>lying poem</emph>, about a man that never existed... (<name ref="#BohlsElizabeth" type="person"
								>Bohls</name> &amp; <name ref="#DuncanIan" type="person">Duncan</name> 178)</quote>
						<lb/>If the Highlander is meant to represent an abrasively common-sense, lower-class view of this particular leisure pastime,
						Malise himself represents the class aspirations typical of the literary tourist. Hogg makes him Rousseauist in language and
						stance, but, comically, as not quite fully inhabiting either: <quote rendition="#indent2"><lb/>I wished to lose myself in the
							Trossachs alone; to have no interruption in my contemplations; but to converse only with nature, please myself with
							wondering at her wildest picture, and wonder why I was pleased. (179)</quote>
						<lb/>Malise records his enjoyment of the experience, but this enjoyment is represented not so much as the result of his
						refined reading sensibility as of a little fine whisky; concluding his account, he provides this advice to any who would
						follow in his footsteps: <quote rendition="#indent2"><lb/>Whoever goes to survey the Trossachs, let him have the 11th, 12th
							and 13th division of the first canto of <title level="m">The Lady of the Lake</title> in his heart; a little Highland
							whisky in his head; and then he shall see the most wonderful scene that nature ever produced. (179-180)</quote>
						<lb/>Hogg&#8217;s suggestion that the performance of Rousseauistic sensibility is class-bound is not uncommon in itself;
						usually, however, accounts of these displays of literary sensibility are more sympathetic exactly because they are supposed to
						define and describe class membership. A complementary account of class and reading-practices informs, for example, the remarks
						of <name ref="#MacCullochJohn" type="person">John MacCulloch</name>&#8212;another sophisticated, not to say a jaundiced,
						reader of his friend <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>&#8212;who has much to say on the ways in which the
						landscape of Loch Katrine was being read in the immediate aftermath of the poem&#8217;s success. In his letters to <name
							ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name> detailing his journeys across Scotland between 1811 and 1820 he displays
						considerable class animus in complaining fretfully about the crowds newly infesting the Trossachs&#8212;&#8220;barouches and
						gigs, cocknies and fishermen and poets, Glasgow weavers and travelling haberdashers&#8221; (<name ref="#MacCullochJohn"
							type="person">MacCulloch</name> 194), expressing especial annoyance at the <name ref="#LondonUK" type="place"
							>London</name>er who arrived with a French horn so as to make the most of the echoes made famous by Fitz-James&#8217;
						horn-call. Typical of this flush of tourists and their practices was the young actor <name ref="#MacreadyWilliamCharles"
							type="person">William Charles Macready</name>, who took a three week holiday after giving performances in Glasgow in the
						summer of 1818, walking to Loch Katrine, &#8220;the object of my most ardent wishes&#8221;, specifically for the pleasure of
						rowing &#8220;merrily up the lake, visiting the island, the Goblin&#8217;s Cave, and every spot that <name ref="#ScottWalter"
							type="person">Scott</name>&#8217;s poetry has invested with a never-dying interest&#8221; (<name
							ref="#MacreadyWilliamCharles" type="person">Macready</name> 1:182, 183, 187). <name ref="#MacCullochJohn" type="person"
							>MacCulloch</name> speculates sourly on the nature of the &#8220;never-dying interest&#8221; with which the poem inspired
						such tourists: &#8220;Why the scenes of a fictitious tale should excite the same interest as those where the great drama of
						life has been acted in its various forms, I shall leave you to explain...but I am quite sure that many of the well-informed
						personages who come here to see, believe the whole thing&#8221; (<name ref="#MacCullochJohn" type="person">MacCulloch</name>
						1:193). <name ref="#MacCullochJohn" type="person">MacCulloch</name>&#8217;s lack of enthusiasm for this down-market literalism
						informs his slightly vindictive pleasure in retailing the discomfiture of a too-credulous reader whom he had accompanied in a
						search for the Goblin&#8217;s Cave, Ellen&#8217;s second place of refuge: &#8220;I had accompanied, on one occasion, a cockney
						friend whom I met here, and who, after scrambling among the rocks and bogs for an hour, expressed vast indignation when he had
						reached the Coir nan Uriskin. &#8216;Lord, sir,&#8217; said the [guide], &#8216;there is no cave here but what Mr <name
							ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name> made himself.&#8217; &#8216;What the d&#8212;l, no cave?&#8217; &#8216;Na,
						Sir, but we go where the gentry chooses, and they always ask for the goblin cave first&#8217;&#8221; (1:165). <name
							ref="#MacCullochJohn" type="person">MacCulloch</name>&#8217;s self-distancing from these tourists as middle-class, urban,
						ignorant, and literalist only echoes in another register and from a different class perspective Hogg&#8217;s
						Highlander&#8217;s sardonic account of how in order to enhance the tourist experience there was to be a girl impersonating the
						lady of the lake and a man hired to represent the Goblin himself (<name ref="#BohlsElizabeth" type="person">Bohls</name> and
							<name ref="#DuncanIan" type="person">Duncan</name> 178).</p>
					<p>Shelley herself made no comment upon the phenomenon of Loch Katrine, so one is left to speculate on whether this passion for
						the scenes of fiction, unsecured by the presence of the author, imagined or physical, as tour-guide, was either too
						unsophisticated or too popular an experience to seek out in 1819. It is conceivable that it was both. It may well have been
						the case that there was something of a hierarchy between the two modes of literary fandom. The one, author-centred and
						organised towards visiting, being or envisioning the author, encoded the social equality and literary clubbability of the
						reader; the other, equally well-established in the period, fiction-centred and organised towards being a spectator of
						narrative, connoted a propensity to confuse the real and the fictional, a dangerous and risible lack of sophistication which
						contemporary discourse typically associated with the new mass readership. Between seeing a vision of <name
							ref="#RousseauJeanJaques" type="person">Rousseau</name>, and believing in a girl impersonating the Lady of the Lake, lay a
						rather thin, but acutely class-conscious line between active fancy and sensation-seeking, one that persists to this day in the
						distinction between visiting Austen&#8217;s Chawton and Dickens&#8217; World.</p>
					<p>Over the course of a lifetime, Shelley thus experimented with a variety of forms of literary tourism and fandom. She visited
						both the living and the dead, seeing their landscapes through their eyes and under their signatures. On balance, she adopts an
						author-centred model of fandom, despite her early flirtation with seeing <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person"
						>Scott</name>&#8217;s environs through a visionary haze of <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>&#8217;s
						characters. Her sense that sites could be worn threadbare by over-use suggests some of the reasons that literary tourism
						evolved as a mode of fandom in the period, because what comes through most clearly in Shelley&#8217;s diaries and letters is
						the sense of an anxiety of readership which fuels literary tourism. To indulge in literary tourism was a class-marker, for in
						the early nineteenth century only a few had the luxuries of sufficient education, idleness and wealth to go in the footsteps
						of their favourite authors to any of the places I&#8217;ve been discussing in this paper. As such, the practice served, or was
						supposed to serve, to distinguish the elite tourist-reader from an otherwise worryingly large and undifferentiated mass
						readership. If romantic authors appealed to posterity in order to save themselves from contemporary mass audiences, romantic
						readers turned tourist in order to distinguish themselves from the same mass-audience. Their self-representation as literary
						tourists was designed to distinguish their practice of sophisticated re-reading and re-representation from the mere unthinking
						consumption associated with mass culture. Our own time, in which it is those readers who <emph>do</emph> write their names in
						the visitors&#8217; books of writers&#8217; houses who are regarded as unsophisticated, was still undreamed of.</p>
