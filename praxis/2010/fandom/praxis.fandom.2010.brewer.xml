         	<p rend="noCount">The early 1820s craze for Pierce Egan's and Robert and George Cruikshank's <title level="m">Life in London</title> has long seemed both deeply puzzling and yet somehow emblematic of its age.  Brewer proposes that the mania becomes far more explicable if we focus, in a very precise way, on the interplay between serial publication, the so-called "illegitimate" theater, and the geography of London, especially insofar as those relations, in turn, line up with the peculiar and rapidly shifting reputation and mood of the metropolis in these years.  By carefully mapping out <title level="m">Life in London</title> part by monthly part, and dramatic adaptation by dramatic adaptation, we can both recover the underlying aesthetics of the craze (which revolved around questions of the adequacy of representation) and further theorize what Franco Moretti has termed the "profoundly social aspect[s]" of form:  the ways in which the forms of individual texts are not only shaped by forces beyond their bounds and beyond their control, but also how the significance of those individual forms largely emerges from their perceived relations with one another.  In short, by slowing down and zeroing in upon the very particular qualities of "the Moment of Tom and Jerry," we can begin to think in new ways about how literature works in the world more generally.</p>

				<p>When <name ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace" type="person">William Makepeace Thackeray</name> looked back at his youth, he was more
					than a little bewildered by the ways in which he&#8217;d gotten caught up in the single greatest cultural craze of his boyhood:
					the mania surrounding <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Pierce Egan</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Life in London; or, the
						Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, Esq., and his Elegant Friend Corinthian Tom, Accompanied by Bob Logic, the Oxonian, in
						their Rambles and Sprees through the Metropolis</title>. <name ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace" type="person"
						>Thackeray</name> readily granted that the illustrations which <name ref="#CruikshankRobert" type="person">Robert</name> and
						<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">George Cruikshank</name> had done for the book had not lost their appeal over the
					intervening decades: &#8220;the pictures!&#8212;oh! the pictures are noble still!&#8221; And he fondly reminisced about
					&#8220;what a funny fellow that actor was who performed Dicky Green in ... the play!&#8221; (<title level="a">De Juventute</title>
					510). But &#8220;on reperusal, Tom and Jerry is not so brilliant as I had supposed it to be... the style of the writing ... was
					not pleasing to me; I even thought it a little vulgar ... and as a description of the sports and amusements of London in the
					ancient times,&#8221; <title level="m">Life in London</title> now seemed &#8220;more curious than amusing&#8221; (509-10). Even
					the typography had grown cryptic: &#8220;those inverted commas, those italics, those capitals&#8221; must have been &#8220;as good
					as jokes, though you mayn&#8217;t quite perceive the point&#8221; anymore (511). Indeed, twenty years earlier, <name
						ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace" type="person">Thackeray</name> had been unable to remember &#8220;the literary contents of
					the book&#8221; at all: they had &#8220;passed sheer away,&#8221; even as the &#8220;scenes remain[ed] indelibly engraved upon the
					mind&#8221; (rev. of <title level="m">The Tower</title> 13). Yet despite his retrospective bafflement as to the attractions of
						<name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>&#8217;s writing, <name ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace" type="person"
						>Thackeray</name> was nonetheless firmly convinced that <title level="m">Life in London</title>&#8217;s account of the larks
					of a fashionable young man (Tom), his country cousin (Jerry), and their friend Logic, a witty Oxford student, through the gamut of
					metropolitan life somehow embodied its age and so, more than any other touchstone from those years, could conjure up &#8220;the
					antediluvian world&#8221; before &#8220;railways were made,&#8221; when there was &#8220;an enjoyment of life ...&#160;which
					contrasts strangely with our feelings of 1860,&#8221; now that &#8220;every London man is weary and <foreign xml:lang="fr"
						>blas&#233;</foreign>&#8221; (<title level="a">De Juventute,</title> 505, 503, 510). <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"
						>Cf. his claim a few years earlier that &#8220;the pictures and the writing of these queer volumes&#8221; lead &#8220;you ...
						to suppose that the English aristocracy of 1820 <emph>did</emph> dance and caper in that way, and box and drink at Tom
						Cribb&#8217;s and knock down watchmen; and the children of to-day, turning to their elders, may say, &#8216;Grandmamma, did
						you wear such a dress as that when you danced at Almack&#8217;s? There was very little of it, grandmamma. Did grandpapa kill
						many watchmen when he was a young man, and frequent thieves, gin-shops, cock-fights, and the ring before you married him? Did
						he use to talk the extraordinary slang and jargon which is printed in this book? He is very much changed. He seems a
						gentlemanly old boy enough now&#8217;&#8221; (rev. of <title level="m">Pictures</title> 77, 78).</note></p>
				<p>Considered in isolation, <name ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace" type="person">Thackeray</name>&#8217;s insistence upon the
					puzzling exemplarity of <title level="m">Life in London</title> might come off as simply the half-amused nostalgia of a
					middle-aged man: engaging, perhaps, but not necessarily all that revealing. However, <name ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace"
						type="person">Thackeray</name>&#8217;s confusion seems to have been broadly shared with his contemporaries. <name
						ref="#MackayCharles" type="person">Charles Mackay</name>, for example, cited the time that &#8220;people went mad upon a
					dramatic subject, and nothing was to be heard of but &#8216;Tom and Jerry&#8217;&#8221; as one of the &#8220;Popular Follies in
					Great Cities&#8221;: &#8220;every youth on the town was seized with the fierce desire of distinguishing himself, by knocking down
					the &#8216;<emph>charlies</emph>,&#8217; being locked up all night in a watch-house, or kicking up a row among loose women and
					blackguard men in the low dens of St. Giles&#8217;s&#8221; (336-37). Further examples could be adduced, but the pattern seems
					clear: those old enough to remember the reign of George IV were retrospectively perplexed by the appeal of <title level="m">Life
						in London</title>, but utterly certain that that appeal, whatever it may have been, epitomized something important about the
					early 1820s, what <name ref="#SurteesRS" type="person">R. S. Surtees</name> would tellingly term &#8220;the old Tom-and-Jerry
					days, when fisticuffs were the fashion&#8221; (187).</p>
				<p>And so its popularity would suggest: <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>&#8217;s biographer records that &#8220;so
					great was the demand for copies of the numbers [in which <title level="m">Life in London</title> was originally published] that
					the printers ... could hardly keep pace with it, and whole armies of women and small boys, employed to colour the plates, were
					worked to exhaustion&#8221; (<name ref="#ReidJC" type="person">Reid</name> 73). Before the initial serialization was even
					complete, the earlier parts were reprinted at a higher price, to be followed by at least five other editions before the end of the
					decade. <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">No bibliography exists for <title level="m">Life in London</title>. I base this
						estimate on a collation of various library catalogs with the newspaper advertisements reproduced in <title level="m">British
							Fiction</title>.</note>Nor was &#8220;all London&#8221; content to &#8220;read it,&#8221; they also, as <name
						ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace" type="person">Thackeray</name> recalled, &#8220;went to see it in its dramatic shape&#8221;
					(rev. of <title level="m">The Tower</title> 13). <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">For (not wholly reliable) overviews of
						the craze, see <name ref="#HindleyCharles" type="person">Hindley</name>, <name ref="#HottenJohnCamden" type="person"
							>Hotten</name>, and <name ref="#ReidJC" type="person">Reid</name> 73-92.</note>At least ten different metropolitan
					theaters offered plays based upon <title level="m">Life in London</title> in the 1821-22 and 1822-23 seasons.&#160; Indeed, at
					several points in the spring and summer of 1822 one could take in up to eight competing productions, the most popular of
						which&#8212;<name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">W. T. Moncrieff</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Tom and
					Jerry</title>&#8212;ran for an unprecedented three hundred nights:&#160; &#8220;from the highest to the lowest, all classes were
					alike anxious to witness its representation; Dukes and Dustmen were equally interested in its performance, and Peers might be seen
					mobbing it with Apprentices to obtain an admission.&#160; Seats were sold for weeks before they could be occupied.... In the furor
					of its popularity, persons have been known to travel post from the furthest parts of the kingdom to see it; and five guineas have
					been offered in an evening for a single seat&#8221; (<name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name> 1826, v). <note n="4"
						place="foot" resp="editors">Tickets at the Adelphi normally ran one to four shillings, depending on where one sat.</note>Nor
					was this an exclusively London phenomenon: over the next few years, performances (usually of <name ref="#MoncrieffWT"
						type="person">Moncrieff</name>&#8217;s version) were staged in Birmingham, Bridgnorth, Brighton, Cheltenham, Dublin,
					Edinburgh, Glasgow, Hull, Lincoln, Liverpool, Newark, Newcastle, Redruth, Shrewsbury, and Southampton, not to mention the even
					more far flung theaters of Albany, <name ref="#BaltimoreUS" type="place">Baltimore</name>, Boston, Charleston, Montreal, New
					Orleans, <name ref="#NewYorkUS" type="place">New York</name>, <name ref="#PhiladelphiaUS" type="place">Philadelphia</name>, York,
					Upper Canada, and even Sydney. Opportunistic booksellers quickly commissioned a range of imitations, including <title level="m"
						>Life in St. George&#8217;s Fields</title>, <title level="m">Real Life in London</title>, and <title level="m">Female Life in
						London</title> (the latter was simply a reprint of Frances Burney&#8217;s <title level="m">Evelina</title>). The ballad
					publisher James Catnach offered several different broadside redactions, while countless cordials, dances, dinners, fans, games,
					handkerchiefs, porcelain figures, prints, screens, slang dictionaries, snuffboxes, song books, sweetmeats, tea boards, and toy
					theater sheets were produced for those who wished to include Tom and Jerry in their daily rituals. <note n="5" place="foot"
						resp="editors">For a rather bitter catalog of most of these items, see <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>,
							<title level="m">
							<name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Pierce Egan</name>&#8217;s Finish</title> 8-12.</note>Even the clothing trades got
					in on the act. According to <name ref="#HottenJohnCamden" type="person">John Camden Hotten</name>, &#8220;tailors, bootmakers, and
					hatters recommended nothing but Corinthian shapes and Tom and Jerry patterns&#8221; (10) and at least some of their
					recommendations carried all the way across the Atlantic: in Richmond, Virginia, the young <name ref="#PoeEdgarAllen" type="person"
						>Edgar Allen Poe</name> singled out a romantic rival&#8217;s &#8220;Tom and Jerry brim / And dove-tailed coat, obtained at
					cost&#8221; for particular mockery (11). Clearly something about <title level="m">Life in London</title> resonated with a broad
					cross-section of the reading, theatrical, and consumer publics of the early 1820s.</p>
				<p>Yet what that something was seems to have already become semi-incomprehensible by the 1840s and that incomprehensibility only
					increased as the century wore on until even the foremost chronicler of the craze was forced to confess that &#8220;although Life
					in London ... did make our grandfathers so very&#8212;<emph>very</emph>! merry in the first quarter of the Nineteenth Century, we
					are constrained to admit; that it is a terrible dull and tedious work to read through in the present day.&#8221; Indeed,
					&#8220;the present generation will find in some of the scenes depicted in such glowing colours, many of the fashions, manners, and
					customs, which prevailed in the reign of King George the Fourth, together with certain landmarks of the past, which no one need
					regret leaving far behind, and ought to give every encouragement to those who live under the rule of Queen Victoria to maintain a
					firm faith in the social progress of the age&#8221; (<name ref="#HindleyCharles" type="person">Hindley</name> ii-iii, iv).
					Whatever significance <title level="m">Life in London</title> still had lay in what <name ref="#HottenJohnCamden" type="person"
						>Hotten</name> termed &#8220;its value as a true picture of life fifty years ago&#8221;: &#8220;the last days of coarse
					caricatures, of dueling, and of the glorious three-bottle system after dinner&#8221; (9). <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"
						>Cf. the 1860s retitling of <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name>&#8217;s play as <title level="m">Tom and
							Jerry; or, Life in London in 1820</title>.</note></p>
				<p>Most of the extant scholarship on <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> and the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert"
						type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name> has simply replicated this pattern of being convinced that the
					success of <title level="m">Life in London</title> was somehow emblematic of its age (the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert"
						type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshank</name> prints have been used to illustrate dozens of books on the Regency
					and reign of George IV), yet finding it incredibly difficult to specify what its appeal might have been, other than as a
					vague&#8212;and generally unconvincing&#8212;adumbration of another, supposedly more readily comprehensible phenomenon like <title
						level="m">The Pickwick Papers</title> or the fl&#226;neur or Bakhtinian heteroglossia. Even the best critics (who recognize
					that <title level="m">Life in London</title> was &#8220;a summation of the passing culture ..., not a foretaste of the new&#8221;
					and so really shouldn&#8217;t be folded into the <foreign xml:lang="fr">longue dur&#233;e</foreign> of Victorianism) seem to be
					unable to explain the sheer magnitude of the craze: why such &#8220;low-life fantasies&#8221; should have gone supernova in the
					first half of the 1820s, rather than simply faded away (<name ref="#GatrellVic" type="person">Gatrell</name> 552, 555). <note
						n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">For a similar complaint (and a different, but not wholly incompatible, attempt to solve this
						problem), see <name ref="#DartGregory" type="person">Dart</name>.</note></p>
				<p>Clearly this is a problem for the history of reading and theatergoing and ordinarily I would turn to the letters, diaries, and
					marginalia of <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>&#8217;s contemporaries in order to try to reconstruct how <title
						level="m">Life in London</title> might actually have been read and watched. Alas, such evidence seems to be more than usually
					scarce in this case and that which I have found&#8212;such as <name ref="#ClareJohn" type="person">John Clare</name>&#8217;s
					suggestion that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Don Juan</title>
					&#8220;seems a fit partner for Tom &amp; Jerry&#8221; (34) or <name ref="#ArbuthnotHarriet" type="person">Harriet
					Arbuthnot</name>&#8217;s dismay at how the audience at a performance of <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person"
					>Moncrieff</name>&#8217;s version &#8220;seemed to enjoy a representation of scenes in which, from their appearance, one might
					infer they frequently shared&#8221; (144)&#8212;come off, at least initially, as even more idiosyncratic or blinkered than such
					traces generally are. <note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The comparative lack of evidence here may in part be a function of
						the medium in which the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert" type="person"/>
						<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name> worked: &#8220;diary- or letter-writers referred ... seldom to
						prints&#8221; of any sort (<name ref="#GatrellVic" type="person">Gatrell</name> 213). Cf. <name ref="#BrattonJacky"
							type="person">Jacky Bratton</name>&#8217;s discussion of how &#8220;very little unquestionably first-hand evidence&#8221;
						surrounds &#8220;entertainment beyond and outside the hegemonic realm of the [patent] theatres&#8221; (134).</note></p>
				<p>Rather than throw up my hands at the absence of our customary tools, however, I decided to try something of a methodological
					experiment. Intrigued by <name ref="#MorettiFranco" type="person">Franco Moretti</name>&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;the most
					profoundly social aspect of literature is its form&#8221; ( <title level="a">Preface</title> xii) and suspecting that the
					difficulty which previous scholars had had in explaining the appeal of <title level="m">Life in London</title> stemmed at least in
					part from the temporal breadth of their inquiries&#8212;the nineteenth-century novel, the eighteenth-century &#8220;urban
					odyssey,&#8221; late Georgian urban pleasure, even simply &#8220;Regency <name ref="#LondonUK" type="place">London</name>&#8221;
					(which still takes in a full decade)&#8212;I decided to map out, <name ref="#MorettiFranco" type="person">Moretti</name>-like,
						<title level="m">Life in London</title> part by monthly part, and then dramatic adaptation by dramatic adaptation, in order to
					see if those maps could reveal anything more specific to the early 1820s about the appeal of these texts to readers and playgoers.
					My hope was that by figuring out how these texts unfolded both temporally and spatially and how that unfolding was in turn related
					to the probable time and place of their reading or viewing, I could discern something about the &#8220;social aspect&#8221; of
					their form which was otherwise unavailable for scrutiny. In so doing, I fondly imagined, I might finally be able to devise a way
					to combine a proper consideration of form with the history of reading and theatergoing&#8212;a consummation which I, at least,
					have long devoutly wished. <note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">For a similar (and I think kindred) ambition to &#8220;unfold a
						reading&#8221; of a set of objects &#8220;from within a synchronic analysis of its production and use,&#8221; see <name
							ref="#LovellMargarettaM" type="person">Lovell</name> 3. As she notes, &#8220;sets of objects, by the power of their

				<p>The results of my mapping <title level="m">Life in London</title> were a revelation and immediately illuminated a number of puzzles
					which the other scholarship I had read had been unable to solve to my satisfaction. The patterns which emerged from this mapping
					(and, I think, their significance) were then confirmed by the maps which I made of the most successful dramatic adaptations and by
					what evidence exists regarding the reactions of early readers and playgoers. Put most baldly, the formal elements which best
					explain the mania spawned by <title level="m">Life in London</title> come from those parts of the book which appeared before the
					narrative, such as it is, ever got going. Accordingly, any attempt to account for the power of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> by theorizing how its narrative works is almost automatically going to lead us astray: quite simply, it would
					be looking in the wrong place. Whatever <title level="m">Life in London</title> may be, it&#8217;s not ultimately a
					nineteenth-century novel in which plot and the fate of emplotted characters are the fundamental sources of interest and power.</p>
				<p>So what did I find when I did my mapping? First let me highlight a small, but extremely telling detail, one which can serve as a
					key to unlock the significance of what the maps reveal: a note headed &#8220;SECOND EDITION, JAN. 8, 1821,&#8221; which <name
						ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> added to retract his playful banter in the first edition with Friedrich Christian
					Accum, now that the latter had been caught tearing leaves out of a library book at the Royal Institution. <note n="10"
						place="foot" resp="editors">
						<name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>, <title level="m">Life in London</title> 2nd ed. 9n. All subsequent
						quotations from <title level="m">Life in London</title> will be from the first edition.</note>Accum&#8217;s misplaced zeal for
					knowledge (in an age before photocopying, he wanted to take an article on chocolate home with him) doesn&#8217;t matter for our
					purposes. But <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>&#8217;s mention of a second edition in early January 1821 is huge,
					since producing such entailed reprinting and again hand-coloring both the text and the plates for the already extent Parts One
					through Five of <title level="m">Life in London</title> and raising the price of those reprinted parts and all of the remaining
					installments from two-and-a-half shillings apiece to three. Bibliographers and collectors of the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert"
						type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name> have long known of this second edition and would readily concede
					how unprecedented it was. Quite simply, illustrated books at this price point had never sold so quickly as to necessitate more
					than a single edition while the original serialization was still underway. Even <title level="m">The Tour of Doctor
					Syntax</title>, which largely created the market for such books, didn&#8217;t go into a second edition until its initial
					appearance in <title level="j">The Poetical Magazine</title> was complete. <note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">There is no
						direct evidence of the size of any of the editions of <title level="m">Life in London</title>, though it seems reasonably safe
						to presume that they were somewhere between the 1,500 copies of the fairly ordinary <title level="m">The Adventures of Johnny
							Newcombe in the Navy</title> (with sixteen plates by Rowlandson) which were produced in 1818 and the 7,000 copies of the
						highly sensational <title level="m">Memoirs of Harriette Wilson</title>&#8212;with ten plates&#8212;which were produced in
						1825 (<name ref="#StClairWilliam" type="person">St Clair</name> 561, 657). Even the low end of this spectrum would have
						allowed the publishers to have &#8220;netted some thousands&#8221; from <title level="m">Life in London</title> by March of
						1822, when the book was in its third or fourth edition (<title level="a">London Chit-Chat</title> 333).</note> However, no one
					has apparently ever thought through the significance of what this second edition reveals: namely, that <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> was astonishingly successful by a few days after the release of Part Five. Yet, if we look at what has happened
					in the text to that point, we get almost nothing by our usual novelistic standards. Those first five parts are comprised almost
					exclusively of an extended pitch for the importance of &#8220;seeing Life,&#8221; along with character sketches of Logic, Tom, and
					Jerry. The first episode remotely close to actual narrative (certainly the first event which the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert"
						type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name> deem worthy of illustration) is only half finished by the close of
					Part Five&#8212;just a week before the second edition. Prior to that, nothing happens. Or, to be precise, none of the events which
					figure in the illustrations or Victorian memory have yet occurred by that point in the text (a good forty-two percent of the way
					in). <figure n="1">

					</figure> On the other hand, readers had already gotten fifteen plates (three in each part), including many of the ones which
					would go on to be the most iconic: say, &#8220;Tom Getting the Best of a Charley&#8221; (<ref

					<ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/RCOldSite/www/praxis/fandom/brewer/slideshow2_1.html#image" rend="_blank"> SLIDESHOW TWO</ref><lb/><lb/> In the first four parts of the text, as I&#8217;ve
					just suggested, there&#8217;s almost nothing in terms of narrative, and what little there is in Part Five hardly involves much in
					the way of &#8220;rambles and sprees&#8221;: Jerry begins to get fitted for new clothes at Tom&#8217;s elegant house in the West
					End. With the plates, on the other hand, our heroes travel all over the West End and Covent Garden, indulging themselves in
					various sorts of sports, gambling, slumming, and other larks, including dalliances with both their mistresses and the prostitutes
					who haunt the theater. What possible sense can this disparity make? Even if the narrative existed only to flesh out the plates (as
					was sometimes charged to be the case by later partisans of the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert" type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name>) and so necessarily had to lag behind, surely a practiced
					journalist like <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> wouldn&#8217;t have needed three whole months to get to the
					action.</p>
				<p>Unless, of course, getting to the action wasn&#8217;t really the point. I&#8217;d like to propose that this disparity between the
					text and plates, far from being either irrelevant or a clumsy bit of throat-clearing on <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person"
						>Egan</name>&#8217;s part while he figured out what to do, can actually go quite far toward explaining the astonishing appeal
					of those early parts of <title level="m">Life in London</title>, whose success brought the text to &#8220;the tipping point&#8221;
					where it could cross over into a full-scale sensation (after which the usual feedback loops of commercial success and
					&#8220;extraordinary popular delusions&#8221; could kick in). <note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">As my phrasing should
						suggest, my thinking about the dynamics of cultural markets has been shaped by <name ref="#GladwellMalcolm" type="person"
							>Gladwell</name> and by the work and conversation of <name ref="#MorettiFranco" type="person">Moretti</name>.</note>So
					let&#8217;s turn to those early parts and consider how their seemingly mismatched text and plates might actually have worked
					together.</p>
				<p>The first thing to notice is how sustained and (in its own way) systematic a pitch for its own aesthetics we are offered. According
					to <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>, <quote rendition="#indent2">the grand object of this work is an attempt to
						portray what is termed &#8216;SEEING LIFE&#8217; in all its various bearings upon society, from the <emph>high-mettled</emph>
						CORINTHIAN of St. James&#8217;s, <emph>swaddled</emph> in luxury, down to the <emph>needy</emph> FLUE-FAKER of Wapping,
							<emph>born without a shirt</emph>, and not a <emph>bit of scran</emph> in his cup to allay his piteous cravings.
						&#8216;LIFE IN LONDON&#8217; is the sport in view, and provided the chase is turned to a good account, &#8216;<emph>seeing
							Life</emph>&#8217; will be found to have its advantages ... whether an evening is spent over a bottle of champaign, at
							<emph>Long&#8217;s</emph>, or in taking a &#8216;<emph>third of a daffy</emph>&#8217; at <emph>Tom
						Belchers&#8217;s</emph>... Equally so, in <emph>waltzing</emph> with the <emph>angelics</emph> at my <emph>Lady</emph>
						FUBB&#8217;S assembly, at Almack&#8217;s, or <emph>sporting a toe</emph> at Mrs. SNOOK&#8217;S <emph>hop</emph> at St.
						Kit&#8217;s, among the pretty <emph>straw</emph> damsels and dashing chippers, if a <emph>knowledge</emph> of
						&#8216;Life,&#8217; an acquaintance with <emph>character</emph>, and the importance of <emph>comparison</emph>, are the
						ultimate results. (24) <note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">The first two sentences in this passage also appeared in the

						xii).</note></quote><lb/> &#8220;Seeing life&#8221; thus seems to involve appreciating both the marked social and geographic
					variety of the metropolis and the underlying similarity of pleasures which yokes such variety together into a coherent, if
					pointedly not unified vision of &#8220;Life in London.&#8221; For those able to relish it, &#8220;a <emph>blow out</emph> may
					likewise be found as <emph>savory</emph> and as <emph>high scented</emph> at Mother O&#8217;Shaughnessy&#8217;s, in the <emph>back
						settlements</emph> of the <emph>Holy Land</emph>, by the hungry <emph>cut-away</emph> Paddy Mulroony, as the
						<emph>Mulligatawny soup</emph> may be swallowed with peculiar <emph>go&#251;t</emph> by one of the fastidious, squeamish,
					screwed-up descendants of the OGILBY train at Grillion&#8217;s hotel&#8221; (26-27). Or, to put it differently, as <name
						ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> clearly delights in doing, &#8220;hundreds of individuals in the Metropolis think
					it no loss of time, and feel as much interest in matching their <emph>tykes</emph> at JEM ROLFE&#8217;S amphitheatre for a
						<emph>quid</emph> or two; or in drawing the badger at HARLEQUIN BILLY&#8217;S menagerie, and boasting of the goodness and
					breed of their dogs, as MY Lord CARE-FOR-NOTHING does in relating the pedigree of his high-mettled cattle, and talking with the
						<emph>touters</emph> and jockeys at Newmarket&#8221; (34). Once one comprehends &#8220;the advantages resulting from the
						<emph>varieties</emph> of &#8216;LIFE&#8217;&#8221; (29), one can supposedly acquire a sort of universal comfort akin to that
					of Tom, who &#8220;was as much at home in blowing a cloud, listening to a night-row charge at a watch-house, as he proved himself
					an adept in all the luxuriant, voluptuous movements, when waltzing at Almack&#8217;s (42).</p>
				<p>I quote so extensively in order to demonstrate the ways in which <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>&#8217;s style
					enacts the very aesthetics he&#8217;s championing: like life in <name ref="#LondonUK" type="place">London</name> itself by <name
						ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>&#8217;s account, <title level="m">Life in London</title> jumbles together
					seemingly disparate kinds of people, sorts of places, and perhaps above all varieties of language (and typography) in order to
					bring out their putative underlying similarity and the advantages of learning to be comfortable amidst them all. If &#8220;half of
					the world are <emph>up</emph> to&#8221; &#8220;the <emph>slang</emph>&#8221; he introduces, &#8220;it is my intention to make the
					other half <emph>down</emph> to it. LIFE IN LONDON demands this sort of demonstration. A kind of <emph>cant</emph> phraseology is
					current from one end of the Metropolis to the other&#8221; and so needs to be replicated in order to properly render &#8220;real
					Life&#8221; (84-85n) and so equip his readers with the tools to emulate his hero, Richard Brinsley Sheridan: &#8220;a man at all
					times, whether viewed at dashing routs, surrounded by the most accomplished beauties; or <emph>caught</emph> upon the
						<emph>sly</emph>, peeping at midnight revels in the precincts of Covent Garden&#8221; (16). Those beauties might talk
					&#8220;of &#8216;a <emph>row</emph>&#8217; which occurred ...&#160;last evening,&#8221; while the Covent Garden revelers would
					allude to a &#8220;<emph>lark</emph>... at a gin-spinner&#8217;s,&#8221; but, for <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person"
						>Egan</name>, slang was &#8220;as strongly marked&#8221; (84-85n) in St. James&#8217;s as it was in St. Giles and it was only
					from &#8220;the knowledge and experience&#8221; of both that one might attain &#8220;complete possession&#8221; (75) of
					one&#8217;s self.</p>
				<p>Of course, inevitably, there will be a gap between any representation and its object and <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person"
						>Egan</name> not only knows this, but highlights it again and again as a source of potential pleasure. Early on, he insists
					upon the adequacy of his representations: he&#8217;s offering &#8220;his readers a <foreign xml:lang="la">Camera Obscura</foreign>
					View&#8221; through which <quote rendition="#indent2">LIFE IN LONDON will be seen without any fear or apprehension of danger
						either from <emph>fire</emph> or <emph>water</emph>; avoiding also breaking a limb, receiving a <emph>black eye</emph>, losing
						a pocket-book, and getting into a watch-house; picking up a <emph>Cyprian</emph> and being exposed the next morning before a
						magistrate for being found <emph>disorderly</emph>. Likewise in steering clear of all those innumerable rows and troubles
						incident or allied to &#8216;keeping it up, and loving of fun.&#8217; It would have been fortunate indeed for poor JERRY and
						CORINTHIAN TOM if they had possessed such advantages. But &#8216;experience makes fools wise,&#8217; and as good-natured
						HAWTHORN and laughing TOM are now about to relate their <emph>adventures</emph>, for the benefit of <emph>fire-side</emph>
						heroes and sprightly maidens, who may feel a wish to &#8216;see Life&#8217; without receiving a <emph>scratch</emph>, it must
						be considered that the Metropolis is now before them. (19)</quote><lb/> Tom and Jerry are thus, it would seem, perfectly up to
					the job of &#8220;seeing Life&#8221; on behalf of these &#8220;<emph>fire-side</emph> heroes and sprightly maidens,&#8221; who
					need not go out, Adam and Eve-like, into the metropolis &#8220;now before them&#8221; in order to &#8220;benefit&#8221; from it.
					Rather they can simply sit back and appreciate the splendor of its variety: after all, &#8220;POUSSIN never had a more luxuriant,
					variegated, and interesting subject for a landscape; nor had SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS finer portraits for his canvass than what have
					already had a sitting for their likenesses to embellish LIFE IN LONDON&#8221; (17). Yet only three months later, as the text was
					on the verge of finally plunging into those &#8220;adventures,&#8221; these same heroes and maidens got to witness Tom telling
					Jerry that &#8220;volumes would not suffice to portray the various characters which <emph>cross our path</emph> DAILY
						<emph>in</emph>
					<name ref="#LondonUK" type="place">LONDON</name>. A <emph>theoretical</emph> inquiry will not go far enough in ascertaining the
					real features of society in the <emph>Metropolis</emph>. You are now on the <emph>primest</emph> SPOT in all the world.... I
					would, therefore, advise you to make the best use of your time. I have seen a great deal of LIFE myself; but I have a great deal
					yet to <emph>see!</emph>&#8221; (143). If even Tom has &#8220;a great deal yet to <emph>see</emph>&#8221; and &#8220;a
						<emph>theoretical</emph> inquiry&#8221; will not suffice, then it would seem that representation of the sort which <name
						ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> is offering up will not ultimately prove sufficient: those heroes and maidens
					would have to leave their firesides and risk injury or embarrassment if they wished to actually &#8220;see Life.&#8221; Yet this
					insistence upon the inadequacy of representation doesn&#8217;t simply supercede or cancel out the previous claims of adequacy.
					Rather, the two seem to coexist, albeit uneasily:&#160; a relationship nicely encapsulated by the sheer repetition of phrases like
					&#8220;such is the diversity of LIFE IN LONDON&#8221; (30) or &#8220;it is a <foreign xml:lang="la">multum in parvo</foreign>
					trait of <title level="a">Life in London</title> &#8221; (139n), the ambiguity of whose reference&#8212;the book?&#160; the
					city?&#160; both?&#8212;at once collapses and maintains the distinction between <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person"
					>Egan</name>&#8217;s text and the metropolis itself.</p>
				<p>I dwell on these questions of the adequacy of representation&#8212;which, I think, are repeated so insistently as to be nearly
					inescapable, even for rather distractible readers, as most of the early adopters of <title level="m">Life in London</title>
					probably were&#8212;because they help to explain the workings of the plates in these early parts and how their interaction with
					these questions helped bring this book to the tipping point. For one thing, the plates themselves supposedly share the
					text&#8217;s paradoxical blend of strict mimesis and adherence to artistic convention. In the note on slang I quoted earlier,
						<name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> goes on to suggest that &#8220;my ingenious friends, ROBERT and GEORGE
					CRUIKSHANK, whose talents in representing &#8216;the living manners as they rise,&#8217; stand unrivalled in this peculiar line,
					feel as strongly impressed with the value of <emph>delicacy</emph> as I do. But if some of the plates should appear rather
						<emph>warm</emph>, the purchasers of Life in London may feel assured, that nothing is added to them tending to
						<emph>excite</emph>, but, on the contrary, they have most anxiously, on all occasions given the preference rather to
						&#8216;<emph>extenuate</emph>&#8217; than to &#8216;set down aught in malice.&#8217; All the Plates are the exact
					representations, as they occurred, of the various classes of society&#8221; (85n). And while it would probably be impossible to
					determine whether any particular image has been extenuated or exactly represented (or somehow both at once), the plates do
					stylistically bear out this odd betwixt and betweeness. <figure n="4">

					</figure> On one hand, they offer what seem (on the basis of other evidence we have) to be quite accurate renderings of their

					</figure> A similar variation can be seen in a plate from Part Six (which appeared a few weeks after the tipping point, but the
					note &#8220;TO THE SUBSCRIBERS&#8221; from &#8220;THE AUTHOR IN DISTRESS!&#8221; inserted to explain the brevity of Part Five had
					hinted at this scene): <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_10.jpg">in one copy</ref> Tom and Jerry&#8217;s punches in &#8220;a
					street Row&#8221; are landing hard enough to draw blood, <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_11.jpg">in another</ref>
					they&#8217;re not. Obviously these variations undercut the sustainability of any claim to catch &#8220;&#8216;the living manners
					as they rise.&#8217;&#8221; Were these scenes wholly mimetic, then surely one of these copies would have to be wrong: at the
					moment represented, Sue&#8217;s breasts were either covered or uncovered, just as Tom&#8217;s fist did or did not smash his
					opponent&#8217;s nose. But the very impossibility (and ridiculousness) of even trying to ascertain the truth here only underscores
					what I think is the broader project of these plates within the aesthetics of representational adequacy and inadequacy that
					I&#8217;ve been sketching out.</p>
				<p>If the point of the text of the first five parts of <title level="m">Life in London</title> is to learn how to &#8220;see
					Life,&#8221; then the plates in those parts are offering up specimens of &#8220;Life&#8221; to be seen. That is, they are offering
					the promise of narrativity. They aren&#8217;t yet narrative (we don&#8217;t know how our heroes got into these situations, nor
					what will come next, nor even in what sequence these various episodes will occur and whether or not that sequence is significant).
					Rather, they&#8217;re a sign that &#8220;the Rambles and Sprees through the Metropolis&#8221; which the wrappers of each part
					promise are, in fact, on the way, that at some point soon we will learn what was involved in Tom&#8217;s &#8220;accommodat[ing]
					himself, as much as possible, to the dispositions of the company in which he might be situated&#8221; (110). But given the
					uncertainty of how adequate these plates ultimately are as representations, I&#8217;d like to suggest that the anticipated
					narrativity of &#8220;seeing Life&#8221; is, dare I say it, always already divided. <figure n="12">

					</figure> &#8220;<emph>Fire-side</emph> heroes and sprightly maidens&#8221; couldn&#8217;t be sure if the breasts of fashionable
					cyprians were routinely bared during private performances of what <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> later termed
					&#8220;the elegant but <emph>lascivious</emph> waltz&#8221; (196), any more than they could be sure that coffee shops near the
					Olympic Theatre routinely degenerated into late night comic riots (see <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_12.jpg" rend="_blank">figure
						12</ref>). But they also couldn&#8217;t be sure that they didn&#8217;t ... unless they went out to see for themselves.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Seeing Life&#8221; can thus go in two quite different directions: one could wait to &#8220;see&#8221; the episodes depicted
					in the plates as they eventually unfolded (in the months after the tipping point of the second edition). Or one could go out into
					the metropolis in pursuit of what one hoped would be similar adventures. Both solutions seem to have been engaged in. On the one
					hand, in a note on the wrappers for Part Four, <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> let his &#8220;Subscribers&#8221;
					know that &#8220;in consequence of several applications having been made to the Publishers respecting the EXPLANATIONS OF THE
					PLATES, it is necessary to observe, that they are merely given ... to keep the plates <emph>alive</emph>; but the
						<emph>subjects</emph> of them will be more minutely described, <emph>in their proper place</emph> in the body of the
					work,&#8221; which would suggest a certain readerly impatience for the plates&#8217; promise of narrativity to be fulfilled. On
					the other hand, though, as <name ref="#SalesRoger" type="person">Roger Sales</name> has pointed out, readers are &#8220;given
					enough information to plan their own rambles&#8221; (161) and over the next few years the press would repeatedly claim that they
					were doing just that with a vengeance: by one report, there were &#8220;nineteen watchmen prostrate with their boxes on their
					backs&#8221; in April 1822 alone (<title level="a">Annus Mirabilis!</title> 23). <note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">The
						prank of &#8220;boxing&#8221; or &#8220;flooring&#8221; &#8220;a charley&#8221; was not, of course, invented by <name

						it supposedly spiked dramatically in the wake of <title level="m">Life in London</title>. For Camelford&#8217;s lark, see
							<name ref="#TolstoyNikolai" type="person">Tolstoy</name> 160.</note>Similarly, in December of that year three
					&#8220;dashing young gentlemen&#8221; were charged &#8220;with making a &#8216;<emph>Tom-Jerry-and-Logic</emph>&#8217; row, after
					midnight, near St. Thomas&#8217;s Hospital&#8221; in Southwark. Among other things, they were &#8220;crying &#8216;Go it,
					Jerry!&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;Go it, Tom!&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;Go it, Logic!&#8217; &amp;c. One of them said &#8216;now we&#8217;ll
					floor the d&#8212;d Charley.&#8217; They then ran with great force against his watch-box, and endeavoured to upset it, so as to
					inclose him inside of it.&#8221; An alderman said &#8220;not a night elapsed but that in some part of the town the peace was
					broken by young thoughtless fellows apeing &#8216;Tom, Jerry, and Logic&#8217;&#8221; (<title level="j">Glasgow Herald</title>,
					presumably reprinting an item from an unidentified <name ref="#LondonUK" type="place">London</name> paper).</p>
				<p>Obviously these particular accounts postdate the specific months in late 1820 and early 1821 we&#8217;ve been examining&#8212;and
					attribute these pranks to &#8220;the Tom and Jerry fever extending to all the minor theatres&#8221; (<title level="a">Annus
						Mirabilis!</title> 23)&#8212;but I see no reason to presume that some sort of readerly sprees were not already being
					undertaken during the serialization of the first five parts. Certainly the geography of those early parts, along with the
					apparently intended readership and the peculiar temporality of serial reading, solicits such excursions&#8212;if only to ascertain
					the adequacy or inadequacy of <title level="m">Life in London</title>&#8217;s representation. Consider the spatial distribution of
					the places depicted in the plates of the first five numbers.<lb/><lb/>
					<ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/RCOldSite/www/praxis/fandom/brewer/slideshow3_1.html#image" rend="_blank"> SLIDESHOW THREE</ref>
				</p>
				<p>Six are in the fashionable West End (Tom&#8217;s apartment, the Westminster Pit, Corinthian Kate&#8217;s apartment, Rotten Row,
					Jackson&#8217;s rooms in Bond Street, and a game of whist played near St. James&#8217;s park). The other nine, however, are in the
					rather more socially varied area surrounding Covent Garden (Temple Bar, a coffee shop near the Olympic Theatre, a watchhouse near
					Bow Street, the English Opera House, Covent Garden Theatre, Bow Street itself, a fortune teller&#8217;s house near Russell Street,
					a gin shop near Covent Garden Theatre, and the tavern run by the retired boxing champion, Tom Cribb, near the Haymarket). And even
					if a reader didn&#8217;t know exactly where a specific place was located, the two areas of town are quite visually and
					thematically distinct from one another and so it would have been easy enough to figure out the approximate neighborhood in
					question. West of Regent Street we get fine clothing and sports and gambling and high-end courtesans like Corinthian Kate and Sue.
					East of Regent Street we get larks and their consequences, slumming, masquerade, various sorts of drinking, and a more ordinary
					species of prostitute. To some extent, of course, such a spatial division of <name ref="#LondonUK" type="place">London</name> was
					nothing new&#8212;even if the construction of Regent Street had significantly bolstered it by &#8220;damming up Soho&#8221; (<name
						ref="#SummersonJohn" type="person">Summerson</name> 125). But I suspect the division was particularly resonant for the target
					public for <title level="m">Life in London</title>, which, given the fairly steep price of the book (and its apparent absence from
					most circulating libraries), probably constituted a good chunk of its actual readership. <note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors"
						>At two and a half (and then with the second edition, three) shillings a part, <title level="m">Life in London</title> cost a
						minimum of thirty-three and a half shillings to purchase in its entirety, and for readers who didn&#8217;t get in on the
						action before the second edition, the total price for the parts would have been thirty-six shillings. By way of comparison,
						each of the contemporary Waverley novels sold for thirty-one and a half shillings, as did the authorized editions of the first
						two cantos of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. While these prices need not have prevented an eager reader of lesser means
						from gaining access to <title level="m">Life in London</title> (there&#8217;s always borrowing or theft or reading in
						bookshops), they do suggest a probable demographic: these are luxury goods and so required a disposable income beyond the
						reach of most Britons. As for circulating libraries, <title level="m">Life in London</title> appears in only one of the dozen
						catalogs surveyed by <title level="m">British Fiction</title> (and <name ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace" type="person"
							>Thackeray</name> reported in 1840 that he had been &#8220;to no less than five circulating libraries in quest of the
						book&#8221; without success [rev. of <title level="m">The Tower</title> 12]). Scott&#8217;s <title level="m"
							>Kenilworth</title> (another 1821 production), on the other hand, appears in all twelve and even Anna Maria Porter&#8217;s
							<title level="m">The Village of Mariendorpt</title> was in eight of the libraries. I presume <title level="m">Life in
							London</title> was a bit too raffish in its reputation to be included in what generally tried to position themselves as
						family-friendly establishments. Certainly that&#8217;s what <title level="j">John Bull</title>&#8217;s insistence that
						&#8220;we do not know what feelings the generality of fathers of families may have upon such subjects, but for ourselves we
						would no more suffer a copy of the book ... to be seen in our house, than we would a copy of &#8216;LITTLE&#8217;s
						Poems,&#8217; or &#8216;PAINE's <title level="m">Age of Reason</title>&#8217;&#8221; would suggest (9 Dec. 1821).</note>In his
					lengthy invocation, <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> singles out three businesses which he hopes will help make
						<title level="m">Life in London</title> a success: the bookshops of Henry Colburn and John Murray and the printshop of George
					Humphrey. Colburn will, <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> wishes, inform &#8220;those dashing belles and beaux,
					whose morning lounge gives thy repository of the mind an air of fashion, that LIFE IN LONDON is worthy of their perusal,&#8221;
					while Murray, whose &#8220;splendid threshold&#8221; frightens away the &#8220;pale, wan, and <emph>shabbily</emph> clad,&#8221;
					will &#8220;take the unsophisticated JERRY HAWTHORN by the hand&#8221; and &#8220;introduce him to thy numerous
					acquaintance.&#8221; And if Humphrey will allot &#8220;only one little pane of glass in thy attractive shop-front ... for the
					display of CORINTHIAN TOM, ...&#160;he may be viewed quite &#8216;at home&#8217; in St. James&#8217;s Street&#8221; (8). As these
					invocations should suggest, these are the most fashionable purveyors of print in the metropolis and, I think tellingly,
					they&#8217;re all located in the neighborhood in which Tom, Jerry, and Logic reside. Obviously this need not mean that all of the
					early readers of <title level="m">Life in London</title> either patronized those shops or lived in that neighborhood, but it seems
					probable that if they didn&#8217;t, they thought themselves in the minority (i.e., they presumed that most of the other
						&#8220;<emph>fire-side</emph> heroes and sprightly maidens&#8221; being addressed were one and the same with the
					&#8220;dashing belles and beaux&#8221; who lounged into Colburn&#8217;s).</p>
				<p>Why should this sort of speculative sociology of readers matter? <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_13.jpg">Compare the locations

					</figure> If I&#8217;m correct in my presumptions, then most of the early readers were living and lounging on the other side of
					Regent Street from the majority of the promised narrativity. Moreover, the intensity of that felt separation from the anticipated
					&#8220;rambles and sprees&#8221; would have been magnified, perhaps exponentially, by the seriality of part publication. As <name
						ref="#ArnoldThomas" type="person">Thomas Arnold</name> would note twenty years later, &#8220;works of amusement ... published
					periodically&#8221; &#8220;occupy the mind&#8221; longer than works published all at once and so &#8220;keep alive&#8221; a
					&#8220;constant ...&#160;expectation,&#8221; &#8220;thus dwelling upon the mind, and distilling themselves into it as it were drop
					by drop&#8221; until they &#8220;possess it so largely, colouring even, in many instances, its very language, and affording
					frequent matter for discussion&#8221; (39). It doesn&#8217;t take anywhere close to a month to read a thirty-two-page octavo
					pamphlet and its printed wrapper, nor to look at three plates. Yet the readers whose demand took <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> to the tipping point had to wait at least that long to get the next part and if they were drawn in by any of
					the promised narrativity, their wait could be considerably longer before that promise was fulfilled. As my maps should suggest,
					the sprees depicted in the plates of the double installment of October 1820 did not begin to be narrated until at least January
					1821 and in most cases, February or March or even, in the case of &#8220;Tom Getting the Best of a Charley,&#8221; April of that
					year. In the meantime, readers had to go about their own lives in <name ref="#LondonUK" type="place">London</name>, either musing
					on the adequacy of <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>&#8217;s account of the &#8220;rambles and sprees&#8221; which
					lay on the other side of Regent Street or else setting out on their own such adventures&#8212;which might or might not accord with
					the account <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> eventually provides. Either way, though, the effect would be a
					complex entanglement of <title level="m">Life in London</title> with life in London such that the aesthetics of &#8220;seeing
					Life&#8221; and the questions of representational adequacy which they pose would almost have to have become phenomenologically
					central to those readers&#8217; lives. Like the realisms described by <name ref="#MillerDA" type="person">D. A. Miller</name>,
					although presumably without quite the same disciplinary force, this interpenetration would &#8220;ensure that the novel is always
					centrally about the world to which one will be recalled and that the world to which one will be recalled has been reduced to
					attesting the truth (or falsehood) of the novel&#8221; (83). Hence, it&#8217;s not so much that &#8220;the sprawling, rambling
					form of <title level="m">Life in London</title> ... reproduc[es] the form of the city itself&#8221; (<name ref="#SalesRoger"
						type="person">Sales</name> 156) as that the form of <title level="m">Life in London</title> solicits and shapes a particular
					way of &#8220;seeing Life&#8221; which then becomes wholly intertwined with the &#8220;Life&#8221; to be seen, both in the text
					and plates to come and in the city itself.</p>
				<p>Thus far I&#8217;ve been dwelling upon the very beginnings of the craze for <title level="m">Life in London</title>, what took the
					phenomenon to the tipping point of an unprecedented second edition and price increase while the initial serialization was still
					underway. But most of the mania postdates this second edition: the assorted reprints of <title level="m">Life in London</title> as
					a stand-alone volume, the various theatrical versions, the Catnach broadsides and other opportunistic redactions, the consumer
					goods ... these are all part of later 1821 or 1822 or 1823. Why spend so much time on the readers of these early parts, whose
					total numbers must have been dwarfed by those who got swept up in the craze after early January 1821? The answer, I&#8217;d like
					to propose, is that the rest of the phenomenon largely plays out according to the parameters set by these first few parts and
					their early adopters. This is not to say that nothing changes, of course, but the subsequent parts of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> itself, the theatrical versions, and all of the other evidence that I&#8217;ve been able to uncover all suggest
					that they were working within the same aesthetics of &#8220;seeing Life&#8221; and the same questions of representational adequacy
					that we&#8217;ve been reconstructing. <note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">I&#8217;m struck by the similarity between how this
						craze unfolded and the ways in which &#8220;the prior path of collective claim-making&#8221; by ordinary Britons in this
						period &#8220;constrains its subsequent forms, influencing the very issues, actors, settings, and outcomes of popular
						struggle.... each shared effort to press claims lays down a settlement among parties to the transaction, a memory of the
						interaction, new information about the likely outcomes of different sorts of interactions, and a changed web of relations
						within and among the participating sets of people&#8221; (<name ref="#TillyCharles" type="person">Tilly</name> 37). I
						certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to claim that Tom and Jerry are &#8220;political&#8221; in any easy or obvious way, but I
						can&#8217;t help wondering if <name ref="#TillyCharles" type="person">Tilly</name>&#8217;s notion of &#8220;repertoires of
						collective action&#8221; (42) might help illuminate phenomena well beyond the realm of &#8220;popular
						contention.&#8221;</note></p>
				<p>Consider, for example, the ways in which <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> and the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert"
						type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name> continued to solicit readerly curiosity as to the adequacy of their
					representations. We are repeatedly told, in the parts published after the tipping point, that we can place our trust in the
					reliability of their depictions: the scene at Jackson&#8217;s Rooms &#8220;is most accurately represented&#8221; (216), and so can
					serve as as much of a surrogate for the rooms themselves as the scene at Cribb&#8217;s Parlour, even though Jackson&#8217;s
					&#8220;is not common to the public eye....&#160;no person can be admitted without an introduction&#8221; (217), while
					Cribb&#8217;s &#8220;can be seen at all times, and, therefore ... may be <emph>identified</emph> when any person thinks
					proper&#8221; (220). Yet we are also told that scenes like that of the ginshop near Covent Garden &#8220;may be nightly witnessed
					after the SPELL is dissolved: but in much more depraved colours than is here represented&#8221; (180) and that &#8220;neither the
					PEN nor the PENCIL, however directed by talent, can do ... adequate justice&#8221; to &#8220;the Morning of Execution&#8221; at
					Newgate &#8220;or convey a description of the &#8216;<emph>harrowed feelings</emph>&#8217; of the few spectators that are admitted
					into the Condemned Yard upon such an occasion&#8221; (280-81). And even when the promised narrativity finally began to arrive,
					more often than not it was a bit coy and still inclined to toy with the temporality of serial reading. So, for example, in the
					long-anticipated account of &#8220;Tom Getting the best of a Charley&#8221; (see again <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_1.jpg"
						>figure one</ref>) we are explicitly told that the women on Jerry&#8217;s arms were, as most readers probably already
					suspected, &#8220;a couple of Cyprians&#8221; (232) who, after the prank, and &#8220;in the most <emph>tender</emph> and
					persuasive manner, ... endeavoured to <emph>gammon</emph> JERRY and the CORINTHIAN up <emph>Shire-Lane</emph> to a place of
						<emph>safety</emph>, as they termed it&#8221; (233). Tom declined the invitation to their house, but we are pointedly not
					informed whether they made alternate arrangements: &#8220;it is quite immaterial how our heroes eluded the pursuit of the
						<emph>Charleys</emph>, or in what manner they spent the remainder of the night; they were out on a

					</figure> Similarly, in the scene at All-Max (an East End dive whose nickname puns on &#8220;max,&#8221; a slang term for gin, and
					&#8220;Almack&#8217;s,&#8221; the exclusive West End assembly rooms) (see <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_14.jpg" rend="_blank">figure
						14</ref>), the text for Part Nine concludes before we can learn what will come of Logic&#8217;s dalliance with the local
					women. Inquiring minds had either to wait a month to discover what Logic was doing in &#8220;the &#8216;<emph>Fields of
						Temptation</emph>,&#8217; by which he was surrounded&#8221; (289)&#8212;and even then he coyly avoids the questioning of his
					friends as to specifics&#8212;or else they had to set out for Wapping in the hope of a reenactment. The reverse situation obtains
					in Part Eleven when our heroes visit Vauxhall where, Logic tells Jerry, &#8220;if <emph>enjoyment</emph> is your
						<emph>motto</emph>, you may make the most of an evening ... more than at any other place in the Metropolis&#8221; (335). Yet
					after the trio has listened to music, admired the paintings, had a bite to eat, &#8220;join[ed] the merry dance,&#8221; and
					watched Logic knock down a dandy with a single blow, Bob &#8220;<emph>reeled</emph> off&#8221; and &#8220;as upon former
					occasions, was not to be found&#8221; (338), though Tom suspected that he had &#8220;los[t]&#8221; his &#8220;way in the
						<emph>dark walks</emph>&#8221; frequented by prostitutes (339). None of this, however, was represented in any of the plates in
					that part. Would-be viewers of the scene had wait for the final installment (two weeks later) (<ref
						target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_15.jpg" rend="_blank">figure 15</ref>) or else see whether their own attempts to &#8220;enjoy ... themselves
					to the utmost extent in all the variety&#8221; the Gardens &#8220;afforded&#8221; (338) could shed sufficient light on the
					Oxonian&#8217;s fate.</p>
				<p>The one significant departure of the post-tipping point parts and, of course, of the subsequent single-volume editions which

						type="person">Leah Price</name>&#8212;is the way in which they build in Jerry as a sort of proxy for the readers and viewers
					of <title level="m">Life in London</title>. Like them, Jerry is learning to &#8220;see Life&#8221; under the tutelage of Tom and
					Logic and so his progress is implicitly positioned as somehow parallel to their own. As &#8220;he bid fair ... to become as

				<p>While as a book <title level="m">Life in London</title> was enough of a sensation for its publishers to have allegedly
					&#8220;netted some thousands by it&#8221; by 11 March 1822, what turned the phenomenon all the way up to eleven and helped ensure
					its place in the collective memory of <name ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace" type="person">Thackeray</name>&#8217;s generation
					were the assorted theatrical versions, the most successful of which&#8212;<name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">W. T.
						Moncrieff</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Tom and Jerry</title>&#8212;supposedly earned &#8220;the proprietors of the Adelphi
					theatre,&#8221; where it was staged, twelve thousand pounds by that same point in the spring of 1822 (&#8220;London
					Chit-Chat&#8221; 333, 334). Indeed, <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name> later estimated that they
					&#8220;cleared&#8221; &#8220;not ... less, from first to last, than <emph>Twenty five Thousand Pounds</emph> by it&#8221; (<name
						ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name> 1828, vii). <note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">A rather disapproving
							<name ref="#CarlyleThomas" type="person">Thomas Carlyle</name> noted the previous year that &#8220;<emph>no</emph> play
						had ever enjoyed such currency on the English Stage as this most classic performance&#8221; (314).</note>Like the post-tipping
					point parts of <title level="m">Life in London</title>, the various plays are all devoted to working out the aesthetics of
					&#8220;seeing Life&#8221; and its accompanying questions of representational adequacy. Accordingly, I&#8217;d like to suggest, the
					theatrical versions can help test and confirm the ways in which the forms we&#8217;re dealing with were &#8220;social&#8221; and
					so are of explanatory value when we&#8217;re trying to figure out what drove this craze. Before I sketch out the workings of the
					most prominent of these plays, however, it&#8217;s worth noting that they were all staged at the so-called
					&#8220;illegitimate&#8221; or minor theaters, the status and characteristics of which amplified a number of aspects of their form.
					First of all, for many playgoers, the illegitimate theaters were on the side of liberty and fun and modernity, against the
					perceived stodginess and perhaps worse of the patent theaters, which &#8220;had come to be identified as the cultural synecdoche
					of a corrupt political state&#8221; (<name ref="#MoodyJane" type="person">Moody</name> 74). Part of that reputation stemmed from
					the shameless, Polonius-like generic mixture of the plays which they staged (in order to get around the legal prohibition on the
					minor theaters offering &#8220;legitimate&#8221;&#8212;i.e., primarily spoken&#8212;drama, they would add all sorts of spectacle
					and music to their productions). As evidence of just how far these mixtures could go, consider only the playbills for three of the
					most popular theatrical versions of <title level="m">Life in London</title>: at Davis&#8217;s Royal Amphitheatre, one could take
					in &#8220;an entirely New, Whimsical, Local, Melo-Dramatic, Pantomimical Equestrian Drama,&#8221; while Sadler&#8217;s Wells
					offered a &#8220;New Pedestrian, Equestrian, and Operatic Extravaganza ... of Gaiety, Frisk, Lark, and Patter&#8221; and <name
						ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name>&#8217;s version at the Adelphi was billed as &#8220;an entirely new Classic,
					Comic, Operatic, Didactic, Aristophanic, Localic, Analytic, Panoramic, Camera-Obscura-ic, Extravaganza Burletta of Fun, Frolic,
					Fashion, and Flash ... Replete with prime Chaunts, rum Glees, and Kiddy Catches&#8221; (qtd. in <name ref="#HindleyCharles"
						type="person">Hindley</name> 4, 85, 8). Another part of the reputation of the minor theaters derived from the sheer
					&#8220;visual magnificence&#8221; (<name ref="#MoodyJane" type="person">Moody</name> 151) of the playhouses themselves, which was
					often at odds with their somewhat dodgy or unfashionable locations. <figure n="18">

					</figure> Compare, for example, where the various versions of <title level="m">Life in London</title> were staged with where the
					action of the Cruikshank plates was located. (see <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_18.jpg" rend="_blank"> figure 18</ref> and <ref
						target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_19.jpg" rend="_blank"> figure 19</ref>) Close to half of the scenes depicted in <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> (many of which transferred over to the plays) were set in the West End, while nothing other than our
					heroes&#8217; outing to Vauxhall involved crossing the Thames. Yet three of the theaters were on the south side of the river and
					another three were out on the north edge of town (far beyond anywhere Tom and Jerry bother to go). Only the Olympic, the Adelphi,
					and (as a somewhat special case) the East London were actually in the same neighborhoods as the &#8220;rambles and sprees&#8221;
					they were representing. Yet all of their buildings were every bit as opulent, if not more, than the patent theaters of Covent
					Garden and Drury Lane where Tom and Jerry were shown consorting with prostitutes and actresses showing their legs. Collectively,
					I&#8217;d like to suggest, these different aspects of the &#8220;illegitimate&#8221; theaters&#8217; reputation helped to further
					crank up the aesthetics of &#8220;seeing Life&#8221; by linking that pursuit to the pleasurable disjunctions of minor theatergoing
					more generally. That is, the questions of representational adequacy which the plays took up from <name ref="#EganPierce"
						type="person">Egan</name> and the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert" type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name> became, if anything, all the more pointed when posed in a setting
					so clearly devoted to (and renowned for) dramatizing the mimetic gap between life on stage&#8212;where people burst into song,
					cross-dressed, and rode horses indoors&#8212;and the more quotidian existence outside the theater, with the pleasure-seeking
					audience in an opulent and liminal space between the two.</p>
				<p>The first of the theatrical versions of <title level="m">Life in London</title> nicely exemplifies the uses to which this gap could
					be put. On 17 September 1821, <name ref="#BarrymoreWilliam" type="person">William Barrymore</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Tom
						and Jerry, or, Life in London</title> debuted at Davis&#8217;s Royal Amphitheatre (better known to most theater historians as
					Astley&#8217;s) and was their chief offering for at least the next three seasons. As its subtitle suggests, this play took the
					&#8220;popular Production, which has lately engrossed the attention of all London&#8221; and turned it into &#8220;an entirely new
					Whimsical, Local, Melo-Dramatic, Pantomimical Equestrian Drama.&#8221; There&#8217;s nothing all that surprising about such a
					transformation: equestrian shows were the specialty of the house and so audiences were treated to a &#8220;scene of <emph>Epsom
						Races</emph>&#8221; which &#8220;exhibits post-chaises, gigs, tilburys, caravans, hackney-coaches, carts, and four-in-hand
					barouches, all drawn by real horses ... concluding with a grand race between seven &#8216;<emph>Bits of Blood!</emph>&#8217; on
					extensive platforms taking the whole width&#8221; of the theater (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 360). <note n="20"
						place="foot" resp="editors">A playbill for the 21 May 1822 performance trumpeted that the show would include &#8220;the whole

						figure twenty</ref>. More tellingly for our purposes, however, the usual sporting or martial or orientalist fare for which
					Davis&#8217;s was known here gets offset by some decidedly metropolitan scenes. For example, there&#8217;s what the reviewer just
					quoted describes as &#8220;the <emph>exterior of the Opera House</emph>, with all the horrors of a rainy night,&#8221; which
					involves Kate and Sue being cheated by one hackney cab driver as they depart for Almack&#8217;s and Tom, Jerry, and Logic playing
					a prank on another (they get in, tell him where they&#8217;re going, and get out the other door), as rain begins to fall on stage.
					Similarly, the scenes in Jackson&#8217;s Rooms and Cribb&#8217;s Parlour not only had &#8220;the <emph>Clown</emph> prove
					...&#160;himself a &#8216;<emph>hard hitter</emph>,&#8217; by sending <emph>Harlequin</emph> clean through the wainscot,&#8221;
					but also offered live performances by &#8220;Cribb and Spring,&#8221; &#8220;stripped half naked, boxing each other round the
					platform&#8221; to the supposed offense of &#8220;female modesty&#8221; (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 4: 306). Such
					spectacles were, of course, readily witnessed in the metropolis, as were &#8220;views of <emph>Tattersal&#8217;s</emph>... and
					Temple Bar, by moonlight&#8221; (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 1: 306). But they were witnessed across the river in rather
					different parts of town and, for the most part, not by the &#8220;genteel people, with their children and servants&#8221; who
					&#8220;had long ... frequented&#8221; this theater (<name ref="#MoodyJane" type="person">Moody</name> 171). <note n="21"
						place="foot" resp="editors">A reviewer for <title level="j">The Drama</title> refers to an analogous production at the Royal

					</figure> Literally, then, there was a significant spatial divide between the space of seeing and the space of the seen (see <ref
						target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_21.jpg" rend="_blank"> figure 21</ref>). Audience members were the Westminster or Waterloo bridge away from
					any of the action being represented. Yet that divide was repeatedly and spectacularly &#8220;bridged&#8221; by the sight of these
					different parts of London right there on stage in all their equestrian or pugilistic or simply drenched glory. The result,
					I&#8217;d like to suggest, was a highlighting of the same sort of simultaneous adequacy and inadequacy of representation that
					we&#8217;ve been tracing in <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> and the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert" type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name>. On one hand, what&#8217;s on stage is clearly not
					&#8220;Life&#8221; of the sort one is supposed to be seeing: the &#8220;street row&#8221; Tom and Jerry get into after boxing a
					charley poses absolutely no danger to any of the spectators. Yet on the other hand, there are actual coaches on stage, a
					&#8220;half naked&#8221; Cribb is boxing around, and the handsomely dressed dancers in the scene at Almack&#8217;s do a quadrille,
					lancers, and &#8220;2 Cast Figures&#8221; (28). How much closer to &#8220;Life&#8221; can one get? And once again this doubleness
					is encapsulated in the talismanic phrase of the title: when at the close Logic sings &#8220;then masquerade it now away, we
					ne&#8217;er shall wish the fun done, / That is, should you be pleased to say, you like our Life in London&#8221; (40), does that
					refer simply to what the audience has just witnessed or more broadly to what the play supposedly stands in for? Either way, it was
					enough to induce &#8220;Mr. Astley to keep his theatre open near a fortnight later than his usual period of closing&#8221; and to
					yield three hundred eighty pounds for <name ref="#BarrymoreWilliam" type="person">Barrymore</name> at his first benefit
					(&#8220;thirty pounds more than upon any previous occasion&#8221;), but I suspect that that success stemmed in no small part from
					how &#8220;that <emph>reality</emph> which ... attach[es] itself to the scenes and incidents&#8221; came off as delightfully
					partial: both mimetic and quite ostentatiously in violation of mimesis. <note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">
						<title level="j">The Drama</title> 1: 306; Egan, <title level="j">Pierce Egan&#8217;s Finish</title> 13n; <title level="j">The
							Drama</title> 2: 361.</note></p>
				<p>A rather different configuration of these same elements seems to have driven the next theatrical version to be offered: <name
						ref="#DibdinCharles" type="person">Charles Dibdin</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Life in London; or, the Larks of Logic, Tom,
						and Jerry, An Extravaganza ... Founded on <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Pierce Egan</name>&#8217;s Highly Popular
						Work</title>, which opened at the Olympic Theatre on 12 November 1821 and ran one hundred ninety-one nights. Here, rather than
					keeping a clear, if bridgeable distance between the theater and the putative location of the action on stage, the play repeatedly
					threatens to collapse the two. This is particularly evident in a scene set in an unspecified, but Olympic-like theater in which
					Tom and Jerry check out a &#8220;pretty girl&#8221; so &#8220;new&#8221; that even Tom doesn&#8217;t &#8220;know her&#8221; and
					then briefly debate the ethics of &#8220;intrud[ing] upon the Engagement of another gentleman&#8221; (i.e., soliciting a
					prostitute already with a client). <note n="23" place="foot" resp="editors">Most of these lines do not appear in the published
						version of the play, but were in the manuscript submitted to the Licenser and so were mostly likely part of the staged version
						(Larpent ms 2257, qtd. in Bratton 162).</note>The girl&#8217;s accomplices then pick a fight with our heroes and Jerry plunges
					in: &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a row! I must be in that, because it&#8217;s Life in London&#8221; (11). As we know from the plate of
					&#8220;Tom &amp; Jerry in the Saloon at Covent Garden&#8221; (see again <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_4.jpg" rend="_blank">figure
					4</ref>), prostitutes routinely worked the lobbies and boxes of the theaters, and pickpockets and conmen would regularly instigate
					&#8220;rows&#8221; in order to gain an advantage over their marks. So it might seem as if <name ref="#DibdinCharles" type="person"
						>Dibdin</name>&#8217;s play is operating uncomfortably close to home, putting on stage what was probably already being more
					casually performed in and around the theater. <figure n="22">
						<graphic url="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_22Thumb.jpg" width="750px"/>
						<figDesc/>
					</figure> And the rest of the geography of the play could support such an impression: the majority of the action and all of the
					&#8220;larks&#8221; are set within a five minute walk of the theater, in and around Temple Bar (see <ref
						target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_22.jpg" rend="_blank"> figure 22</ref>). One can easily imagine that there were some post-theater attempts
					to steal a charley&#8217;s box or to crash a cockney party (as Tom, Jerry, and Logic do). But as with our other texts, that
					implicit invitation to compare the &#8220;Life&#8221; on stage with that surrounding it is counterbalanced by various moments
					which call attention to the patent theatricality (and so presumed difference) of what the actors were doing. Hence the brawl in
					the lobby turns into a song whose chorus is &#8220;sure never row was so monstrously uproarious, / This is Life in London, how
					d&#8217;ye like the go?&#8221; (13). Similarly, the chorus of the finale asks the audience &#8220;your plaudits of patronage
					kindly then give, / And let Life in London, in London, long live; / For features of fancy howe&#8217;er we pursue, / No
					fancy&#8217;s true fancy not fancied by you&#8221; (40). As with <name ref="#BarrymoreWilliam" type="person"
					>Barrymore</name>&#8217;s version, this begs the question of what it would mean to &#8220;let Life in London, in London, long
					live.&#8221; Simply return frequently to the Olympic for more of this &#8220;<emph>extravaganza of fun, frolic, and
					whim</emph>&#8221; (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 51)? Routinely engage in actual rows? And what would happen if a
					real-life counterpart to Jerry presumed that a member of &#8220;the fancy&#8221; wasn&#8217;t &#8220;true fancy&#8221; since he
					didn&#8217;t accord with his own &#8220;fancy&#8221;? Would he be able to conclude with the stage Jerry that &#8220;Life in
					London&#8217;s nothing without adventures&#8221; (29)? Again, either way, the play clearly worked and was &#8220;repeated every
					evening to overflowing audiences of the most fashionable description&#8221; (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 206), despite,
					or perhaps because of, what <name ref="#MoodyJane" type="person">Jane Moody</name> terms the theater&#8217;s rather
					&#8220;insalubrious location&#8221; (31)&#8212;remember only the midnight scene at a nearby coffee shop (see again <ref
						target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_12Thumb.jpg" rend="_blank"> figure 12</ref>). <note n="24" place="foot" resp="editors">Ironically, <name
							ref="#DibdinCharles" type="person">Dibdin</name>&#8217;s play was the only theatrical version of <title level="m">Life in

				<p>The third theatrical version to be staged, that by <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name>, which debuted at the

					</figure> Rather than opening up or dramatically collapsing the gap between the space of the seer and the seen (as <name
						ref="#BarrymoreWilliam" type="person">Barrymore</name> and <name ref="#DibdinCharles" type="person">Dibdin</name> had done),
						<name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name> largely replicated the spatial distribution of <name ref="#EganPierce"

					again) There were fewer sites, of course, because of time constraints and the demands of staging, but with two intriguing
					exceptions, <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name>&#8217;s version offers the same basic array of activities in
					most of the same places (although for some reason he relocates Kate and Sue&#8217;s visit to a fortuneteller from St. Giles to St.
					George&#8217;s Fields). The two exceptions, though, are extremely revealing. First, <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person"
						>Moncrieff</name> omits the spaces associated with prostitution by <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> and the
						<name ref="#CruikshankRobert" type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name>: Kate&#8217;s apartment and the theaters. Secondly, he cuts out or
					relocates all the opportunities for sprees and their consequences near Covent Garden (the coffee and gin shops and Bow Street
					simply disappear; the watchhouse gets moved east of Temple Bar), so that such activities now take place in distinctly different
					neighborhoods than that of the theater. One could try to account for these cuts by suggesting that they&#8217;re an attempt to
					raise the moral tone of <title level="m">Life in London</title> or to provide a <foreign xml:lang="fr">cordon sanitaire</foreign>
					between the space of viewing and the viewed. But then it would be rather difficult to explain why <name ref="#MoncrieffWT"
						type="person">Moncrieff</name> invents a plot in which Kate and Sue (who are no longer cyprians, but simply the sweethearts of
					Tom and Jerry) follow their loves all over London, posing as dancers at Almack&#8217;s, gamblers in a &#8220;fashionable
					hell,&#8221; beggars in the Holy Land of St. Giles, and perhaps most discordantly of all, if the aim was to clean up <title
						level="m">Life in London</title>, &#8220;two young bucks&#8221; who accost the wife of a cit and kiss her&#8212;lest anyone
					miss the point, Logic leeringly observes a minute or two later how &#8220;very well&#8221; the object of their affection
					&#8220;must look in&#8221; breeches like the ones being worn by Kate and Sue ( <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person"
						>Moncrieff</name> 1828, 37, 43). Similarly, any theory along the <foreign xml:lang="fr">cordon sanitaire</foreign> lines would
					rapidly run afoul of what was apparently one of the real attractions of the Adelphi&#8217;s production: namely, its portrayal of
					actual street celebrities like Andrew &#8220;Little Jemmy&#8221; Whiston, a paraplegic beggar who propelled himself about in a
					little cart, or Billy Waters, the one-legged African fiddler and &#8220;King of the Beggars.&#8221; What sense would it make to
					bring such figures on stage if the aim was to keep the &#8220;low&#8221; at bay?</p>
				<p>
					<name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name>&#8217;s cuts become significantly more comprehensible, though, if we
					consider them in conjunction with the very <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>-like claims of the Adelphi&#8217;s
					early advertising. According to one playbill, this was &#8220;an animated picture of every species of Life in London, deprived,
					through the filtering stone of the Proprietor&#8217;s critical care, of all that might disgust or offend even the most fastidious
					Imagination.&#8221; Yet less than twelve weeks later, the play was being offered as &#8220;a series of pungent and minutely
					accurate Representations of HIGH and LOW LIFE.&#8221; <note n="25" place="foot" resp="editors">Playbills for 6 December 1821 and
						25 February 1822 (qtd. in Bratton 163).</note>Similarly, the whole piece was a ballad opera, with new words to familiar tunes
					and so was likely to conjure up a quite complicated array of memories of previous theatergoing (to <title level="m">The
						Beggar&#8217;s Opera</title>, to <title level="m">The Benevolent Tar</title>, to <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>), even
					as it featured &#8220;Twenty New Scenes, Painted from Drawings taken on the spot&#8221; and &#8220;the Publishers of the various
					Maps and Guides through London&#8221; were rather cheekily, if &#8220;respectfully informed, that this Piece does not supersede
					the Necessity of their various Publications&#8221; as they &#8220;may still be useful in refreshing the Memory of the Spectators,
					after the Conclusion of the Adelphi season&#8221; (<name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name>, <title level="m"
						>Songs</title> tp, v). <note n="26" place="foot" resp="editors">For a discussion of the interplay between the new and old
						words and the music, see Shepherd 181-87.</note>So, it would seem that, as with <title level="m">Life in London</title>
					itself, <title level="m">Tom and Jerry</title> is somehow both filtered and minutely accurate, representationally inadequate and
					yet up to the task. Unlike <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> and the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert" type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name>&#8217; version, however, <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person"
						>Moncrieff</name>&#8217;s play drew a quite socially&#8212;and therefore geographically&#8212;varied audience: dukes and
					dustmen, peers and apprentices, the first member of the royal family ever to visit a minor theater (Frederick, Duke of York) and
					&#8220;the people&#8221; whose &#8220;appearance&#8221; made <name ref="#ArbuthnotHarriet" type="person">Harriet Arbuthnot</name>
					turn up her nose. Indeed, in the closing address to the 1821-22 season, the actor who played Tom called explicit attention to the
					&#8220;overflowing audiences&#8221; the Adelphi had attracted, &#8220;comprising a galaxy of the brightest stars of the West, and
					a <emph>maximum</emph> of the primest natives of the East&#8221; (qtd. in <title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 311). What&#8217;s
					missing in all this socio-geographic language, of course, is the middle, both of the social order&#8212;there are apparently no
					counterparts in the audience to Jemmy Green, the cockney dandy of the play&#8212;and of the metropolis itself. This absence, I
					think, helps reveal the significance of <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name>&#8217;s geography. Put simply,
					Covent Garden has been emptied out (except for a few sporting destinations like Cribb&#8217;s Parlour, which gets replicated on
					stage with the exhibition of the champion&#8217;s &#8220;ORIGINAL CUP&#8221; [ <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person"
						>Moncrieff</name>, <title level="m">Songs</title> iv]) in order to make all these questions of representational adequacy
					depend upon the origins of the audience, rather than on the location of the theater. That is, by preserving <name
						ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> and the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert" type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name>&#8217; spatial distribution (except for the area around the
					Adelphi) and then soliciting, incredibly successfully, an audience from both West and East, <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person"
						>Moncrieff</name> was able to transfer the felt site of viewing from the playhouse in the Strand to wherever the individual
					audience members came from. Accordingly, &#8220;the scene of &#8216;All Max in the East,&#8217; is well worth seeing by any one
					who does not mind contemplating filth, and profligacy, and vagabond merriment. The man who performs &#8216;Dusty Bob&#8217; makes
					a wonderful fac-simile of a squalid &#8216;<emph>coster-monger</emph>,&#8217; a being made up of gin, rags, occasional starvation,
					and perpetual knavery&#8221; (&#8220;London Chit-Chat&#8221; 334)(see <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_24.jpg" rend="_blank"> figure

					</figure> Conversely, &#8220;the outline of fashionable life discovers more than is frequently known of London, by those who are
					its residents from the cradle to the tomb&#8221; (&#8220;Advertisement&#8221;). In each of these passages there&#8217;s a clear
					sense of what is known and what is unknown and so where the play&#8217;s representational adequacy can or cannot be easily
					confirmed. But, of course, the areas which are known are quite different: the writer for <title level="j"
						>Blackwood&#8217;s</title> seems to presume that filth and squalor are unusual sights for its readers, while the author of the
					&#8220;Advertisement&#8221; in the Albany edition of <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name> has apparently never
					set foot in Almack&#8217;s or Burlington Arcade. The different vantage points that these writers exemplify, however, were brought
					nightly into extremely close contact with one another: &#8220;upwards of one hundred nights&#8221; into the first season it was
					&#8220;yet an affair of peril to squeeze your way into the pit&#8221; (&#8220;London Chit-Chat&#8221; 333) and the theater was
					still &#8220;collect[ing] overflowing audiences&#8221; two seasons later (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 5: 247). Such
					unavoidable proximity seems like it would almost have to have produced a doubleness of perspective not wholly unlike that of <name
						ref="#ArbuthnotHarriet" type="person">Mrs. Arbuthnot</name>: something like &#8220;if I can assess the adequacy of this, but
					not that, and, judging by his appearance, he can assess the adequacy of that, but not this, and yet here we all are jammed
					together in &#8216;a very pretty theatre&#8217; whose surroundings constitute a common ground that is pointedly not being
					represented on stage, then perhaps the thing to do is simply to &#8216;attend&#8217; Tom and Jerry&#8217;s
						&#8216;<emph>larks</emph> and rambles,&#8217; to &#8216;witness [their] <emph>sprees</emph>, and encourage [their]
					endeavours&#8217; without worrying overmuch about &#8216;the <emph>fidelity</emph> of its representation of London
					manners&#8217;.&#8221; <note n="27" place="foot" resp="editors">Arbuthnot 144; <title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 311; an
						unidentified reviewer of 13 Oct. 1822, qtd. in Moody 156.</note>If so, then it makes sense that the most
					&#8220;laughable&#8221; scenes&#8212;&#8220;the night row at Temple-bar, and ... the meeting of all the celebrated beggars and
					ballad singers of the metropolis&#8221; (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 207)&#8212;were precisely those which most clearly
					raised the issue of adequacy, only to immediately suspend it: Temple Bar was close enough for all to verify, while the inner
					recesses of the Holy Land were inaccessible to almost everyone. <note n="28" place="foot" resp="editors">The same exact scenes
						were singled out by Henry Crabb Robinson as particularly "pleasant": "there is a capital row and fight among Watchmen&#8212;a
						meeting of beggars etc etc" (98).</note>Accordingly, one could either sit back and enjoy what the <title level="j"
						>Times</title> termed the play&#8217;s &#8220;ludicrous and tolerably faithful pictures&#8221; of &#8220;the characters and
					customs of the different classes of society&#8221; into &#8220;which the irregular habits&#8221; of Tom, Jerry, Logic, Kate, and
					Sue&#8217;s lives threw them or else one could set out on &#8220;nocturnal &#8216;sprees&#8217; &#8221; of one&#8217;s own and it
					seems telling that the most popular sort of spree&#8212;&#8220;<emph>milling the Charlies</emph>&#8221;&#8212;was precisely that
					which was least place-specific and so most equally available to all: there were charleys, and reports of pranks against them, all
					over town (<title level="a">London Chit-Chat</title> 334).</p>

					</figure> We could go on in this vein and think, for example, about why <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name>&#8217;s
					own theatrical version, initially staged at Sadler&#8217;s Wells on 8 April 1822 and then transferred to the Olympic for a hundred
					and ninety-one night run, should have stripped out so much of the Covent Garden slumming and West End blood sports, only to turn
					around and close with an apparently unmotivated pony race at the &#8220;pugilistic Waterloo&#8221; of Moulsey Hurst in the far
					western suburbs (see <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_25.jpg" rend="_blank"> figure 25</ref> and <ref
						target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_20.jpg" rend="_blank"> figure 20</ref> again). But I suspect my broader point has been made. Each of the
					plays offers a form through which its audiences could indulge in the representational uncertainties of &#8220;seeing Life,&#8221;
					but each does so differently, which no doubt fostered comparisons between the versions, particularly in the spring and summer of
					1822 when there were so many simultaneous productions underway. A writer for <title level="j">John Bull</title> imagines that the
					latter was simply a shrewd commercial move: &#8220;that which appears a silly opposition in producing the same piece at all these
					houses, will eventually turn out capitally; for now, instead of being contented with seeing one TOM and JERRY, the town will not
					be satisfied till they have seen them all; and as the last three months were spent in discussing the merits of the first, so the
					whole summer will be devoted to comparing notes, and qualifying for &#8216;Critic,&#8217; upon the new editions of this very
					extraordinary performance&#8221; (14 April 1822). But such comparison would almost have to have redoubled and thereby rendered all
					the more tantalizing and delicious all the various questions of representational adequacy that each play had pursued individually.
					This, I&#8217;d like to suggest, offers a rare glimpse into just how &#8220;profoundly social&#8221; form can be: it&#8217;s not
					only that the forms of individual texts are shaped by forces both beyond their bounds and beyond their control, but also that the
					significance of those individual forms largely emerges from their perceived relations with one another. <figure n="26">

					</figure> The pleasure one can take in, say, the Adelphi&#8217;s version of &#8220;seeing Life&#8221; is thus in no small part
					shaped by the pleasure one has taken&#8212;or hopes to take or has heard or imagined others have taken&#8212;in Davis&#8217;s
					version or the Olympic&#8217;s version or Sadler&#8217;s Wells&#8217; version or any of the other versions on offer, including, of
					course, that of <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> and the <name ref="#CruikshankRobert" type="person"/>
					<name ref="#CruikshankGeorge" type="person">Cruikshanks</name> or the dramatically downmarket redaction offered by Catnach (see
						<ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_26.jpg" rend="_blank"> figure 26</ref>). Moreover, one doesn't need to have actually seen or read those
					other versions in order for them to have shaped the felt significance of the text at hand; one simply needs to have known of their
					existence, and in a craze like that for <title level="m">Life in London</title>, it would have been hard to remain ignorant, when
					even the very ballad singers on the streets were reminding passers-by that &#8220;And since Life in London / Has been all the
					rage, / There&#8217;s nothing else now / That will do for the stage&#8221; (qtd. in <name ref="#HindleyCharles" type="person"
						>Hindley</name> 120).</p>
				<p>The question that this all begs, of course, is why should <title level="m">Life in London</title> have so taken off when it did,
					only to then become so retrospectively puzzling as <name ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace" type="person">Thackeray</name>&#8217;s
					generation moved into adulthood, given that most of its different components had long been and would continue to be available?
					Pugilism and other blood sports, &#8220;the city representing itself to itself&#8221; (<name ref="#DuringSimon" type="person"
						>During</name> 342), young men from the West End going into Covent Garden or beyond on nighttime &#8220;sprees&#8221; ...

					1820s, though, was the status and reputation of London itself. As <name ref="#ChandlerJames" type="person">James Chandler</name>
					has reminded us, the years leading up to and surrounding the mania for <title level="m">Life in London</title> operated according
					to a particularly &#8220;hot chronology,&#8221; their &#8220;peculiar eventfulness&#8221; making it seem as if things were
					changing almost day by day (3). In 1819 and the first half of 1820, both the metropolis and the nation more generally seemed
					poised on the brink of revolution: mass meetings of unprecedented size gathered in almost every town and sometimes, as at
					&#8220;Peterloo,&#8221; were met with savage violence on the part of the authorities; the Six Acts rendered the exercise of quite
					basic traditional rights treasonous; radicals in Cato Street plotted to assassinate the Cabinet and the Prime Minister; <name
						ref="#JerninghamFrancesDillon" type="person">Lady Jerningham</name> thought &#8220;the Queen&#8217;s bold return to
					England,&#8221; despite her husband&#8217;s open animosity, had moved the &#8220;country ...&#160;nearer disaster than it has been
					since the days of Charles I&#8221; (168), as crowds flooded the streets in open defiance of the soon to be crowned George IV. And
					yet by the time that the first few parts of <title level="m">Life in London</title> were appearing, that had all melted away:
					Caroline was acquitted in mid-November (or rather, the divorce case against her was abandoned) to widespread rejoicing, &#8220;the
					anger that had sustained ... radical action ...&#160;in the regency years virtually evaporated&#8221; (<name ref="#GatrellVic"
						type="person">Gatrell</name> 420), it was as if the end of the year belonged to a different &#8220;epoch&#8221; than its
					beginning. <note n="30" place="foot" resp="editors">In a speech that March, George Canning had asked, rhetorically, "whether any
						country, in any two epochs, however distant, of its history, ever presented such a contrast with itself as this country in

							London</title> was being serialized, the distance between 1819 and 1820 would have seemed even greater.</note>And this
					transformation was at its most dramatic in London itself. From the dangerous moment when &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of

					</figure> Perhaps the single best emblem of this change was the so-called &#8220;Looking Glass Curtain&#8221; which debuted at the

					suggest, this was a huge mirror (or rather, sixty-three mirrors set together in a giant frame), which &#8220;reflected every form
					and face in that gorgeous house, from the topmost seat in the galleries, to the lowest bench in the pit&#8221; (<name

					and possesses every thing from the acme of splendor to the ne plus ultra of grossiert&#233;&#8221; (<title level="a"
						>Advertisement</title>). Inevitably, however, such buoyant sentiments proved a bubble and &#8220;between 1825 and 1837 the

					</figure> Banks failed, building came to a halt, cholera arrived from the East, and perhaps most distressingly of all for the kind
					of &#8220;libidinal vitality&#8221; (<name ref="#DuringSimon" type="person">During</name> 344) that drove the mania for <title
						level="m">Life in London</title>, &#8220;low life&#8221; was recast as &#8220;a terrain of anxiety and didactic moralization:
					in short, it became less and less funny&#8221; (<name ref="#GatrellVic" type="person">Gatrell</name> 547). What one 1825 engraver
					protested as <title level="m">The Progress of Cant</title>, which features at its very center a funeral mute holding up a banner
					reading &#8220;No Life in London&#8221; (see <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_28.jpg" rend="_blank"> figure 28</ref>), rapidly became an
					unstemmable tide. Indeed, by the end of the decade, <name ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Egan</name> had himself turned against
					his creations, killing off Tom, Logic, and Corinthian Kate in his <title level="m">Finish</title>.</p>
				<p>&#8220;The Moment of Tom and Jerry,&#8221; I&#8217;d like to propose, was enabled by the peculiar &#8220;resonance&#8221; between
					the social forms we&#8217;ve been examining and this fleeting &#8220;epoch&#8221; of supreme self-regard among Londoners and their
					admirers. To borrow <name ref="#DimockWaiChee" type="person">Wai Chee Dimock</name>&#8217;s acoustic metaphor, the
					&#8220;signal&#8221; of these forms was amplified by the &#8220;noise&#8221; of the early 1820s and so became audible in ways that
					would not have been possible either before or since. The result was that as the status and reputation of London changed, so too
					did that of <title level="m">Life in London</title>. Tom and Jerry so encapsulated their moment that, once that moment had passed,
					they, like the Vauxhall which had provided them such &#8220;ample pleasures,&#8221; were left to constitute, at best, the puzzling
					memory of &#8220;a delightful perversion of the imagination&#8221; (<name ref="#ThackerayWilliam Makepeace" type="person"
