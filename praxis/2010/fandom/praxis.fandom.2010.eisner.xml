         	<p rend="noCount">Romantic-era audiences participated enthusiastically in what we would now recognize as fan practices and fan cultures. In his introduction to this volume, Eisner proposes an understanding of fandom as a culturally situated, qualitatively distinctive, and complexly mediated form of audience response, arguing that fandom rewards analysis as a historical phenomenon in its own right and not simply as a register of the celebrity of the objects of fan interest. Pointing out the ways in which the volume’s essays frame the topic of fandom as a provocation to methodological innovation, Eisner’s introduction locates the volume’s approach to fandom in relation to recent scholarship in Romantic studies and cultural studies, and in contradistinction to more traditional studies of reception. The introduction argues that the volume’s essays deepen our understanding of Romanticism’s publics as socially heterogeneous, inventive, and unpredictable, shaped by and shaping rapidly changing institutions of performance, publication, reading, spectatorship, leisure and consumption. By mapping the complicated social dynamics informing the activity of particular fans, the essays in this volume demonstrate both the diversity of Romantic fan practices and the historical particularity of the forms Romantic fandom takes. While these essays contest literary criticism’s often habitual abjection of the fan, Eisner emphasizes that they also resist conflating Romantic fandom with our own.</p>

					<p>Depending on your perspective, this volume&#8217;s title might appear either oxymoronic or simply redundant. If your
						Romanticism tends to be disdainful, even phobic, of popularity; if it is self-reflexive and critical, full of obstinate
						questioning of sense and outward things; if it is dedicated to reforming as well as experimenting on the public&#8217;s taste,
						then fandom might look to you like Romanticism&#8217;s very opposite: fandom after all marks the faddish and the popular; we
						often characterize it as embracing its objects with reckless abandon or unthinking absorption. If on the other hand your
						Romanticism involves primarily the overflow of powerful feeling, an exuberance recollected perhaps somewhat ashamedly in
						moments of tranquility, a going out of our own nature in search of an ideal other, you might ask what kind of fandom worth the
						name wouldn&#8217;t be deemed Romantic.</p>
					<p>While commentators in the early nineteenth century would not yet have spoken of &#8220;fans&#8221;&#8212;the term is an
						American coinage from later in the century&#8212;the period swirled with talk about crazes, manias, idols and
						idol-worshippers, enthusiasts, and devotees. The period also saw the popularization of recognizable &#8220;fan
						practices,&#8221; spurred by the growth of consumer culture and the development of a mass audience for culture generally.
						Admirers collected autographs, souvenirs, portraits and relics of celebrity writers, artists, performers, military heroes, and
						athletes; snapped up mementos associated with beloved plays or books or music; visited the homes and haunts of celebrities;
						pored over gossip-filled periodicals and newspaper notices; imitated celebrities&#8217; fashion statements; fantasized about
						becoming friends or lovers with celebrities; wrote fan mail and formed communities of like-minded aficionados. <note n="1"
							place="foot" resp="editors"> An entertaining and detailed survey of some of the practices defining this emerging fan
							culture can be found in <name ref="#AltickRichard" type="person">Altick</name> 112-45. On fandom and eighteenth- and
							nineteenth-century reading practices, see also previous work by the contributors to this volume, including <name

								level="a">Tainted Love,</title> and <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Nicola Watson</name>&#8217;s <title
								level="m">The Literary Tourist</title>. </note> Romantic-era celebrities, of course, not only encouraged but also
						frequently participated in such practices themselves: <name ref="#BraudyLeo" type="person">Leo Braudy</name> observes of <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, for example, that he was &#8220;a fan before he was a
						star&#8230;[a]ll sorts of fame intrigued him,&#8221; from the world-historical to the more local and ephemeral (407). <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> famously adorned his rooms with a portrait of his &#8220;little
						pagod&#8221; Napoleon, but also kept a &#8220;screen pasted with scraps of boxers and actresses&#8221; (<name

						qtd. in <name ref="#BraudyLeo" type="person">Braudy</name> 407).</p>
					<p>This volume does not propose a single definition of fandom, and it does not isolate a particular moment in time when modern
						fandom can be said to begin. In general terms, however, we might distinguish fandom from other forms of admiration or interest
						by foregrounding a few distinctive qualities. Fandom is, as <name ref="#FiskeJohn" type="person">John Fiske</name> puts it, an
						&#8220;intensely pleasurable, intensely signifying&#8221; form associated with mass-cultural structures and mass-mediated
						society, though it may not be restricted to mass-cultural or mass-mediated objects (30). Fandom is a participatory activity
						embedded in a series of more or less routinized practices or rituals (e.g., collecting, writing fan mail), and connected to
						more or less exhibitionistic forms of display. Fandom has powerful emotional and affective dimensions&#8212;it can involve
						love, passion, excitation, unbearable curiosity or longing, near-total absorption, as well as feelings of shame, anxiety or
						abjection&#8212;though again, degrees of fandom obviously vary and such passions come and go. Fandom is also powerfully linked
						to fantasy, and often to forms of transferential identification. Both its emotional component and its fantasy elements often
						make it central to constructions of identity, but fandom also gives rise to communities of like-minded fans, to a fan culture.
						Finally, fandom can be crucially productive or creative: most clearly in the genre of fan fiction or the playful readerly
						practice <name ref="#BrewerDavidA" type="person">David A. Brewer</name> has called the &#8220;imaginative expansion&#8221; of
						narratives or characters (<title level="m">Afterlife</title> 2), but also more generally in the invention of modes of
						engagement, expression and performance. <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
							<name ref="#FiskeJohn" type="person">John Fiske</name> observes that &#8220;all popular audiences engage in varying
							degrees of semiotic productivity, producing meanings and pleasures that pertain to their social situation out of the
							products of the culture industries. But fans often turn this semiotic productivity into some form of textual production
							that can circulate among&#8212;and thus help to define&#8212;the fan community. Fans create a fan culture with its own
							systems of production and distribution that forms&#8230;a &#8216;shadow cultural economy&#8217; that lies outside that of
							the cultural industries yet shares features with them which more normal popular culture lacks&#8221; (30). </note>
					</p>
					<p>When I contacted potential contributors to this volume, I suggested they consider some of the following questions: How does the
						concept of fandom help us think about the development of new kinds of publics, new formations of culture, and new ways of
						consuming culture in the Romantic period? What dynamics of class, gender, nation and sexuality emerge around the figure of the
						fan or specific forms of fandom in the Romantic period? How do Romantic writers themselves participate in such cultures of
						fandom? How do the material practices around fandom condition, reflect or support specific modes of reading or spectatorship
						associated with Romanticism? What can fan practices tell us about the development of new kinds of subjectivity or feeling in
						the period? How do we understand the fan&#8217;s desire, and how does that desire mirror, predict, or precede our own
						investments in Romantic-era texts and writers, as scholars, teachers, and 21st-century fans? Contributors were free to look at
						any of the possible topics projected by the phrase &#8220;Romantic Fandom&#8221;: Romantic-era fans; fans of the Romantics;
						fandom that is in some sense Romantic. Responding to these questions and possibilities, the four very diverse essays in this
						volume together show how taking fandom seriously might help reshape our understanding of Romantic-era audiences and
						Romantic-era forms. Conversely, these essays also demonstrate that attention to emerging practices of fandom in the Romantic
						period can open up valuable comparative perspectives on our own modes of admiration and response. <note n="3" place="foot"

					<p>Celebrity has become something of a hot topic within Romantic studies, with a wave of studies building on groundbreaking
						articles and books by <name ref="#ManningPeterJ" type="person">Peter Manning</name>, <name ref="#WolfsonSusan" type="person"
							>Susan Wolfson</name>, <name ref="#PascoeJudith" type="person">Judith Pascoe</name>, and <name ref="#SwannKaren"
							type="person">Karen Swann</name>, and including recent work by <name ref="#MoleThomas" type="person">Tom Mole</name>,
							<name ref="#McDayterGhislaine" type="person">Ghislaine McDayter</name>, <name ref="#HigginsDavid" type="person">David
							Higgins</name>, <name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Clara Tuite</name>, myself and many others. There have been, too, in
						recent years several excellent collections of essays examining the fan cultures built up around individual writers: <name
							ref="#WilsonFrances" type="person">Frances Wilson</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Byromania</title> and <name
							ref="#LynchDeidre" type="person">Deidre Lynch</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Janeites</title>, for example. This volume
						aims to continue the conversation this scholarship has begun, but asks what different questions or insights arise if we shift
						the emphasis from the celebrity to the fan. The essays in this volume use this shift in emphasis to open up alternative views
						of the history of reading, and they take up the problem of fandom as a methodological challenge that requires new thinking
						about how to recover and analyze varieties of audience response. That is, the focus here is not on the topics of traditional
						reception history: the development of reputation, the strategies by which texts are marketed or distributed, a legacy of
						changing judgments or expectations or interpretations. Nor is the focus on cults of a particular author as reflections or
						betrayals of the reception that author might imagine. Rather, these are essays about the sometimes very ordinary, often very
						quirky activities of fans, though they show, unavoidably, the complex interrelation and interaction&#8212;mutually influential
						but not mutually determining&#8212;between forms of response and the forms that inspire such response in the first place.
						These essays reveal Romanticism&#8217;s publics as highly complicated, heterogeneous, inventive and unpredictable.</p>
					<p>
						<name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Nicola Watson</name>&#8217;s essay makes clear both the diversity of modes of fandom
						in the period and how little these fan practices actually conform to some of our frequent assumptions about the period. <name
							ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name>&#8217;s topic is the practice of reading writers <foreign xml:lang="la"
							>in situ</foreign>&#8212;touring locations associated with writers or their characters and experiencing those scenes
						through the lens of one&#8217;s literary experience, often with book in hand. Her essay takes as a case study the cultural
						tourism of the socialite Lady Frances Shelley&#8212;a distant relative of the poet, &#8220;well-read yet unintellectual, and a
						crashing snob&#8221;&#8212;whose encounters with writers and the places they made famous are richly detailed in nearly half a
						century&#8217;s worth of letters and diaries. While we now typically see such tourism as a middle-brow if not mass-cultural
						phenomenon, <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name> explains by contrast how Lady Shelley&#8217;s fandom is in
						fact dogged by an &#8220;anxiety of readership&#8221; tied to her elite class position. Though it anticipates later throngs of
						tourists in the Lake District in the nineteenth century or to places like Stratford or Haworth today, Lady Shelley&#8217;s
						reading of landscapes and locales reflects an effort to &#8220;distinguish the elite tourist-reader from an otherwise
						worryingly large and undifferentiated mass readership&#8221; (<name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name>).</p>
					<p>The social distinctions <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name> turns up in her analysis of this particular
						reader&#8217;s fan practices have suggestive implications for our understanding of the relationships between readers and books
						more generally in the Romantic period and, indeed, in the present. <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name>
						uncovers a contest between two modes of literary fandom driving the cultural tourism she investigates: on the one hand, an
						&#8220;author-centered&#8221; mode &#8220;organized towards visiting, being, or envisioning the author;&#8221; on the other
						hand, a &#8220;fiction-centered&#8221; mode through which the tourist-reader uses a particular landscape to project himself or
						herself imaginatively into a narrative, or imaginatively to project the reality of fictional scenes. If the author-centered
						mode of fandom suggests the writer and reader are on equal footing, <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name>
						argues, the fiction-centered mode of fandom &#8220;connoted a propensity to confuse the real and the fictional, a dangerous
						and risible lack of sophistication which contemporary discourse typically associated with the new mass readership&#8221;
							(<name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name>). As <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name>
						observes, this is a distinction still active in the gap between visiting someplace like Austen&#8217;s Chawton or the Keats
						House and a theme park like Dickens&#8217; World. Yet I might add that these two modes of fandom, of course, draw on and feed
						back into types of fantasy and identification possibly present, and overlapping, in any given experience of losing oneself in
						a book. <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name>&#8217;s discussion ultimately, then, points us to the
						spillover&#8212;in both directions&#8212;between the way we experience imaginative worlds in reading and the cultural
						practices through which we seek to extend those experiences into reality.</p>
					<p>While all of the essays in this volume bring out fandom&#8217;s richly social and even communal dimensions, it&#8217;s also a
						paradox of fandom that the typicality of any given fan&#8217;s pleasures must lie in their idiosyncrasy. <name
							ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Clara Tuite</name>&#8217;s case history of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
							>Stendhal</name>&#8217;s momentous meeting with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> in 1816
						builds a strong argument both for the individuality of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>&#8217;s
						response to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> (it&#8217;s a quintessentially Stendhalian response)
						and for its representative status with regard to Byronic fandom in particular and modern mass-cultural fandom, perhaps modern
						masculinity, more generally. Floored when he realizes he&#8217;s sharing an opera box with the poet he idolizes, <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is at once thrilled and deeply embarrassed, but in <name
							ref="#TuiteClara">Tuite</name>&#8217;s account this is not just another story of enthrallment to <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s seductive figure. Indeed, part of what&#8217;s so
						intriguing about this exchange is the uneasy, competitive, and erotically charged triangular relationship that governs
						it&#8212; <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>/Napoleon/<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>&#8212;with both <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> engaged in an on-going and unstable process of identity-formation
						through the public performance of ambivalent identification with figures <emph>also</emph> engaged in such an on-going and
						unstable process of self-invention. As <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name> does also, <name
							ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Tuite</name> emphasizes that the fan acts in ways not always scripted or anticipated by
						the author, but here the fan&#8217;s independence takes on a more Barthesian quality. In <name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person"
							>Tuite</name>&#8217;s provocative argument, fandom &#8220;spectacularizes the transformative agency of the reader,
						producing new circuits of exchange that empower reading and reception, and endow them with new pleasures and sensations. Far
						from entailing an exclusively passive position&#8212;in docile thrall to the sovereignty of author and text&#8212;fandom can
						be seen to transform a traditional textual economy of active and passive, thereby enabling reception as a mode of delirious
						productivity&#8212;proliferating often disobedient and indiscreet disclosures&#8221; (<name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person"
							>Tuite</name>). But <name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Tuite</name> painstakingly shows as well how <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>&#8217;s emotion and its display are conditioned by and as the
						social ritual of a very specific time and place, the immediately post-Napoleonic moment of the encounter between these two
						recent exiles, one British and one French, at the opera in Italy.</p>
					<p>Crucial to <name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Tuite</name>&#8217;s analysis of the affective dimension of <name
							ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>&#8217;s fandom is the category of the &#8220;impulse,&#8221; on
						the edge point between &#8220;the desire to act and the act itself,&#8221; and ambiguously located between body and mind
							(<name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Tuite</name>). <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
						>Stendhal</name>&#8217;s experience of fandom as unwilled feeling chimes not only with accounts of present-day fandom but also
						with the language of other nineteenth-century accounts of fan feeling: <name ref="#BrowningElizabethBarrett" type="person"
							>Elizabeth Barrett Browning</name> would write in the 1840s of her own &#8220;impulses to lionizing,&#8221; for example
						(1:145). As <name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Tuite</name> suggests in linking <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
							type="person">Stendhal</name>&#8217;s &#8220;impulse&#8221; to the older literary-historical and philosophical category of
						the &#8220;sensation&#8221;&#8212;important in <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>&#8217;s thinking
						about love, memory and emotion&#8212; <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>&#8217;s fascination with
						his feeling on this occasion might be assimilated to the entire complex project through which Romantic writers work to
						refashion and revalue eighteenth-century understandings of the relation of emotion and knowledge, producing a new
						&#8220;history or science of feelings&#8221; (<name ref="#WordsworthWilliam" type="person">Wordsworth</name>, Note to <title
							level="a">The Thorn,</title>
						<title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> 289). (We might, for example, read <name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person"
						>Tuite</name>&#8217;s discussion of impulse and sensation in <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person"
						>Stendhal</name>&#8217;s fan feeling against <name ref="#JacksonNoel" type="person">Noel Jackson</name>&#8217;s recent work on
						sensation in British Romantic poetry: <name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Tuite</name> sees <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle"
							type="person">Stendhal</name> pushing sensation away from scientific knowledge while <name ref="#JacksonNoel"
							type="person">Jackson</name> sees the two as more closely allied in British Romantic thought [ <name ref="#JacksonNoel"
							type="person">Jackson</name> 1-2]). Tracing <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>&#8217;s shifting
						recollections and rewritings of the encounter with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> over the
						years, <name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Tuite</name> zeros in on what these rewritings tell us about &#8220;that most
						Stendhalian concern with the fraught interrelation between desire and memory&#8221;&#8212;a concern so central to Romantic
						writing generally. As I have suggested elsewhere, Romantic fandom turns out in this way to be surprisingly close to the
						dynamics of the Romantic lyric, with its focus on memory and memorialization and its attempted coordination between deeply
						personal and transpersonal feeling. Just as the Romantic lyric is supposed to provide a passage between an almost
						incommunicable meaning and public meaning, the fan&#8217;s response is felt at once as uniquely individual experience and as
						shared or social experience. Is it possible really to imagine oneself the lone fan of anything? Fandom is perhaps always
						something we think of as shared, or at least as something we want to share, even as our embarrassment about our fandom speaks
						not just to its excesses of feeling but to the way we take it as revealing deeply personal truth. It&#8217;s too much
						sharing.</p>

						<name ref="#SchoenfieldMark" type="person">Mark Schoenfield</name>&#8217;s engaging contribution to this volume, <title
							level="a">
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> in the <title level="j">Satirist</title>,</title> analyzes a
						much less adulatory&#8212;if perhaps no less obsessed&#8212;response to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
							>Byron</name>. <name ref="#SchoenfieldMark" type="person">Schoenfield</name> teases out the complex political and cultural
						rhetorics through which the journal refracts the figure of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> in
						its reviews, its social satire, and its verbal and visual parodies, starting with its 1807 review of <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Hours of Idleness</title>. Animating this
						interaction in large part is the personal animus between <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and the
							<title level="j">Satirist</title> writer Hewson Clarke, who was at Cambridge with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name> and for whom <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> represented not only
						a rival but the (frustrating) epitome of aristocratic privilege, a privilege Clarke and <title level="j">The Satirist</title>
						will target in attacks on what they brand Whiggish indolence. <name ref="#SchoenfieldMark" type="person">Schoenfield</name>
						demonstrates how even at this early stage in <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s career, the
							<title level="j">Satirist</title>&#8217;s attacks function to deflate, by redeploying, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s figuration of his own fame, reflecting back to the poet and his audience &#8220;the
						fragility of his public self.&#8221; In other words, despite being captivated by <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s figure, Clarke is hardly a fan of the poet, but both Clarke and Clarke&#8217;s <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> write with an anxious eye on the poet&#8217;s real or potential
						audience of devoted admirers, the &#8220;real&#8221; <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s
						claims to nonchalance or indifference notwithstanding. In <name ref="#SchoenfieldMark" type="person"
						>Schoenfield</name>&#8217;s nice summary, the journal thus influentially produces &#8220;a competing version of Byronic
						celebrity to that produced by <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>.&#8221;</p>
					<p>
						<name ref="#SchoenfieldMark" type="person">Schoenfield</name>&#8217;s essay is perhaps most exciting in the way it shows us
						the vexed interdependence of periodical writing and poetic production in the first decades of the nineteenth century, a
						mutually bound relationship whose antagonistic dynamic is captured by the reversibility of these hostilities: as <name
							ref="#SchoenfieldMark" type="person">Schoenfield</name> explains, &#8220;who binds whom is determined by an economy of
						cultural production.&#8221; The antagonism of satire in this way proves suggestively parallel to the mutually bound and
						sometimes very antagonistic relationship between fans and the objects of their interest. The close connection <name
							ref="#SchoenfieldMark" type="person">Schoenfield</name> examines between poetic production and periodical culture
						reflects, of course, the position of each within a rapidly developing literary marketplace, but also, especially in <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s case, the way a kind of seriality was emerging in the
						publication of poetry (even before the Oriental Tales) that lent itself to sustained engagement with and by the seriality of
						magazine publication. If periodicals like <title level="j">The Satirist</title> require a <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name> as an organizing figure for their own reading of culture, we&#8217;re also coming more and more
						to see how powerful a role the periodicals played not just in the reception of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name> but in shaping the poet&#8217;s self-representation.</p>
					<p>While <name ref="#SchoenfieldMark" type="person">Schoenfield</name>, <name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Tuite</name> and
							<name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name> each describe how particular individuals responded to famous
						writers and their works, <name ref="#BrewerDavidA" type="person">Brewer</name>&#8217;s essay on the craze for <name
							ref="#EganPierce" type="person">Pierce Egan</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Life in London</title> asks a somewhat
						different question about fandom: how to account for the &#8220;phenomenon&#8221; of a book like <title level="m">Life in
							London</title>? As <name ref="#BrewerDavidA" type="person">Brewer</name> recounts, it&#8217;s not just that the book
						itself sparked a craze, but that it gave rise to so many also wildly popular imitations, theatrical adaptations and spin-offs,
						and even cross-merchandising (clothiers pushed Tom and Jerry fashions, for example). Histories of reading and reception have a
						tough time making convincing sense of such reader response: the mania inspired by <title level="m">Life in London</title> may
						stand as a particularly inexplicable instance, but, as <name ref="#BrewerDavidA" type="person">Brewer</name> points out, we
						still need to develop critical languages or frameworks through which we might approach this kind of fandom productively. <name
							ref="#BrewerDavidA" type="person">Brewer</name>&#8217;s brilliant solution is radically to shift the scale of analysis:
						rather than situate the response to <title level="m">Life in London</title> within ideological or cultural patterns mapped
						through broad swaths of literary or social history, or even the more limited &#8220;Regency culture,&#8221; <name
							ref="#BrewerDavidA" type="person">Brewer</name>&#8217;s analysis goes micro. Building on Franco Morretti&#8217;s <title
							level="m">Graphs, Maps, Trees</title>, <name ref="#BrewerDavidA" type="person">Brewer</name>&#8217;s essay literally maps
						the publication, adaptation and reception of <title level="m">Life in London</title> down to the month-by-month level of the
						book&#8217;s serial appearance and down to the street-by-street level of the particular <name ref="#LondonUK" type="place"
							>London</name> neighborhoods where the characters go on their larks, where theaters stage adaptations, or where we have
						evidence of particular reader response (including police reports of overexcited readers acting out Tom and Jerry&#8217;s
						sprees). The results are astonishing: not only do we, in reading this essay and looking at these maps, experience the
						temporality of reception in an entirely new way, but we see in new terms how and why this craze played out as it did across
						forms and media. As in all the essays in this volume, we get a powerful sense of the peculiarly mediated space fandom
						occupies. We also, excitingly, get a new sense of how we might understand the history of reading and theatergoing through the
						problematic of form.</p>
					<p>I confess that when I began contacting potential contributors to this volume, I was anxious about the terminology I&#8217;d
						chosen: would the label &#8220;fandom&#8221; impel readings that merely projected our own forms of desire back onto
						Romantic-era readers? Surely, there are striking continuities between today&#8217;s fan practices and their pre-history in
						Romantic-era forms of reception, as <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Nicola Watson</name> remarks: &#8220;in the
						climate of today&#8217;s celebrity culture, it has become possible to rediscover <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">Byron</name> as a necessary precondition for Mick Jagger, as the first famous poet to inspire certain modes
						of feeling on an international scale.&#8221; <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> For a great instance of running with
							such an equation, see <title level="a"><name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>&#8217;s life of
								bling, booze and groupie sex,</title>
							<title level="j">The Sun</title>&#8217;s 2008 article reporting (somewhat spuriously) on Corin Throsby&#8217;s research on
							love letters to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> in the John Murray archive: &#8220;His
							passions included brandy and bling&#8230;and bedding hundreds of lust-crazed groupies. The dashing aristocrat&#8217;s racy
							lifestyle, palatial homes and oceans of female fan mail created a circus not unlike the one surrounding David Beckham
							today&#8230; Now never-before-published letters have emerged proving his female fans were every bit as smitten as those
							who were later to swoon over Becks and his fellow stars.&#8221; </note> The essays in the present volume do suggest some
						potential rewards of analyzing Romantic-era reading practices in terms of a &#8220;presentist&#8221; understanding of the
						affective dynamics of celebrity and fandom (&#8220;presentist&#8221; because derived from an analysis of those dynamics as
						they are familiar to us). <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> For thoughtful discussions of the uses and risks of
							&#8220;presentism&#8221; see <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/praxis/contemporary/toc.html">the Praxis volume on the
								topic</ref> edited by <name ref="#MandellLaura" type="person">Laura Mandell</name>. </note> Ultimately, however, I
						find what comes across in these essays is in fact the historical difference that separates Romantic-era fandom from more
						familiar fan routines, rather than any putative similarity between the two. If these essays contest literary criticism&#8217;s
						abjection of the fan as &#8220;na&#239;ve, obsessive, desirous, and dangerously predatory&#8221; (<name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ"
							type="person">Watson</name>), they also resist simply celebrating the fan or identifying Romantic-era readerly desire with
						our own. <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> On the pathologization of fandom as obsessive and hysterical, see <name
								ref="#JensenJoli" type="person">Jensen</name> 9. </note>
					</p>
					<p>Indeed, each of these essays describes scenes of fandom that come very quickly to belong emphatically to the past. Travelling
						down the Rhine in the 1850s, Lady Shelley, <name ref="#WatsonNicolaJ" type="person">Watson</name> tells us, finds herself
						unable to re-experience her own earlier feelings of romance amid these scenes, even though she keeps her copy of <title
							level="m">Childe Harold</title> open beside her. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>&#8217;s
						encounter with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> may set the stage for later developments in his
						life and his writing, but almost on the scene, in <name ref="#TuiteClara" type="person">Tuite</name>&#8217;s account, it is
						already subject to the revising and corroding action of memory. <title level="j">The Satirist</title>&#8217;s exchanges with
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> set in motion recurring tropes in the poet&#8217;s
						reception, but as <name ref="#SchoenfieldMark" type="person">Schoenfield</name> explains, these exchanges belong to an early
						moment in <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s career, before the full appearance of
						&#8220;Byronism&#8221; and its transformative effects on the poet&#8217;s public persona and on the literary market itself.
							<name ref="#BrewerDavidA" type="person">Brewer</name> explains that the craze for <title level="m">Life in London</title>
						faded as quickly as it came on; by the middle of the century, even those who&#8217;d been swept up in it in their youth
						professed themselves mystified by the book&#8217;s popularity. This pattern isn&#8217;t just about aging or the passage of
						time: what it reveals is the way fandom is always historically situated, always tied to specific and shifting cultural as well
						as individual situations. In the Romantic period in particular, the <emph>fading</emph> of forms of fandom indexes the rapid
						and uneven development and transformation of institutions of writing, reading, and publication across the period. The essays
						in this volume show how an analysis of fandom can limn these changes in provocative and revelatory fashion. They point the way
						to more work on Romantic-era readers and reading practices that needs to be done, and they suggest some of the innovative and
						varied methodologies scholars might put to use in charting this underexplored but very rich terrain.</p>
