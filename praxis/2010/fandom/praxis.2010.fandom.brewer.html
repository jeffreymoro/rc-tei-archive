            <p class="noCount">The early 1820s craze for Pierce Egan's and Robert and George Cruikshank's <em>Life in London</em> has long seemed both deeply puzzling and yet somehow emblematic of its age. Brewer
               proposes that the mania becomes far more explicable if we focus, in a very precise
               way, on the interplay between serial publication, the so-called "illegitimate" theater,
               and the geography of London, especially insofar as those relations, in turn, line
               up with the peculiar and rapidly shifting reputation and mood of the metropolis in
               these years. By carefully mapping out <em>Life in London</em> part by monthly part, and dramatic adaptation by dramatic adaptation, we can both
               recover the underlying aesthetics of the craze (which revolved around questions of
               the adequacy of representation) and further theorize what Franco Moretti has termed
               the "profoundly social aspect[s]" of form: the ways in which the forms of individual
               texts are not only shaped by forces beyond their bounds and beyond their control,
               but also how the significance of those individual forms largely emerges from their
               perceived relations with one another. In short, by slowing down and zeroing in upon
               the very particular qualities of "the Moment of Tom and Jerry," we can begin to think
               in new ways about how literature works in the world more generally.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>When William Makepeace Thackeray looked back at his youth, he was more than a little
                  bewildered by the ways in which he’d gotten caught up in the single greatest cultural
                  craze of his boyhood: the mania surrounding Pierce Egan’s <em>Life in London; or, the Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, Esq., and his Elegant
                     Friend Corinthian Tom, Accompanied by Bob Logic, the Oxonian, in their Rambles and
                     Sprees through the Metropolis</em>. Thackeray readily granted that the illustrations which Robert and George Cruikshank
                  had done for the book had not lost their appeal over the intervening decades: “the
                  pictures!—oh! the pictures are noble still!” And he fondly reminisced about “what
                  a funny fellow that actor was who performed Dicky Green in ... the play!” (
                  “De Juventute”
                   510). But “on reperusal, Tom and Jerry is not so brilliant as I had supposed it to
                  be... the style of the writing ... was not pleasing to me; I even thought it a little
                  vulgar ... and as a description of the sports and amusements of London in the ancient
                  times,” <em>Life in London</em> now seemed “more curious than amusing” (509-10). Even the typography had grown cryptic:
                  “those inverted commas, those italics, those capitals” must have been “as good as
                  jokes, though you mayn’t quite perceive the point” anymore (511). Indeed, twenty years
                  earlier, Thackeray had been unable to remember “the literary contents of the book”
                  at all: they had “passed sheer away,” even as the “scenes remain[ed] indelibly engraved
                  upon the mind” (rev. of <em>The Tower</em> 13). Yet despite his retrospective bafflement as to the attractions of Egan’s writing,
                  Thackeray was nonetheless firmly convinced that <em>Life in London</em>’s account of the larks of a fashionable young man (Tom), his country cousin (Jerry),
                  and their friend Logic, a witty Oxford student, through the gamut of metropolitan
                  life somehow embodied its age and so, more than any other touchstone from those years,
                  could conjure up “the antediluvian world” before “railways were made,” when there
                  was “an enjoyment of life ... which contrasts strangely with our feelings of 1860,”
                  now that “every London man is weary and <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">blasé</span>” (
                  “De Juventute,”
                   505, 503, 510).

                           volumes” lead “you ... to suppose that the English aristocracy of 1820 did dance and
                           caper in that way, and box and drink at Tom Cribb’s and knock down watchmen; and the
                           children of to-day, turning to their elders, may say, ‘Grandmamma, did you wear such

               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Considered in isolation, Thackeray’s insistence upon the puzzling exemplarity of <em>Life in London</em> might come off as simply the half-amused nostalgia of a middle-aged man: engaging,
               perhaps, but not necessarily all that revealing. However, Thackeray’s confusion seems
               to have been broadly shared with his contemporaries. Charles Mackay, for example,
               cited the time that “people went mad upon a dramatic subject, and nothing was to be
               heard of but ‘Tom and Jerry’” as one of the “Popular Follies in Great Cities”: “every
               youth on the town was seized with the fierce desire of distinguishing himself, by
               knocking down the ‘<em>charlies</em>,’ being locked up all night in a watch-house, or kicking up a row among loose women
               and blackguard men in the low dens of St. Giles’s” (336-37). Further examples could
               be adduced, but the pattern seems clear: those old enough to remember the reign of
               George IV were retrospectively perplexed by the appeal of <em>Life in London</em>, but utterly certain that that appeal, whatever it may have been, epitomized something
               important about the early 1820s, what R. S. Surtees would tellingly term “the old
               Tom-and-Jerry days, when fisticuffs were the fashion” (187).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>And so its popularity would suggest: Egan’s biographer records that “so great was
                  the demand for copies of the numbers [in which <em>Life in London</em> was originally published] that the printers ... could hardly keep pace with it, and
                  whole armies of women and small boys, employed to colour the plates, were worked to
                  exhaustion” (Reid 73). Before the initial serialization was even complete, the earlier
                  parts were reprinted at a higher price, to be followed by at least five other editions
                  before the end of the decade.

                  </div>Nor was “all London” content to “read it,” they also, as Thackeray recalled, “went
                  to see it in its dramatic shape” (rev. of <em>The Tower</em> 13).

                  </div>At least ten different metropolitan theaters offered plays based upon <em>Life in London</em> in the 1821-22 and 1822-23 seasons.  Indeed, at several points in the spring and summer
                  of 1822 one could take in up to eight competing productions, the most popular of which—W.
                  T. Moncrieff’s <em>Tom and Jerry</em>—ran for an unprecedented three hundred nights:  “from the highest to the lowest,
                  all classes were alike anxious to witness its representation; Dukes and Dustmen were
                  equally interested in its performance, and Peers might be seen mobbing it with Apprentices
                  to obtain an admission.  Seats were sold for weeks before they could be occupied....
                  In the furor of its popularity, persons have been known to travel post from the furthest
                  parts of the kingdom to see it; and five guineas have been offered in an evening for
                  a single seat” (Moncrieff 1826, v). 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Tickets at the Adelphi normally ran one to four shillings, depending on where one
                           sat.</span></div>
                  </div>Nor was this an exclusively London phenomenon: over the next few years, performances
                  (usually of Moncrieff’s version) were staged in Birmingham, Bridgnorth, Brighton,
                  Cheltenham, Dublin, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Hull, Lincoln, Liverpool, Newark, Newcastle,
                  Redruth, Shrewsbury, and Southampton, not to mention the even more far flung theaters
                  of Albany, Baltimore, Boston, Charleston, Montreal, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia,
                  York, Upper Canada, and even Sydney. Opportunistic booksellers quickly commissioned
                  a range of imitations, including <em>Life in St. George’s Fields</em>, <em>Real Life in London</em>, and <em>Female Life in London</em> (the latter was simply a reprint of Frances Burney’s <em>Evelina</em>). The ballad publisher James Catnach offered several different broadside redactions,
                  while countless cordials, dances, dinners, fans, games, handkerchiefs, porcelain figures,
                  prints, screens, slang dictionaries, snuffboxes, song books, sweetmeats, tea boards,
                  and toy theater sheets were produced for those who wished to include Tom and Jerry
                  in their daily rituals.

                  </div>Even the clothing trades got in on the act. According to John Camden Hotten, “tailors,
                  bootmakers, and hatters recommended nothing but Corinthian shapes and Tom and Jerry
                  patterns” (10) and at least some of their recommendations carried all the way across
                  the Atlantic: in Richmond, Virginia, the young Edgar Allen Poe singled out a romantic
                  rival’s “Tom and Jerry brim / And dove-tailed coat, obtained at cost” for particular
                  mockery (11). Clearly something about <em>Life in London</em> resonated with a broad cross-section of the reading, theatrical, and consumer publics
                  of the early 1820s.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Yet what that something was seems to have already become semi-incomprehensible by
                  the 1840s and that incomprehensibility only increased as the century wore on until
                  even the foremost chronicler of the craze was forced to confess that “although Life
                  in London ... did make our grandfathers so very—<em>very</em>! merry in the first quarter of the Nineteenth Century, we are constrained to admit;
                  that it is a terrible dull and tedious work to read through in the present day.” Indeed,
                  “the present generation will find in some of the scenes depicted in such glowing colours,
                  many of the fashions, manners, and customs, which prevailed in the reign of King George
                  the Fourth, together with certain landmarks of the past, which no one need regret
                  leaving far behind, and ought to give every encouragement to those who live under
                  the rule of Queen Victoria to maintain a firm faith in the social progress of the
                  age” (Hindley ii-iii, iv). Whatever significance <em>Life in London</em> still had lay in what Hotten termed “its value as a true picture of life fifty years
                  ago”: “the last days of coarse caricatures, of dueling, and of the glorious three-bottle
                  system after dinner” (9).

               <p>Most of the extant scholarship on Egan and the Cruikshanks has simply replicated this
                  pattern of being convinced that the success of <em>Life in London</em> was somehow emblematic of its age (the Cruikshank prints have been used to illustrate
                  dozens of books on the Regency and reign of George IV), yet finding it incredibly
                  difficult to specify what its appeal might have been, other than as a vague—and generally
                  unconvincing—adumbration of another, supposedly more readily comprehensible phenomenon
                  like <em>The Pickwick Papers</em> or the flâneur or Bakhtinian heteroglossia. Even the best critics (who recognize that <em>Life in London</em> was “a summation of the passing culture ..., not a foretaste of the new” and so really
                  shouldn’t be folded into the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">longue durée</span> of Victorianism) seem to be unable to explain the sheer magnitude of the craze: why
                  such “low-life fantasies” should have gone supernova in the first half of the 1820s,
                  rather than simply faded away (Gatrell 552, 555).

               <p>Clearly this is a problem for the history of reading and theatergoing and ordinarily
                  I would turn to the letters, diaries, and marginalia of Egan’s contemporaries in order
                  to try to reconstruct how <em>Life in London</em> might actually have been read and watched. Alas, such evidence seems to be more than
                  usually scarce in this case and that which I have found—such as John Clare’s suggestion
                  that Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em> “seems a fit partner for Tom &amp; Jerry” (34) or Harriet Arbuthnot’s dismay at how the
                  audience at a performance of Moncrieff’s version “seemed to enjoy a representation
                  of scenes in which, from their appearance, one might infer they frequently shared”
                  (144)—come off, at least initially, as even more idiosyncratic or blinkered than such
                  traces generally are.

                           any sort (Gatrell 213). Cf. Jacky Bratton’s discussion of how “very little unquestionably

                           of the [patent] theatres” (134).</span></div>

               <p>Rather than throw up my hands at the absence of our customary tools, however, I decided
                  to try something of a methodological experiment. Intrigued by Franco Moretti’s assertion
                  that “the most profoundly social aspect of literature is its form” ( 
                  “Preface”
                   xii) and suspecting that the difficulty which previous scholars had had in explaining
                  the appeal of <em>Life in London</em> stemmed at least in part from the temporal breadth of their inquiries—the nineteenth-century
                  novel, the eighteenth-century “urban odyssey,” late Georgian urban pleasure, even
                  simply “Regency London” (which still takes in a full decade)—I decided to map out,
                  Moretti-like, <em>Life in London</em> part by monthly part, and then dramatic adaptation by dramatic adaptation, in order
                  to see if those maps could reveal anything more specific to the early 1820s about
                  the appeal of these texts to readers and playgoers. My hope was that by figuring out
                  how these texts unfolded both temporally and spatially and how that unfolding was
                  in turn related to the probable time and place of their reading or viewing, I could
                  discern something about the “social aspect” of their form which was otherwise unavailable
                  for scrutiny. In so doing, I fondly imagined, I might finally be able to devise a
                  way to combine a proper consideration of form with the history of reading and theatergoing—a
                  consummation which I, at least, have long devoutly wished.

                           “from within a synchronic analysis of its production and use,” see Lovell 3. As she
                           notes, “sets of objects, by the power of their reiteration, by the formulation and

            <p>The results of my mapping <em>Life in London</em> were a revelation and immediately illuminated a number of puzzles which the other
               scholarship I had read had been unable to solve to my satisfaction. The patterns which
               emerged from this mapping (and, I think, their significance) were then confirmed by
               the maps which I made of the most successful dramatic adaptations and by what evidence
               exists regarding the reactions of early readers and playgoers. Put most baldly, the
               formal elements which best explain the mania spawned by <em>Life in London</em> come from those parts of the book which appeared before the narrative, such as it
               is, ever got going. Accordingly, any attempt to account for the power of <em>Life in London</em> by theorizing how its narrative works is almost automatically going to lead us astray:
               quite simply, it would be looking in the wrong place. Whatever <em>Life in London</em> may be, it’s not ultimately a nineteenth-century novel in which plot and the fate
               of emplotted characters are the fundamental sources of interest and power.</p>

               <p>So what did I find when I did my mapping? First let me highlight a small, but extremely
                  telling detail, one which can serve as a key to unlock the significance of what the
                  maps reveal: a note headed “SECOND EDITION, JAN. 8, 1821,” which Egan added to retract
                  his playful banter in the first edition with Friedrich Christian Accum, now that the
                  latter had been caught tearing leaves out of a library book at the Royal Institution.

                  take an article on chocolate home with him) doesn’t matter for our purposes. But Egan’s
                  mention of a second edition in early January 1821 is huge, since producing such entailed
                  reprinting and again hand-coloring both the text and the plates for the already extent
                  Parts One through Five of <em>Life in London</em> and raising the price of those reprinted parts and all of the remaining installments
                  from two-and-a-half shillings apiece to three. Bibliographers and collectors of the
                  Cruikshanks have long known of this second edition and would readily concede how unprecedented
                  it was. Quite simply, illustrated books at this price point had never sold so quickly
                  as to necessitate more than a single edition while the original serialization was
                  still underway. Even <em>The Tour of Doctor Syntax</em>, which largely created the market for such books, didn’t go into a second edition
                  until its initial appearance in <em>The Poetical Magazine</em> was complete.

                           copies of the fairly ordinary The Adventures of Johnny Newcombe in the Navy (with
                           sixteen plates by Rowlandson) which were produced in 1818 and the 7,000 copies of

                           in 1825 (St Clair 561, 657). Even the low end of this spectrum would have allowed
                           the publishers to have “netted some thousands” from Life in London by March of 1822,

                  second edition reveals: namely, that <em>Life in London</em> was astonishingly successful by a few days after the release of Part Five. Yet, if
                  we look at what has happened in the text to that point, we get almost nothing by our
                  usual novelistic standards. Those first five parts are comprised almost exclusively
                  of an extended pitch for the importance of “seeing Life,” along with character sketches
                  of Logic, Tom, and Jerry. The first episode remotely close to actual narrative (certainly
                  the first event which the Cruikshanks deem worthy of illustration) is only half finished
                  by the close of Part Five—just a week before the second edition. Prior to that, nothing
                  happens. Or, to be precise, none of the events which figure in the illustrations or
                  Victorian memory have yet occurred by that point in the text (a good forty-two percent
                  of the way in).

            <p>On the other hand, readers had already gotten fifteen plates (three in each part),
               including many of the ones which would go on to be the most iconic: say, “Tom Getting
               the Best of a Charley” (figure 1) which was adapted for various downmarket redactions
               of the text (figure 2), taken up as a general visual joke (figure 3), and transfer-printed
               onto a handkerchief to delight “the <em>Country Folks</em>” (Egan, <em>Pierce Egan’s Finish</em> 11-12). Compare the maps in the slideshows below for the text and the plates (in
               each case the locales which appear in the part in question are shown in yellow, while
               sites from earlier parts are in red): <br/><br/> <a class="_blank" href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/RCOldSite/www/praxis/fandom/brewer/slideshow1_1.html#image">SLIDESHOW ONE</a><br/> <a class="_blank" href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/RCOldSite/www/praxis/fandom/brewer/slideshow2_1.html#image">SLIDESHOW TWO</a><br/><br/> In the first four parts of the text, as I’ve just suggested, there’s almost nothing
               in terms of narrative, and what little there is in Part Five hardly involves much
               in the way of “rambles and sprees”: Jerry begins to get fitted for new clothes at
               Tom’s elegant house in the West End. With the plates, on the other hand, our heroes
               travel all over the West End and Covent Garden, indulging themselves in various sorts
               of sports, gambling, slumming, and other larks, including dalliances with both their
               mistresses and the prostitutes who haunt the theater. What possible sense can this
               disparity make? Even if the narrative existed only to flesh out the plates (as was
               sometimes charged to be the case by later partisans of the Cruikshanks) and so necessarily
               had to lag behind, surely a practiced journalist like Egan wouldn’t have needed three
               whole months to get to the action.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Unless, of course, getting to the action wasn’t really the point. I’d like to propose
                  that this disparity between the text and plates, far from being either irrelevant
                  or a clumsy bit of throat-clearing on Egan’s part while he figured out what to do,
                  can actually go quite far toward explaining the astonishing appeal of those early
                  parts of <em>Life in London</em>, whose success brought the text to “the tipping point” where it could cross over
                  into a full-scale sensation (after which the usual feedback loops of commercial success
                  and “extraordinary popular delusions” could kick in).

                  </div>So let’s turn to those early parts and consider how their seemingly mismatched text
                  and plates might actually have worked together.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The first thing to notice is how sustained and (in its own way) systematic a pitch
                  for its own aesthetics we are offered. According to Egan, <span class="indent2">the grand object of this work is an attempt to portray what is termed ‘SEEING LIFE’
                     in all its various bearings upon society, from the <em>high-mettled</em> CORINTHIAN of St. James’s, <em>swaddled</em> in luxury, down to the <em>needy</em> FLUE-FAKER of Wapping, <em>born without a shirt</em>, and not a <em>bit of scran</em> in his cup to allay his piteous cravings. ‘LIFE IN LONDON’ is the sport in view, and
                     provided the chase is turned to a good account, ‘<em>seeing Life</em>’ will be found to have its advantages ... whether an evening is spent over a bottle
                     of champaign, at <em>Long’s</em>, or in taking a ‘<em>third of a daffy</em>’ at <em>Tom Belchers’s</em>... Equally so, in <em>waltzing</em> with the <em>angelics</em> at my <em>Lady</em> FUBB’S assembly, at Almack’s, or <em>sporting a toe</em> at Mrs. SNOOK’S <em>hop</em> at St. Kit’s, among the pretty <em>straw</em> damsels and dashing chippers, if a <em>knowledge</em> of ‘Life,’ an acquaintance with <em>character</em>, and the importance of <em>comparison</em>, are the ultimate results.

                              subscribers put out by Egan’s publishers a few weeks before the appearance of Parts
                              One and Two (Hindley xii).</span></div>
                     </div></span><br/> “Seeing life” thus seems to involve appreciating both the marked social and geographic
                  variety of the metropolis and the underlying similarity of pleasures which yokes such
                  variety together into a coherent, if pointedly not unified vision of “Life in London.”
                  For those able to relish it, “a <em>blow out</em> may likewise be found as <em>savory</em> and as <em>high scented</em> at Mother O’Shaughnessy’s, in the <em>back settlements</em> of the <em>Holy Land</em>, by the hungry <em>cut-away</em> Paddy Mulroony, as the <em>Mulligatawny soup</em> may be swallowed with peculiar <em>goût</em> by one of the fastidious, squeamish, screwed-up descendants of the OGILBY train at
                  Grillion’s hotel” (26-27). Or, to put it differently, as Egan clearly delights in
                  doing, “hundreds of individuals in the Metropolis think it no loss of time, and feel
                  as much interest in matching their <em>tykes</em> at JEM ROLFE’S amphitheatre for a <em>quid</em> or two; or in drawing the badger at HARLEQUIN BILLY’S menagerie, and boasting of the
                  goodness and breed of their dogs, as MY Lord CARE-FOR-NOTHING does in relating the
                  pedigree of his high-mettled cattle, and talking with the <em>touters</em> and jockeys at Newmarket” (34). Once one comprehends “the advantages resulting from
                  the <em>varieties</em> of ‘LIFE’” (29), one can supposedly acquire a sort of universal comfort akin to that
                  of Tom, who “was as much at home in blowing a cloud, listening to a night-row charge
                  at a watch-house, as he proved himself an adept in all the luxuriant, voluptuous movements,
                  when waltzing at Almack’s (42).</p>
            </div>
            <p>I quote so extensively in order to demonstrate the ways in which Egan’s style enacts
               the very aesthetics he’s championing: like life in London itself by Egan’s account,
               <em>Life in London</em> jumbles together seemingly disparate kinds of people, sorts of places, and perhaps
               above all varieties of language (and typography) in order to bring out their putative
               underlying similarity and the advantages of learning to be comfortable amidst them
               all. If “half of the world are <em>up</em> to” “the <em>slang</em>” he introduces, “it is my intention to make the other half <em>down</em> to it. LIFE IN LONDON demands this sort of demonstration. A kind of <em>cant</em> phraseology is current from one end of the Metropolis to the other” and so needs
               to be replicated in order to properly render “real Life” (84-85n) and so equip his
               readers with the tools to emulate his hero, Richard Brinsley Sheridan: “a man at all
               times, whether viewed at dashing routs, surrounded by the most accomplished beauties;
               or <em>caught</em> upon the <em>sly</em>, peeping at midnight revels in the precincts of Covent Garden” (16). Those beauties
               might talk “of ‘a <em>row</em>’ which occurred ... last evening,” while the Covent Garden revelers would allude
               to a “<em>lark</em>... at a gin-spinner’s,” but, for Egan, slang was “as strongly marked” (84-85n) in
               St. James’s as it was in St. Giles and it was only from “the knowledge and experience”
               of both that one might attain “complete possession” (75) of one’s self.</p>
            <p>Of course, inevitably, there will be a gap between any representation and its object
               and Egan not only knows this, but highlights it again and again as a source of potential
               pleasure. Early on, he insists upon the adequacy of his representations: he’s offering
               “his readers a <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">Camera Obscura</span> View” through which <span class="indent2">LIFE IN LONDON will be seen without any fear or apprehension of danger either from
                  <em>fire</em> or <em>water</em>; avoiding also breaking a limb, receiving a <em>black eye</em>, losing a pocket-book, and getting into a watch-house; picking up a <em>Cyprian</em> and being exposed the next morning before a magistrate for being found <em>disorderly</em>. Likewise in steering clear of all those innumerable rows and troubles incident or
                  allied to ‘keeping it up, and loving of fun.’ It would have been fortunate indeed
                  for poor JERRY and CORINTHIAN TOM if they had possessed such advantages. But ‘experience
                  makes fools wise,’ and as good-natured HAWTHORN and laughing TOM are now about to
                  relate their <em>adventures</em>, for the benefit of <em>fire-side</em> heroes and sprightly maidens, who may feel a wish to ‘see Life’ without receiving
                  a <em>scratch</em>, it must be considered that the Metropolis is now before them. (19)</span><br/> Tom and Jerry are thus, it would seem, perfectly up to the job of “seeing Life” on
               behalf of these “<em>fire-side</em> heroes and sprightly maidens,” who need not go out, Adam and Eve-like, into the metropolis
               “now before them” in order to “benefit” from it. Rather they can simply sit back and
               appreciate the splendor of its variety: after all, “POUSSIN never had a more luxuriant,
               variegated, and interesting subject for a landscape; nor had SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS finer
               portraits for his canvass than what have already had a sitting for their likenesses
               to embellish LIFE IN LONDON” (17). Yet only three months later, as the text was on
               the verge of finally plunging into those “adventures,” these same heroes and maidens
               got to witness Tom telling Jerry that “volumes would not suffice to portray the various
               characters which <em>cross our path</em> DAILY <em>in</em> LONDON. A <em>theoretical</em> inquiry will not go far enough in ascertaining the real features of society in the
               <em>Metropolis</em>. You are now on the <em>primest</em> SPOT in all the world.... I would, therefore, advise you to make the best use of
               your time. I have seen a great deal of LIFE myself; but I have a great deal yet to
               <em>see!</em>” (143). If even Tom has “a great deal yet to <em>see</em>” and “a <em>theoretical</em> inquiry” will not suffice, then it would seem that representation of the sort which
               Egan is offering up will not ultimately prove sufficient: those heroes and maidens
               would have to leave their firesides and risk injury or embarrassment if they wished
               to actually “see Life.” Yet this insistence upon the inadequacy of representation
               doesn’t simply supercede or cancel out the previous claims of adequacy. Rather, the
               two seem to coexist, albeit uneasily:  a relationship nicely encapsulated by the sheer
               repetition of phrases like “such is the diversity of LIFE IN LONDON” (30) or “it is
               a <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">multum in parvo</span> trait of 
               “Life in London”
               ” (139n), the ambiguity of whose reference—the book?  the city?  both?—at once collapses
               and maintains the distinction between Egan’s text and the metropolis itself.</p>
            <p>I dwell on these questions of the adequacy of representation—which, I think, are repeated
               so insistently as to be nearly inescapable, even for rather distractible readers,
               as most of the early adopters of <em>Life in London</em> probably were—because they help to explain the workings of the plates in these early
               parts and how their interaction with these questions helped bring this book to the
               tipping point. For one thing, the plates themselves supposedly share the text’s paradoxical
               blend of strict mimesis and adherence to artistic convention. In the note on slang
               I quoted earlier, Egan goes on to suggest that “my ingenious friends, ROBERT and GEORGE
               CRUIKSHANK, whose talents in representing ‘the living manners as they rise,’ stand
               unrivalled in this peculiar line, feel as strongly impressed with the value of <em>delicacy</em> as I do. But if some of the plates should appear rather <em>warm</em>, the purchasers of Life in London may feel assured, that nothing is added to them
               tending to <em>excite</em>, but, on the contrary, they have most anxiously, on all occasions given the preference
               rather to ‘<em>extenuate</em>’ than to ‘set down aught in malice.’ All the Plates are the exact representations,
               as they occurred, of the various classes of society” (85n). And while it would probably
               be impossible to determine whether any particular image has been extenuated or exactly
               represented (or somehow both at once), the plates do stylistically bear out this odd
               betwixt and betweeness. </p>

            <p>On one hand, they offer what seem (on the basis of other evidence we have) to be quite
               accurate renderings of their various locales. The saloon at Covent Garden (see figure
               4) or the Westminster Pit (figure 5) did, so far as we can tell, look the way the
               Cruikshanks pictured them, in terms of their architecture, the rank and dress of their
               usual denizens, etc. On the other hand, however, these same images look almost exactly
               like any number of other hand-colored aquatint caricatures of the early nineteenth
               century with their shallow box-like rooms, foreshortened perspective, grotesque faces,
               visual jokes (like the rather phallic muff in front of Tom’s breeches in the saloon

               <p>Moreover, if readers compared their respective copies of <em>Life in London</em> (as many print collectors were wont to do) they would have noticed variations between
                  the copies that seem far from random. For example, one Ohio State copy of the plate
                  which most struck Thackeray—“An Introduction. Gay moments of Logic, Jerry, Tom, and
                  Corinthian Kate”—showed Jerry’s mistress with her breasts covered (figure 6), while
                  another of our copies left them bare (figure 7), so as to call attention to the fact
                  that Kate and Sue are, after all, “cyprians” and that Jerry’s pose is straight out
                  of the brothel scene in <em>The Rake’s Progress</em> .

                           In 1840 Thackeray could only remember a scene “at Bob Logic’s chambers, where, if

                           scene had come to exemplify that “enjoyment of life ... which contrasts strangely
                           with our feelings of 1860”: (figure 9) “just look at it now (as I have copied it to

            <p>A similar variation can be seen in a plate from Part Six (which appeared a few weeks
               after the tipping point, but the note “TO THE SUBSCRIBERS” from “THE AUTHOR IN DISTRESS!”
               inserted to explain the brevity of Part Five had hinted at this scene): in one copy
               Tom and Jerry’s punches in “a street Row” are landing hard enough to draw blood, in
               another they’re not. Obviously these variations undercut the sustainability of any
               claim to catch “‘the living manners as they rise.’” Were these scenes wholly mimetic,
               then surely one of these copies would have to be wrong: at the moment represented,
               Sue’s breasts were either covered or uncovered, just as Tom’s fist did or did not
               smash his opponent’s nose. But the very impossibility (and ridiculousness) of even
               trying to ascertain the truth here only underscores what I think is the broader project
               of these plates within the aesthetics of representational adequacy and inadequacy
               that I’ve been sketching out.</p>
            <p>If the point of the text of the first five parts of <em>Life in London</em> is to learn how to “see Life,” then the plates in those parts are offering up specimens
               of “Life” to be seen. That is, they are offering the promise of narrativity. They
               aren’t yet narrative (we don’t know how our heroes got into these situations, nor
               what will come next, nor even in what sequence these various episodes will occur and
               whether or not that sequence is significant). Rather, they’re a sign that “the Rambles
               and Sprees through the Metropolis” which the wrappers of each part promise are, in
               fact, on the way, that at some point soon we will learn what was involved in Tom’s
               “accommodat[ing] himself, as much as possible, to the dispositions of the company
               in which he might be situated” (110). But given the uncertainty of how adequate these
               plates ultimately are as representations, I’d like to suggest that the anticipated
               narrativity of “seeing Life” is, dare I say it, always already divided. </p>

            <p>“<em>Fire-side</em> heroes and sprightly maidens” couldn’t be sure if the breasts of fashionable cyprians
               were routinely bared during private performances of what Egan later termed “the elegant
               but <em>lascivious</em> waltz” (196), any more than they could be sure that coffee shops near the Olympic
               Theatre routinely degenerated into late night comic riots (see figure 12). But they
               also couldn’t be sure that they didn’t ... unless they went out to see for themselves.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>“Seeing Life” can thus go in two quite different directions: one could wait to “see”
                  the episodes depicted in the plates as they eventually unfolded (in the months after
                  the tipping point of the second edition). Or one could go out into the metropolis
                  in pursuit of what one hoped would be similar adventures. Both solutions seem to have
                  been engaged in. On the one hand, in a note on the wrappers for Part Four, Egan let
                  his “Subscribers” know that “in consequence of several applications having been made
                  to the Publishers respecting the EXPLANATIONS OF THE PLATES, it is necessary to observe,
                  that they are merely given ... to keep the plates <em>alive</em>; but the <em>subjects</em> of them will be more minutely described, <em>in their proper place</em> in the body of the work,” which would suggest a certain readerly impatience for the
                  plates’ promise of narrativity to be fulfilled. On the other hand, though, as Roger
                  Sales has pointed out, readers are “given enough information to plan their own rambles”
                  (161) and over the next few years the press would repeatedly claim that they were
                  doing just that with a vengeance: by one report, there were “nineteen watchmen prostrate
                  with their boxes on their backs” in April 1822 alone (
                  “Annus Mirabilis!”
                   23).

                           Pitt, Lord Camelford, records such an adventure in 1803—but it supposedly spiked dramatically
                           in the wake of Life in London. For Camelford’s lark, see Tolstoy 160.</span></div>
                  </div>Similarly, in December of that year three “dashing young gentlemen” were charged “with
                  making a ‘<em>Tom-Jerry-and-Logic</em>’ row, after midnight, near St. Thomas’s Hospital” in Southwark. Among other things,
                  they were “crying ‘Go it, Jerry!’—‘Go it, Tom!’—‘Go it, Logic!’ &amp;c. One of them said
                  ‘now we’ll floor the d—d Charley.’ They then ran with great force against his watch-box,
                  and endeavoured to upset it, so as to inclose him inside of it.” An alderman said
                  “not a night elapsed but that in some part of the town the peace was broken by young
                  thoughtless fellows apeing ‘Tom, Jerry, and Logic’” (<em>Glasgow Herald</em>, presumably reprinting an item from an unidentified London paper).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Obviously these particular accounts postdate the specific months in late 1820 and
               early 1821 we’ve been examining—and attribute these pranks to “the Tom and Jerry fever
               extending to all the minor theatres” (
               “Annus Mirabilis!”
               23)—but I see no reason to presume that some sort of readerly sprees were not already
               being undertaken during the serialization of the first five parts. Certainly the geography
               of those early parts, along with the apparently intended readership and the peculiar
               temporality of serial reading, solicits such excursions—if only to ascertain the adequacy
               or inadequacy of <em>Life in London</em>’s representation. Consider the spatial distribution of the places depicted in the
               plates of the first five numbers.<br/><br/> <a class="_blank" href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/RCOldSite/www/praxis/fandom/brewer/slideshow3_1.html#image">SLIDESHOW THREE</a></p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Six are in the fashionable West End (Tom’s apartment, the Westminster Pit, Corinthian
                  Kate’s apartment, Rotten Row, Jackson’s rooms in Bond Street, and a game of whist
                  played near St. James’s park). The other nine, however, are in the rather more socially
                  varied area surrounding Covent Garden (Temple Bar, a coffee shop near the Olympic
                  Theatre, a watchhouse near Bow Street, the English Opera House, Covent Garden Theatre,
                  Bow Street itself, a fortune teller’s house near Russell Street, a gin shop near Covent
                  Garden Theatre, and the tavern run by the retired boxing champion, Tom Cribb, near
                  the Haymarket). And even if a reader didn’t know exactly where a specific place was
                  located, the two areas of town are quite visually and thematically distinct from one
                  another and so it would have been easy enough to figure out the approximate neighborhood
                  in question. West of Regent Street we get fine clothing and sports and gambling and
                  high-end courtesans like Corinthian Kate and Sue. East of Regent Street we get larks
                  and their consequences, slumming, masquerade, various sorts of drinking, and a more
                  ordinary species of prostitute. To some extent, of course, such a spatial division
                  of London was nothing new—even if the construction of Regent Street had significantly
                  bolstered it by “damming up Soho” (Summerson 125). But I suspect the division was
                  particularly resonant for the target public for <em>Life in London</em>, which, given the fairly steep price of the book (and its apparent absence from most
                  circulating libraries), probably constituted a good chunk of its actual readership.

                  is worthy of their perusal,” while Murray, whose “splendid threshold” frightens away
                  the “pale, wan, and <em>shabbily</em> clad,” will “take the unsophisticated JERRY HAWTHORN by the hand” and “introduce him
                  to thy numerous acquaintance.” And if Humphrey will allot “only one little pane of
                  glass in thy attractive shop-front ... for the display of CORINTHIAN TOM, ... he may
                  be viewed quite ‘at home’ in St. James’s Street” (8). As these invocations should
                  suggest, these are the most fashionable purveyors of print in the metropolis and,
                  I think tellingly, they’re all located in the neighborhood in which Tom, Jerry, and
                  Logic reside. Obviously this need not mean that all of the early readers of <em>Life in London</em> either patronized those shops or lived in that neighborhood, but it seems probable
                  that if they didn’t, they thought themselves in the minority (i.e., they presumed
                  that most of the other “<em>fire-side</em> heroes and sprightly maidens” being addressed were one and the same with the “dashing
                  belles and beaux” who lounged into Colburn’s).</p>

            <p>Why should this sort of speculative sociology of readers matter? <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_13.jpg">Compare the locations of these shops with the geography of the plates in the first
                  five parts</a>. </p>

            <p> If I’m correct in my presumptions, then most of the early readers were living and
               lounging on the other side of Regent Street from the majority of the promised narrativity.
               Moreover, the intensity of that felt separation from the anticipated “rambles and
               sprees” would have been magnified, perhaps exponentially, by the seriality of part
               publication. As Thomas Arnold would note twenty years later, “works of amusement ...
               published periodically” “occupy the mind” longer than works published all at once
               and so “keep alive” a “constant ... expectation,” “thus dwelling upon the mind, and
               distilling themselves into it as it were drop by drop” until they “possess it so largely,
               colouring even, in many instances, its very language, and affording frequent matter
               for discussion” (39). It doesn’t take anywhere close to a month to read a thirty-two-page
               octavo pamphlet and its printed wrapper, nor to look at three plates. Yet the readers
               whose demand took <em>Life in London</em> to the tipping point had to wait at least that long to get the next part and if they
               were drawn in by any of the promised narrativity, their wait could be considerably
               longer before that promise was fulfilled. As my maps should suggest, the sprees depicted
               in the plates of the double installment of October 1820 did not begin to be narrated
               until at least January 1821 and in most cases, February or March or even, in the case
               of “Tom Getting the Best of a Charley,” April of that year. In the meantime, readers
               had to go about their own lives in London, either musing on the adequacy of Egan’s
               account of the “rambles and sprees” which lay on the other side of Regent Street or
               else setting out on their own such adventures—which might or might not accord with
               the account Egan eventually provides. Either way, though, the effect would be a complex
               entanglement of <em>Life in London</em> with life in London such that the aesthetics of “seeing Life” and the questions of
               representational adequacy which they pose would almost have to have become phenomenologically
               central to those readers’ lives. Like the realisms described by D. A. Miller, although
               presumably without quite the same disciplinary force, this interpenetration would
               “ensure that the novel is always centrally about the world to which one will be recalled
               and that the world to which one will be recalled has been reduced to attesting the
               truth (or falsehood) of the novel” (83). Hence, it’s not so much that “the sprawling,
               rambling form of <em>Life in London</em> ... reproduc[es] the form of the city itself” (Sales 156) as that the form of <em>Life in London</em> solicits and shapes a particular way of “seeing Life” which then becomes wholly intertwined
               with the “Life” to be seen, both in the text and plates to come and in the city itself.</p>

               <p>Thus far I’ve been dwelling upon the very beginnings of the craze for <em>Life in London</em>, what took the phenomenon to the tipping point of an unprecedented second edition
                  and price increase while the initial serialization was still underway. But most of
                  the mania postdates this second edition: the assorted reprints of <em>Life in London</em> as a stand-alone volume, the various theatrical versions, the Catnach broadsides and
                  other opportunistic redactions, the consumer goods ... these are all part of later
                  1821 or 1822 or 1823. Why spend so much time on the readers of these early parts,
                  whose total numbers must have been dwarfed by those who got swept up in the craze
                  after early January 1821? The answer, I’d like to propose, is that the rest of the
                  phenomenon largely plays out according to the parameters set by these first few parts
                  and their early adopters. This is not to say that nothing changes, of course, but
                  the subsequent parts of <em>Life in London</em> itself, the theatrical versions, and all of the other evidence that I’ve been able
                  to uncover all suggest that they were working within the same aesthetics of “seeing
                  Life” and the same questions of representational adequacy that we’ve been reconstructing.

            <p>Consider, for example, the ways in which Egan and the Cruikshanks continued to solicit
               readerly curiosity as to the adequacy of their representations. We are repeatedly
               told, in the parts published after the tipping point, that we can place our trust
               in the reliability of their depictions: the scene at Jackson’s Rooms “is most accurately
               represented” (216), and so can serve as as much of a surrogate for the rooms themselves
               as the scene at Cribb’s Parlour, even though Jackson’s “is not common to the public
               eye.... no person can be admitted without an introduction” (217), while Cribb’s “can
               be seen at all times, and, therefore ... may be <em>identified</em> when any person thinks proper” (220). Yet we are also told that scenes like that
               of the ginshop near Covent Garden “may be nightly witnessed after the SPELL is dissolved:
               but in much more depraved colours than is here represented” (180) and that “neither
               the PEN nor the PENCIL, however directed by talent, can do ... adequate justice” to
               “the Morning of Execution” at Newgate “or convey a description of the ‘<em>harrowed feelings</em>’ of the few spectators that are admitted into the Condemned Yard upon such an occasion”
               (280-81). And even when the promised narrativity finally began to arrive, more often
               than not it was a bit coy and still inclined to toy with the temporality of serial
               reading. So, for example, in the long-anticipated account of “Tom Getting the best
               of a Charley” (see again figure one) we are explicitly told that the women on Jerry’s
               arms were, as most readers probably already suspected, “a couple of Cyprians” (232)
               who, after the prank, and “in the most <em>tender</em> and persuasive manner, ... endeavoured to <em>gammon</em> JERRY and the CORINTHIAN up <em>Shire-Lane</em> to a place of <em>safety</em>, as they termed it” (233). Tom declined the invitation to their house, but we are
               pointedly not informed whether they made alternate arrangements: “it is quite immaterial
               how our heroes eluded the pursuit of the <em>Charleys</em>, or in what manner they spent the remainder of the night; they were out on a ‘<em>spree</em>,’ and were determined to finish it. They were not immaculate,” although whatever
               transpired couldn’t have been too dire, as “LOGIC found his companions” at home and
               “in a ‘whole skin’ ... the next morning” (233). </p>

            <p>Similarly, in the scene at All-Max (an East End dive whose nickname puns on “max,”
               a slang term for gin, and “Almack’s,” the exclusive West End assembly rooms) (see
               figure 14), the text for Part Nine concludes before we can learn what will come of
               Logic’s dalliance with the local women. Inquiring minds had either to wait a month
               to discover what Logic was doing in “the ‘<em>Fields of Temptation</em>,’ by which he was surrounded” (289)—and even then he coyly avoids the questioning
               of his friends as to specifics—or else they had to set out for Wapping in the hope
               of a reenactment. The reverse situation obtains in Part Eleven when our heroes visit
               Vauxhall where, Logic tells Jerry, “if <em>enjoyment</em> is your <em>motto</em>, you may make the most of an evening ... more than at any other place in the Metropolis”
               (335). Yet after the trio has listened to music, admired the paintings, had a bite
               to eat, “join[ed] the merry dance,” and watched Logic knock down a dandy with a single
               blow, Bob “<em>reeled</em> off” and “as upon former occasions, was not to be found” (338), though Tom suspected
               that he had “los[t]” his “way in the <em>dark walks</em>” frequented by prostitutes (339). None of this, however, was represented in any of
               the plates in that part. Would-be viewers of the scene had wait for the final installment
               (two weeks later) (figure 15) or else see whether their own attempts to “enjoy ...
               themselves to the utmost extent in all the variety” the Gardens “afforded” (338) could
               shed sufficient light on the Oxonian’s fate.</p>
            <p>The one significant departure of the post-tipping point parts and, of course, of the
               subsequent single-volume editions which allowed for a more varied temporality of reading—including
               the skimming and skipping studied by Leah Price—is the way in which they build in
               Jerry as a sort of proxy for the readers and viewers of <em>Life in London</em>. Like them, Jerry is learning to “see Life” under the tutelage of Tom and Logic and
               so his progress is implicitly positioned as somehow parallel to their own. As “he
               bid fair ... to become as <em>prime</em> an article” as his tutors “in being at home to ‘a peg’ in all their various SPREES
               and RAMBLES” (171), so too, the suggestion seems to go, could Egan and the Cruikshanks’
               readers acquire a universal comfort. </p>

            <p>Similarly, if Jerry can learn to appreciate how moving “from ALL-MAX in the East to
               ALMACKS in the West” (see again figure 14 and figure 16) is “almost like the rapid
               succession of scenes in a play, which will tend highly to increase the effect” and
               make “the contrast ... delightful,” then surely the “<em>fire-side</em> heroes and sprightly maidens” watching over his shoulder could relish similarly “good
               opportunit[ies] for observation” (291), even if they couldn’t gain admission to either
               place. But, of course, the adequacy of these representations and so of Jerry’s abilities
               to serve as our proxy are always half in question. A scant two-thirds of the way in,
               he confesses that he has “heard <em>talk</em> of the <em>varieties</em> of ‘LIFE IN LONDON,’ but what I have already seen beggars any thing like attempt
               at description” (227). </p>

               <p>While as a book <em>Life in London</em> was enough of a sensation for its publishers to have allegedly “netted some thousands
                  by it” by 11 March 1822, what turned the phenomenon all the way up to eleven and helped
                  ensure its place in the collective memory of Thackeray’s generation were the assorted
                  theatrical versions, the most successful of which—&gt;W. T. Moncrieff’s <em>Tom and Jerry</em>—supposedly earned “the proprietors of the Adelphi theatre,” where it was staged,
                  twelve thousand pounds by that same point in the spring of 1822 (“London Chit-Chat”
                  333, 334). Indeed, Moncrieff later estimated that they “cleared” “not ... less, from
                  first to last, than <em>Twenty five Thousand Pounds</em> by it” (Moncrieff 1828, vii).

                  </div>Like the post-tipping point parts of <em>Life in London</em>, the various plays are all devoted to working out the aesthetics of “seeing Life”
                  and its accompanying questions of representational adequacy. Accordingly, I’d like
                  to suggest, the theatrical versions can help test and confirm the ways in which the
                  forms we’re dealing with were “social” and so are of explanatory value when we’re
                  trying to figure out what drove this craze. Before I sketch out the workings of the
                  most prominent of these plays, however, it’s worth noting that they were all staged
                  at the so-called “illegitimate” or minor theaters, the status and characteristics
                  of which amplified a number of aspects of their form. First of all, for many playgoers,
                  the illegitimate theaters were on the side of liberty and fun and modernity, against
                  the perceived stodginess and perhaps worse of the patent theaters, which “had come
                  to be identified as the cultural synecdoche of a corrupt political state” (Moody 74).
                  Part of that reputation stemmed from the shameless, Polonius-like generic mixture
                  of the plays which they staged (in order to get around the legal prohibition on the
                  minor theaters offering “legitimate”—i.e., primarily spoken—drama, they would add
                  all sorts of spectacle and music to their productions). As evidence of just how far
                  these mixtures could go, consider only the playbills for three of the most popular
                  theatrical versions of <em>Life in London</em>: at Davis’s Royal Amphitheatre, one could take in “an entirely New, Whimsical, Local,
                  Melo-Dramatic, Pantomimical Equestrian Drama,” while Sadler’s Wells offered a “New
                  Pedestrian, Equestrian, and Operatic Extravaganza ... of Gaiety, Frisk, Lark, and
                  Patter” and <span class="name">Moncrieff</span>’s version at the Adelphi was billed as “an entirely new Classic, Comic, Operatic,
                  Didactic, Aristophanic, Localic, Analytic, Panoramic, Camera-Obscura-ic, Extravaganza
                  Burletta of Fun, Frolic, Fashion, and Flash ... Replete with prime Chaunts, rum Glees,
                  and Kiddy Catches” (qtd. in Hindley 4, 85, 8). Another part of the reputation of the
                  minor theaters derived from the sheer “visual magnificence” (Moody 151) of the playhouses
                  themselves, which was often at odds with their somewhat dodgy or unfashionable locations.

(see figure
                  18 and figure 19) Close to half of the scenes depicted in <em>Life in London</em> (many of which transferred over to the plays) were set in the West End, while nothing
                  other than our heroes’ outing to Vauxhall involved crossing the Thames. Yet three
                  of the theaters were on the south side of the river and another three were out on
                  the north edge of town (far beyond anywhere Tom and Jerry bother to go). Only the
                  Olympic, the Adelphi, and (as a somewhat special case) the East London were actually
                  in the same neighborhoods as the “rambles and sprees” they were representing. Yet
                  all of their buildings were every bit as opulent, if not more, than the patent theaters
                  of Covent Garden and Drury Lane where Tom and Jerry were shown consorting with prostitutes
                  and actresses showing their legs. Collectively, I’d like to suggest, these different
                  aspects of the “illegitimate” theaters’ reputation helped to further crank up the
                  aesthetics of “seeing Life” by linking that pursuit to the pleasurable disjunctions
                  of minor theatergoing more generally. That is, the questions of representational adequacy
                  which the plays took up from Egan and the Cruikshanks became, if anything, all the
                  more pointed when posed in a setting so clearly devoted to (and renowned for) dramatizing
                  the mimetic gap between life on stage—where people burst into song, cross-dressed,
                  and rode horses indoors—and the more quotidian existence outside the theater, with
                  the pleasure-seeking audience in an opulent and liminal space between the two.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The first of the theatrical versions of <em>Life in London</em> nicely exemplifies the uses to which this gap could be put. On 17 September 1821,
                  William Barrymore’s <em>Tom and Jerry, or, Life in London</em> debuted at Davis’s Royal Amphitheatre (better known to most theater historians as
                  Astley’s) and was their chief offering for at least the next three seasons. As its
                  subtitle suggests, this play took the “popular Production, which has lately engrossed
                  the attention of all London” and turned it into “an entirely new Whimsical, Local,
                  Melo-Dramatic, Pantomimical Equestrian Drama.” There’s nothing all that surprising
                  about such a transformation: equestrian shows were the specialty of the house and
                  so audiences were treated to a “scene of <em>Epsom Races</em>” which “exhibits post-chaises, gigs, tilburys, caravans, hackney-coaches, carts,
                  and four-in-hand barouches, all drawn by real horses ... concluding with a grand race
                  between seven ‘<em>Bits of Blood!</em>’ on extensive platforms taking the whole width” of the theater (<em>The Drama</em> 2: 360).

               <p>For a similar scene from Egan’s own theatrical version at Sadler’s Wells, which nicely
                  brings out the sheer oddity of the spectacle, see figure twenty. More tellingly for
                  our purposes, however, the usual sporting or martial or orientalist fare for which
                  Davis’s was known here gets offset by some decidedly metropolitan scenes. For example,
                  there’s what the reviewer just quoted describes as “the <em>exterior of the Opera House</em>, with all the horrors of a rainy night,” which involves Kate and Sue being cheated
                  by one hackney cab driver as they depart for Almack’s and Tom, Jerry, and Logic playing
                  a prank on another (they get in, tell him where they’re going, and get out the other
                  door), as rain begins to fall on stage. Similarly, the scenes in Jackson’s Rooms and
                  Cribb’s Parlour not only had “the <em>Clown</em> prove ... himself a ‘<em>hard hitter</em>,’ by sending <em>Harlequin</em> clean through the wainscot,” but also offered live performances by “Cribb and Spring,”
                  “stripped half naked, boxing each other round the platform” to the supposed offense
                  of “female modesty” (<em>The Drama</em> 4: 306). Such spectacles were, of course, readily witnessed in the metropolis, as
                  were “views of <em>Tattersal’s</em>... and Temple Bar, by moonlight” (<em>The Drama</em> 1: 306). But they were witnessed across the river in rather different parts of town
                  and, for the most part, not by the “genteel people, with their children and servants”
                  who “had long ... frequented” this theater (Moody 171).

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Literally, then, there was a significant spatial divide between the space of seeing
                  and the space of the seen (see figure 21). Audience members were the Westminster or
                  Waterloo bridge away from any of the action being represented. Yet that divide was
                  repeatedly and spectacularly “bridged” by the sight of these different parts of London
                  right there on stage in all their equestrian or pugilistic or simply drenched glory.
                  The result, I’d like to suggest, was a highlighting of the same sort of simultaneous
                  adequacy and inadequacy of representation that we’ve been tracing in Egan and the
                  Cruikshanks. On one hand, what’s on stage is clearly not “Life” of the sort one is
                  supposed to be seeing: the “street row” Tom and Jerry get into after boxing a charley
                  poses absolutely no danger to any of the spectators. Yet on the other hand, there
                  are actual coaches on stage, a “half naked” Cribb is boxing around, and the handsomely
                  dressed dancers in the scene at Almack’s do a quadrille, lancers, and “2 Cast Figures”
                  (28). How much closer to “Life” can one get? And once again this doubleness is encapsulated
                  in the talismanic phrase of the title: when at the close Logic sings “then masquerade
                  it now away, we ne’er shall wish the fun done, / That is, should you be pleased to
                  say, you like our Life in London” (40), does that refer simply to what the audience
                  has just witnessed or more broadly to what the play supposedly stands in for? Either
                  way, it was enough to induce “Mr. Astley to keep his theatre open near a fortnight
                  later than his usual period of closing” and to yield three hundred eighty pounds for
                  Barrymore at his first benefit (“thirty pounds more than upon any previous occasion”),
                  but I suspect that that success stemmed in no small part from how “that <em>reality</em> which ... attach[es] itself to the scenes and incidents” came off as delightfully
                  partial: both mimetic and quite ostentatiously in violation of mimesis.

               <p>A rather different configuration of these same elements seems to have driven the next

                     on Pierce Egan’s Highly Popular Work</em>, which opened at the Olympic Theatre on 12 November 1821 and ran one hundred ninety-one
                  nights. Here, rather than keeping a clear, if bridgeable distance between the theater
                  and the putative location of the action on stage, the play repeatedly threatens to
                  collapse the two. This is particularly evident in a scene set in an unspecified, but
                  Olympic-like theater in which Tom and Jerry check out a “pretty girl” so “new” that
                  even Tom doesn’t “know her” and then briefly debate the ethics of “intrud[ing] upon
                  the Engagement of another gentleman” (i.e., soliciting a prostitute already with a
                  client).

                  </div>The girl’s accomplices then pick a fight with our heroes and Jerry plunges in: “Oh,
                  there’s a row! I must be in that, because it’s Life in London” (11). As we know from
                  the plate of “Tom &amp; Jerry in the Saloon at Covent Garden” (see again (figure 4), prostitutes
                  routinely worked the lobbies and boxes of the theaters, and pickpockets and conmen
                  would regularly instigate “rows” in order to gain an advantage over their marks. So
                  it might seem as if Dibdin’s play is operating uncomfortably close to home, putting
                  on stage what was probably already being more casually performed in and around the
                  theater.

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>And the rest of the geography of the play could support such an impression: the majority
                  of the action and all of the “larks” are set within a five minute walk of the theater,
                  in and around Temple Bar (see figure 22). One can easily imagine that there were some
                  post-theater attempts to steal a charley’s box or to crash a cockney party (as Tom,
                  Jerry, and Logic do). But as with our other texts, that implicit invitation to compare
                  the “Life” on stage with that surrounding it is counterbalanced by various moments
                  which call attention to the patent theatricality (and so presumed difference) of what
                  the actors were doing. Hence the brawl in the lobby turns into a song whose chorus
                  is “sure never row was so monstrously uproarious, / This is Life in London, how d’ye
                  like the go?” (13). Similarly, the chorus of the finale asks the audience “your plaudits
                  of patronage kindly then give, / And let Life in London, in London, long live; / For
                  features of fancy howe’er we pursue, / No fancy’s true fancy not fancied by you” (40).
                  As with Barrymore’s version, this begs the question of what it would mean to “let
                  Life in London, in London, long live.” Simply return frequently to the Olympic for
                  more of this “<em>extravaganza of fun, frolic, and whim</em>” (<em>The Drama</em> 2: 51)? Routinely engage in actual rows? And what would happen if a real-life counterpart
                  to Jerry presumed that a member of “the fancy” wasn’t “true fancy” since he didn’t
                  accord with his own “fancy”? Would he be able to conclude with the stage Jerry that
                  “Life in London’s nothing without adventures” (29)? Again, either way, the play clearly
                  worked and was “repeated every evening to overflowing audiences of the most fashionable
                  description” (<em>The Drama</em> 2: 206), despite, or perhaps because of, what Jane Moody terms the theater’s rather
                  “insalubrious location” (31)—remember only the midnight scene at a nearby coffee shop
                  (see again figure 12).

            <p> Fig. 23</p>
            <p>Rather than opening up or dramatically collapsing the gap between the space of the
               seer and the seen (as Barrymore and Dibdin had done), Moncrieff largely replicated
               the spatial distribution of Egan and the Cruikshanks’ <em>Life in London</em> (see figure 23 and figure 19 again) There were fewer sites, of course, because of
               time constraints and the demands of staging, but with two intriguing exceptions, Moncrieff’s
               version offers the same basic array of activities in most of the same places (although
               for some reason he relocates Kate and Sue’s visit to a fortuneteller from St. Giles
               to St. George’s Fields). The two exceptions, though, are extremely revealing. First,
               Moncrieff omits the spaces associated with prostitution by Egan and the Cruikshanks:
               Kate’s apartment and the theaters. Secondly, he cuts out or relocates all the opportunities
               for sprees and their consequences near Covent Garden (the coffee and gin shops and
               Bow Street simply disappear; the watchhouse gets moved east of Temple Bar), so that
               such activities now take place in distinctly different neighborhoods than that of
               the theater. One could try to account for these cuts by suggesting that they’re an
               attempt to raise the moral tone of <em>Life in London</em> or to provide a <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cordon sanitaire</span> between the space of viewing and the viewed. But then it would be rather difficult
               to explain why Moncrieff invents a plot in which Kate and Sue (who are no longer cyprians,
               but simply the sweethearts of Tom and Jerry) follow their loves all over London, posing
               as dancers at Almack’s, gamblers in a “fashionable hell,” beggars in the Holy Land
               of St. Giles, and perhaps most discordantly of all, if the aim was to clean up <em>Life in London</em>, “two young bucks” who accost the wife of a cit and kiss her—lest anyone miss the
               point, Logic leeringly observes a minute or two later how “very well” the object of
               their affection “must look in” breeches like the ones being worn by Kate and Sue (
               Moncrieff 1828, 37, 43). Similarly, any theory along the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cordon sanitaire</span> lines would rapidly run afoul of what was apparently one of the real attractions
               of the Adelphi’s production: namely, its portrayal of actual street celebrities like
               Andrew “Little Jemmy” Whiston, a paraplegic beggar who propelled himself about in
               a little cart, or Billy Waters, the one-legged African fiddler and “King of the Beggars.”
               What sense would it make to bring such figures on stage if the aim was to keep the
               “low” at bay?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Moncrieff’s cuts become significantly more comprehensible, though, if we consider
                  them in conjunction with the very Egan-like claims of the Adelphi’s early advertising.
                  According to one playbill, this was “an animated picture of every species of Life
                  in London, deprived, through the filtering stone of the Proprietor’s critical care,
                  of all that might disgust or offend even the most fastidious Imagination.” Yet less
                  than twelve weeks later, the play was being offered as “a series of pungent and minutely
                  accurate Representations of HIGH and LOW LIFE.”

                  various Publications” as they “may still be useful in refreshing the Memory of the
                  Spectators, after the Conclusion of the Adelphi season” (Moncrieff, <em>Songs</em> tp, v).

                  </div>So, it would seem that, as with <em>Life in London</em> itself, <em>Tom and Jerry</em> is somehow both filtered and minutely accurate, representationally inadequate and
                  yet up to the task. Unlike Egan and the Cruikshanks’ version, however, Moncrieff’s
                  play drew a quite socially—and therefore geographically—varied audience: dukes and
                  dustmen, peers and apprentices, the first member of the royal family ever to visit
                  a minor theater (Frederick, Duke of York) and “the people” whose “appearance” made
                  Harriet Arbuthnot turn up her nose. Indeed, in the closing address to the 1821-22
                  season, the actor who played Tom called explicit attention to the “overflowing audiences”
                  the Adelphi had attracted, “comprising a galaxy of the brightest stars of the West,
                  and a <em>maximum</em> of the primest natives of the East” (qtd. in <em>The Drama</em> 2: 311). What’s missing in all this socio-geographic language, of course, is the middle,
                  both of the social order—there are apparently no counterparts in the audience to Jemmy
                  Green, the cockney dandy of the play—and of the metropolis itself. This absence, I
                  think, helps reveal the significance of Moncrieff’s geography. Put simply, Covent
                  Garden has been emptied out (except for a few sporting destinations like Cribb’s Parlour,
                  which gets replicated on stage with the exhibition of the champion’s “ORIGINAL CUP”
                  [Moncrieff, <em>Songs</em> iv]) in order to make all these questions of representational adequacy depend upon
                  the origins of the audience, rather than on the location of the theater. That is,
                  by preserving Egan and the Cruikshanks’ spatial distribution (except for the area
                  around the Adelphi) and then soliciting, incredibly successfully, an audience from
                  both West and East, Moncrieff was able to transfer the felt site of viewing from the
                  playhouse in the Strand to wherever the individual audience members came from. Accordingly,
                  “the scene of ‘All Max in the East,’ is well worth seeing by any one who does not
                  mind contemplating filth, and profligacy, and vagabond merriment. The man who performs
                  ‘Dusty Bob’ makes a wonderful fac-simile of a squalid ‘<em>coster-monger</em>,’ a being made up of gin, rags, occasional starvation, and perpetual knavery” (“London
                  Chit-Chat” 334)(see figure 24).

               <p>Conversely, “the outline of fashionable life discovers more than is frequently known
                  of London, by those who are its residents from the cradle to the tomb” (“Advertisement”).
                  In each of these passages there’s a clear sense of what is known and what is unknown
                  and so where the play’s representational adequacy can or cannot be easily confirmed.
                  But, of course, the areas which are known are quite different: the writer for <em>Blackwood’s</em> seems to presume that filth and squalor are unusual sights for its readers, while
                  the author of the “Advertisement” in the Albany edition of Moncrieff has apparently
                  never set foot in Almack’s or Burlington Arcade. The different vantage points that
                  these writers exemplify, however, were brought nightly into extremely close contact
                  with one another: “upwards of one hundred nights” into the first season it was “yet
                  an affair of peril to squeeze your way into the pit” (“London Chit-Chat” 333) and
                  the theater was still “collect[ing] overflowing audiences” two seasons later (<em>The Drama</em> 5: 247). Such unavoidable proximity seems like it would almost have to have produced
                  a doubleness of perspective not wholly unlike that of Mrs. Arbuthnot: something like
                  “if I can assess the adequacy of this, but not that, and, judging by his appearance,
                  he can assess the adequacy of that, but not this, and yet here we all are jammed together
                  in ‘a very pretty theatre’ whose surroundings constitute a common ground that is pointedly
                  not being represented on stage, then perhaps the thing to do is simply to ‘attend’
                  Tom and Jerry’s ‘<em>larks</em> and rambles,’ to ‘witness [their] <em>sprees</em>, and encourage [their] endeavours’ without worrying overmuch about ‘the <em>fidelity</em> of its representation of London manners’.”

                  </div>If so, then it makes sense that the most “laughable” scenes—“the night row at Temple-bar,

                  (<em>The Drama</em> 2: 207)—were precisely those which most clearly raised the issue of adequacy, only
                  to immediately suspend it: Temple Bar was close enough for all to verify, while the
                  inner recesses of the Holy Land were inaccessible to almost everyone.

                  </div>Accordingly, one could either sit back and enjoy what the <em>Times</em> termed the play’s “ludicrous and tolerably faithful pictures” of “the characters and

                  Tom, Jerry, Logic, Kate, and Sue’s lives threw them or else one could set out on “nocturnal
                  ‘sprees’ ” of one’s own and it seems telling that the most popular sort of spree—“<em>milling the Charlies</em>”—was precisely that which was least place-specific and so most equally available
                  to all: there were charleys, and reports of pranks against them, all over town (

            <p> Fig. 25</p>
            <p>We could go on in this vein and think, for example, about why Egan’s own theatrical
               version, initially staged at Sadler’s Wells on 8 April 1822 and then transferred to
               the Olympic for a hundred and ninety-one night run, should have stripped out so much
               of the Covent Garden slumming and West End blood sports, only to turn around and close
               with an apparently unmotivated pony race at the “pugilistic Waterloo” of Moulsey Hurst
               in the far western suburbs (see figure 25 and figure 20 again). But I suspect my broader
               point has been made. Each of the plays offers a form through which its audiences could
               indulge in the representational uncertainties of “seeing Life,” but each does so differently,
               which no doubt fostered comparisons between the versions, particularly in the spring
               and summer of 1822 when there were so many simultaneous productions underway. A writer
               for <em>John Bull</em> imagines that the latter was simply a shrewd commercial move: “that which appears
               a silly opposition in producing the same piece at all these houses, will eventually
               turn out capitally; for now, instead of being contented with seeing one TOM and JERRY,
               the town will not be satisfied till they have seen them all; and as the last three
               months were spent in discussing the merits of the first, so the whole summer will
               be devoted to comparing notes, and qualifying for ‘Critic,’ upon the new editions
               of this very extraordinary performance” (14 April 1822). But such comparison would
               almost have to have redoubled and thereby rendered all the more tantalizing and delicious
               all the various questions of representational adequacy that each play had pursued
               individually. This, I’d like to suggest, offers a rare glimpse into just how “profoundly
               social” form can be: it’s not only that the forms of individual texts are shaped by
               forces both beyond their bounds and beyond their control, but also that the significance
               of those individual forms largely emerges from their perceived relations with one
               another. </p>

            <p>The pleasure one can take in, say, the Adelphi’s version of “seeing Life” is thus
               in no small part shaped by the pleasure one has taken—or hopes to take or has heard
               or imagined others have taken—in Davis’s version or the Olympic’s version or Sadler’s
               Wells’ version or any of the other versions on offer, including, of course, that of
               Egan and the Cruikshanks or the dramatically downmarket redaction offered by Catnach
               (see figure 26). Moreover, one doesn't need to have actually seen or read those other
               versions in order for them to have shaped the felt significance of the text at hand;
               one simply needs to have known of their existence, and in a craze like that for <em>Life in London</em>, it would have been hard to remain ignorant, when even the very ballad singers on
               the streets were reminding passers-by that “And since Life in London / Has been all
               the rage, / There’s nothing else now / That will do for the stage” (qtd. in Hindley

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The question that this all begs, of course, is why should <em>Life in London</em> have so taken off when it did, only to then become so retrospectively puzzling as
                  Thackeray’s generation moved into adulthood, given that most of its different components
                  had long been and would continue to be available? Pugilism and other blood sports,
                  “the city representing itself to itself” (During 342), young men from the West End
                  going into Covent Garden or beyond on nighttime “sprees” ... these had all been a
                  part of metropolitan life for decades or even centuries and didn’t magically disappear
                  with the coming of the railways.

                  </div>What was different in the early 1820s, though, was the status and reputation of London
                  itself. As James Chandler has reminded us, the years leading up to and surrounding
                  the mania for <em>Life in London</em> operated according to a particularly “hot chronology,” their “peculiar eventfulness”
                  making it seem as if things were changing almost day by day (3). In 1819 and the first
                  half of 1820, both the metropolis and the nation more generally seemed poised on the
                  brink of revolution: mass meetings of unprecedented size gathered in almost every
                  town and sometimes, as at “Peterloo,” were met with savage violence on the part of
                  the authorities; the Six Acts rendered the exercise of quite basic traditional rights
                  treasonous; radicals in Cato Street plotted to assassinate the Cabinet and the Prime
                  Minister; Lady Jerningham thought “the Queen’s bold return to England,” despite her
                  husband’s open animosity, had moved the “country ... nearer disaster than it has been
                  since the days of Charles I” (168), as crowds flooded the streets in open defiance
                  of the soon to be crowned George IV. And yet by the time that the first few parts
                  of <em>Life in London</em> were appearing, that had all melted away: Caroline was acquitted in mid-November (or
                  rather, the divorce case against her was abandoned) to widespread rejoicing, “the
                  anger that had sustained ... radical action ... in the regency years virtually evaporated”
                  (Gatrell 420), it was as if the end of the year belonged to a different “epoch” than
                  its beginning.

                           with itself as this country in November, 1819, and this country in February 1820"
                           (7). I suspect that if he had waited until Life in London was being serialized, the
                           distance between 1819 and 1820 would have seemed even greater.</span></div>
                  </div>And this transformation was at its most dramatic in London itself. From the dangerous
                  moment when “tens of thousands” of onlookers “booed and hissed” when the executioner
                  held up the “severed heads” of the Cato Street plotters (Laqueur 423) to November
                  1820, when <em>The European Magazine</em> could approvingly pronounce that Egan’s subject was “the world’s epitome; London!”
                  (rev. of <em>Life in London</em> 436), was, calendrically, only six months, but phenomenologically and emotionally
                  the two points were worlds apart.

               <p>Perhaps the single best emblem of this change was the so-called “Looking Glass Curtain”
                  which debuted at the Royal Coburg Theatre on 26 December 1820 (see figure 27). As
                  its name would suggest, this was a huge mirror (or rather, sixty-three mirrors set
                  together in a giant frame), which “reflected every form and face in that gorgeous
                  house, from the topmost seat in the galleries, to the lowest bench in the pit” (Fitzball

                  of a quite astonishing metropolitan self-regard and one to which much of the rest
                  of the Anglophone world twas apparently willing to accede. A writer in upstate New
                  York, for example, thought that Moncrieff’s play would “convince the ear and the eye
                  that London is the world in miniature, and possesses every thing from the acme of
                  splendor to the ne plus ultra of grossierté” (
                  “Advertisement”
                  ). Inevitably, however, such buoyant sentiments proved a bubble and “between 1825
                  and 1837 the mood of self-confidence, the devotion to urban values, and the pride
                  in London all came to an end” (Olsen 21).

            <p>Banks failed, building came to a halt, cholera arrived from the East, and perhaps
               most distressingly of all for the kind of “libidinal vitality” (During 344) that drove
               the mania for <em>Life in London</em>, “low life” was recast as “a terrain of anxiety and didactic moralization: in short,
               it became less and less funny” (Gatrell 547). What one 1825 engraver protested as
               <em>The Progress of Cant</em>, which features at its very center a funeral mute holding up a banner reading “No
               Life in London” (see <a class="_blank" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_28.jpg">figure 28</a>), rapidly became an unstemmable tide. Indeed, by the end of the decade, Egan had
               himself turned against his creations, killing off Tom, Logic, and Corinthian Kate
               in his <em>Finish</em>.</p>
            <p>“The Moment of Tom and Jerry,” I’d like to propose, was enabled by the peculiar “resonance”
               between the social forms we’ve been examining and this fleeting “epoch” of supreme

               metaphor, the “signal” of these forms was amplified by the “noise” of the early 1820s
               and so became audible in ways that would not have been possible either before or since.
               The result was that as the status and reputation of London changed, so too did that
               of <em>Life in London</em>. Tom and Jerry so encapsulated their moment that, once that moment had passed, they,
               like the Vauxhall which had provided them such “ample pleasures,” were left to constitute,
               at best, the puzzling memory of “a delightful perversion of the imagination” (Thackeray,
               
               “De Juventute”
               512).</p>

               volumes” lead “you ... to suppose that the English aristocracy of 1820 <em>did</em> dance and caper in that way, and box and drink at Tom Cribb’s and knock down watchmen;
               and the children of to-day, turning to their elders, may say, ‘Grandmamma, did you
               wear such a dress as that when you danced at Almack’s? There was very little of it,
               grandmamma. Did grandpapa kill many watchmen when he was a young man, and frequent
               thieves, gin-shops, cock-fights, and the ring before you married him? Did he use to
               talk the extraordinary slang and jargon which is printed in this book? He is very
               much changed. He seems a gentlemanly old boy enough now’” (rev. of <em>Pictures</em> 77, 78).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">The comparative lack of evidence here may in part be a function of the medium in which
               the Cruikshanks worked: “diary- or letter-writers referred ... seldom to prints” of
               any sort (Gatrell 213). Cf. Jacky Bratton’s discussion of how “very little unquestionably
               first-hand evidence” surrounds “entertainment beyond and outside the hegemonic realm
               of the [patent] theatres” (134).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">For a similar (and I think kindred) ambition to “unfold a reading” of a set of objects
               “from within a synchronic analysis of its production and use,” see Lovell 3. As she
               notes, “sets of objects, by the power of their reiteration, by the formulation and
               repetition of ... cues, tell us about shared expectations, and about ... literacies.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">There is no direct evidence of the size of any of the editions of <em>Life in London</em>, though it seems reasonably safe to presume that they were somewhere between the
               1,500 copies of the fairly ordinary <em>The Adventures of Johnny Newcombe in the Navy</em> (with sixteen plates by Rowlandson) which were produced in 1818 and the 7,000 copies
               of the highly sensational <em>Memoirs of Harriette Wilson</em>—with ten plates—which were produced in 1825 (St Clair 561, 657). Even the low end
               of this spectrum would have allowed the publishers to have “netted some thousands”
               from <em>Life in London</em> by March of 1822, when the book was in its third or fourth edition (
               “London Chit-Chat”
               333).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               <p>Fig. 9 William Makepeace Thackeray, 
                  “De Juventute,”

               <p>In 1840 Thackeray could only remember a scene “at Bob Logic’s chambers, where, if
                  we mistake not, ‘Corinthian Kate’ was at a cabinet piano, singing a song” (rev. of
                  <em>The Tower</em> 13), but twenty years later—and after he had finally tracked down a copy—that scene
                  had come to exemplify that “enjoyment of life ... which contrasts strangely with our
                  feelings of 1860”: (figure 9) “just look at it now (as I have copied it to the best
                  of my humble ability), and compare Master Logic’s countenance and attitude with the
                  splendid elegance of Tom!” (
                  “De Juventute”
                  510).</p></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">The prank of “boxing” or “flooring” “a charley” was not, of course, invented by Egan—Thomas
               Pitt, Lord Camelford, records such an adventure in 1803—but it supposedly spiked dramatically
               in the wake of <em>Life in London</em>. For Camelford’s lark, see Tolstoy 160.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">At two and a half (and then with the second edition, three) shillings a part, <em>Life in London</em> cost a minimum of thirty-three and a half shillings to purchase in its entirety,
               and for readers who didn’t get in on the action before the second edition, the total
               price for the parts would have been thirty-six shillings. By way of comparison, each
               of the contemporary Waverley novels sold for thirty-one and a half shillings, as did
               the authorized editions of the first two cantos of <em>Don Juan</em>. While these prices need not have prevented an eager reader of lesser means from
               gaining access to <em>Life in London</em> (there’s always borrowing or theft or reading in bookshops), they do suggest a probable
               demographic: these are luxury goods and so required a disposable income beyond the
               reach of most Britons. As for circulating libraries, <em>Life in London</em> appears in only one of the dozen catalogs surveyed by <em>British Fiction</em> (and Thackeray reported in 1840 that he had been “to no less than five circulating
               libraries in quest of the book” without success [rev. of <em>The Tower</em> 12]). Scott’s <em>Kenilworth</em> (another 1821 production), on the other hand, appears in all twelve and even Anna
               Maria Porter’s <em>The Village of Mariendorpt</em> was in eight of the libraries. I presume <em>Life in London</em> was a bit too raffish in its reputation to be included in what generally tried to
               position themselves as family-friendly establishments. Certainly that’s what <em>John Bull</em>’s insistence that “we do not know what feelings the generality of fathers of families
               may have upon such subjects, but for ourselves we would no more suffer a copy of the
               book ... to be seen in our house, than we would a copy of ‘LITTLE’s Poems,’ or ‘PAINE's
               <em>Age of Reason</em>’” would suggest (9 Dec. 1821).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">I’m struck by the similarity between how this craze unfolded and the ways in which
               “the prior path of collective claim-making” by ordinary Britons in this period “constrains
               its subsequent forms, influencing the very issues, actors, settings, and outcomes
               of popular struggle.... each shared effort to press claims lays down a settlement
               among parties to the transaction, a memory of the interaction, new information about
               the likely outcomes of different sorts of interactions, and a changed web of relations
               within and among the participating sets of people” (Tilly 37). I certainly wouldn’t
               want to claim that Tom and Jerry are “political” in any easy or obvious way, but I
               can’t help wondering if Tilly’s notion of “repertoires of collective action” (42)
               might help illuminate phenomena well beyond the realm of “popular contention.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
