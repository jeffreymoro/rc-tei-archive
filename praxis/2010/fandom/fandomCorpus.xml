            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">The early 1820s craze for Pierce Egan's and Robert and George
					Cruikshank's <title level="m">Life in London</title> has long seemed both deeply
					puzzling and yet somehow emblematic of its age. Brewer proposes that the mania
					becomes far more explicable if we focus, in a very precise way, on the interplay
					between serial publication, the so-called "illegitimate" theater, and the
					geography of London, especially insofar as those relations, in turn, line up
					with the peculiar and rapidly shifting reputation and mood of the metropolis in
					these years. By carefully mapping out <title level="m">Life in London</title>
					part by monthly part, and dramatic adaptation by dramatic adaptation, we can
					both recover the underlying aesthetics of the craze (which revolved around
					questions of the adequacy of representation) and further theorize what Franco
					Moretti has termed the "profoundly social aspect[s]" of form: the ways in which
					the forms of individual texts are not only shaped by forces beyond their bounds
					and beyond their control, but also how the significance of those individual
					forms largely emerges from their perceived relations with one another. In short,
					by slowing down and zeroing in upon the very particular qualities of "the Moment
					of Tom and Jerry," we can begin to think in new ways about how literature works
					in the world more generally.</p>

					mysteriously slipped out of my life after early adolescence). <lb/>The

						ACTUAL SURVEY IN THE YEARS 1824, 1825 &amp; 1826</title> (London, 1830).
					Courtesy of Motco Enterprises Limited.</p>
               <p>When William Makepeace
						Thackeray looked back at his youth, he was more than a little
					bewildered by the ways in which he’d gotten caught up in the single
					greatest cultural craze of his boyhood: the mania surrounding Pierce Egan’s <title level="m">Life in London; or, the Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, Esq., and
						his Elegant Friend Corinthian Tom, Accompanied by Bob Logic, the Oxonian, in
						their Rambles and Sprees through the Metropolis</title>. Thackeray readily
					granted that the illustrations which Robert and George
						Cruikshank had done for the book had not lost their appeal over the
					intervening decades: “the pictures!—oh! the pictures are noble
					still!” And he fondly reminisced about “what a funny fellow that
					actor was who performed Dicky Green in ... the play!” (<title level="a">De
						Juventute</title> 510). But “on reperusal, Tom and Jerry is not so
					brilliant as I had supposed it to be... the style of the writing ... was not
					pleasing to me; I even thought it a little vulgar ... and as a description of
					the sports and amusements of London in the ancient times,” <title level="m">Life in London</title> now seemed “more curious than
					amusing” (509-10). Even the typography had grown cryptic: “those
					inverted commas, those italics, those capitals” must have been “as
					good as jokes, though you mayn’t quite perceive the point” anymore
					(511). Indeed, twenty years earlier, Thackeray had been unable to remember “the
					literary contents of the book” at all: they had “passed sheer
					away,” even as the “scenes remain[ed] indelibly engraved upon the
					mind” (rev. of <title level="m">The Tower</title> 13). Yet despite his
					retrospective bafflement as to the attractions of Egan’s writing, Thackeray was
					nonetheless firmly convinced that <title level="m">Life in
					London</title>’s account of the larks of a fashionable young man (Tom),
					his country cousin (Jerry), and their friend Logic, a witty Oxford student,
					through the gamut of metropolitan life somehow embodied its age and so, more
					than any other touchstone from those years, could conjure up “the
					antediluvian world” before “railways were made,” when there
					was “an enjoyment of life ... which contrasts strangely with our
					feelings of 1860,” now that “every London man is weary and <foreign xml:lang="fr">blasé</foreign>” (<title level="a">De
						Juventute,</title> 505, 503, 510). <note place="foot" resp="editors">Cf. his claim a few years earlier that “the pictures and the writing
						of these queer volumes” lead “you ... to suppose that the
						English aristocracy of 1820 <emph>did</emph> dance and caper in that way,
						and box and drink at Tom Cribb’s and knock down watchmen; and the
						children of to-day, turning to their elders, may say, ‘Grandmamma, did
						you wear such a dress as that when you danced at Almack’s? There was
						very little of it, grandmamma. Did grandpapa kill many watchmen when he was
						a young man, and frequent thieves, gin-shops, cock-fights, and the ring
						before you married him? Did he use to talk the extraordinary slang and
						jargon which is printed in this book? He is very much changed. He seems a
						gentlemanly old boy enough now’” (rev. of <title level="m">Pictures</title> 77, 78).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Considered in isolation, Thackeray’s insistence upon the puzzling exemplarity of <title level="m">Life in London</title> might come off as simply the half-amused
					nostalgia of a middle-aged man: engaging, perhaps, but not necessarily all that
					revealing. However, Thackeray’s confusion seems to have been broadly shared with
					his contemporaries. Charles
						Mackay, for example, cited the time that “people went mad upon
					a dramatic subject, and nothing was to be heard of but ‘Tom and
					Jerry’” as one of the “Popular Follies in Great Cities”:
					“every youth on the town was seized with the fierce desire of
					distinguishing himself, by knocking down the
					‘<emph>charlies</emph>,’ being locked up all night in a watch-house,
					or kicking up a row among loose women and blackguard men in the low dens of St.
					Giles’s” (336-37). Further examples could be adduced, but the
					pattern seems clear: those old enough to remember the reign of George IV were
					retrospectively perplexed by the appeal of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title>, but utterly certain that that appeal, whatever it may have
					been, epitomized something important about the early 1820s, what R. S. Surtees would tellingly term
					“the old Tom-and-Jerry days, when fisticuffs were the fashion”
					(187).</p>
               <p>And so its popularity would suggest: Egan’s biographer records that “so great was the demand
					for copies of the numbers [in which <title level="m">Life in London</title> was
					originally published] that the printers ... could hardly keep pace with it, and
					whole armies of women and small boys, employed to colour the plates, were worked
					to exhaustion” (Reid 73). Before
					the initial serialization was even complete, the earlier parts were reprinted at
					a higher price, to be followed by at least five other editions before the end of
					the decade. <note place="foot" resp="editors">No bibliography exists for
							<title level="m">Life in London</title>. I base this estimate on a

					“went to see it in its dramatic shape” (rev. of <title level="m">The

					offered plays based upon <title level="m">Life in London</title> in the 1821-22
					and 1822-23 seasons.  Indeed, at several points in the spring and summer of
					1822 one could take in up to eight competing productions, the most popular of
						which—W. T.
					Moncrieff’s <title level="m">Tom and Jerry</title>—ran for an
					unprecedented three hundred nights:  “from the highest to the lowest,
					all classes were alike anxious to witness its representation; Dukes and Dustmen
					were equally interested in its performance, and Peers might be seen mobbing it
					with Apprentices to obtain an admission.  Seats were sold for weeks before
					they could be occupied.... In the furor of its popularity, persons have been
					known to travel post from the furthest parts of the kingdom to see it; and five
					guineas have been offered in an evening for a single seat” (Moncrieff 1826, v). <note place="foot" resp="editors">Tickets at the Adelphi normally ran one to four
						shillings, depending on where one sat.</note>Nor was this an exclusively
					London phenomenon: over the next few years, performances (usually of Moncrieff’s version) were
					staged in Birmingham, Bridgnorth, Brighton, Cheltenham, Dublin, Edinburgh,
					Glasgow, Hull, Lincoln, Liverpool, Newark, Newcastle, Redruth, Shrewsbury, and
					Southampton, not to mention the even more far flung theaters of Albany, Baltimore, Boston, Charleston,
					Montreal, New Orleans, New York,
						Philadelphia, York, Upper
					Canada, and even Sydney. Opportunistic booksellers quickly commissioned a range
					of imitations, including <title level="m">Life in St. George’s
						Fields</title>, <title level="m">Real Life in London</title>, and <title level="m">Female Life in London</title> (the latter was simply a reprint of
					Frances Burney’s <title level="m">Evelina</title>). The ballad publisher
					James Catnach offered several different broadside redactions, while countless
					cordials, dances, dinners, fans, games, handkerchiefs, porcelain figures,
					prints, screens, slang dictionaries, snuffboxes, song books, sweetmeats, tea
					boards, and toy theater sheets were produced for those who wished to include Tom
					and Jerry in their daily rituals. <note place="foot" resp="editors">For a
						rather bitter catalog of most of these items, see Egan, <title level="m">

					According to John Camden
						Hotten, “tailors, bootmakers, and hatters recommended nothing
					but Corinthian shapes and Tom and Jerry patterns” (10) and at least some
					of their recommendations carried all the way across the Atlantic: in Richmond,
					Virginia, the young Edgar Allen
						Poe singled out a romantic rival’s “Tom and Jerry brim /
					And dove-tailed coat, obtained at cost” for particular mockery (11).
					Clearly something about <title level="m">Life in London</title> resonated with a
					broad cross-section of the reading, theatrical, and consumer publics of the
					early 1820s.</p>
               <p>Yet what that something was seems to have already become semi-incomprehensible by
					the 1840s and that incomprehensibility only increased as the century wore on
					until even the foremost chronicler of the craze was forced to confess that
					“although Life in London ... did make our grandfathers so
						very—<emph>very</emph>! merry in the first quarter of the Nineteenth
					Century, we are constrained to admit; that it is a terrible dull and tedious
					work to read through in the present day.” Indeed, “the present
					generation will find in some of the scenes depicted in such glowing colours,
					many of the fashions, manners, and customs, which prevailed in the reign of King
					George the Fourth, together with certain landmarks of the past, which no one
					need regret leaving far behind, and ought to give every encouragement to those
					who live under the rule of Queen Victoria to maintain a firm faith in the social
					progress of the age” (Hindley ii-iii, iv). Whatever significance <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> still had lay in what Hotten termed “its value as a true picture of
					life fifty years ago”: “the last days of coarse caricatures, of
					dueling, and of the glorious three-bottle system after dinner” (9).

               </p>
               <p>Most of the extant scholarship on Egan and the Cruikshanks has simply
					replicated this pattern of being convinced that the success of <title level="m">Life in London</title> was somehow emblematic of its age (the 
					Cruikshank prints have been
					used to illustrate dozens of books on the Regency and reign of George IV), yet
					finding it incredibly difficult to specify what its appeal might have been,
					other than as a vague—and generally unconvincing—adumbration of
					another, supposedly more readily comprehensible phenomenon like <title level="m">The Pickwick Papers</title> or the flâneur or Bakhtinian
					heteroglossia. Even the best critics (who recognize that <title level="m">Life
						in London</title> was “a summation of the passing culture ..., not a
					foretaste of the new” and so really shouldn’t be folded into the
						<foreign xml:lang="fr">longue durée</foreign> of Victorianism) seem to
					be unable to explain the sheer magnitude of the craze: why such “low-life
					fantasies” should have gone supernova in the first half of the 1820s,
					rather than simply faded away (Gatrell 552, 555). <note place="foot" resp="editors">For a
						similar complaint (and a different, but not wholly incompatible, attempt to
						solve this problem), see Dart.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Clearly this is a problem for the history of reading and theatergoing and
					ordinarily I would turn to the letters, diaries, and marginalia of Egan’s contemporaries in order
					to try to reconstruct how <title level="m">Life in London</title> might actually
					have been read and watched. Alas, such evidence seems to be more than usually
					scarce in this case and that which I have found—such as John Clare’s suggestion that
						Byron’s <title level="m">Don Juan</title> “seems a fit partner for Tom &amp;
					Jerry” (34) or Harriet
						Arbuthnot’s dismay at how the audience at a performance of
						Moncrieff’s version
					“seemed to enjoy a representation of scenes in which, from their
					appearance, one might infer they frequently shared” (144)—come off,
					at least initially, as even more idiosyncratic or blinkered than such traces
					generally are. <note place="foot" resp="editors">The comparative lack of
						evidence here may in part be a function of the medium in which the Cruikshanks worked:
						“diary- or letter-writers referred ... seldom to prints” of any
						sort (Gatrell 213). Cf. Jacky Bratton’s
						discussion of how “very little unquestionably first-hand
						evidence” surrounds “entertainment beyond and outside the
						hegemonic realm of the [patent] theatres” (134).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Rather than throw up my hands at the absence of our customary tools, however, I
					decided to try something of a methodological experiment. Intrigued by Franco Moretti’s assertion
					that “the most profoundly social aspect of literature is its form” (
						<title level="a">Preface</title> xii) and suspecting that the difficulty
					which previous scholars had had in explaining the appeal of <title level="m">Life in London</title> stemmed at least in part from the temporal breadth
					of their inquiries—the nineteenth-century novel, the eighteenth-century
					“urban odyssey,” late Georgian urban pleasure, even simply
					“Regency London” (which
					still takes in a full decade)—I decided to map out, Moretti-like, <title level="m">Life in London</title> part by monthly part, and then dramatic adaptation
					by dramatic adaptation, in order to see if those maps could reveal anything more
					specific to the early 1820s about the appeal of these texts to readers and
					playgoers. My hope was that by figuring out how these texts unfolded both
					temporally and spatially and how that unfolding was in turn related to the
					probable time and place of their reading or viewing, I could discern something
					about the “social aspect” of their form which was otherwise
					unavailable for scrutiny. In so doing, I fondly imagined, I might finally be
					able to devise a way to combine a proper consideration of form with the history
					of reading and theatergoing—a consummation which I, at least, have long
					devoutly wished. <note place="foot" resp="editors">For a similar (and I
						think kindred) ambition to “unfold a reading” of a set of
						objects “from within a synchronic analysis of its production and
						use,” see Lovell
						3. As she notes, “sets of objects, by the power of their reiteration,
						by the formulation and repetition of ... cues, tell us about shared
						expectations, and about ... literacies.”</note>
               </p>
               <p>The results of my mapping <title level="m">Life in London</title> were a
					revelation and immediately illuminated a number of puzzles which the other
					scholarship I had read had been unable to solve to my satisfaction. The patterns
					which emerged from this mapping (and, I think, their significance) were then
					confirmed by the maps which I made of the most successful dramatic adaptations
					and by what evidence exists regarding the reactions of early readers and
					playgoers. Put most baldly, the formal elements which best explain the mania
					spawned by <title level="m">Life in London</title> come from those parts of the
					book which appeared before the narrative, such as it is, ever got going.
					Accordingly, any attempt to account for the power of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> by theorizing how its narrative works is almost automatically
					going to lead us astray: quite simply, it would be looking in the wrong place.
					Whatever <title level="m">Life in London</title> may be, it’s not
					ultimately a nineteenth-century novel in which plot and the fate of emplotted
					characters are the fundamental sources of interest and power.</p>
               <p>So what did I find when I did my mapping? First let me highlight a small, but
					extremely telling detail, one which can serve as a key to unlock the
					significance of what the maps reveal: a note headed “SECOND EDITION, JAN.
					8, 1821,” which Egan added to
					retract his playful banter in the first edition with Friedrich Christian Accum,
					now that the latter had been caught tearing leaves out of a library book at the
					Royal Institution. <note place="foot" resp="editors">
						Egan, <title level="m">Life in
							London</title> 2nd ed. 9n. All subsequent quotations from <title level="m">Life in London</title> will be from the first
					edition.</note>Accum’s misplaced zeal for knowledge (in an age before
					photocopying, he wanted to take an article on chocolate home with him)
					doesn’t matter for our purposes. But Egan’s mention of a second edition in early January 1821 is
					huge, since producing such entailed reprinting and again hand-coloring both the
					text and the plates for the already extent Parts One through Five of <title level="m">Life in London</title> and raising the price of those reprinted
					parts and all of the remaining installments from two-and-a-half shillings apiece
					to three. Bibliographers and collectors of the Cruikshanks have long known
					of this second edition and would readily concede how unprecedented it was. Quite
					simply, illustrated books at this price point had never sold so quickly as to
					necessitate more than a single edition while the original serialization was
					still underway. Even <title level="m">The Tour of Doctor Syntax</title>, which
					largely created the market for such books, didn’t go into a second edition
					until its initial appearance in <title level="j">The Poetical Magazine</title>
					was complete. <note place="foot" resp="editors">There is no direct
						evidence of the size of any of the editions of <title level="m">Life in
							London</title>, though it seems reasonably safe to presume that they
						were somewhere between the 1,500 copies of the fairly ordinary <title level="m">The Adventures of Johnny Newcombe in the Navy</title> (with
						sixteen plates by Rowlandson) which were produced in 1818 and the 7,000
						copies of the highly sensational <title level="m">Memoirs of Harriette
							Wilson</title>—with ten plates—which were produced in 1825
							(St Clair 561, 657).
						Even the low end of this spectrum would have allowed the publishers to have
						“netted some thousands” from <title level="m">Life in
							London</title> by March of 1822, when the book was in its third or
						fourth edition (<title level="a">London Chit-Chat</title> 333).</note>
					However, no one has apparently ever thought through the significance of what
					this second edition reveals: namely, that <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> was astonishingly successful by a few days after the release
					of Part Five. Yet, if we look at what has happened in the text to that point, we
					get almost nothing by our usual novelistic standards. Those first five parts are
					comprised almost exclusively of an extended pitch for the importance of
					“seeing Life,” along with character sketches of Logic, Tom, and
					Jerry. The first episode remotely close to actual narrative (certainly the first
					event which the Cruikshanks deem worthy of
					illustration) is only half finished by the close of Part Five—just a week
					before the second edition. Prior to that, nothing happens. Or, to be precise,
					none of the events which figure in the illustrations or Victorian memory have
					yet occurred by that point in the text (a good forty-two percent of the way in).

               <p>On the other hand, readers had already gotten fifteen plates (three in
					each part), including many of the ones which would go on to be the most iconic:
					say, “Tom Getting the Best of a Charley” (figure 1) which was adapted for various downmarket
					redactions of the text (figure 2), taken up as a general visual joke (figure 3), and transfer-printed onto a handkerchief to

                  <lb/>
                  <lb/> In the first four parts of the
					text, as I’ve just suggested, there’s almost nothing in terms of
					narrative, and what little there is in Part Five hardly involves much in the way
					of “rambles and sprees”: Jerry begins to get fitted for new clothes
					at Tom’s elegant house in the West End. With the plates, on the other
					hand, our heroes travel all over the West End and Covent Garden, indulging
					themselves in various sorts of sports, gambling, slumming, and other larks,
					including dalliances with both their mistresses and the prostitutes who haunt
					the theater. What possible sense can this disparity make? Even if the narrative
					existed only to flesh out the plates (as was sometimes charged to be the case by
					later partisans of the Cruikshanks) and so
					necessarily had to lag behind, surely a practiced journalist like Egan wouldn’t have needed three
					whole months to get to the action.</p>
               <p>Unless, of course, getting to the action wasn’t really the point. I’d
					like to propose that this disparity between the text and plates, far from being
					either irrelevant or a clumsy bit of throat-clearing on Egan’s part while he figured out what to do, can
					actually go quite far toward explaining the astonishing appeal of those early
					parts of <title level="m">Life in London</title>, whose success brought the text
					to “the tipping point” where it could cross over into a full-scale
					sensation (after which the usual feedback loops of commercial success and
					“extraordinary popular delusions” could kick in). <note place="foot" resp="editors">As my phrasing should suggest, my thinking about
						the dynamics of cultural markets has been shaped by Gladwell and by the work and
						conversation of Moretti.</note>So let’s turn to those early parts and consider
					how their seemingly mismatched text and plates might actually have worked
					together.</p>
               <p>The first thing to notice is how sustained and (in its own way) systematic a
					pitch for its own aesthetics we are offered. According to Egan, <quote rendition="#indent2">the
						grand object of this work is an attempt to portray what is termed
						‘SEEING LIFE’ in all its various bearings upon society, from the
							<emph>high-mettled</emph> CORINTHIAN of St. James’s,
							<emph>swaddled</emph> in luxury, down to the <emph>needy</emph>
						FLUE-FAKER of Wapping, <emph>born without a shirt</emph>, and not a
							<emph>bit of scran</emph> in his cup to allay his piteous cravings.
						‘LIFE IN LONDON’ is the sport in view, and provided the chase is
						turned to a good account, ‘<emph>seeing Life</emph>’ will be
						found to have its advantages ... whether an evening is spent over a bottle
						of champaign, at <emph>Long’s</emph>, or in taking a
							‘<emph>third of a daffy</emph>’ at <emph>Tom
							Belchers’s</emph>... Equally so, in <emph>waltzing</emph> with the
							<emph>angelics</emph> at my <emph>Lady</emph> FUBB’S assembly, at
						Almack’s, or <emph>sporting a toe</emph> at Mrs. SNOOK’S
							<emph>hop</emph> at St. Kit’s, among the pretty <emph>straw</emph>
						damsels and dashing chippers, if a <emph>knowledge</emph> of
						‘Life,’ an acquaintance with <emph>character</emph>, and the
						importance of <emph>comparison</emph>, are the ultimate results. (24) <note place="foot" resp="editors">The first two sentences in this
							passage also appeared in the prospectus to potential subscribers put out
							by Egan’s publishers
							a few weeks before the appearance of Parts One and Two (Hindley
						xii).</note>
                  </quote>
                  <lb/> “Seeing life” thus seems to involve
					appreciating both the marked social and geographic variety of the metropolis and
					the underlying similarity of pleasures which yokes such variety together into a
					coherent, if pointedly not unified vision of “Life in London.” For
					those able to relish it, “a <emph>blow out</emph> may likewise be found as
						<emph>savory</emph> and as <emph>high scented</emph> at Mother
					O’Shaughnessy’s, in the <emph>back settlements</emph> of the
						<emph>Holy Land</emph>, by the hungry <emph>cut-away</emph> Paddy Mulroony,
					as the <emph>Mulligatawny soup</emph> may be swallowed with peculiar
						<emph>goût</emph> by one of the fastidious, squeamish, screwed-up
					descendants of the OGILBY train at Grillion’s hotel” (26-27). Or, to
					put it differently, as Egan clearly
					delights in doing, “hundreds of individuals in the Metropolis think it no
					loss of time, and feel as much interest in matching their <emph>tykes</emph> at
					JEM ROLFE’S amphitheatre for a <emph>quid</emph> or two; or in drawing the
					badger at HARLEQUIN BILLY’S menagerie, and boasting of the goodness and
					breed of their dogs, as MY Lord CARE-FOR-NOTHING does in relating the pedigree
					of his high-mettled cattle, and talking with the <emph>touters</emph> and
					jockeys at Newmarket” (34). Once one comprehends “the advantages
					resulting from the <emph>varieties</emph> of ‘LIFE’” (29), one
					can supposedly acquire a sort of universal comfort akin to that of Tom, who
					“was as much at home in blowing a cloud, listening to a night-row charge
					at a watch-house, as he proved himself an adept in all the luxuriant, voluptuous
					movements, when waltzing at Almack’s (42).</p>
               <p>I quote so extensively in order to demonstrate the ways in which Egan’s style enacts the very
					aesthetics he’s championing: like life in London itself by Egan’s account, <title level="m">Life in London</title>
					jumbles together seemingly disparate kinds of people, sorts of places, and
					perhaps above all varieties of language (and typography) in order to bring out
					their putative underlying similarity and the advantages of learning to be
					comfortable amidst them all. If “half of the world are <emph>up</emph>
					to” “the <emph>slang</emph>” he introduces, “it is my
					intention to make the other half <emph>down</emph> to it. LIFE IN LONDON demands
					this sort of demonstration. A kind of <emph>cant</emph> phraseology is current
					from one end of the Metropolis to the other” and so needs to be replicated
					in order to properly render “real Life” (84-85n) and so equip his
					readers with the tools to emulate his hero, Richard Brinsley Sheridan: “a
					man at all times, whether viewed at dashing routs, surrounded by the most
					accomplished beauties; or <emph>caught</emph> upon the <emph>sly</emph>, peeping
					at midnight revels in the precincts of Covent Garden” (16). Those beauties
					might talk “of ‘a <emph>row</emph>’ which occurred
					... last evening,” while the Covent Garden revelers would allude to a
						“<emph>lark</emph>... at a gin-spinner’s,” but, for Egan, slang was “as strongly
					marked” (84-85n) in St. James’s as it was in St. Giles and it was
					only from “the knowledge and experience” of both that one might
					attain “complete possession” (75) of one’s self.</p>
               <p>Of course, inevitably, there will be a gap between any representation and its
					object and Egan not only knows
					this, but highlights it again and again as a source of potential pleasure. Early
					on, he insists upon the adequacy of his representations: he’s offering
					“his readers a <foreign xml:lang="la">Camera Obscura</foreign> View”
					through which <quote rendition="#indent2">LIFE IN LONDON will be seen without
						any fear or apprehension of danger either from <emph>fire</emph> or
							<emph>water</emph>; avoiding also breaking a limb, receiving a
							<emph>black eye</emph>, losing a pocket-book, and getting into a
						watch-house; picking up a <emph>Cyprian</emph> and being exposed the next
						morning before a magistrate for being found <emph>disorderly</emph>.
						Likewise in steering clear of all those innumerable rows and troubles
						incident or allied to ‘keeping it up, and loving of fun.’ It
						would have been fortunate indeed for poor JERRY and CORINTHIAN TOM if they
						had possessed such advantages. But ‘experience makes fools
						wise,’ and as good-natured HAWTHORN and laughing TOM are now about to
						relate their <emph>adventures</emph>, for the benefit of
							<emph>fire-side</emph> heroes and sprightly maidens, who may feel a wish
						to ‘see Life’ without receiving a <emph>scratch</emph>, it must
						be considered that the Metropolis is now before them. (19)</quote>
                  <lb/> Tom
					and Jerry are thus, it would seem, perfectly up to the job of “seeing
					Life” on behalf of these “<emph>fire-side</emph> heroes and
					sprightly maidens,” who need not go out, Adam and Eve-like, into the
					metropolis “now before them” in order to “benefit” from
					it. Rather they can simply sit back and appreciate the splendor of its variety:
					after all, “POUSSIN never had a more luxuriant, variegated, and
					interesting subject for a landscape; nor had SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS finer portraits
					for his canvass than what have already had a sitting for their likenesses to
					embellish LIFE IN LONDON” (17). Yet only three months later, as the text
					was on the verge of finally plunging into those “adventures,” these
					same heroes and maidens got to witness Tom telling Jerry that “volumes
					would not suffice to portray the various characters which <emph>cross our
						path</emph> DAILY <emph>in</emph>
					LONDON. A <emph>theoretical</emph>
					inquiry will not go far enough in ascertaining the real features of society in
					the <emph>Metropolis</emph>. You are now on the <emph>primest</emph> SPOT in all
					the world.... I would, therefore, advise you to make the best use of your time.
					I have seen a great deal of LIFE myself; but I have a great deal yet to
						<emph>see!</emph>” (143). If even Tom has “a great deal yet to
						<emph>see</emph>” and “a <emph>theoretical</emph> inquiry”
					will not suffice, then it would seem that representation of the sort which Egan is offering up will not
					ultimately prove sufficient: those heroes and maidens would have to leave their
					firesides and risk injury or embarrassment if they wished to actually “see
					Life.” Yet this insistence upon the inadequacy of representation
					doesn’t simply supercede or cancel out the previous claims of adequacy.
					Rather, the two seem to coexist, albeit uneasily:  a relationship nicely
					encapsulated by the sheer repetition of phrases like “such is the
					diversity of LIFE IN LONDON” (30) or “it is a <foreign xml:lang="la">multum in parvo</foreign> trait of <title level="a">Life in London</title>
					” (139n), the ambiguity of whose reference—the book?  the
					city?  both?—at once collapses and maintains the distinction between
						Egan’s text and the
					metropolis itself.</p>
               <p>I dwell on these questions of the adequacy of representation—which, I
					think, are repeated so insistently as to be nearly inescapable, even for rather
					distractible readers, as most of the early adopters of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> probably were—because they help to explain the workings
					of the plates in these early parts and how their interaction with these
					questions helped bring this book to the tipping point. For one thing, the plates
					themselves supposedly share the text’s paradoxical blend of strict mimesis
					and adherence to artistic convention. In the note on slang I quoted earlier,
						Egan goes on to suggest that
					“my ingenious friends, ROBERT and GEORGE CRUIKSHANK, whose talents in
					representing ‘the living manners as they rise,’ stand unrivalled in
					this peculiar line, feel as strongly impressed with the value of
						<emph>delicacy</emph> as I do. But if some of the plates should appear
					rather <emph>warm</emph>, the purchasers of Life in London may feel assured,
					that nothing is added to them tending to <emph>excite</emph>, but, on the
					contrary, they have most anxiously, on all occasions given the preference rather
					to ‘<emph>extenuate</emph>’ than to ‘set down aught in
					malice.’ All the Plates are the exact representations, as they occurred,
					of the various classes of society” (85n). And while it would probably be
					impossible to determine whether any particular image has been extenuated or
					exactly represented (or somehow both at once), the plates do stylistically bear
					out this odd betwixt and betweeness. <figure>

               <p>	On one hand, they offer what seem (on the basis of other evidence we

               <p>A similar variation can be seen in a plate from Part Six (which
					appeared a few weeks after the tipping point, but the note “TO THE
					SUBSCRIBERS” from “THE AUTHOR IN DISTRESS!” inserted to
					explain the brevity of Part Five had hinted at this scene): in one copy Tom and Jerry’s punches in “a street
					Row” are landing hard enough to draw blood, in another they’re not. Obviously these variations undercut the
					sustainability of any claim to catch “‘the living manners as they
					rise.’” Were these scenes wholly mimetic, then surely one of these
					copies would have to be wrong: at the moment represented, Sue’s breasts
					were either covered or uncovered, just as Tom’s fist did or did not smash
					his opponent’s nose. But the very impossibility (and ridiculousness) of
					even trying to ascertain the truth here only underscores what I think is the
					broader project of these plates within the aesthetics of representational
					adequacy and inadequacy that I’ve been sketching out.</p>
               <p>If the point of the text of the first five parts of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> is to learn how to “see Life,” then the plates in
					those parts are offering up specimens of “Life” to be seen. That is,
					they are offering the promise of narrativity. They aren’t yet narrative
					(we don’t know how our heroes got into these situations, nor what will
					come next, nor even in what sequence these various episodes will occur and
					whether or not that sequence is significant). Rather, they’re a sign that
					“the Rambles and Sprees through the Metropolis” which the wrappers
					of each part promise are, in fact, on the way, that at some point soon we will
					learn what was involved in Tom’s “accommodat[ing] himself, as much
					as possible, to the dispositions of the company in which he might be
					situated” (110). But given the uncertainty of how adequate these plates
					ultimately are as representations, I’d like to suggest that the
					anticipated narrativity of “seeing Life” is, dare I say it, always
					already divided. <figure>

               <p>	“<emph>Fire-side</emph> heroes and sprightly maidens”
					couldn’t be sure if the breasts of fashionable cyprians were routinely
					bared during private performances of what Egan later termed “the elegant but <emph>lascivious</emph>
					waltz” (196), any more than they could be sure that coffee shops near the
					Olympic Theatre routinely degenerated into late night comic riots (see figure 12). But they also couldn’t be sure that
					they didn’t ... unless they went out to see for themselves.</p>
               <p>“Seeing Life” can thus go in two quite different directions: one
					could wait to “see” the episodes depicted in the plates as they
					eventually unfolded (in the months after the tipping point of the second
					edition). Or one could go out into the metropolis in pursuit of what one hoped
					would be similar adventures. Both solutions seem to have been engaged in. On the
					one hand, in a note on the wrappers for Part Four, Egan let his “Subscribers” know that
					“in consequence of several applications having been made to the Publishers
					respecting the EXPLANATIONS OF THE PLATES, it is necessary to observe, that they
					are merely given ... to keep the plates <emph>alive</emph>; but the
						<emph>subjects</emph> of them will be more minutely described, <emph>in
						their proper place</emph> in the body of the work,” which would
					suggest a certain readerly impatience for the plates’ promise of
					narrativity to be fulfilled. On the other hand, though, as Roger Sales has pointed out, readers
					are “given enough information to plan their own rambles” (161) and
					over the next few years the press would repeatedly claim that they were doing
					just that with a vengeance: by one report, there were “nineteen watchmen
					prostrate with their boxes on their backs” in April 1822 alone (<title level="a">Annus Mirabilis!</title> 23). <note place="foot" resp="editors">The prank of “boxing” or “flooring”
						“a charley” was not, of course, invented by Egan—Thomas Pitt, Lord
						Camelford, records such an adventure in 1803—but it supposedly spiked
						dramatically in the wake of <title level="m">Life in London</title>. For
						Camelford’s lark, see Tolstoy 160.</note>Similarly, in December of that year three
					“dashing young gentlemen” were charged “with making a
						‘<emph>Tom-Jerry-and-Logic</emph>’ row, after midnight, near St.
					Thomas’s Hospital” in Southwark. Among other things, they were
					“crying ‘Go it, Jerry!’—‘Go it,
					Tom!’—‘Go it, Logic!’ &amp;c. One of them said
					‘now we’ll floor the d—d Charley.’ They then ran with
					great force against his watch-box, and endeavoured to upset it, so as to inclose
					him inside of it.” An alderman said “not a night elapsed but that in
					some part of the town the peace was broken by young thoughtless fellows apeing
					‘Tom, Jerry, and Logic’” (<title level="j">Glasgow
						Herald</title>, presumably reprinting an item from an unidentified London paper).</p>
               <p>Obviously these particular accounts postdate the specific months in late 1820 and
					early 1821 we’ve been examining—and attribute these pranks to
					“the Tom and Jerry fever extending to all the minor theatres”
						(<title level="a">Annus Mirabilis!</title> 23)—but I see no reason to
					presume that some sort of readerly sprees were not already being undertaken
					during the serialization of the first five parts. Certainly the geography of
					those early parts, along with the apparently intended readership and the
					peculiar temporality of serial reading, solicits such excursions—if only
					to ascertain the adequacy or inadequacy of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title>’s representation. Consider the spatial distribution of
					the places depicted in the plates of the first five numbers.<lb/>

               </p>
               <p>Six are in the fashionable West End (Tom’s apartment, the Westminster Pit,
					Corinthian Kate’s apartment, Rotten Row, Jackson’s rooms in Bond
					Street, and a game of whist played near St. James’s park). The other nine,
					however, are in the rather more socially varied area surrounding Covent Garden
					(Temple Bar, a coffee shop near the Olympic Theatre, a watchhouse near Bow
					Street, the English Opera House, Covent Garden Theatre, Bow Street itself, a
					fortune teller’s house near Russell Street, a gin shop near Covent Garden
					Theatre, and the tavern run by the retired boxing champion, Tom Cribb, near the
					Haymarket). And even if a reader didn’t know exactly where a specific
					place was located, the two areas of town are quite visually and thematically
					distinct from one another and so it would have been easy enough to figure out
					the approximate neighborhood in question. West of Regent Street we get fine
					clothing and sports and gambling and high-end courtesans like Corinthian Kate
					and Sue. East of Regent Street we get larks and their consequences, slumming,
					masquerade, various sorts of drinking, and a more ordinary species of
					prostitute. To some extent, of course, such a spatial division of London was nothing new—even if the
					construction of Regent Street had significantly bolstered it by “damming
					up Soho” (Summerson 125).
					But I suspect the division was particularly resonant for the target public for
						<title level="m">Life in London</title>, which, given the fairly steep price
					of the book (and its apparent absence from most circulating libraries), probably
					constituted a good chunk of its actual readership. <note place="foot" resp="editors">At two and a half (and then with the second edition, three)
						shillings a part, <title level="m">Life in London</title> cost a minimum of
						thirty-three and a half shillings to purchase in its entirety, and for
						readers who didn’t get in on the action before the second edition, the
						total price for the parts would have been thirty-six shillings. By way of
						comparison, each of the contemporary Waverley novels sold for thirty-one and
						a half shillings, as did the authorized editions of the first two cantos of
							<title level="m">Don Juan</title>. While these prices need not have
						prevented an eager reader of lesser means from gaining access to <title level="m">Life in London</title> (there’s always borrowing or
						theft or reading in bookshops), they do suggest a probable demographic:
						these are luxury goods and so required a disposable income beyond the reach
						of most Britons. As for circulating libraries, <title level="m">Life in
							London</title> appears in only one of the dozen catalogs surveyed by
							<title level="m">British Fiction</title> (and Thackeray
						reported in 1840 that he had been “to no less than five circulating
						libraries in quest of the book” without success [rev. of <title level="m">The Tower</title> 12]). Scott’s <title level="m">Kenilworth</title> (another 1821 production), on the other hand,
						appears in all twelve and even Anna Maria Porter’s <title level="m">The Village of Mariendorpt</title> was in eight of the libraries. I
						presume <title level="m">Life in London</title> was a bit too raffish in its
						reputation to be included in what generally tried to position themselves as
						family-friendly establishments. Certainly that’s what <title level="j">John Bull</title>’s insistence that “we do not know what
						feelings the generality of fathers of families may have upon such subjects,
						but for ourselves we would no more suffer a copy of the book ... to be seen
						in our house, than we would a copy of ‘LITTLE’s Poems,’ or
						‘PAINE's <title level="m">Age of Reason</title>’” would
						suggest (9 Dec. 1821).</note>In his lengthy invocation, Egan singles out three businesses
					which he hopes will help make <title level="m">Life in London</title> a success:
					the bookshops of Henry Colburn and John Murray and the printshop of George
					Humphrey. Colburn will, Egan
					wishes, inform “those dashing belles and beaux, whose morning lounge gives
					thy repository of the mind an air of fashion, that LIFE IN LONDON is worthy of
					their perusal,” while Murray, whose “splendid threshold”
					frightens away the “pale, wan, and <emph>shabbily</emph> clad,” will
					“take the unsophisticated JERRY HAWTHORN by the hand” and
					“introduce him to thy numerous acquaintance.” And if Humphrey will
					allot “only one little pane of glass in thy attractive shop-front ... for
					the display of CORINTHIAN TOM, ... he may be viewed quite ‘at
					home’ in St. James’s Street” (8). As these invocations should
					suggest, these are the most fashionable purveyors of print in the metropolis
					and, I think tellingly, they’re all located in the neighborhood in which
					Tom, Jerry, and Logic reside. Obviously this need not mean that all of the early
					readers of <title level="m">Life in London</title> either patronized those shops
					or lived in that neighborhood, but it seems probable that if they didn’t,
					they thought themselves in the minority (i.e., they presumed that most of the
					other “<emph>fire-side</emph> heroes and sprightly maidens” being
					addressed were one and the same with the “dashing belles and beaux”
					who lounged into Colburn’s).</p>
               <p>Why should this sort of speculative sociology of readers matter? <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/fandom/brewer/images/figure_13.jpg">Compare the locations of these shops with the geography of the plates in

					If I’m correct in my presumptions, then most of the early
					readers were living and lounging on the other side of Regent Street from the
					majority of the promised narrativity. Moreover, the intensity of that felt
					separation from the anticipated “rambles and sprees” would have been
					magnified, perhaps exponentially, by the seriality of part publication. As Thomas Arnold would note twenty
					years later, “works of amusement ... published periodically”
					“occupy the mind” longer than works published all at once and so
					“keep alive” a “constant ... expectation,”
					“thus dwelling upon the mind, and distilling themselves into it as it were
					drop by drop” until they “possess it so largely, colouring even, in
					many instances, its very language, and affording frequent matter for
					discussion” (39). It doesn’t take anywhere close to a month to read
					a thirty-two-page octavo pamphlet and its printed wrapper, nor to look at three
					plates. Yet the readers whose demand took <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> to the tipping point had to wait at least that long to get
					the next part and if they were drawn in by any of the promised narrativity,
					their wait could be considerably longer before that promise was fulfilled. As my
					maps should suggest, the sprees depicted in the plates of the double installment
					of October 1820 did not begin to be narrated until at least January 1821 and in
					most cases, February or March or even, in the case of “Tom Getting the
					Best of a Charley,” April of that year. In the meantime, readers had to go
					about their own lives in London,
					either musing on the adequacy of Egan’s account of the “rambles and sprees” which
					lay on the other side of Regent Street or else setting out on their own such
					adventures—which might or might not accord with the account Egan eventually provides. Either way,
					though, the effect would be a complex entanglement of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> with life in London such that the aesthetics of “seeing
					Life” and the questions of representational adequacy which they pose would
					almost have to have become phenomenologically central to those readers’
					lives. Like the realisms described by D. A.
						Miller, although presumably without quite the same disciplinary
					force, this interpenetration would “ensure that the novel is always
					centrally about the world to which one will be recalled and that the world to
					which one will be recalled has been reduced to attesting the truth (or
					falsehood) of the novel” (83). Hence, it’s not so much that
					“the sprawling, rambling form of <title level="m">Life in London</title>
					... reproduc[es] the form of the city itself” (Sales 156) as that the form of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> solicits and shapes a particular way of “seeing
					Life” which then becomes wholly intertwined with the “Life” to
					be seen, both in the text and plates to come and in the city itself.</p>
               <p>Thus far I’ve been dwelling upon the very beginnings of the craze for
						<title level="m">Life in London</title>, what took the phenomenon to the
					tipping point of an unprecedented second edition and price increase while the
					initial serialization was still underway. But most of the mania postdates this
					second edition: the assorted reprints of <title level="m">Life in London</title>
					as a stand-alone volume, the various theatrical versions, the Catnach broadsides
					and other opportunistic redactions, the consumer goods ... these are all part of
					later 1821 or 1822 or 1823. Why spend so much time on the readers of these early
					parts, whose total numbers must have been dwarfed by those who got swept up in
					the craze after early January 1821? The answer, I’d like to propose, is
					that the rest of the phenomenon largely plays out according to the parameters
					set by these first few parts and their early adopters. This is not to say that
					nothing changes, of course, but the subsequent parts of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> itself, the theatrical versions, and all of the other
					evidence that I’ve been able to uncover all suggest that they were working
					within the same aesthetics of “seeing Life” and the same questions
					of representational adequacy that we’ve been reconstructing. <note place="foot" resp="editors">I’m struck by the similarity between how
						this craze unfolded and the ways in which “the prior path of
						collective claim-making” by ordinary Britons in this period
						“constrains its subsequent forms, influencing the very issues, actors,
						settings, and outcomes of popular struggle.... each shared effort to press
						claims lays down a settlement among parties to the transaction, a memory of
						the interaction, new information about the likely outcomes of different

						Jerry are “political” in any easy or obvious way, but I
						can’t help wondering if Tilly’s notion of “repertoires of collective
						action” (42) might help illuminate phenomena well beyond the realm of
						“popular contention.”</note>
               </p>
               <p>Consider, for example, the ways in which Egan and the Cruikshanks continued to
					solicit readerly curiosity as to the adequacy of their representations. We are
					repeatedly told, in the parts published after the tipping point, that we can
					place our trust in the reliability of their depictions: the scene at
					Jackson’s Rooms “is most accurately represented” (216), and so
					can serve as as much of a surrogate for the rooms themselves as the scene at
					Cribb’s Parlour, even though Jackson’s “is not common to the
					public eye.... no person can be admitted without an introduction”
					(217), while Cribb’s “can be seen at all times, and, therefore ...
					may be <emph>identified</emph> when any person thinks proper” (220). Yet
					we are also told that scenes like that of the ginshop near Covent Garden
					“may be nightly witnessed after the SPELL is dissolved: but in much more
					depraved colours than is here represented” (180) and that “neither
					the PEN nor the PENCIL, however directed by talent, can do ... adequate
					justice” to “the Morning of Execution” at Newgate “or
					convey a description of the ‘<emph>harrowed feelings</emph>’ of the
					few spectators that are admitted into the Condemned Yard upon such an
					occasion” (280-81). And even when the promised narrativity finally began
					to arrive, more often than not it was a bit coy and still inclined to toy with
					the temporality of serial reading. So, for example, in the long-anticipated
					account of “Tom Getting the best of a Charley” (see again figure one) we are explicitly told that the women on Jerry’s
					arms were, as most readers probably already suspected, “a couple of
					Cyprians” (232) who, after the prank, and “in the most
						<emph>tender</emph> and persuasive manner, ... endeavoured to
						<emph>gammon</emph> JERRY and the CORINTHIAN up <emph>Shire-Lane</emph> to a
					place of <emph>safety</emph>, as they termed it” (233). Tom declined the
					invitation to their house, but we are pointedly not informed whether they made
					alternate arrangements: “it is quite immaterial how our heroes eluded the
					pursuit of the <emph>Charleys</emph>, or in what manner they spent the remainder
					of the night; they were out on a ‘<emph>spree</emph>,’ and were
					determined to finish it. They were not immaculate,” although whatever
					transpired couldn’t have been too dire, as “LOGIC found his
					companions” at home and “in a ‘whole skin’ ... the
					next morning” (233). <figure>

               <p>Similarly, in the scene at All-Max (an East End dive whose nickname
					puns on “max,” a slang term for gin, and
					“Almack’s,” the exclusive West End assembly rooms) (see figure 14), the text for Part Nine concludes before we
					can learn what will come of Logic’s dalliance with the local women.
					Inquiring minds had either to wait a month to discover what Logic was doing in
					“the ‘<emph>Fields of Temptation</emph>,’ by which he was
					surrounded” (289)—and even then he coyly avoids the questioning of
					his friends as to specifics—or else they had to set out for Wapping in the
					hope of a reenactment. The reverse situation obtains in Part Eleven when our
					heroes visit Vauxhall where, Logic tells Jerry, “if <emph>enjoyment</emph>
					is your <emph>motto</emph>, you may make the most of an evening ... more than at
					any other place in the Metropolis” (335). Yet after the trio has listened
					to music, admired the paintings, had a bite to eat, “join[ed] the merry
					dance,” and watched Logic knock down a dandy with a single blow, Bob
						“<emph>reeled</emph> off” and “as upon former occasions,
					was not to be found” (338), though Tom suspected that he had
					“los[t]” his “way in the <emph>dark walks</emph>”
					frequented by prostitutes (339). None of this, however, was represented in any
					of the plates in that part. Would-be viewers of the scene had wait for the final
					installment (two weeks later) (figure 15) or else see whether their own attempts to
					“enjoy ... themselves to the utmost extent in all the variety” the
					Gardens “afforded” (338) could shed sufficient light on the
					Oxonian’s fate.</p>
               <p>The one significant departure of the post-tipping point parts and, of course, of
					the subsequent single-volume editions which allowed for a more varied
					temporality of reading—including the skimming and skipping studied by
						Leah Price—is the way in
					which they build in Jerry as a sort of proxy for the readers and viewers of
						<title level="m">Life in London</title>. Like them, Jerry is learning to
					“see Life” under the tutelage of Tom and Logic and so his progress
					is implicitly positioned as somehow parallel to their own. As “he bid fair
					... to become as <emph>prime</emph> an article” as his tutors “in
					being at home to ‘a peg’ in all their various SPREES and
					RAMBLES” (171), so too, the suggestion seems to go, could Egan and the Cruikshanks’ readers
					acquire a universal comfort.

               <p>	Similarly, if Jerry can learn to appreciate how moving “from
					ALL-MAX in the East to ALMACKS in the West” (see again figure 14 and figure 16) is “almost like the rapid succession of
					scenes in a play, which will tend highly to increase the effect” and make
					“the contrast ... delightful,” then surely the
						“<emph>fire-side</emph> heroes and sprightly maidens” watching
					over his shoulder could relish similarly “good opportunit[ies] for
					observation” (291), even if they couldn’t gain admission to either
					place. But, of course, the adequacy of these representations and so of
					Jerry’s abilities to serve as our proxy are always half in question. A

               <p>While as a book <title level="m">Life in London</title> was enough of a sensation
					for its publishers to have allegedly “netted some thousands by it”
					by 11 March 1822, what turned the phenomenon all the way up to eleven and helped
					ensure its place in the collective memory of Thackeray’s
					generation were the assorted theatrical versions, the most successful of
						which—&gt;W. T.
					Moncrieff’s <title level="m">Tom and Jerry</title>—supposedly
					earned “the proprietors of the Adelphi theatre,” where it was
					staged, twelve thousand pounds by that same point in the spring of 1822
					(“London Chit-Chat” 333, 334). Indeed, Moncrieff later estimated that they
					“cleared” “not ... less, from first to last, than <emph>Twenty
						five Thousand Pounds</emph> by it” (Moncrieff 1828, vii). <note place="foot" resp="editors">A rather disapproving Thomas Carlyle noted the previous year that
							“<emph>no</emph> play had ever enjoyed such currency on the
						English Stage as this most classic performance” (314).</note>Like the
					post-tipping point parts of <title level="m">Life in London</title>, the various
					plays are all devoted to working out the aesthetics of “seeing Life”
					and its accompanying questions of representational adequacy. Accordingly,
					I’d like to suggest, the theatrical versions can help test and confirm the
					ways in which the forms we’re dealing with were “social” and
					so are of explanatory value when we’re trying to figure out what drove
					this craze. Before I sketch out the workings of the most prominent of these
					plays, however, it’s worth noting that they were all staged at the
					so-called “illegitimate” or minor theaters, the status and
					characteristics of which amplified a number of aspects of their form. First of
					all, for many playgoers, the illegitimate theaters were on the side of liberty
					and fun and modernity, against the perceived stodginess and perhaps worse of the
					patent theaters, which “had come to be identified as the cultural
					synecdoche of a corrupt political state” (Moody 74). Part of that reputation stemmed from the
					shameless, Polonius-like generic mixture of the plays which they staged (in
					order to get around the legal prohibition on the minor theaters offering
					“legitimate”—i.e., primarily spoken—drama, they would
					add all sorts of spectacle and music to their productions). As evidence of just
					how far these mixtures could go, consider only the playbills for three of the
					most popular theatrical versions of <title level="m">Life in London</title>: at
					Davis’s Royal Amphitheatre, one could take in “an entirely New,
					Whimsical, Local, Melo-Dramatic, Pantomimical Equestrian Drama,” while
					Sadler’s Wells offered a “New Pedestrian, Equestrian, and Operatic
					Extravaganza ... of Gaiety, Frisk, Lark, and Patter” and <name ref="#MoncrieffWT" type="person">Moncrieff</name>’s version at the
					Adelphi was billed as “an entirely new Classic, Comic, Operatic, Didactic,
					Aristophanic, Localic, Analytic, Panoramic, Camera-Obscura-ic, Extravaganza
					Burletta of Fun, Frolic, Fashion, and Flash ... Replete with prime Chaunts, rum
					Glees, and Kiddy Catches” (qtd. in Hindley 4, 85, 8). Another part of the reputation of
					the minor theaters derived from the sheer “visual magnificence”
						(Moody 151) of the playhouses
					themselves, which was often at odds with their somewhat dodgy or unfashionable
					locations. <figure>

					Compare, for example, where the various versions of <title level="m">Life in London</title> were staged with where the action of the Cruikshank
					plates was located. (see  figure 18 and  figure 19) Close to half of the scenes depicted in
						<title level="m">Life in London</title> (many of which transferred over to
					the plays) were set in the West End, while nothing other than our heroes’
					outing to Vauxhall involved crossing the Thames. Yet three of the theaters were
					on the south side of the river and another three were out on the north edge of
					town (far beyond anywhere Tom and Jerry bother to go). Only the Olympic, the
					Adelphi, and (as a somewhat special case) the East London were actually in the
					same neighborhoods as the “rambles and sprees” they were
					representing. Yet all of their buildings were every bit as opulent, if not more,
					than the patent theaters of Covent Garden and Drury Lane where Tom and Jerry
					were shown consorting with prostitutes and actresses showing their legs.
					Collectively, I’d like to suggest, these different aspects of the
					“illegitimate” theaters’ reputation helped to further crank up
					the aesthetics of “seeing Life” by linking that pursuit to the
					pleasurable disjunctions of minor theatergoing more generally. That is, the
					questions of representational adequacy which the plays took up from Egan and the Cruikshanks became, if
					anything, all the more pointed when posed in a setting so clearly devoted to
					(and renowned for) dramatizing the mimetic gap between life on stage—where
					people burst into song, cross-dressed, and rode horses indoors—and the
					more quotidian existence outside the theater, with the pleasure-seeking audience
					in an opulent and liminal space between the two.</p>
               <p>The first of the theatrical versions of <title level="m">Life in London</title>
					nicely exemplifies the uses to which this gap could be put. On 17 September
					1821, William
					Barrymore’s <title level="m">Tom and Jerry, or, Life in
						London</title> debuted at Davis’s Royal Amphitheatre (better known to
					most theater historians as Astley’s) and was their chief offering for at
					least the next three seasons. As its subtitle suggests, this play took the
					“popular Production, which has lately engrossed the attention of all
					London” and turned it into “an entirely new Whimsical, Local,
					Melo-Dramatic, Pantomimical Equestrian Drama.” There’s nothing all
					that surprising about such a transformation: equestrian shows were the specialty
					of the house and so audiences were treated to a “scene of <emph>Epsom
						Races</emph>” which “exhibits post-chaises, gigs, tilburys,
					caravans, hackney-coaches, carts, and four-in-hand barouches, all drawn by real
					horses ... concluding with a grand race between seven ‘<emph>Bits of
						Blood!</emph>’ on extensive platforms taking the whole width” of
					the theater (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 360). <note place="foot" resp="editors">A playbill for the 21 May 1822 performance

               <p>For a similar scene from Egan’s own theatrical version at Sadler’s Wells, which
					nicely brings out the sheer oddity of the spectacle, see figure twenty. More tellingly for our purposes, however, the usual
					sporting or martial or orientalist fare for which Davis’s was known here
					gets offset by some decidedly metropolitan scenes. For example, there’s
					what the reviewer just quoted describes as “the <emph>exterior of the
						Opera House</emph>, with all the horrors of a rainy night,” which
					involves Kate and Sue being cheated by one hackney cab driver as they depart for
					Almack’s and Tom, Jerry, and Logic playing a prank on another (they get
					in, tell him where they’re going, and get out the other door), as rain
					begins to fall on stage. Similarly, the scenes in Jackson’s Rooms and
					Cribb’s Parlour not only had “the <emph>Clown</emph> prove
					... himself a ‘<emph>hard hitter</emph>,’ by sending
						<emph>Harlequin</emph> clean through the wainscot,” but also offered
					live performances by “Cribb and Spring,” “stripped half naked,
					boxing each other round the platform” to the supposed offense of
					“female modesty” (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 4: 306). Such
					spectacles were, of course, readily witnessed in the metropolis, as were
					“views of <emph>Tattersal’s</emph>... and Temple Bar, by
					moonlight” (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 1: 306). But they were
					witnessed across the river in rather different parts of town and, for the most
					part, not by the “genteel people, with their children and servants”
					who “had long ... frequented” this theater (Moody 171). <note place="foot" resp="editors">A
						reviewer for <title level="j">The Drama</title> refers to an analogous
						production at the Royal Coburg as "a very excellent portraiture of
							'<emph>things as they are</emph>' on the other side of the water" (2:
						306).</note>

						Fig. 21 </p>
               <p>Literally, then, there was a significant spatial divide between the
					space of seeing and the space of the seen (see figure 21). Audience members were the Westminster or
					Waterloo bridge away from any of the action being represented. Yet that divide
					was repeatedly and spectacularly “bridged” by the sight of these
					different parts of London right there on stage in all their equestrian or
					pugilistic or simply drenched glory. The result, I’d like to suggest, was
					a highlighting of the same sort of simultaneous adequacy and inadequacy of
					representation that we’ve been tracing in Egan and the Cruikshanks. On one hand,
					what’s on stage is clearly not “Life” of the sort one is
					supposed to be seeing: the “street row” Tom and Jerry get into after
					boxing a charley poses absolutely no danger to any of the spectators. Yet on the
					other hand, there are actual coaches on stage, a “half naked” Cribb
					is boxing around, and the handsomely dressed dancers in the scene at
					Almack’s do a quadrille, lancers, and “2 Cast Figures” (28).
					How much closer to “Life” can one get? And once again this
					doubleness is encapsulated in the talismanic phrase of the title: when at the
					close Logic sings “then masquerade it now away, we ne’er shall wish
					the fun done, / That is, should you be pleased to say, you like our Life in
					London” (40), does that refer simply to what the audience has just
					witnessed or more broadly to what the play supposedly stands in for? Either way,
					it was enough to induce “Mr. Astley to keep his theatre open near a
					fortnight later than his usual period of closing” and to yield three
					hundred eighty pounds for Barrymore at his first benefit (“thirty pounds more than upon
					any previous occasion”), but I suspect that that success stemmed in no
					small part from how “that <emph>reality</emph> which ... attach[es] itself
					to the scenes and incidents” came off as delightfully partial: both
					mimetic and quite ostentatiously in violation of mimesis. <note place="foot" resp="editors">

               </p>
               <p>A rather different configuration of these same elements seems to have driven the
					next theatrical version to be offered: Charles Dibdin’s <title level="m">Life in London; or, the
						Larks of Logic, Tom, and Jerry, An Extravaganza ... Founded on Pierce Egan’s Highly
						Popular Work</title>, which opened at the Olympic Theatre on 12 November
					1821 and ran one hundred ninety-one nights. Here, rather than keeping a clear,
					if bridgeable distance between the theater and the putative location of the
					action on stage, the play repeatedly threatens to collapse the two. This is
					particularly evident in a scene set in an unspecified, but Olympic-like theater
					in which Tom and Jerry check out a “pretty girl” so
					“new” that even Tom doesn’t “know her” and then
					briefly debate the ethics of “intrud[ing] upon the Engagement of another
					gentleman” (i.e., soliciting a prostitute already with a client). <note place="foot" resp="editors">Most of these lines do not appear in the
						published version of the play, but were in the manuscript submitted to the
						Licenser and so were mostly likely part of the staged version (Larpent ms
						2257, qtd. in Bratton 162).</note>The girl’s accomplices then pick a
					fight with our heroes and Jerry plunges in: “Oh, there’s a row! I
					must be in that, because it’s Life in London” (11). As we know from
					the plate of “Tom &amp; Jerry in the Saloon at Covent Garden” (see
					again (figure 4), prostitutes routinely worked the lobbies and
					boxes of the theaters, and pickpockets and conmen would regularly instigate
					“rows” in order to gain an advantage over their marks. So it might
					seem as if Dibdin’s play
					is operating uncomfortably close to home, putting on stage what was probably
					already being more casually performed in and around the theater. <figure>

					Fig. 22</p>
               <p>	And the rest of the geography of the play could support such an
					impression: the majority of the action and all of the “larks” are
					set within a five minute walk of the theater, in and around Temple Bar (see figure 22). One can easily imagine that there were some
					post-theater attempts to steal a charley’s box or to crash a cockney party
					(as Tom, Jerry, and Logic do). But as with our other texts, that implicit
					invitation to compare the “Life” on stage with that surrounding it
					is counterbalanced by various moments which call attention to the patent
					theatricality (and so presumed difference) of what the actors were doing. Hence
					the brawl in the lobby turns into a song whose chorus is “sure never row
					was so monstrously uproarious, / This is Life in London, how d’ye like the
					go?” (13). Similarly, the chorus of the finale asks the audience
					“your plaudits of patronage kindly then give, / And let Life in London, in
					London, long live; / For features of fancy howe’er we pursue, / No
					fancy’s true fancy not fancied by you” (40). As with Barrymore’s version, this
					begs the question of what it would mean to “let Life in London, in London,
					long live.” Simply return frequently to the Olympic for more of this
						“<emph>extravaganza of fun, frolic, and whim</emph>” (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 51)? Routinely engage in actual rows? And
					what would happen if a real-life counterpart to Jerry presumed that a member of
					“the fancy” wasn’t “true fancy” since he
					didn’t accord with his own “fancy”? Would he be able to
					conclude with the stage Jerry that “Life in London’s nothing without
					adventures” (29)? Again, either way, the play clearly worked and was
					“repeated every evening to overflowing audiences of the most fashionable
					description” (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 206), despite, or
					perhaps because of, what Jane Moody
					terms the theater’s rather “insalubrious location”
					(31)—remember only the midnight scene at a nearby coffee shop (see again figure 12). <note place="foot" resp="editors">Ironically, Dibdin’s
						play was the only theatrical version of <title level="m">Life in

               <p>The third theatrical version to be staged, that by Moncrieff, which debuted at the Adelphi on 26 November
					1821, offered yet another arrangement of the devices through which these

					Fig. 23</p>
               <p>Rather than opening up or dramatically collapsing the gap between the
					space of the seer and the seen (as Barrymore and Dibdin
					had done), Moncrieff largely
					replicated the spatial distribution of Egan and the Cruikshanks’ <title level="m">Life in London</title> (see figure 23 and figure 19 again) There were fewer sites, of course,
					because of time constraints and the demands of staging, but with two intriguing
					exceptions, Moncrieff’s
					version offers the same basic array of activities in most of the same places
					(although for some reason he relocates Kate and Sue’s visit to a
					fortuneteller from St. Giles to St. George’s Fields). The two exceptions,
					though, are extremely revealing. First, Moncrieff omits the spaces associated with prostitution by Egan and the Cruikshanks: Kate’s
					apartment and the theaters. Secondly, he cuts out or relocates all the
					opportunities for sprees and their consequences near Covent Garden (the coffee
					and gin shops and Bow Street simply disappear; the watchhouse gets moved east of
					Temple Bar), so that such activities now take place in distinctly different
					neighborhoods than that of the theater. One could try to account for these cuts
					by suggesting that they’re an attempt to raise the moral tone of <title level="m">Life in London</title> or to provide a <foreign xml:lang="fr">cordon sanitaire</foreign> between the space of viewing and the viewed. But
					then it would be rather difficult to explain why Moncrieff invents a plot in which Kate and Sue (who are
					no longer cyprians, but simply the sweethearts of Tom and Jerry) follow their
					loves all over London, posing as dancers at Almack’s, gamblers in a
					“fashionable hell,” beggars in the Holy Land of St. Giles, and
					perhaps most discordantly of all, if the aim was to clean up <title level="m">Life in London</title>, “two young bucks” who accost the wife
					of a cit and kiss her—lest anyone miss the point, Logic leeringly observes
					a minute or two later how “very well” the object of their affection
					“must look in” breeches like the ones being worn by Kate and Sue (
						Moncrieff 1828, 37, 43).
					Similarly, any theory along the <foreign xml:lang="fr">cordon
						sanitaire</foreign> lines would rapidly run afoul of what was apparently one
					of the real attractions of the Adelphi’s production: namely, its portrayal
					of actual street celebrities like Andrew “Little Jemmy” Whiston, a
					paraplegic beggar who propelled himself about in a little cart, or Billy Waters,
					the one-legged African fiddler and “King of the Beggars.” What sense
					would it make to bring such figures on stage if the aim was to keep the
					“low” at bay?</p>
               <p>
					Moncrieff’s cuts become
					significantly more comprehensible, though, if we consider them in conjunction
					with the very Egan-like claims of
					the Adelphi’s early advertising. According to one playbill, this was
					“an animated picture of every species of Life in London, deprived, through
					the filtering stone of the Proprietor’s critical care, of all that might
					disgust or offend even the most fastidious Imagination.” Yet less than
					twelve weeks later, the play was being offered as “a series of pungent and
					minutely accurate Representations of HIGH and LOW LIFE.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">Playbills for 6 December 1821 and 25 February
						1822 (qtd. in Bratton 163).</note>Similarly, the whole piece was a ballad
					opera, with new words to familiar tunes and so was likely to conjure up a quite
					complicated array of memories of previous theatergoing (to <title level="m">The
						Beggar’s Opera</title>, to <title level="m">The Benevolent
					Tar</title>, to <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>), even as it featured
					“Twenty New Scenes, Painted from Drawings taken on the spot” and
					“the Publishers of the various Maps and Guides through London” were
					rather cheekily, if “respectfully informed, that this Piece does not
					supersede the Necessity of their various Publications” as they “may
					still be useful in refreshing the Memory of the Spectators, after the Conclusion
					of the Adelphi season” (Moncrieff, <title level="m">Songs</title> tp, v). <note place="foot" resp="editors">For a discussion of the interplay between the
						new and old words and the music, see Shepherd 181-87.</note>So, it would
					seem that, as with <title level="m">Life in London</title> itself, <title level="m">Tom and Jerry</title> is somehow both filtered and minutely
					accurate, representationally inadequate and yet up to the task. Unlike Egan and the Cruikshanks’ version,
					however, Moncrieff’s play
					drew a quite socially—and therefore geographically—varied audience:
					dukes and dustmen, peers and apprentices, the first member of the royal family
					ever to visit a minor theater (Frederick, Duke of York) and “the
					people” whose “appearance” made Harriet Arbuthnot turn up her nose. Indeed, in the
					closing address to the 1821-22 season, the actor who played Tom called explicit
					attention to the “overflowing audiences” the Adelphi had attracted,
					“comprising a galaxy of the brightest stars of the West, and a
						<emph>maximum</emph> of the primest natives of the East” (qtd. in
						<title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 311). What’s missing in all this
					socio-geographic language, of course, is the middle, both of the social
					order—there are apparently no counterparts in the audience to Jemmy Green,
					the cockney dandy of the play—and of the metropolis itself. This absence,
					I think, helps reveal the significance of Moncrieff’s geography. Put simply, Covent Garden has been
					emptied out (except for a few sporting destinations like Cribb’s Parlour,
					which gets replicated on stage with the exhibition of the champion’s
					“ORIGINAL CUP” [Moncrieff, <title level="m">Songs</title> iv]) in order to make all
					these questions of representational adequacy depend upon the origins of the
					audience, rather than on the location of the theater. That is, by preserving
						Egan and the Cruikshanks’ spatial
					distribution (except for the area around the Adelphi) and then soliciting,
					incredibly successfully, an audience from both West and East, Moncrieff was able to transfer the
					felt site of viewing from the playhouse in the Strand to wherever the individual
					audience members came from. Accordingly, “the scene of ‘All Max in
					the East,’ is well worth seeing by any one who does not mind contemplating
					filth, and profligacy, and vagabond merriment. The man who performs ‘Dusty
					Bob’ makes a wonderful fac-simile of a squalid
						‘<emph>coster-monger</emph>,’ a being made up of gin, rags,
					occasional starvation, and perpetual knavery” (“London
					Chit-Chat” 334)(see figure 24). <figure>

               <p>Conversely, “the outline of fashionable life discovers more than
					is frequently known of London, by those who are its residents from the cradle to
					the tomb” (“Advertisement”). In each of these passages
					there’s a clear sense of what is known and what is unknown and so where
					the play’s representational adequacy can or cannot be easily confirmed.
					But, of course, the areas which are known are quite different: the writer for
						<title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> seems to presume that filth and
					squalor are unusual sights for its readers, while the author of the
					“Advertisement” in the Albany edition of Moncrieff has apparently never set foot in
					Almack’s or Burlington Arcade. The different vantage points that these
					writers exemplify, however, were brought nightly into extremely close contact
					with one another: “upwards of one hundred nights” into the first
					season it was “yet an affair of peril to squeeze your way into the
					pit” (“London Chit-Chat” 333) and the theater was still
					“collect[ing] overflowing audiences” two seasons later (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 5: 247). Such unavoidable proximity seems like
					it would almost have to have produced a doubleness of perspective not wholly
					unlike that of Mrs.
					Arbuthnot: something like “if I can assess the adequacy of this,
					but not that, and, judging by his appearance, he can assess the adequacy of
					that, but not this, and yet here we all are jammed together in ‘a very
					pretty theatre’ whose surroundings constitute a common ground that is
					pointedly not being represented on stage, then perhaps the thing to do is simply
					to ‘attend’ Tom and Jerry’s ‘<emph>larks</emph> and
					rambles,’ to ‘witness [their] <emph>sprees</emph>, and encourage
					[their] endeavours’ without worrying overmuch about ‘the
						<emph>fidelity</emph> of its representation of London manners’.”
						<note place="foot" resp="editors">Arbuthnot 144; <title level="j">The
							Drama</title> 2: 311; an unidentified reviewer of 13 Oct. 1822, qtd. in
						Moody 156.</note>If so, then it makes sense that the most
					“laughable” scenes—“the night row at Temple-bar, and ...
					the meeting of all the celebrated beggars and ballad singers of the
					metropolis” (<title level="j">The Drama</title> 2: 207)—were
					precisely those which most clearly raised the issue of adequacy, only to
					immediately suspend it: Temple Bar was close enough for all to verify, while the
					inner recesses of the Holy Land were inaccessible to almost everyone. <note place="foot" resp="editors">The same exact scenes were singled out by
						Henry Crabb Robinson as particularly "pleasant": "there is a capital row and
						fight among Watchmen—a meeting of beggars etc etc"
					(98).</note>Accordingly, one could either sit back and enjoy what the <title level="j">Times</title> termed the play’s “ludicrous and
					tolerably faithful pictures” of “the characters and customs of the
					different classes of society” into “which the irregular
					habits” of Tom, Jerry, Logic, Kate, and Sue’s lives threw them or
					else one could set out on “nocturnal ‘sprees’ ” of
					one’s own and it seems telling that the most popular sort of
						spree—“<emph>milling the Charlies</emph>”—was
					precisely that which was least place-specific and so most equally available to
					all: there were charleys, and reports of pranks against them, all over town
						(<title level="a">London Chit-Chat</title> 334).</p>

					Fig. 25</p>
               <p>We could go on in this vein and think, for example, about why Egan’s own theatrical version,
					initially staged at Sadler’s Wells on 8 April 1822 and then transferred to
					the Olympic for a hundred and ninety-one night run, should have stripped out so
					much of the Covent Garden slumming and West End blood sports, only to turn
					around and close with an apparently unmotivated pony race at the
					“pugilistic Waterloo” of Moulsey Hurst in the far western suburbs
					(see  figure 25 and figure 20 again). But I suspect my broader point has
					been made. Each of the plays offers a form through which its audiences could
					indulge in the representational uncertainties of “seeing Life,” but
					each does so differently, which no doubt fostered comparisons between the
					versions, particularly in the spring and summer of 1822 when there were so many
					simultaneous productions underway. A writer for <title level="j">John
						Bull</title> imagines that the latter was simply a shrewd commercial move:
					“that which appears a silly opposition in producing the same piece at all
					these houses, will eventually turn out capitally; for now, instead of being
					contented with seeing one TOM and JERRY, the town will not be satisfied till
					they have seen them all; and as the last three months were spent in discussing
					the merits of the first, so the whole summer will be devoted to comparing notes,
					and qualifying for ‘Critic,’ upon the new editions of this very
					extraordinary performance” (14 April 1822). But such comparison would
					almost have to have redoubled and thereby rendered all the more tantalizing and
					delicious all the various questions of representational adequacy that each play
					had pursued individually. This, I’d like to suggest, offers a rare glimpse
					into just how “profoundly social” form can be: it’s not only
					that the forms of individual texts are shaped by forces both beyond their bounds
					and beyond their control, but also that the significance of those individual
					forms largely emerges from their perceived relations with one another. <figure>

               <p>	The pleasure one can take in, say, the Adelphi’s version of
					“seeing Life” is thus in no small part shaped by the pleasure one
					has taken—or hopes to take or has heard or imagined others have
					taken—in Davis’s version or the Olympic’s version or
					Sadler’s Wells’ version or any of the other versions on offer,
					including, of course, that of Egan
					and the Cruikshanks or the
					dramatically downmarket redaction offered by Catnach (see figure 26). Moreover, one doesn't need to have actually
					seen or read those other versions in order for them to have shaped the felt
					significance of the text at hand; one simply needs to have known of their
					existence, and in a craze like that for <title level="m">Life in London</title>,
					it would have been hard to remain ignorant, when even the very ballad singers on
					the streets were reminding passers-by that “And since Life in London / Has
					been all the rage, / There’s nothing else now / That will do for the
					stage” (qtd. in Hindley
					120).</p>
               <p>The question that this all begs, of course, is why should <title level="m">Life
						in London</title> have so taken off when it did, only to then become so
					retrospectively puzzling as Thackeray’s generation moved into adulthood,
					given that most of its different components had long been and would continue to
					be available? Pugilism and other blood sports, “the city representing
					itself to itself” (During
					342), young men from the West End going into Covent Garden or beyond on
					nighttime “sprees” ... these had all been a part of metropolitan
					life for decades or even centuries and didn’t magically disappear with the
					coming of the railways. <note place="foot" resp="editors">For various
						versions of this <foreign xml:lang="fr">longue durée</foreign> of urban
						pleasure, see Corfield, During, Gatrell, and Sen.</note>What was different
					in the early 1820s, though, was the status and reputation of London itself. As
						James Chandler has reminded
					us, the years leading up to and surrounding the mania for <title level="m">Life
						in London</title> operated according to a particularly “hot
					chronology,” their “peculiar eventfulness” making it seem as
					if things were changing almost day by day (3). In 1819 and the first half of
					1820, both the metropolis and the nation more generally seemed poised on the
					brink of revolution: mass meetings of unprecedented size gathered in almost
					every town and sometimes, as at “Peterloo,” were met with savage
					violence on the part of the authorities; the Six Acts rendered the exercise of
					quite basic traditional rights treasonous; radicals in Cato Street plotted to
					assassinate the Cabinet and the Prime Minister; Lady Jerningham thought
					“the Queen’s bold return to England,” despite her
					husband’s open animosity, had moved the “country ... nearer
					disaster than it has been since the days of Charles I” (168), as crowds
					flooded the streets in open defiance of the soon to be crowned George IV. And
					yet by the time that the first few parts of <title level="m">Life in
						London</title> were appearing, that had all melted away: Caroline was
					acquitted in mid-November (or rather, the divorce case against her was
					abandoned) to widespread rejoicing, “the anger that had sustained ...
					radical action ... in the regency years virtually evaporated” (Gatrell 420), it was as if the end of
					the year belonged to a different “epoch” than its beginning. <note place="foot" resp="editors">In a speech that March, George Canning
						had asked, rhetorically, "whether any country, in any two epochs, however
						distant, of its history, ever presented such a contrast with itself as this
						country in November, 1819, and this country in February 1820" (7). I suspect
						that if he had waited until <title level="m">Life in London</title> was
						being serialized, the distance between 1819 and 1820 would have seemed even
						greater.</note>And this transformation was at its most dramatic in London
					itself. From the dangerous moment when “tens of thousands” of
					onlookers “booed and hissed” when the executioner held up the
					“severed heads” of the Cato Street plotters (Laqueur 423) to November 1820,
					when <title level="j">The European Magazine</title> could approvingly pronounce
					that Egan’s subject was
					“the world’s epitome; London!” (rev. of <title level="m">Life
						in London</title> 436), was, calendrically, only six months, but
					phenomenologically and emotionally the two points were worlds apart.

               <p>Perhaps the single best emblem of this change was the so-called
					“Looking Glass Curtain” which debuted at the Royal Coburg Theatre on
					26 December 1820 (see figure 27). As its name would suggest, this was a huge
					mirror (or rather, sixty-three mirrors set together in a giant frame), which
					“reflected every form and face in that gorgeous house, from the topmost
					seat in the galleries, to the lowest bench in the pit” (Fitzball v-vi) and which was in
					itself apparently enough both to “fill all the places” and to arouse
					the envy of the other minor theaters (Dibdin 20). <note place="foot" resp="editors">Cf. the address
						spoken at the opening of Sadler’s Wells in April 1822, which tried to
						distinguish their offerings by insisting that they had “no curtain
						made of glass, at great expense; / Be ours the task to drive reflection
						hence” (qtd. in Egan, <title level="m">Songs</title> 7).</note> The
					sheer attitudinal shift necessary for the Royal Coburg’s venture to have
					been a success, the newfound capacity to take pleasure in seeing oneself as part
					of a socially varied <foreign xml:lang="fr">tableau vivant</foreign>, when only
					a year previous the denizens of the galleries were thought to be preparing
					themselves to slaughter many of the habitués of the pit ... this marks the
					advent of a quite astonishing metropolitan self-regard and one to which much of
					the rest of the Anglophone world twas apparently willing to accede. A writer in
					upstate New York, for example,
					thought that Moncrieff’s
					play would “convince the ear and the eye that London is the world in
					miniature, and possesses every thing from the acme of splendor to the ne plus
					ultra of grossierté” (<title level="a">Advertisement</title>).
					Inevitably, however, such buoyant sentiments proved a bubble and “between
					1825 and 1837 the mood of self-confidence, the devotion to urban values, and the
					pride in London all came to an end” (Olsen 21). <figure>

               <p>Banks failed, building came to a halt, cholera arrived from the East,
					and perhaps most distressingly of all for the kind of “libidinal
					vitality” (During 344) that
					drove the mania for <title level="m">Life in London</title>, “low
					life” was recast as “a terrain of anxiety and didactic moralization:
					in short, it became less and less funny” (Gatrell 547). What one 1825 engraver protested as
						<title level="m">The Progress of Cant</title>, which features at its very

					by the end of the decade, Egan had
					himself turned against his creations, killing off Tom, Logic, and Corinthian
					Kate in his <title level="m">Finish</title>.</p>
               <p>“The Moment of Tom and Jerry,” I’d like to propose, was enabled
					by the peculiar “resonance” between the social forms we’ve
					been examining and this fleeting “epoch” of supreme self-regard
					among Londoners and their admirers. To borrow Wai Chee Dimock’s acoustic metaphor, the
					“signal” of these forms was amplified by the “noise” of
					the early 1820s and so became audible in ways that would not have been possible
					either before or since. The result was that as the status and reputation of
					London changed, so too did that of <title level="m">Life in London</title>. Tom
					and Jerry so encapsulated their moment that, once that moment had passed, they,
					like the Vauxhall which had provided them such “ample pleasures,”
					were left to constitute, at best, the puzzling memory of “a delightful
					perversion of the imagination” (Thackeray, <title level="a">De Juventute</title>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">Romantic-era audiences participated enthusiastically in what we
					would now recognize as fan practices and fan cultures. In his introduction to
					this volume, Eisner proposes an understanding of fandom as a culturally
					situated, qualitatively distinctive, and complexly mediated form of audience
					response, arguing that fandom rewards analysis as a historical phenomenon in its
					own right and not simply as a register of the celebrity of the objects of fan
					interest. Pointing out the ways in which the volume’s essays frame the topic of
					fandom as a provocation to methodological innovation, Eisner’s introduction
					locates the volume’s approach to fandom in relation to recent scholarship in
					Romantic studies and cultural studies, and in contradistinction to more
					traditional studies of reception. The introduction argues that the volume’s
					essays deepen our understanding of Romanticism’s publics as socially
					heterogeneous, inventive, and unpredictable, shaped by and shaping rapidly
					changing institutions of performance, publication, reading, spectatorship,
					leisure and consumption. By mapping the complicated social dynamics informing
					the activity of particular fans, the essays in this volume demonstrate both the
					diversity of Romantic fan practices and the historical particularity of the
					forms Romantic fandom takes. While these essays contest literary criticism’s
					often habitual abjection of the fan, Eisner emphasizes that they also resist
					conflating Romantic fandom with our own.</p>

                  <p>Depending on your perspective, this volume’s title might appear either
						oxymoronic or simply redundant. If your Romanticism tends to be disdainful,
						even phobic, of popularity; if it is self-reflexive and critical, full of
						obstinate questioning of sense and outward things; if it is dedicated to
						reforming as well as experimenting on the public’s taste, then fandom
						might look to you like Romanticism’s very opposite: fandom after all
						marks the faddish and the popular; we often characterize it as embracing its
						objects with reckless abandon or unthinking absorption. If on the other hand
						your Romanticism involves primarily the overflow of powerful feeling, an
						exuberance recollected perhaps somewhat ashamedly in moments of tranquility,
						a going out of our own nature in search of an ideal other, you might ask
						what kind of fandom worth the name wouldn’t be deemed Romantic.</p>
                  <p>While commentators in the early nineteenth century would not yet have spoken
						of “fans”—the term is an American coinage from later in
						the century—the period swirled with talk about crazes, manias, idols
						and idol-worshippers, enthusiasts, and devotees. The period also saw the
						popularization of recognizable “fan practices,” spurred by the
						growth of consumer culture and the development of a mass audience for
						culture generally. Admirers collected autographs, souvenirs, portraits and
						relics of celebrity writers, artists, performers, military heroes, and
						athletes; snapped up mementos associated with beloved plays or books or
						music; visited the homes and haunts of celebrities; pored over gossip-filled
						periodicals and newspaper notices; imitated celebrities’ fashion
						statements; fantasized about becoming friends or lovers with celebrities;
						wrote fan mail and formed communities of like-minded aficionados. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> An entertaining and detailed survey
							of some of the practices defining this emerging fan culture can be found
							in Altick 112-45. On
							fandom and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century reading practices, see
							also previous work by the contributors to this volume, including David A. Brewer’s
							work on eighteenth-century fan fiction in <title level="m">The Afterlife
								of Character</title>, Clara
								Tuite’s analysis of the Byron-Caroline
							Lamb relationship in <title level="a">Tainted Love,</title> and Nicola Watson’s
								<title level="m">The Literary Tourist</title>. </note> Romantic-era
						celebrities, of course, not only encouraged but also frequently participated
						in such practices themselves: Leo
							Braudy observes of Byron, for example, that he was “a fan before
						he was a star…[a]ll sorts of fame intrigued him,” from the
						world-historical to the more local and ephemeral (407). Byron famously adorned
						his rooms with a portrait of his “little pagod” Napoleon, but
						also kept a “screen pasted with scraps of boxers and actresses”
							(Marchand 4:256; Peter Quennell, qtd. in Braudy 407).</p>
                  <p>This volume does not propose a single definition of fandom, and it does not
						isolate a particular moment in time when modern fandom can be said to begin.
						In general terms, however, we might distinguish fandom from other forms of
						admiration or interest by foregrounding a few distinctive qualities. Fandom
						is, as John Fiske puts it, an
						“intensely pleasurable, intensely signifying” form associated
						with mass-cultural structures and mass-mediated society, though it may not
						be restricted to mass-cultural or mass-mediated objects (30). Fandom is a
						participatory activity embedded in a series of more or less routinized
						practices or rituals (e.g., collecting, writing fan mail), and connected to
						more or less exhibitionistic forms of display. Fandom has powerful emotional
						and affective dimensions—it can involve love, passion, excitation,
						unbearable curiosity or longing, near-total absorption, as well as feelings
						of shame, anxiety or abjection—though again, degrees of fandom
						obviously vary and such passions come and go. Fandom is also powerfully
						linked to fantasy, and often to forms of transferential identification. Both
						its emotional component and its fantasy elements often make it central to
						constructions of identity, but fandom also gives rise to communities of
						like-minded fans, to a fan culture. Finally, fandom can be crucially
						productive or creative: most clearly in the genre of fan fiction or the
						playful readerly practice David A.
							Brewer has called the “imaginative expansion” of
						narratives or characters (<title level="m">Afterlife</title> 2), but also
						more generally in the invention of modes of engagement, expression and
						performance. <note place="foot" resp="editors">
							John Fiske observes that
							“all popular audiences engage in varying degrees of semiotic
							productivity, producing meanings and pleasures that pertain to their
							social situation out of the products of the culture industries. But fans
							often turn this semiotic productivity into some form of textual
							production that can circulate among—and thus help to
							define—the fan community. Fans create a fan culture with its own
							systems of production and distribution that forms…a ‘shadow
							cultural economy’ that lies outside that of the cultural
							industries yet shares features with them which more normal popular
							culture lacks” (30). </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I contacted potential contributors to this volume, I suggested they
						consider some of the following questions: How does the concept of fandom
						help us think about the development of new kinds of publics, new formations
						of culture, and new ways of consuming culture in the Romantic period? What
						dynamics of class, gender, nation and sexuality emerge around the figure of
						the fan or specific forms of fandom in the Romantic period? How do Romantic
						writers themselves participate in such cultures of fandom? How do the
						material practices around fandom condition, reflect or support specific
						modes of reading or spectatorship associated with Romanticism? What can fan
						practices tell us about the development of new kinds of subjectivity or
						feeling in the period? How do we understand the fan’s desire, and how
						does that desire mirror, predict, or precede our own investments in
						Romantic-era texts and writers, as scholars, teachers, and 21st-century
						fans? Contributors were free to look at any of the possible topics projected
						by the phrase “Romantic Fandom”: Romantic-era fans; fans of the
						Romantics; fandom that is in some sense Romantic. Responding to these
						questions and possibilities, the four very diverse essays in this volume
						together show how taking fandom seriously might help reshape our
						understanding of Romantic-era audiences and Romantic-era forms. Conversely,
						these essays also demonstrate that attention to emerging practices of fandom
						in the Romantic period can open up valuable comparative perspectives on our
						own modes of admiration and response. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> For influential studies of contemporary fandom, see
								Gamson, Fiske and Jenkins, <title level="m">Poachers</title>; for a review of recent academic work on fandom
							and the academy’s changing relationship to fandom, see Jenkins, <title level="a">Confessions of an Aca/Fan.</title>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Celebrity has become something of a hot topic within Romantic studies, with a
						wave of studies building on groundbreaking articles and books by Peter Manning, Susan Wolfson, Judith Pascoe, and Karen Swann, and including recent
						work by Tom Mole, Ghislaine McDayter,David Higgins, Clara Tuite, myself and many
						others. There have been, too, in recent years several excellent collections
						of essays examining the fan cultures built up around individual writers:
							Frances Wilson’s
							<title level="m">Byromania</title> and Deidre Lynch’s <title level="m">Janeites</title>, for example. This volume aims to continue the
						conversation this scholarship has begun, but asks what different questions
						or insights arise if we shift the emphasis from the celebrity to the fan.
						The essays in this volume use this shift in emphasis to open up alternative
						views of the history of reading, and they take up the problem of fandom as a
						methodological challenge that requires new thinking about how to recover and
						analyze varieties of audience response. That is, the focus here is not on
						the topics of traditional reception history: the development of reputation,
						the strategies by which texts are marketed or distributed, a legacy of
						changing judgments or expectations or interpretations. Nor is the focus on
						cults of a particular author as reflections or betrayals of the reception
						that author might imagine. Rather, these are essays about the sometimes very
						ordinary, often very quirky activities of fans, though they show,
						unavoidably, the complex interrelation and interaction—mutually
						influential but not mutually determining—between forms of response and
						the forms that inspire such response in the first place. These essays reveal
						Romanticism’s publics as highly complicated, heterogeneous, inventive
						and unpredictable.</p>
                  <p>
						Nicola Watson’s essay
						makes clear both the diversity of modes of fandom in the period and how
						little these fan practices actually conform to some of our frequent
						assumptions about the period. Watson’s topic is the practice of reading writers <foreign xml:lang="la">in situ</foreign>—touring locations associated with
						writers or their characters and experiencing those scenes through the lens
						of one’s literary experience, often with book in hand. Her essay takes
						as a case study the cultural tourism of the socialite Lady Frances
						Shelley—a distant relative of the poet, “well-read yet
						unintellectual, and a crashing snob”—whose encounters with
						writers and the places they made famous are richly detailed in nearly half a
						century’s worth of letters and diaries. While we now typically see
						such tourism as a middle-brow if not mass-cultural phenomenon, Watson explains by contrast
						how Lady Shelley’s fandom is in fact dogged by an “anxiety of
						readership” tied to her elite class position. Though it anticipates
						later throngs of tourists in the Lake District in the nineteenth century or
						to places like Stratford or Haworth today, Lady Shelley’s reading of
						landscapes and locales reflects an effort to “distinguish the elite
						tourist-reader from an otherwise worryingly large and undifferentiated mass
						readership” (Watson).</p>
                  <p>The social distinctions Watson turns up in her analysis of this particular
						reader’s fan practices have suggestive implications for our
						understanding of the relationships between readers and books more generally
						in the Romantic period and, indeed, in the present. Watson uncovers a contest
						between two modes of literary fandom driving the cultural tourism she
						investigates: on the one hand, an “author-centered” mode
						“organized towards visiting, being, or envisioning the author;”
						on the other hand, a “fiction-centered” mode through which the
						tourist-reader uses a particular landscape to project himself or herself
						imaginatively into a narrative, or imaginatively to project the reality of
						fictional scenes. If the author-centered mode of fandom suggests the writer
						and reader are on equal footing, Watson argues, the fiction-centered mode of fandom
						“connoted a propensity to confuse the real and the fictional, a
						dangerous and risible lack of sophistication which contemporary discourse
						typically associated with the new mass readership” (Watson). As Watson observes, this is a
						distinction still active in the gap between visiting someplace like
						Austen’s Chawton or the Keats House and a theme park like
						Dickens’ World. Yet I might add that these two modes of fandom, of
						course, draw on and feed back into types of fantasy and identification
						possibly present, and overlapping, in any given experience of losing oneself
						in a book. Watson’s
						discussion ultimately, then, points us to the spillover—in both
						directions—between the way we experience imaginative worlds in reading
						and the cultural practices through which we seek to extend those experiences
						into reality.</p>
                  <p>While all of the essays in this volume bring out fandom’s richly social
						and even communal dimensions, it’s also a paradox of fandom that the
						typicality of any given fan’s pleasures must lie in their
						idiosyncrasy. Clara
						Tuite’s case history of Stendhal’s momentous meeting with Byron in 1816 builds a
						strong argument both for the individuality of Stendhal’s response
						to Byron (it’s
						a quintessentially Stendhalian response) and for its representative status
						with regard to Byronic fandom in particular and modern mass-cultural fandom,
						perhaps modern masculinity, more generally. Floored when he realizes
						he’s sharing an opera box with the poet he idolizes, Stendhal is at once
						thrilled and deeply embarrassed, but in Tuite’s account this is not just another story of enthrallment
						to Byron’s
						seductive figure. Indeed, part of what’s so intriguing about this
						exchange is the uneasy, competitive, and erotically charged triangular
						relationship that governs it— Stendhal/Napoleon/Byron—with both
							Stendhal and Byron engaged in an
						on-going and unstable process of identity-formation through the public
						performance of ambivalent identification with figures <emph>also</emph>
						engaged in such an on-going and unstable process of self-invention. As Watson does also, Tuite emphasizes that the fan
						acts in ways not always scripted or anticipated by the author, but here the
						fan’s independence takes on a more Barthesian quality. In Tuite’s provocative
						argument, fandom “spectacularizes the transformative agency of the
						reader, producing new circuits of exchange that empower reading and
						reception, and endow them with new pleasures and sensations. Far from
						entailing an exclusively passive position—in docile thrall to the
						sovereignty of author and text—fandom can be seen to transform a
						traditional textual economy of active and passive, thereby enabling
						reception as a mode of delirious productivity—proliferating often
						disobedient and indiscreet disclosures” (Tuite). But Tuite painstakingly shows as well how Stendhal’s emotion
						and its display are conditioned by and as the social ritual of a very
						specific time and place, the immediately post-Napoleonic moment of the
						encounter between these two recent exiles, one British and one French, at
						the opera in Italy.</p>
                  <p>Crucial to Tuite’s
						analysis of the affective dimension of Stendhal’s fandom is the category of the
						“impulse,” on the edge point between “the desire to act
						and the act itself,” and ambiguously located between body and mind
							(Tuite). Stendhal’s
						experience of fandom as unwilled feeling chimes not only with accounts of
						present-day fandom but also with the language of other nineteenth-century
						accounts of fan feeling: Elizabeth Barrett Browning would write in the 1840s of her own
						“impulses to lionizing,” for example (1:145). As Tuite suggests in linking Stendhal’s
						“impulse” to the older literary-historical and philosophical
						category of the “sensation”—important in Stendhal’s thinking
						about love, memory and emotion— Stendhal’s fascination with his feeling on
						this occasion might be assimilated to the entire complex project through
						which Romantic writers work to refashion and revalue eighteenth-century
						understandings of the relation of emotion and knowledge, producing a new
						“history or science of feelings” (Wordsworth, Note to <title level="a">The
							Thorn,</title>
                     <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> 289). (We might, for example, read
							Tuite’s discussion of
						impulse and sensation in Stendhal’s fan feeling against Noel Jackson’s recent work on sensation in
						British Romantic poetry: Tuite
						sees Stendhal pushing
						sensation away from scientific knowledge while Jackson sees the two as more closely allied in
						British Romantic thought [ Jackson 1-2]). Tracing Stendhal’s shifting recollections and
						rewritings of the encounter with Byron over the years, Tuite zeros in on what these rewritings tell us
						about “that most Stendhalian concern with the fraught interrelation
						between desire and memory”—a concern so central to Romantic
						writing generally. As I have suggested elsewhere, Romantic fandom turns out
						in this way to be surprisingly close to the dynamics of the Romantic lyric,
						with its focus on memory and memorialization and its attempted coordination
						between deeply personal and transpersonal feeling. Just as the Romantic
						lyric is supposed to provide a passage between an almost incommunicable
						meaning and public meaning, the fan’s response is felt at once as
						uniquely individual experience and as shared or social experience. Is it
						possible really to imagine oneself the lone fan of anything? Fandom is
						perhaps always something we think of as shared, or at least as something we
						want to share, even as our embarrassment about our fandom speaks not just to
						its excesses of feeling but to the way we take it as revealing deeply
						personal truth. It’s too much sharing.</p>
                  <p>
						Mark Schoenfield’s
						engaging contribution to this volume, <title level="a">
							Byron in the
								<title level="j">Satirist</title>,</title> analyzes a much less
						adulatory—if perhaps no less obsessed—response to Byron. Schoenfield teases out the
						complex political and cultural rhetorics through which the journal refracts
						the figure of Byron
						in its reviews, its social satire, and its verbal and visual parodies,
						starting with its 1807 review of Byron’s <title level="m">Hours of
							Idleness</title>. Animating this interaction in large part is the
						personal animus between Byron and the <title level="j">Satirist</title> writer Hewson
						Clarke, who was at Cambridge with Byron and for whom Byron represented not
						only a rival but the (frustrating) epitome of aristocratic privilege, a
						privilege Clarke and <title level="j">The Satirist</title> will target in
						attacks on what they brand Whiggish indolence. Schoenfield demonstrates how even at this early
						stage in Byron’s career, the <title level="j">Satirist</title>’s
						attacks function to deflate, by redeploying, Byron’s
						figuration of his own fame, reflecting back to the poet and his audience
						“the fragility of his public self.” In other words, despite
						being captivated by Byron’s figure, Clarke is hardly a fan of the poet, but
						both Clarke and Clarke’s Byron write with an anxious eye on the poet’s
						real or potential audience of devoted admirers, the “real” Byron’s claims
						to nonchalance or indifference notwithstanding. In Schoenfield’s nice
						summary, the journal thus influentially produces “a competing version
						of Byronic celebrity to that produced by Byron.”</p>
                  <p>
						Schoenfield’s essay
						is perhaps most exciting in the way it shows us the vexed interdependence of
						periodical writing and poetic production in the first decades of the
						nineteenth century, a mutually bound relationship whose antagonistic dynamic
						is captured by the reversibility of these hostilities: as Schoenfield explains,
						“who binds whom is determined by an economy of cultural
						production.” The antagonism of satire in this way proves suggestively
						parallel to the mutually bound and sometimes very antagonistic relationship
						between fans and the objects of their interest. The close connection Schoenfield examines between
						poetic production and periodical culture reflects, of course, the position
						of each within a rapidly developing literary marketplace, but also,
						especially in Byron’s case, the way a kind of seriality was emerging in the
						publication of poetry (even before the Oriental Tales) that lent itself to
						sustained engagement with and by the seriality of magazine publication. If
						periodicals like <title level="j">The Satirist</title> require a Byron as an organizing
						figure for their own reading of culture, we’re also coming more and
						more to see how powerful a role the periodicals played not just in the
						reception of Byron
						but in shaping the poet’s self-representation.</p>
                  <p>While Schoenfield, Tuite and Watson each describe how
						particular individuals responded to famous writers and their works, Brewer’s essay on the
						craze for Pierce Egan’s
							<title level="m">Life in London</title> asks a somewhat different
						question about fandom: how to account for the “phenomenon” of a
						book like <title level="m">Life in London</title>? As Brewer recounts, it’s not
						just that the book itself sparked a craze, but that it gave rise to so many
						also wildly popular imitations, theatrical adaptations and spin-offs, and
						even cross-merchandising (clothiers pushed Tom and Jerry fashions, for
						example). Histories of reading and reception have a tough time making
						convincing sense of such reader response: the mania inspired by <title level="m">Life in London</title> may stand as a particularly
						inexplicable instance, but, as Brewer points out, we still need to develop critical languages
						or frameworks through which we might approach this kind of fandom
						productively. Brewer’s
						brilliant solution is radically to shift the scale of analysis: rather than
						situate the response to <title level="m">Life in London</title> within
						ideological or cultural patterns mapped through broad swaths of literary or
						social history, or even the more limited “Regency culture,”
							Brewer’s analysis
						goes micro. Building on Franco Morretti’s <title level="m">Graphs,
							Maps, Trees</title>, Brewer’s essay literally maps the publication, adaptation
						and reception of <title level="m">Life in London</title> down to the
						month-by-month level of the book’s serial appearance and down to the
						street-by-street level of the particular London neighborhoods where the characters go on their larks,
						where theaters stage adaptations, or where we have evidence of particular
						reader response (including police reports of overexcited readers acting out
						Tom and Jerry’s sprees). The results are astonishing: not only do we,
						in reading this essay and looking at these maps, experience the temporality
						of reception in an entirely new way, but we see in new terms how and why
						this craze played out as it did across forms and media. As in all the essays
						in this volume, we get a powerful sense of the peculiarly mediated space
						fandom occupies. We also, excitingly, get a new sense of how we might
						understand the history of reading and theatergoing through the problematic
						of form.</p>
                  <p>I confess that when I began contacting potential contributors to this volume,
						I was anxious about the terminology I’d chosen: would the label
						“fandom” impel readings that merely projected our own forms of
						desire back onto Romantic-era readers? Surely, there are striking
						continuities between today’s fan practices and their pre-history in
						Romantic-era forms of reception, as Nicola Watson remarks: “in the climate of today’s
						celebrity culture, it has become possible to rediscover Byron as a necessary
						precondition for Mick Jagger, as the first famous poet to inspire certain
						modes of feeling on an international scale.” <note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a great instance of running with such an equation,
							see <title level="a">Lord Byron’s life of bling, booze and groupie
								sex,</title>
                        <title level="j">The Sun</title>’s 2008 article reporting
							(somewhat spuriously) on Corin Throsby’s research on love letters
							to Byron in the
							John Murray archive: “His passions included brandy and
							bling…and bedding hundreds of lust-crazed groupies. The dashing
							aristocrat’s racy lifestyle, palatial homes and oceans of female
							fan mail created a circus not unlike the one surrounding David Beckham
							today… Now never-before-published letters have emerged proving his
							female fans were every bit as smitten as those who were later to swoon
							over Becks and his fellow stars.” </note> The essays in the
						present volume do suggest some potential rewards of analyzing Romantic-era
						reading practices in terms of a “presentist” understanding of
						the affective dynamics of celebrity and fandom (“presentist”
						because derived from an analysis of those dynamics as they are familiar to
						us). <note place="foot" resp="editors"> For thoughtful discussions of
							the uses and risks of “presentism” see <ref target="/praxis/contemporary/toc.html">the
								Praxis volume on the topic</ref> edited by Laura Mandell. </note> Ultimately, however, I
						find what comes across in these essays is in fact the historical difference
						that separates Romantic-era fandom from more familiar fan routines, rather
						than any putative similarity between the two. If these essays contest
						literary criticism’s abjection of the fan as “naïve,
						obsessive, desirous, and dangerously predatory” (Watson), they also resist
						simply celebrating the fan or identifying Romantic-era readerly desire with
						our own. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the pathologization of
							fandom as obsessive and hysterical, see Jensen 9. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, each of these essays describes scenes of fandom that come very
						quickly to belong emphatically to the past. Travelling down the Rhine in the
						1850s, Lady Shelley, Watson
						tells us, finds herself unable to re-experience her own earlier feelings of
						romance amid these scenes, even though she keeps her copy of <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> open beside her. Stendhal’s
						encounter with Byron
						may set the stage for later developments in his life and his writing, but
						almost on the scene, in Tuite’s account, it is already subject to the revising and
						corroding action of memory. <title level="j">The Satirist</title>’s
						exchanges with Byron
						set in motion recurring tropes in the poet’s reception, but as Schoenfield explains, these
						exchanges belong to an early moment in Byron’s career, before the full appearance of
						“Byronism” and its transformative effects on the poet’s
						public persona and on the literary market itself. Brewer explains that the craze for <title level="m">Life in London</title> faded as quickly as it came on; by the middle of
						the century, even those who’d been swept up in it in their youth
						professed themselves mystified by the book’s popularity. This pattern
						isn’t just about aging or the passage of time: what it reveals is the
						way fandom is always historically situated, always tied to specific and
						shifting cultural as well as individual situations. In the Romantic period
						in particular, the <emph>fading</emph> of forms of fandom indexes the rapid
						and uneven development and transformation of institutions of writing,
						reading, and publication across the period. The essays in this volume show
						how an analysis of fandom can limn these changes in provocative and
						revelatory fashion. They point the way to more work on Romantic-era readers
						and reading practices that needs to be done, and they suggest some of the
						innovative and varied methodologies scholars might put to use in charting

               <p rend="noCount">This article analyzes the complex political and cultural rhetorics
					through which the journal <title level="j">Satirist</title> refracts the figure
					of Byron in its reviews,
					its social satire, and its verbal and visual parodies, starting with its 1807
					review of Byron’s
						<title level="m">Hours of Idleness</title>. Animating this interaction in
					large part is the personal animus between Byron and the <title level="j">Satirist</title> writer
					Hewson Clarke, who was at Cambridge with Byron and for whom Byron represented not only a rival but the
					(frustrating) epitome of aristocratic privilege, a privilege Clarke and <title level="j">The Satirist</title> will target in attacks on what they brand
					Whiggish indolence. Schoenfield demonstrates how even at this early stage in Byron’s career, the
						<title level="j">Satirist</title>’s attacks function to deflate, by
					redeploying, Byron’s figuration of his own fame, reflecting back to the poet
					and his audience “the fragility of his public self.” The journal
					thus influentially produces “a competing version of Byronic celebrity to
					that produced by Byron.”</p>

               <p>When Byron sent a copy
					of his first publically printed volume, <title level="m">Hours of
						Idleness</title>, to his ineffectual guardian, Lord Carlisle, the elder poet
					evaded an assessment of the poems by writing his thanks in advance of (and
					perhaps entirely in lieu of) reading the poems. Carlisle assured Byron that however the
					public and reviewers received the volume, Byron “will stand better with the world than
					others who only pursue their studies in Bond St. or at Tatershall's” (<ref target="http://books.google.com/books?id=J2ERAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=%22pursue+their+studies+in+Bond%22">Byron, <title level="m">Works</title> 1:138</ref>) Poetry, Carlisle suggests, may not
					be actual labor, but it is better than dissipating consumption on Bond Street, a
					high-end shopping district, or horse racing and gambling at Tattersall's. This
					tepid response, with its emphasis on the “studies” of other
					aristocrats, underscores Carlisle's frustration with Byron's indifference to
					his studies at Cambridge. Henry Brougham's review of <title level="m">Hours</title> in the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review,</title> urges Byron to “forthwith
					abandon poetry, and turn his talents, which are considerable, and his
					opportunities, which are great, to better account” (<ref target="http://books.google.com/books?id=NmIRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=%22which+are+considerable,+and+his+opportunities%22">
                     <title level="j">ER</title> 9: 286</ref>). Like Carlisle, Brougham
					raises the issue of the public perception of aristocratic labor, a subject that
					provoked both class-based and party-affiliated responses that ranged from anger
					to amusement. Reviews, both positive and negative, registered the issue, which
					was signaled not only by the title's emphasis on “idleness,” but the
					Preface's insistence on Byron's status as a poetic dabbler. Byron's public
					performance, thus, is refracted through competing understandings of the
					relationship between class privilege and forms of labor, both working-class and
					professional.</p>
               <p>Among the most virulent of the reviews was the notice by Hewson Clarke, who was
					at Cambridge at the same time as Byron, in the first issue of <title level="j">The
						Satirist, or the Monthly Meteor</title> (this summary of Clarke's review
					draws from my longer account of it in <title level="m">British
						Periodicals</title> 142-6). Probably suppressing a personal knowledge of the
					identity of the reviewer, Byron's main complaint about the review, expressed to Elizabeth
					Pigot, is that “my censor only quotes <emph>two lines</emph> from
					different poems” to support his position (<ref target="http://discoverarchive.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/2314/Byron%20to%20Elizabeth%20Pigot%20-%20Oct%2026%2c%201807.pdf?sequence=1">
                     <title level="j">BLJ</title> 1:136</ref>). This charge is somewhat
					imprecise, and the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s weird quotation makes the
					review potent. <title level="j">The Satirist</title>, emphasizing the name's
					absence from the annals of accomplishment, quotes six times (once in the
					possessive case) the full denomination of the author announced on the title
					page: “<emph>George
							Gordon Lord Byron, a minor</emph>” (<ref target="http://discoverarchive.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/2548/Satirist%20No.%201%20-%20Oct.%201807%20-%20Review%20of%20Hours%20of%20Idleness.pdf?sequence=1">1: 77-81</ref>). This repetition (of a pseudo-trimeter line of amphibrachs,
					with strong caesuras emphasizing the rhythm) asserts the mannered construction
					not only of the poetry, but of Byron's self-conception. As Jerome Christensen has noted, Henry Brougham, writing
					several months later in the <title level="j">Edinburgh</title>, exploited the
					tension between Lordship and minority (21-23), and, like Hewson, queried the
					relevance of either to poetic production.</p>
               <p>Clarke's review begins, “There certainly must be a wonderful charm in the
					name of <emph>author</emph>, and a prodigious desire in men to see their own
					works in <emph>print</emph>, or what could have induced <emph>George Gordon Lord
							Byron, a minor</emph>, to have favoured the world with this
					collection of poems” (<title level="j">Satirist</title> 1:77). Drawing on
					his own experience as a young author, Clarke adumbrates the method of the
					“wonderful charm” in which “<emph>print</emph>” becomes
					a mirror in which men can “see” their works—and
					work—materialized, yet such sight can be a delusion. Using the charmed
					“name of <emph>author</emph>” to undercut the awkward amalgam that
					identifies Byron
					particularly, the reviewer insists on his right to regulate excess and
					authenticity. The <title level="j">Satirist</title> reads <title level="m">Hours
						of Idleness</title> as self-exposure that confirms Byron's inability to
					produce and not as his record of the poetic process of transforming idle moments
					into verse: if Byron
					had not published, “no human being would have guessed the quantity of time
					he had spent in <emph>doing nothing</emph>.” For the <title level="j">Satirist</title>, Byron's minority is not, as Byron himself positions it, an anteroom to lordship,
					but an expression of his personality. The <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s
					review mentions thirteen poems, nearly the most of any notice of <title level="j">Hours</title>, while paraphrasing or, as Byron complains, quoting
					short phrases. In the paragraph on <title level="a">On a Distant View of the
						Village and School, of Harrow, on the Hill,</title> Clarke reduces its title
					to <title level="a">Harrow on the Hill,</title> collapsing the poetic distance
					and distorting Byron's
					generic signals. Such a reduction strips <title level="a">On a Distant
						View</title> of its ironic perspective and represents, as the poem's central
					point, Byron's notion
					that “he spoke better than Mossop, and acted better than Garrick”
						(<title level="j">Satirist</title> 1:78). In context, the poem's point is
					that such sensations of fame occur by confusions of scale—mistaking (even
					while cognizant of the mistake) the school auditorium for Drury Lane and thereby
					mishearing the conventions of applause: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l rend="indent2">While, to swell my young pride, such applauses
								resounded,</l>
                        <l rend="indent2">I fancied that Mossop himself was outshone</l>
                        <l rend="indent2">... fir'd by loud plaudits, and self adulation,</l>
                        <l rend="indent2">I regarded myself as a Garrick reviv'd.</l>
                     </lg>(18-23)</quote>The comparison with Mossop creates a fantasy of fame
					that the poem discounts but which the review attributes to Byron. Byron saw, in Clarke's
					review, the fragility of his public self, because the redeployment of his words
					altered his character and exposed his anxieties about, and commitments to, that
					character. <title level="a">Harrow</title> is, in part, a meditation on the
					mechanism of the “wonderful charm” of authorship, in which applauses
					are reiteratively <emph>re</emph>sounded, both seductive and treacherous, yet
					Clarke insists that Byron is oblivious to and enthralled by this “charm.”
						 Byron read the
						<title level="j">Satirist</title> review within a few weeks of its
					appearance and wrote to Elizabeth Pigot about it on October 26, 1807. The letter
					compares Cambridge to Southwell, before discussing the <title level="j">Satirist</title>: “This place is wretched enough...Oh! the misery of
					doing nothing but make <emph>Love, Enemies</emph>, and
					<emph>Verses</emph>” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 1:135). “This
					place” is where
						Byron encountered Hewson Clarke, and the phrase “doing
					nothing” echoes the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s accusation of
						Byron's idleness.
					But Byron's “doing
					nothing” is supplemented— stylized—by his making “love,
					enemies, and verses.” The asymmetrical meanings of “making” as
					applied to each of the nouns gives it triple meaning, and signals the serial
					nature of Byron's own
					construction as a form of valid labor, of continual and varied
					“making.”</p>
               <p>From its inaugural issue, in which it skewered <title level="m">Hours of
						Idleness</title>, <title level="j">The Satirist</title> both reviewed Byron's work and injected
					sightings of  Byron into
					its social commentary. Spurred in part by personal animosity between Byron and Hewson Clarke,
					these references often played on private information, and functioned to expose
					Byronic nonchalance as a façade for ambition and privilege, thereby
					producing a competing version of Byronic celebrity to that produced by Byron. <note place="foot" resp="editors">The collaborative production of Romantic
						celebrity, particularly with regard to Byron, has been productively explored by Tom Mole and Eric Eisner in his first chapter,
						note 6 of which provides a useful bibliography of critical approaches to
						fame.</note> When 
						Byron published the next edition of <title level="m">Hours</title>,
					retitled <title level="m">Poems, Original and Translated</title>, in 1808, he
					dropped the appellation “a minor” as well as the Preface and several
					poems. The <title level="j">Satirist</title>, nonetheless, revives the title in
					its review of the newer volume, and continues to refer to him as “George Gordon, Lord Byron,
					a Minor.” The review invents the title <title level="a">Prayer of George Gordon, Lord
							Byron, a Minor</title> for [<title level="a">May Heaven so guard
						my lovely Quaker</title>] (3:82). Further insisting on the durable trace of
						<title level="m">Idleness</title>, this review discusses—and quotes at
					varying lengths—six of the poems omitted from the <title level="m">Poems,
						Original and Translated</title>. While Byron's career flees from <title level="m">Hours</title>, the <title level="j">Satirist</title> maintain its
					centrality to Byronism, even after Clarke had left the journal, because of its
					affinity with the journal's construction of the Whig aristocracy as enablers of
					fictitious labor. In the March, 1808 number, the <title level="j">Satirist</title> publishes a correspondent's praise, <title level="a">Address to the Satirist,</title> which begins “Health to the
					Satirist! Whose daring hand/Scourges the rampant follies of the land” (2:
					7). Almost certainly written by Clarke, the poem associates the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s attacks on idle poetry with its repudiation of the
					“All the Talents” government led by the Whig Lord Grenville. Framed
					by two articles—<title level="a">The School of Eloquence and Grace</title>
					and <title level="a">Female Costume</title>—that demonstrate the
					connections between economic activity and personal perceptions and experiences,
					the poem, with guiding footnotes, references Mr. Satirist's many cuts from prior
					reviews, political and poetical. In contrast to the characters of the
					surrounding articles, the poem argues for a consistency in the <title level="j">Satirist</title> that runs contrary to contemporary society. He
					“Gives to each author's work strict review:/ Whether a Lord step forth,
					whose <title level="m">Idle Hours</title>,/ Display, midst petty wits, his minor
					powers” (2: 8). The “petty wits” invoke the scene of Cambridge
					elites who scorned Hewson Clarke and clustered around Byron. In the May, 1808
					number, the <title level="j">Satirist</title> compiles snippets that review
						<title level="a">Hours of Idleness, a Series of Poems; by George Gordon, Lord
							Byron, a Minor,</title> ranging from the <title level="j">British
						Critic</title>'s “this is very ingenious Idleness” to the <title level="j">Monthly Mirror</title>'s “This Minor certainly is a
						<emph>minor poet</emph> at present; and will, we think, at <emph>any age
						continue</emph> to be so.” It concludes by quoting the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> on “the noble Minor's
						<emph>volume</emph>,” whose Ossianic poetry is
						“<emph>stupid</emph> and <emph>tiresome</emph>” (335).</p>
               <p>Hewson Clarke, as a sizar at Emmanuel College had, at least potentially, to work
					for his reduced expenses. He would have been among the poorer students, and, in
					considering himself a writer, would have recognized Byron as a local rival.
						Byron, by contrast,
					affected a complete indifference for Clarke, except in his character as a writer
					in <title level="j">The Satirist</title>, although in a footnote to <title level="m">English Bards</title>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> notes that Newcastle, “the town in whose
					markets he [Clarke] had sold meat, and in whose weekly journal he had written,
					deserved better treatment” than it is given in Clarke's later writing
						(<ref target="http://books.google.com/books?id=BJUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=byron+%22hewson+clarke%22">124</ref>), a comment that registers, and personalizes, Clarke's class
					politics. Ben Wilson notes that
					Clarke worked as “an errand boy at a chemists” while writing
					“satires for <title level="j">The Tyne Mercury</title>” and, once at
					Cambridge, “developed a lasting and fathomless enmity toward the upper
					class” (173). In the March 1808 issue of <title level="j">The
						Satirist</title>, the first of an extended sequence, <title level="a">The
						Cantab</title> appeared; it ran until its ninth number in February, 1809,
					and represented itself as debunking the myth of Cambridge maintained “by
					the visionary retrospections of its departed members” (2:42). In <title level="a">Cantab VIII,</title> both “Lord B—“ (with his
					bear) and Mr. Hewson Clarke” appear, the former rescuing his
						“<foreign xml:lang="fr">chere amie</foreign>” from a fire and
					the latter completing his <title level="a">
                     <emph>Art of Pleasing</emph>
                  </title>(3:478). These articles drew on Clarke's experiences, though they
					projected his own dissipation (some of which Cyrus Redding recounts in <title level="m">Fifty Years'
						Recollections</title>; <ref target="http://books.google.com/books?id=78YEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22fifty+years%27+recollections%22+hewson"> 1: 245-6</ref>) onto others, as when another student harasses his patron
					for funds. In the first number, he sets the intellectual standard: “A
					student generally comes to the university with a sufficient knowledge of the
					classics, and if he be not ruined by the dissipation of the place, he may easily
					retain it” (2:43). Throughout, especially as it is highlighted by the
						<title level="j">Satirist</title>'s Tory leanings, the series connects
					college dissipation with Whig ambitions, and underscores the problems of
					aristocratic labor, which is associated with the Whigs' indolence as a party
					indifferent to workers but mired in the abstractions of political economy (see
					figure one).</p>

					Cambridge students into three groups: “the studious, the idle, and the
					profligate” (364). The time of the first is spent examining Newton, of the
					second in “doing nothing,” and that of the “profligate in
					drinking, wh[orin]g, betting, &amp;c, &amp;c.” This language locates Byron among the idle, and
					more, makes him representative of a social class for whom idleness constitutes
					character. The memorandum book covers roughly a week in the life of the
					profligate student, Sir G W, that is, Sir Godfrey Webster, Lady Holland's son
					(whom Lady Caroline Lamb would satirize in <title level="m">Glenarvon</title>
					along with Lord Byron,
					for much the same reasons if with only a shadow of the passion; like Buchanan,
					his pseudonym in Glenavron, Godfrey “only came alive while driving at top
					speed through town, or conversing with famous pugilists” [Wilson 176]).</p>
               <p>On Monday, G.W. wakes at noon with a “D[amne]d headache,” an <foreign xml:lang="la">in medias res</foreign> opening that hints at epic struggles

                  </ref>. The driver of the Cambridge
					Telegraph, Hell Fire Dick was, according to Francis Grose's 1811 <title level="m">Dictionary of the
						Vulgar Tongue</title>, “the favorite companion of the University
					fashionables, and the only tutor to whose precepts they attend.” According
					to Lewis Benjamin, “it was
					a fad of many <foreign xml:lang="fr">beaux</foreign> to dress as stage-coachmen
					and to imitate their conversation and habits,” even going so far as to
					drive private vehicles to “pretend to deliver parcels” (a practice
					to which Byron alludes
					in his 1813 <title level="a">The Devil's Drive</title> [1: 206-7]). Our Student,
					then, unwilling to perform labor, instead chooses to imitate it; his being is
					constituted by a satirical relation to work, both his own (as a nascent Whig
					propagandist) and that of others. The next day, the student receives bills for
					“whips, dogs, etc. etc.,” and for six “interviews” with
					“Fanny W[e]lls” Despite his being broke, the last of these is easily
					handled—he sends her wine and a broach, but for the other debts, he must
					write his guardian, to whom he argues that his “tutor knows it is proper
					for me to have the <emph>wherewith</emph> to be in a genteel way,” and
					that requires ready money. On Wednesday, he stumbles across the Dean of his
					College, who gives him “an imposition out of some stuff or other called
					the Rambler.” As Clarke himself had published the <title level="j">Saunterer</title>, a deliberate echo of Johnson's <title level="j">Rambler</title>, when at
					Cambridge, Webster's literary ignorance is aligned with his idleness and his
					Whig perspective. Instead of reading Johnson, Webster is taken by “Devilish funny
					caricatures” and a “d[amne]d clever thing” by Lord Byron, <title level="a">Lord Byron
						to his Bear</title>, which the idle poet sings to an adoring audience of

						Graham Chainey provides an
						account of the known facts and legends about the bear (126-9).</note> Once
					master of his own domain of “consorts,” the bear is now “slave
					to a Lord.” Such slavery, a subjugation of labor to lordship, imputes to
						 Byron and his
					fellow students an indifference to the bear's—or any
					laborer's—rights. The second stanza equates the bear's pranks with Byron's own poetry,
					equally likely to arouse and to lull to sleep. The <title level="j">Satirist</title> had, in both its reviews of <title level="m">Hours of
						Idleness</title>, indicated the dullness of Byron's work and its
					soporific effect. In the final stanza, the juvenile Byron makes the great
					discovery of sympathy: the bear's enslavement to him is parallel to Byron's enslavement to
					love. Of course, this is once again a misunderstanding of the laboring class, as
					the bear's subjugation is inflicted upon it, while Byron's is merely a
					stylistic choice of his, evident in the conventionality of his poetry.</p>

               <p>	Although the <title level="j">Satirist</title> does not go so far as
					to place the empowered Whigs in this camp, it does suggest that, just as some
					Cambridge scholars are best suited for merely racing around in coaches, Whigs,
					too, have their ideal, Platonic professions: “Mr. Sheridan ..as a
					mountebank, Mr. Windham admired as a conjurer, Lord Grenville celebrated as a
					Roman Catholic Priest, Lord Temple eminent as a stationer, Lord Petty unrivalled
					as an opera dancer, Mr. Walter Scott [thrown in with the Whigs either through
					ignorance, because of his association with the <title level="j">Edinburgh
						Review</title>, or as wit] excellent as a compiler of nursery tales, and
						George Gordon, Lord
						Byron, a minor,...as the keeper of a <emph>bear-garden</emph>”
					(489). Guided by the sound echo of “Whig club” and “Whip
					Club,” the <title level="j">Satirist</title>, as it does elsewhere,
					associates Whig theorizing with unregulated consumption and undisciplined
					governance. In its satiric voice, the article notes it can only discover
					“one adverse effect” of such clubs, a “want of employment to
					those who drive not for notoriety but for bread.” The club, however, is
					alert to this problem and “keeps up the spirits of desponding stage and
					hackney coachmen” by “frequently treat[ing] them to a ride in their
					dashing barouches, and giv[ing] them as much gin and bitters as they can
					drink.” The article turns next to the “Varmint Club,” founded
					by Lady Holland's son, Godfrey Webster, our student who so much admired Byron's song to his bear
					and whom Clarke would, in the <title level="j">Scourge</title>, associate with
					the economic disaster of paper money, an institutionalized form of false
					promises and unrestrained consumption. Webster's club, again, impersonates
					labor, choosing to dress with “hats...never exceeding three and sixpence
					and...all their other habiliments...proportionally cheap.” Clarke's
					commentator wonders that so few ladies are attracted to these “gentlemen
					rat-catchers”: “We heard a lovely girl (no relation to Lord Byron) declare, that
					she would sooner marry a <emph>bear</emph> than a <emph>barouche
					driver</emph>...perhaps she wished to keep the <emph>whip</emph> and reins in
					her own hands” (491; figure three).

               <p>The following month, the review of <title level="m">Poems, Original and
						Translated</title> appeared. The <title level="j">Satirist</title> was one
					of the few journals to review both versions. Clarke asked pardon for again
					intruding on the public “this eccentric <emph>minor</emph> poet;—but
					stay, ladies, stay, 'tis a truly harmless Lord, now—he is without his
					Bear, and is himself muzzled” (3: 78). This review divides Byron into two corporate
					entities, the minor Lord who produced <title level="m">Hours</title> and <title level="a">Bruin and Co.,</title> the somewhat wiser, though no more poetic,
					construct, disciplined by the periodicals which are given credit for Byron's deletions in the
					new edition. In the December issue of 1808, a correspondent named “An
					Alarmist”—consistent in tone with Hewson's Clarke's work, and
					probably his—writes Mr. Satirist a “Warning”; it begins:
					“Are you mad, or have you as little feeling for yourself as you have for
					other people?..you have almost flayed your victims...till they have roared with
					the smart, and almost gone mad with pain...you had better look about you, Mr.
					Satirist, [to] escape in your whole skin.” On one hand, this parodies the
					corporate body, which has no “skin” but only a surface of paper. But
					it also plays on the exchange of madness and lashing between the <title level="j">Satirist</title> and its victim-attackers. Who binds whom is
					determined by an economy of cultural production.</p>
               <p>The correspondent declares, “I go nowhere now, indeed, but I hear you
					abused” (3: 467). This is hyperbole, increasing the presumed clout of
						<title level="j">The Satirist</title> by making it the object of universal
					recognition, and to prove his case, he relays an impromptu, overheard
					conversation about the journal. A trio of a “gentleman in black,” a
					“sullen, male novelist,” and a “fine woman with very prominent
					beauties” agree, as the woman puts it, they must “join our forces to
					crush these fellows, or we shall positively be all Gothicized;” their
					anxiety—and therefore the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s
					boast—is the control of a public image, to the extent that the novelist
					can no longer sell his work. As the conversation turns to defending the utility
					of Criminal Conversation (without which, a new interlocutor injects, “what
					would be the use of a pretty wife?”), another man then makes this appeal
					to a thus-far silent interlocutor: “ ‘You are an author, my Lord,'
					added he, turning to a man who was hanging on the arm of a tall masculine woman,
					that looked like a Holland <emph>frow</emph>; ‘suppose you were to take
					them in hand, and write them down.'” Noting that he is “just now
					going to Spain,” he replies he might do something “ ‘when I am
					half-seas over. I and my bear will be a match for them' exclaims [the]
						<emph>minor</emph> peer. ‘...And as for what they say of me, I don't
					care a d[amn].'” The man in black replies, with unintended irony,
					“Why, surely, it is not possible for them to libel you” (470). This
					might represent some rumored knowledge of the forthcoming <title level="m">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</title> in which Byron would skewer Hewson
					Clarke; Byron's letters
					reflect an anxiety about whether the secret of his poem would hold. In it, he
					wrote: <quote>

               <p>The <title level="j">Satirist</title>, now without Clarke, would go on to review,
					mostly favorably, <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, several of Byron's tales, and <title level="m">The Waltz</title> (though probably without knowing Byron wrote it) before it
					folded in 1814. But the figure of “idleness” as the propensity of
					lordship was easily reinvoked, and constituted, for the journal, a recurrent
					critique. The reviewer of <title level="m">The Giaour</title> concludes by
					suggesting that, while Byron is “reveling in all the sensual and intellectual luxury
					which the successful sale of Newstead Abbey has procured for you, you little
					think of the privations to which you have subjected us, unfortunate Reviewers;
					compelled...to subsist for a week on half our usual allowance of ‘broth
					and bullock's liver' in order to afford the expensive publication of 41 octavo
					pages of a ‘rivulet of text flowing through a meadow of margin'” (13
					[n.s. 3]: 88-9). Even as the Tories reasserted governmental control with the
					establishment of the Regency, the Whig intellectual power, articulated in the
						<title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> and in the rising economic
					discourse, shifted the battle into a cultural war.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I want to glance briefly at one final article. When Henry Pye died
					in 1813 and the office of Poet Laureate fell vacate, the following application
					was made to the Lord Chamberlain: “Having many hours of idleness upon my
					hands, and being an adept at versification, it would not be unacceptable to me
					to try the experiment of writing the Laureate Odes” (13 [n.s. 3]: 246) The
					author's rationale was that “Being in politics between a Whig and a
					Jacobin, the subject of our Sovereign's praise will have so much of the Romaunt
					in my eyes, as sufficiently to resemble that species of composition in which I
					am most successful.” Signed simply “ Byron,” the
					signature is in marked contrast to the next applicant, who ends, <quote>
                     <l>I am,</l>
                     <l>My Lord,</l>
                     <l>With the utmost gratitude,</l>
                     <l>Respect, and admiration,</l>
                     <l>Your Lordship's</l>
                     <l>Most obedient, devoted,</l>
                     <l>And very humble servant,</l>
                     <l>
								W.
								Wordsworth.</l>
                  </quote>
					This parodic
						Byron argues the value of the Laureateship will be to “kill the
						<emph>ennui</emph> by which I am devoured”; he maintains that
					“Wine I now loath—money I detest—praise is irksome to
					me—and the world only one dull round of apathy and misanthropy.”
					Just as the earlier Byron of <title level="m">Hours of Idleness</title> positions poetic
					production as a form of self-amusement, this Byron positions the laureateship as appropriate for
					him, precisely for his indifference to its rewards. By comparison, Wordsworth's sample poem is a
					montage of various poems, remarking: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l rend="indent2">

                     </lg>
                  </quote>These two applications are among the “twelve” that the
						<title level="j">Satirist</title> denotes as the best among the thousands
					made. Among the applicants were Walter Scott and Robert Southey. Walter Scott's
					letter is among the most financially astute: “I begin to be afear'd that
					the Booksellers will soon think meet to retrench in the purchase of my
					ballads,” so “I submit my claims to your judgment, as a Candidate
					for a hundred pounds sterling per annum, and a butt of good sack,...on condition
					of furnishing a certain quantum of rhyme, at which your Lordship may have heard
					I possess great alacrity.” This is a great image of the competitive
					marketplace of fame, matching Scott, Southey, Byron, and others against one another. It is, alas,
					like the fabulous image from the 2002 <title level="j">Observer</title> that
					begins Tom Mole's book on Byron's fame, of girls
					screaming at his poetry readings (xi; presumably to Ringo's back beat). Neither
					happened. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Lamb's reaction to
							Byron, so often
						reproduced as hysterical, seems an apt stand-in for these imagined fans.
							Clara Tuite's <title level="a">Tainted Love and Romantic Literary Celebrity</title> provides
						a nuanced account of that encounter which "does not subordinate Lamb to
							Byron's version
						of their affair or to Byron's canonical authorial power" (61) and so complicates
						psychological models by demonstrating a complex rhetoric of fame.</note>
					There was, of course, no application process for the Poet Laureate, but in
					imagining it, the <title level="j">Satirist</title> constitutes poetry as a
					professional market, allied tightly with other government offices. Its proposal
					is to form a committee of the twelve best, to replace the single laureate (and
					divide the emolument evenly among them to curtail expenses). When Walter Scott
					received, to his declared surprise, the offer of the Poet Laureateship, he
					declined and, with apologies, wrote Southey that he had hinted to Croker that
					Southey should take up the laurel. Of course, the closest Byron came to the
					laureateship were his satires on and of Robert Southey. But Mr. Satirist, if
					making up the scene, caught the emerging dynamic of the literary marketplace,
					and—caught in it as he was, with his own journal on the financial
					ropes—recognized the need, the gain, even the inevitability of bringing
					the poets—even Lord
						Byron who had refused the profits of his first works—into its
					sphere. Such competition provided both a ready comparison and a proxy for the
					political skirmishes between Whigs and Tories. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Although any literary contact between Byron and Clarke
						seems to have petered out, in the back of John Agg's <title level="m">
							Lord Byron's
							Pilgrimage to the Holy Land</title>, a two canto poem published as if by

							Lord Byron's

                        <emph> Living in Style;, Or, The Miseries of Infidelity. A Satirical
								Novel</emph> By Hewson Clarke, Esq.</title> Worldcat shows no record
						of this particular work, but its title makes an intriguing final comment
						upon Byron. (A later
						advertisement announces an "Account of the Cause and Separation of Lord and
						Lady Byron, with some interesting Anecdotes of his Lordship, never before
						published.")</note> If the initial skirmishes I have traced can be viewed as
					the juvenile squabbling of two under-achieving Cambridge students, their
					escalation into battles on and of the national stage signaled not only the
					maturing of George Gordon, Lord
						Byron, a minor, but of his rivals and the poetic marketplace.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay investigates how the concept of fandom might make sense
					of a reading practice that emerged in the romantic period, the practice of
					visiting places associated with authors and their works in order to re-read
					their works in situ. Focussing on Lady Frances Shelley as a typical romantic
					literary tourist, the essay considers the ways in which she (and by extension
					others) produced new constructions of reading and the reader in response to the
					emergent figure of the romantic author. Shelley's various accounts of visiting
					romantic locales associated with Rousseau, Scott and Byron not only provides a
					conspectus of possible tourist-stances and practices but suggests that romantic
					readers strove to represent themselves on a footing not only of intimacy but of
					social equality with the author, re-establishing a sense of a coterie audience
					in the face of the realities of an increasingly heterogenous mass reading
					public.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>[The research and writing of this
					article were supported by a grant from the Australian Research
					Council.]</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>So Henri Beyle recalls his
					introduction to Lord
						Byron in Milan in October
					1816 in the theatre of La Scala, in the box of Beyle's friend, Monsieur Ludovic de Brême:
					“I entered M. de Brême's box on my return from an excursion on Lake
					Como. I found that the gathering had a sort of solemn and awkward air: everybody
					was silent. I was listening to the music when M. de Brême said to me,
					indicating my neighbour, 'Monsieur Beyle, this is Lord
						Byron'.” (Lovell
					196) At this moment, Byron is freshly exiled and just arrived in Italy, trailing
					scandalous celebrity and the opening flourishes of “[t]he pageant of his
					bleeding heart” (Arnold,
						<title level="a">Stanzas</title>) that came with the separation from his
					wife, Annabella Milbanke, the ensuing public scandal, and the flight from
					England. After travelling via Switzerland, where he stayed with Percy Bysshe and
					Mary Shelley at Lake Geneva, Byron has been just over a week in Italy, where he was to live for
					the rest of his life. Beyle, also in exile, has been mainly in Milan since 1813, when he took leave from Napoleon's
					army after the retreat from Moscow, and where he would spend the next seven
					years. When they meet, Monsieur Beyle is still just Beyle, not yet 'Stendhal,' as he will soon become when he adopts this pseudonym for
					the first time as the author of <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence in
						1817</title> (1817), in which he will recount a different version of this
					first meeting with Byron—one of many, as it turns out, in private letters and
					published texts.</p>
                  <p>While Monsieur Beyle is
					still Beyle, Lord Byron is for Beyle very much the author
					identified with his works: “At that time I was mad about <title level="m">Lara</title>. From the second glance, I no longer saw Byron as he really was,
					but as I thought the author of <title level="m">Lara</title> should be”
						(Lovell 196). Here, Beyle registers both the
					power and the radical partiality that marks the gaze of the fan, in the form of
					this “second glance” and its prerogative to wilfully misread. Beyle's “second
					glance” enacts what D. A.
						Miller has referred to as the “Stendhalian eros [that] would
					seem to depend on love plots engendered from misjudgements and blind spots.
					Error, as it were, permits the narrateable movement of errantry (wandering,
					elapsing, delaying) in which finally comes to lie the erotic” (225).
					Indeed, Stendhal's fondness
					for irony means that he congenially <emph>throws</emph> such blind spots and
					errors to his correspondents and readers as though they were gifts. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Stendhal's generous capacity for error in relation to dates, for
						example, is registered in the letter to Colomb, where the meeting of October
						1816 is misremembered as occurring in “the autumn of 1812” (see
							Lovell 196), and in the
						famous misdating of the 1816 meeting that is included in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</title>. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This essay examines the love plots and errantry that proliferate in Stendhal's recollections of
					his meeting with Byron.
						Stendhal's work and
					life (and the intermediating code of “<foreign xml:lang="fr">beylisme</foreign>”) is associated most famously with “<foreign xml:lang="fr">la chasse au bonheur</foreign>” (“the pursuit of
					happiness”). As I wish to suggest, Stendhal's recollections of Byron are marked by the
					happy over-investment of affect that has come to be identified with fan
					practices. A significant feature of Stendhal's account of the meeting is that his emotion
					is produced after the event, in the act of recollection. The recollections
					embody, then, a typically Stendhalian concern with the fraught interrelation
					between desire and memory. For the historical figure of Henri Beyle has offered the
					consummate allegory of the distortions of memory, and of the contradictions
					between reason and feeling that memory dramatizes. In W. G. Sebald's historical fiction, <title level="a">
						Beyle, or Love is a
						Madness Most Discreet</title> (included in <title level="m">Vertigo</title>), Beyle is
					made to offer “eloquent proof of the various difficulties entailed in the
					act of recollection” (Sebald
					5). Likewise, the fan Beyle
					who meets Byron embodies
					love as a madness most discreet: “if I had dared, I would have burst into
					tears and kissed Lord
						Byron's hand” (
						Lovell 196).</p>
                  <p>In the first full-length biography of Stendhal, <title level="m">
						Henry Beyle (otherwise
						De Stendahl [sic]) A Critical and Biographical Study</title> (1874), Andrew Archibald Paton foregrounds such
					contradictions between reason and feeling as vital to his subject: “Beyle was a man of genius,
					but he had a hundred irresistible impulses which could not be squared with
					reason” (9). <note place="foot" resp="editors">
						Paton's biography
						displayed a certain contradictory charm itself, as Henry James noted in a review in the <title level="j">Nation</title> (17 September 1874): “It contains hardly
						an opinion which is not ludicrously erratic, and hardly a quotation, a
						foreign phrase, or a proper name which is not misspelled or misprinted. But
						the author writes with a garrulous <foreign xml:lang="fr">
							bonhomie</foreign> —that of an easy-going cosmopolite ...
						—which will soften the edge of the reader's displeasure; and he is to
						be thanked at any rate for bringing Beyle once more before the world” (James 187). </note> As I wish to
					suggest, it is precisely such “irresistible impulses” that make up
					the affective repertoire of fan culture. And nowhere are these impulses offered
					more readily than in these recollections by Stendhal, the master of memory and emotion. Stendhal's response to Byron is informed both
					impulsively and masterfully by a withholding or disguising of emotion. As Henry James wrote in his
						(<emph>un</emph>withholding and rather mixed) review of Paton's biography, Stendhal's work has
					“that singular something ... —a kind of painful tension of feeling
					under the disguise of the coolest and easiest style” (James 189). The beauty of the
					impulse, and its significance as a way of illuminating fan practices, is that it
					occupies a liminal position between the desire to act and the act itself. By
					narrowing the distinction between desire and act —as mere as “a wave
					of excitation in the nerve” (OED) or an “influence acting upon the
					mind” (Johnson 1: 954)
					—the category of the impulse enables a focus upon the mobility and
					changeability of desire. In this way, Stendhal's impulse to burst into tears and kiss Lord Byron's hand is both
					expressed and checked.</p>
                  <p>The impulse is a very similar emotional creature to the sensation. Stendhal was a keen follower
					of the sensationalism of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">idéologues</foreign>
					— materialist philosophers and psychologists such as Condorect, Condillac,
					Tracy, and Stendhal's
					revered Cabanis, the physician and materialist philosopher from whom he borrowed
					his “woman's skin”: “I will borrow for an instant the language
					of Cabanis. I have too fine a skin, a woman's skin ...; I graze my fingers,
					which are very fine, for a trifle; in a word, the surface of my body is
					feminine” (Stendhal,
						<title level="m">Life</title> 120). Revolutionaries and Republicans with a
					total system that conceived of personal happiness as an effect of political
					liberty, the <foreign xml:lang="fr"> idéologues</foreign> disregarded the
					question of classical form when it came to literature and emphasized the effect
					of the literary work upon reason, sensibility and imagination —its status,
					in other words, as sensation.</p>
                  <p>As I will argue in this essay, Stendhal's emphasis on sensation is also legible in relation to the
					forms of celebrity culture. Stendhal's recollections of Byron offer a different way of approaching the classic
					Stendhalian affective repertoire of sensation; the pursuit of happiness; the
						<foreign xml:lang="fr">mal du siècle</foreign>; and the intrigued and
					intriguing engagement with memory and love. I read Stendhal's recollections as
					the revelatory staging of a close encounter between celebrity and fan, and I
					argue that Stendhal's
					recollections suggest how practices of sensation can be understood as part of
					the affective routines of the fan that are such a vital part of celebrity
					culture. This essay explores, then, this constellation of interests in memory,
					sensation and love, by examining Stendhal's recollections of Byron in relation to the productivity and affectivity
					of the fan. Hence, my emphasis is primarily on the fan, Stendhal, rather than on the
					celebrity, Byron.
					Focusing on the meeting between Stendhal and Byron as a particular form of ritualized sociable encounter in the
					box at La Scala, I examine how Stendhal's recounting of this meeting enacts celebrity culture's
					transformation of stranger to intimate, and how the fan-celebrity relation
					between Stendhal and Byron is mediated both by
					the social materiality of place and by a shared devotion to another contemporary
					idol, Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
                  <p>Stendhal's recollections
					come to us in various textual forms, and are produced over about fifteen years
					from 1817—1832, in private correspondence, autobiographical fragments and
					published texts (collected in Lovell 1954: 196-206). <note place="foot" resp="editors">

						and Florence in 1817</title> (1817), all of these accounts take their place
					within the flood of published recollections that appear in the wake of Byron's death in April

					“recollections of Byron,” which included recollections by such figures as Thomas
					Medwin, Lady Blessington, John Galt, Thomas Moore and, some time later, Teresa
					Guiccioli. Stendhal's
					recollections, like those of almost everyone else, did not go uncontested. In
					particular, John Cam Hobhouse,
						Byron's closest
					friend and executor, who accompanied Byron during these encounters in Milan, described Stendhal's eye-witness account, <title level="a">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">
							Lord Byron en
							Italie, récit d'un témoin oculaire</foreign>
                     </title> (1830), as “a tissue of fictions.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">
						Hobhouse is quoted from an
						undated MS in the John Murray archive in Doris Langley Moore's <title level="m">The Late
								Lord Byron:
							Posthumous Dramas</title> (372). See Moore, Chapter XI, “An Imaginative
						Frenchman,” 372-95. Moore's highly unsympathetic account of Stendhal takes its cues
						from Hobhouse and reads
							Stendhal's
						recollections as “published exploitation” (374). For an analysis
						of Hobhouse and Moore, see Jonathan Keates's biography
							<title level="m">
							Stendhal
						</title> (186-94). Keates
						traces the chronology of textual production of the different versions of the
						meeting, and claims that “[t]here is no hard evidence ... with which
						to catch Stendhal in
						quite so blatant an act as that of faking Byron” (190). For his part, Byron wrote to thank
							Stendhal for the
						praise he received in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence</title>:
						“Sir, At present, [now?] that I know to whom I am indebted for a very
						flattering mention in the 'Rome, Naples, and Florence in 1817, by Mons.

						fit that I should return my thanks ... to Mons. Beyle, with whom I had
						the honour of being acquainted in Milan in 1816.” (Genoa, May 29, 1823, <title level="j">BLJ</title> 10: 189) Byron also took the opportunity to defend Walter Scott against the attack

						[Stendhal, <title level="m">Correspondance</title> II: 175]). In this essay, deciding the

					transcriptions of Byron's conversations. I am interested rather in the significance of
					these memories as participants within a new culture of celebrity encounter, and
					seek to engage their productive and necessarily inventive power.</p>

                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>The meeting between  
							Stendhal and 
							Byron was destined to be: a match made in heaven on account of
						worldliness, a shared love of Napoleon, a keen interest in the fraught pains
						and pleasures of amorous memory, and in sensation. Sensation, after all, is
						what Stendhal found in
						the poetry of Byron:
						“Since my first childhood imaginings, I have found a sensation,
						comparable by its immensity and its tenacity, triumphing over all other
						memories, only in the poems of 
							Lord 
								Byron
						” ( 
							Stendhal
						<title level="m">Roman Journal</title>, 21). With this marvellous billow of
						ambiguity that attends the Romantic invocation of childhood, Stendhal suggests both
						that the sensation of 
							Byron's poetry is the only thing that compares with
						“childhood imaginings” <emph>and</emph> that even childhood
						itself could only imagine the “sensation” that Byron's poetry later
						realized. Here, the poems of 
							Lord Byron are not so much the secondary
						compensation for a lost childhood as the sensation that Stendhal has been
						searching for since childhood. 
							Byron's poetry is the long-lost discovery that
						transcends “childhood imaginings,” even as it is augured and
						desired through them. 
							Byron's poetry is the sensation that makes this precocious life
						worth the wait. In such a way,  
							Stendhal suggests, 
							Byron retrospectively creates his readers and
						authors their earliest and most precocious longings.</p>
                  <p>As Stendhal eloquently
						elaborates, it is the sensation of the poetry itself, and not the moral or
						the truth it represents, which matters, and which so moved Byron's early readers,
						for better and worse. As a later reader, Matthew Arnold, wrote in one of his tributes
						written in that ambivalent moment of 
							Byron's re-evaluation that occurs around 1850: <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l rend="indent2"> He taught us nothing; but our soul</l>
                           <l rend="indent2"> Has <emph>felt</emph> him like the thunder's
									roll.</l>
                        </lg> (<title level="a">Memorial Verses, April 1850</title> 270)
						</quote> In this aptly sensational meteorological figure, Arnold suggests how
							“Byron's
						force” (272) licensed the deeply participatory reading practices that
						privileged the corporeal and emotional effects of the poetry upon the reader
						(“With shivering heart ... with reverential awe”). A privileged
						topos of celebrity culture is reading —private, transportable and what
							Jacques Rancière
						terms “random” reading experiences (Rancière 14), and the sensations that are
						affected through these reading experiences.</p>
                  <p>The culture of celebrity that 
							Byron's poetry both authorizes and is expropriated
						by places a premium on sharing such readerly sensations with the author
						himself: “As I told him [
							Byron] this one day in Venice, quoting <title level="m">The Giaour</title>, he replied, 'That is why it is full of
						dotted lines. The moment the experience of the age of reason can attack one
						of my images, I abandon it, I don't want the reader to find the same
						sensations in my work as at the Stock Exchange'” (Stendhal, <title level="m">Roman Journal</title> 21). Here, as Byron is made to
						corroborate the fan's sensation, he produces a distinction between reason
						and sensation and adopts a characteristically anti-commercial stance.
						Ironically, these very sensations that 
							Byron identifies as constitutively opposed to the
						Stock Exchange are in fact dependant upon such commercial institutions. For
						it is only through highly-developed capitalist relations of production and
						consumption that the particular sensations of print culture and celebrity
						culture can be disseminated as the commodified cultural pleasures
						“full of dotted lines” that they are. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> On 
								Byron's relation to the commercial entailments of fame and
							celebrity culture, see Manning, Christensen and Mole. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against the clichés of celebrity culture as gushy and excessive, Stendhal's meeting with
							Byron is marked
						primarily by “timidity” and suggests an encounter that is
						restrained, discreet and even courtly. Indeed, it is so restrained that
							Stendhal is
						rendered speechless: “Since the conversation had languished, M. de
						Brême sought to make me speak. This was impossible for me” (Lovell 196). But even in
						silence, there is cliché and emotion and gushiness enough. For when
							Stendhal recovers
						himself sufficiently to be able to speak, he goes on to share with Byron “the
						finest conversation I have ever known in my life; a volcano of new ideas and
						generous sentiments, so mingled that one believed himself to be enjoying
						them for the very first time” (
							&gt;Lovell 198). Recounting this moment of the social sublime, Stendhal subtly draws
						attention to the difference between illusion and reality, and between the
						past moment of high emotion and the present moment of sober recollection.
						However, he also suggests that this distinction is barely legible and, in
						the end, rather negligible. For the impulse of the passage is to catapult
						the speaker and the reader of the present moment of recollection back into
						the past as experienced.</p>
                  <p>
						Stendhal's
						recollections of 
							Byron offer an abbreviated form of “the exact and
						scientific description of a brand of madness” that is produced in
							Stendhal's 1822
						work <title level="m">Love</title> (
							Stendhal, <title level="m">Love</title> 25). As
						with <title level="m">Love</title>, 
							Stendhal's recollections work to demonstrate the
						specificity of literary representation as distinct from scientific
						description, but they also show how nonetheless emotion can be imbricated
						with cognition. The cognitive literary critic Patricia Waugh has referred to the unique capacity
						of literature to “embody ... the problem of knowledge” by
						enabling the tension between the subjective and objective points of view to
						be experienced (Waugh 1999:
						51, 52). Stendhal's
						recollections do this too. By inhabiting, in the form of the recollection,
						both the first-person and third-person perspective, and thereby splitting
						the subject between present and past, they enable the tension between past
						and present to be experienced. This suggests an alternative way of
						approaching Stendhal's
						famous disrespect for chronology. Far from casually disregarding chronology,
							Stendhal was
						acutely aware of chronology as a rhetorical convention of narrative —
						indeed as a rhetorical effect of narrative —and displayed this
						awareness in direct addresses to the reader: “After all these
						observations, I will now be born” (21), he writes in his
						autobiography, <title level="m">The Life of Henri Brulard</title> (completed
						in 1836 and published posthumously in 1890). In this way, he draws attention
						to the tensions and distortions between past and present that are created by
						the act of retrospective narration.</p>
                  <p>We know, then, that these “new ideas and generous sentiments”
							Stendhal claims to
						enjoy in conversation with 
							Byron can't be so new, if 
							Stendhal is not enjoying them for the first time.
						But what really matters here is the feeling itself —the sensation.
						This sensational affective regime of the fan is a fetishistic regime. For
							Stendhal's
						statement —“a volcano of new ideas and generous sentiments, so
						mingled that one believed himself to be enjoying them for the very first
						time” —does not so much produce a redeeming and enlightening
						epistemological distinction between the original and the copy, reason and
						emotion, as recapitulate what Slavoj Žižek refers to as “the
						formula of fetishism”: “I know, but nevertheless ...”.
							<note place="foot" resp="editors"> These are the words
								(“<foreign xml:lang="fr">Je sais bien, mais quand
								même</foreign>”) of Octave Mannoni's famous patient in

							113-116. </note> (<emph>I know that I was not experiencing these ideas
							and sentiments for the very first time, but nevertheless</emph>.) Such a
						vindication of affect in the face of disbelieving reality works to
						consecrate the entry into social life of the intense affectivity of fandom,
						or what Stendhal's
						contemporaries termed “idol worship.”</p>
                  <p>Fandom would seem to proceed, then, according to the fetishistic logic that
							Naomi Schor refers to as
						“a perpetual oscillation between two incompatible beliefs”
							(Schor 114). It is this
						logic of fetishism that  
							Stendhal's narrative draws attention to in that earlier moment
						when he says: “At that time I was mad about <title level="m">Lara</title>. From the second glance, I no longer saw Byron as he really
						was, but as I thought the author of <title level="m">Lara</title> should
						be.” This is both the knowledge of hindsight (<emph>Only now do I
							realize I no longer saw 
								Byron as he really was</emph>), and the knowledge that is
						fetishism's disavowal (<emph>I knew my 
								Byron was the Byron I thought he
							should be rather than the 
								Byron he was, but nevertheless</emph>).</p>
                  <p>
						Stendhal's
						recollections participate in the genre of the celebrity sighting or what
							Chris Rojek has referred to
						as the “out-of-face encounter” between celebrity and fan (17).
						As the dynamic of presence and absence is critical to celebrity affect, the
						textual revisitation of the “out-of-face” encounter is about
						staging the author's presence as a moment of private life and staging
						familiarity with the author. The genre of the celebrity sighting dramatizes
						celebrity culture's preoccupation with embodiment, which is predicated upon
						distance (see Rojek 12). As
						such, it engages one of the most striking ironies of celebrity culture,
						which is that the desire for intimacy increases as access becomes more
						unattainable and distance greater. For this reason, technologies of
						simulation become more prolific in the labour of transforming the distant
						celebrity stranger into an intimate, predicated as they are upon the
						disavowal of the distance that they in fact materialize. The genre of
						“conversations of 
							Byron” speaks to celebrity culture's premium upon
						embodiment and authorial presence, and to a certain disavowal of textual
						mediation. As  
						Stendhal's conversations speak the genre, they present the
						exquisitely productive power of textual mediation in conjuring authorial
						presence.</p>

						Stendhal's celebrity
						sighting of Byron is
						a moment of high emotion. Most significantly, this is a moment of emotion
						shared between two men, one of whom presents himself with the intensity of a
						lover. This moment encapsulates a particular intensity of emotion that
						informs the proverbial devotion of fan to idol, and which mimics the
						gestures and emotional intensities of Romantic love. Stendhal's episodic
						narratives mimic, too, the narrative that Roland Barthes has analysed in
							<title level="m">A Lover's Discourse</title> as the “scene”
						of “love at first sight”: <quote rendition="#indent2"> the first
							thing we love is <emph>a scene</emph>. For love at first sight requires
							the very scene of its suddenness (what makes me irresponsible, subject
							to fatality, swept away, ravished): and of all the arrangements of
							objects, it is the scene which seems to be seen best for the first time:
							a curtain parts: what had not yet ever been seen is discovered in its
							entirety, and then devoured by the eyes: what is immediate stands for
							what is fulfilled: I am initiated: the scene <emph>consecrates</emph>
							the object I am going to love. (Barthes 192)</quote>
                     <lb/> In Stendhal's
						love-at-first-sighting of 
							Byron, the scene is set at La Scala, Milan, where the curtains part, and what takes place
						off-stage —more precisely in the box of M. de Brême —is
						moved to centre-stage. (“I entered M. de Brême's box on my return
						from an excursion on Lake Como. I found that the gathering had a sort of
						solemn and awkward air: everybody was silent. I was listening to the music
						when M. de Brême said to me, indicating my neighbour, 'Monsieur Beyle, this is Lord
						Byron'.”)</p>
                  <p>As Michael Moon notes of
						Barthes' scene of ravishment, the scene of love-at-first-sight requires not
						so much the “beloved-at-first-sight” as “the scene
						itself” (Moon 6). For
							Stendhal, as he
						writes in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence</title>, it was love at
						first sight for the scene itself a few weeks earlier, when he returned to La
						Scala after a brief absence from Milan, but presents it as though for the very first time,
						devouring it with his eyes: <quote rendition="#indent2">I was limp with
							exhaustion; but I dragged myself straight off to La Scala ... and there,
							at one stroke, lay the justification of my journey. My senses were so
							weary that they were beyond the furthest reaches of pleasure. Yet all

							may evolve, all that is most baroque and most bizarre, all that is most
							sumptuous in architectural devising, all that can be made to live and
							breathe through the soft brilliance of draperies, all that can be coaxed
							into reality through the symbolism of characters who have not merely the
							costume, but the very faces and gestures of their make-belief and alien
							lands ... all this and more have I seen tonight.</quote>

						and card playing, in movable chairs by the railing, or on the cushions of

								Benjamin Walton notes, Rossini was “the
								Scott, Byron or Napoleon
							of music, depending on the fancy of individual critics” (Walton 82). Despite
							Rossini's enormous popularity, however, in 1816 he endured the
							scandalous failure of the first performance of <title level="m">The
								Barber of Seville</title> in Rome on Feb 26 1816. (The second
							performance, in Bologna, was a big success.) Stendhal writes about
							the episode in his <title level="m">Vie de Rossini </title> (1823),
							itself a scandalously plagiarized text “cribbed” from
							Guiseppe Carpani's <title level="m">Rossiane</title>. See Walton on the mixed
							reception of Rossini in London. To note another Napoleonic intertext:
							Rossini's father, the town trumpeter, very famously welcomed the
							Napoleonic troops into their northern Italian town, a gesture for which
							he was later thrown into jail after the Habsburg restoration of 1796.

						“La Scala has revived <title level="m">Elena</title>, an opera by
						Mayr... . Dear God, how dull it seems! Yet what wild enthusiasm still
						survived to greet the <emph>sextet</emph> in Act II! ... There is genius in
						such a passage: old Mayr must have saved it up from the days of his youth,
						or else pilfered it where he chanced to light upon it. Alone, this passage
						rescued the entire opera from disaster” (21). Byron too it seems was

                  <p>For all its ravishing social sublimity, the celebrity sighting delivers
						nevertheless an emphatically different kind of ravishment to the
						love-at-first-sighting. The celebrity sighting is very much a second sight,
						a “second-order intimacy” (
							Turner 92-3), the deliriously misprisioning sight
						of what Stendhal refers
						to as the “second glance.” The celebrity is always already
						known, and so a certain belatedness is at play. Such belatedness also marks
						the post-Napoleonic social, affective and psychic armature of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">mal du siècle</foreign>, that constitutive feature of
						French Romanticism, with its nostalgic but inhibited desire for the great
						gesture, compromised by suspicion of gallantry (see Brookner, <title level="m">Romanticism</title>, 41ff).</p>
                  <p>
						Stendhal's biographer,
							Paton, would beg
						to differ from a reading of the meeting between Stendhal and Byron as a scene of
						ravishment and idol worship: “But 
							Beyle was not on his knees before Byron, as if he had
						been an idol, like thousands of others, whose admiration of his verses made
						them blind to all the personal defects of the man; and Beyle tells us roundly
						that those who saw him close at hand considered him haughty, and even a
						little mad” (
							Paton 1874: 122). Indeed, in another recollection of Byron, the 20 October
						1816 letter to Louis Crozet,  
							&gt;Beyle refers to 
							Byron as “the original of Lovelace,” and, in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</title> (1817), as
						“the most amiable monster that I have ever seen” (quoted in
							Lovell 196). Celebrity
						affect is, after all, an ambivalent mode of affect. “The purpose of
						gossip about celebrities,” as Graeme 
							Turner points out, “is not to elevate or
						idealize them as exemplary individuals” (107); it is about
						“modelling, fantasy and identification” (Gamson, quoted in Turner 110). As a practice of
						the fan's identity work, gossip involves, then, the production of identity
						through <emph>dis</emph>-identification as much as identification with such
						amiable monsters. The fan's obsessive preoccupation with the private life of
						the celebrity necessarily entails revealing the bad, the mad and the
						dangerous to know. And, as it turns out, there is quite a lot for Stendhal
						<emph>not</emph> to like about 
							Byron. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> On
								Byron's
							character flaws,  
								Stendhal writes that “Lord Byron could
							have pardoned Napoleon more easily if he had had a little of the
							colourlessness of Washington. Amusingly, it was not at all the despotic
							and odious part of Napoleon's character which displeased the English
							peer” (Lovell 197).
							He also presents a 
								Byron jealous of Brummell: “in his moments of
							dandyism, he always pronounced the name of Brummell with a mingled
							emotion of respect and jealousy” (201). </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In any case, as we already know, 
							Beyle
						<emph>was</emph> on his knees inside the box of M. de Brême, if only in
						the form of the repressed impulse expressed in the letter to his cousin,
						Romain Colomb: “I was filled with timidity and affection: if I had
						dared, I would have burst into tears and kissed Lord Byron's
						hand” (Lovell 196).
						This is love at first sight —or, at least, “second glance”
						— and he is rendered speechless by the <foreign xml:lang="fr">coup de
							foudre</foreign> of this first sighting. But this speechlessness too is
						an active structuring impulse, just as his “timidity” reflects
						the impulse acting on him as a “wave of excitation in the
						nerve.” Whilst this restraint holds 
							Beyle back from outwardly going on his knees for
							Byron, the
						withheld emotion is later displayed in the autobiographical disclosure:
						not-daring-to is purely rhetorical, for 
							Stendhal does dare, if only in the disclosure. In
						this way, Stendhal's
						disclosure produces one of the ironies of the affect of the fan: that a
						moment of the display of intense emotion can also be a moment of
						withholding. Stendhal's
						disclosure thereby dramatizes a certain complication of the distinction
						between private feeling and public display that is central to the workings
						both of celebrity affect and the poetry of Byron as it is read.
							Byron's life and
						work habitually inspired such displays of emotion, such reworkings of the
						boundaries between public and private, and the spectacularly rhetorical
						disclosures of the heart that he referred to in <title level="m">Don
							Juan</title> as “The truth in masquerade” (XI, 37, 290,
							Byron 1986:
						476). A feature of that rhetorical sophistication is that Byron's poetry, to
						borrow Jerome McGann's
						memorable formulation, “is always, at whatever register, elaborating
						reciprocities with its audiences” (McGann 85-6).</p>
                  <p>Celebrity culture enables —indeed would seem to demand —the
						mimicry of Romantic love, even in the space of a relationship between two
						men. (So much so that the cultural and discursive genre we refer to as
						“Byromania” also involved elaborate recantations, usually on the
						part of mature authors, such as Edward Bulwer-Lytton and Benjamin Disraeli,
						who looked back on their love of 
							Byron as a youthful folly [see Elfenbein].) But what kind
						of relationship between two men? In underscoring the proximity of the fan's
						devotion as a form of love and “Stendhalian eros,” I am not
						suggesting that  
							Stendhal's revelatory staging of intense feeling for Byron is intended as a
						kind of unmasking of himself and his feeling as self-evidently homosexual
							<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Not that Stendhal does not
							have his own homosexual fans, such as the openly homosexual Second
							Empire dandy Jean Lorrain (1855-1906), who paid his homage by adopting
							the effeminate, diminutive <emph> nom-de-plume</emph>
							“Stendhaletta”. As Rhonda Garelick writes, the
							“[h]eavily rouged, powdered, openly gay” Lorrain, who
							presented himself not as a man of fashion but as a <foreign xml:lang="fr">femme du monde</foreign>, was also the author of an
							initiatory fashion text that identifies fashion with cultural memory,
								<title level="m">
                           <foreign xml:lang="fr">La nostalgie de la beauté</foreign>
                        </title> (1912). See Garelick 43-6. Proust challenged Lorrain to a duel
							after Lorrain publicly implicated Proust as a homosexual. See Nye 122-3. </note> —or
						even indeed as definitively <emph>sexual</emph> (as though what is being
						revealed here is a knowable and consolidated sexual identity rather than the
						desiring play of eroticised identifications and investments) —although
						it is certainly, in all its mobility and intensity, very queer. And even
						though Paton's image
						of Stendhal
						<emph>not</emph> on his knees suggests Leo Bersani's “seductive and
						intolerable image of a grown man, legs high in the air, unable to refuse the
						suicidal ecstasy of being a woman”, that is, of “getting
						fucked” (<title level="a">Rectum</title> 212), unable to refuse the
						pleasures of “self-divestiture” (<title level="m">Homos</title>
						128), and of willingly sacrificing disciplined self-mastery for
						“self-shattering and solipsistic jouissance” (<title level="a">Rectum</title> 222).</p>
                  <p>The affect of the fan is proverbially like that of the lover, but also
							<emph>un</emph>like, perversely freighted as it is with all kinds of
						mobile identifications, impulses and intensities of emotion and desire that
						exceed the boundaries of traditional masculine homosociality and
						subjectivity yet which are not to be overdetermined by sexuality. The
						affective and discursive practices of Romantic fandom are vitally
						significant because they usher this impulsiveness into sociability, into a
						world where impulse is legible, meaningful and valuable, for all its
						contradictions. 
							Byron's scandalous celebrity licenses such perversity and
						inspires a re-imagining of author-reader relations, endowing them with new
						pleasures and sensations. The fandom it generates is a productive affective
						and social economy that spectacularizes the transformative agency of the
						reader. Far from entailing an exclusively passive position (in docile thrall
						to the sovereignty of author and text), fandom can be seen to transform a
						traditional textual economy of active and passive, thereby enabling
						reception as a mode of delirious productivity —proliferating often
						disobedient and indiscreet disclosures —as Stendhal's fan practices
						demonstrate in abundance.</p>

						Stendhal's numerous
						recollections are characterized by repetition, the habitual revisiting and
						restaging of the scene of the first sighting, and the connoisseurial
						selection and discrimination of “moments” to recount —
							Byron's
						“moments of genius” as well as more “prosaic
						moments” (Lovell 197).
						This devotional practice involves the multiplication of nuance and detail,
						to compare and contrast, enabling the obsessive return to the scene of
						encounter. As I mentioned earlier, these versions did not go unchallenged.
						In the years after 
							Byron's death, John
							Cam Hobhouse, 
							Byron's closest friend and executor, was fierce in his attempts
						to regulate the posthumous accounts that flooded the market, as well as the
						letters and memoirs that enabled people to profit from these memories.
						(Having said that, 
							Hobhouse's position was complicated and somewhat compromised by
						his own vested interest in always having to be seen to be Byron's first-best
						friend.) <note place="foot" resp="editors">
							Hobhouse's role in the
							destruction of 
								Byron's memoirs and the publication of Moore's subsequent
								<title level="m">Life</title> is illuminating here, suggesting how
							fraught this position could be. 
								Byron had originally given Moore the MS of his
							memoirs to raise money. Moore opposed the destruction of the memoirs (a
							campaign which 
								Hobhouse initiated and completed within three days of
							learning of 
								Byron's death), and wrote his <title level="m">Life</title>
							of Byron, which
							brought in the money that would have been his from the memoirs. 
								Hobhouse seems to have
							been a little bit jealous of Moore for having been entrusted with the
							MS, which possibly makes him suspect Moore's motives. As
								Hobhouse wrote in the
								<title level="a">Narrative of Events Connected with the Destruction
								of Lord
									Byron's Memoirs</title>, “Lord Byron made a
							present of himself to Mr. Moore, and Mr. Moore sold his Lordship to the
							booksellers” ( 
								Hobhouse III: 331). And in his diary of 14 May 1826:
							“Moore owned very frankly to me that he would make a book to get
							the money he wanted, but not a book of real merit as a Life of Lord Byron... . I
							am sorry that circumstances have made this interview necessary, but as I
							feel that Byron
							certainly intended a benefit to Moore, I cannot but assist him in some
							degree to gain his 2, 000 out of 
								Lord Byron's memory. That is his motive; he has
							no other.” (
								Hobhouse III: 134-5). &gt;
								Hobhouse also had to contend with the publication of a
							collection of “religious conversations” with Byron as
							“one of the thousand and one squabbles which my intimacy [has]
							entailed upon me” (IV: 81). For a detailed analysis of this
							episode, see Hamilton.
						</note> As “keeper of the flame,” 
							Hobhouse could claim at least a legal obligation or
						entitlement to regard all memories of 
							Byron as a form of property. Less convincing are
						contemporary critics of celebrity who (without such cause) would naturalize
						this traditional economy of authorial sovereignty whereby the authorial
						image is understood to be the exclusive property of the author and to be
						controlled by the author. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Recent
							legal theory has challenged this idea of publicity as a form of
							property. As David Lange
							points out, “if the right of publicity was to be a new species of
							property it could in theory devolve and descend forever” (154).
						</note> As my account departs from such an understanding, I emphasize the
						expropriation of the author by the fan. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> The authorial image, like the star image, as Richard
							Dyer points out, includes “what people say or write about him or
							her, as critics or commentators, the way the image is used in other
							contexts such as advertisements, novels, pop songs, and finally the way
							the star can become part of the coinage of everyday speech” (3).
							Hence, the authorial image is not the exclusive property of the author
							nor is it controlled by the author. </note> For it is the fan who is the
						foregrounded subject, even in the gesture of self-abnegation: <quote rendition="#indent2"> what I know concerning that singular man is only
							the memory of what I have felt in his presence. How does one give an
							account of a memory without speaking of self, and how dare one speak of
							self after having named 
								&gt;Lord Byron? (
								&gt;Lovell 197)</quote>
                     <lb/> How dare one speak of self, but
						speak of himself  
							Stendhal does and must. In this spectacular subordination of fan
						to celebrity, the beloved celebrity is made over into the creature or the
						darling of the fan, through the self-same gestures of revelation that stage
						intimacy between 
							Byron and “self,” distinguish Stendhal as a fan and
						mark Byron with
						those distinguishing features of 
							Stendhal's love. What we see is Stendhal's display of the
						supreme prerogative of unveiling authorial presence, Stendhal's staging of
						privileged access,  
							Stendhal's narrative manipulation of the dynamic of presence and
						absence that is critical to celebrity affect's preoccupation with
						embodiment. In this way,  
							Stendhal's rendition of the Byronic conversation and
						recollection proceeds like the fan website, with the “interpolation of
						autobiographical example ... [implicitly declaring] this is my site, my
						contents ... my way” (Hoxter, quoted in Hills 91).</p>
                  <p>The meeting between 
							Byron and  
							Stendhal is a close encounter between celebrity and fan, a
						sighting of the celebrity. But it is also a moment of social presentation:
						being introduced to a stranger. This drama of social presentation involves
						reading that stranger through social signs. For his part, Byron initially gets
						these signs wrong, as  
							Stendhal coolly informs us in <title level="a">
							Lord Byron en
							Italie</title> (1830): <quote rendition="#indent2"> [Lord Byron] had
							been informed that in the course of the evening he would probably be
							introduced to a stranger who had performed the celebrated campaign of
							Moscow, which still possessed the charm of novelty, as at that time we
							had not been spoiled by any romances on the subject. A fine-looking man,
							with a military appearance, happening to be one of your party, his
							Lordship naturally concluded that he was the hero. (quoted in Lovell 200)</quote>
                     <lb/>
						The “hero” is not the “fine-looking man, with a military
						appearance,” but  
							Stendhal, <note place="foot" resp="editors">
							Stendhal the man
							may not have had the “military appearance,” but his
							sentences do, as Anita Brookner suggests, in her subtle and appreciative
							account of  
							Stendhal's gift for a peculiar kind of emotion constrained by
							formality: “Hence too the depth and subtlety of the emotion which
							eventually goes into the novels disguised or wrapped up in short,
							military sentences” (<title level="m">Genius</title>, 36). </note>
						so Byron is
						mistaken. But only temporarily: “The next day, however, Byron was undeceived
						... [and] did me the honour to address me on the subject of Russia”
							(Lovell 200).</p>
                  <p>The moment in the box is a moment of high emotion, but it is also constrained
						—and enabled —by social ritual. As we have seen, Stendhal's response to
							Byron is
						informed by a withholding of emotion: “if I had dared I would
						have.” However, this not-daring “timidity” is also an
						active structuring impulse, in play with “affection,” for Stendhal is
						“filled” with both. To conceive of fandom as a form of social
						ritual is to understand it as something more than a debased, excessive,
						inauthentic mode of emotion. Rather, it is to see it as a complex form of
						social modernity, aligned with new modes of social performance and
						presentation, affect and publicity, and to see it as an exemplary form of
						intimate publicity. For what marks the particular encounter between Stendhal and Byron is both the
						intensity of emotion and also the restraint with which it is controlled and
						produced: the ritualization of that emotion. As the social theorist Erving
						Goffman has suggested, “When in the idol's immediate presence we act
						with ritual care” (quoted in Smith 28).</p>

                  <p>We act with ritual care, but also with a sense of strategy. For once the
						introduction between  
							Stendhal and 
							Byron has been made, strategic skirmishes ensue on the subject
						of the recent Anglo-French hostilities. As

							idolized Napoleon, and replied to his Lordship [Byron] as I should

							firmly and mentioned the hulks where the English had tortured French
							prisoners of war, of the deaths of Russian emperors, happening always at
							such a convenient time for English interests, of infernal machines, etc.
							etc. Our friends in the box imagined that the discussion which had taken
							place, and which, though polite and respectful on my part, had been
							rather warm, would prevent any further intimacy between us. They were
							mistaken. The next evening his Lordship took me by the arm, and walked
							me for an hour in the saloon of the Theatre de la Scala.</quote>
                     <quote rendition="#indent2"> (<title level="a">Lord Byron en

                     <lb/> This passage
						elaborates a gradual transformation from stranger to intimate, as each man
						is required to negotiate the often oblique social signs that the other puts
						into circulation. It is about the tactical manoeuvres of social affect and
						social intimacy, which involve emotional withholding: giving out coldness
						when one feels warmth. But it is also about the expectation that this
						paradoxical coldness will be read, and worked through, as indeed it is, when
							Stendhal discovers
						that Byron is not
						the typical “member of the legislative assembly who had exiled the
						ex-emperor to St Helena. I subsequently discovered that Lord Byron was at once
						enthusiastic in favour of Napoleon, and jealous of his fame.” This
						mutual love for Napoleon explains in retrospect that intriguing paradox of
						social emotion: “My determination to be cold offers some explanation
						for the marked kindness with which at the end of a few days, Lord Byron did me the
						favour to regard me.”  
							Stendhal is determined to be cold, and this results in kindness
						from Byron. Why? The
						discovery of a shared Napoleon-love not only rescues and redeems an awkward
						social moment, but also reconfigures the co-ordinates of a map of first
						impressions shared by the two men that assumes national identity to
						determine political identification. After the discovery, Byron rewards Stendhal with kindness
						for his loyalty to Napoleon, even when that loyalty has entailed coldness
						toward himself. The exchange is about the enigma of making a connection
						through being cold.  
							Stendhal's friends think they won't be friends but they are
						wrong, for Byron has
						taken his arm.</p>
                  <p>These meetings occur in a relatively circumscribed social space, the theatre
						box of M. de Brême, an intriguing figure who as a consecrated priest,
						almoner of the ex-king and leader of the Italian Romantics, mixed exotic
						forms of Italian social and cultural capital. Clearly charmed, 
							Hobhouse gives a detailed
						account of his first impression of <quote rendition="#indent2"> Monsignore
							Lodovico de Brême, one of Napoleon's almoners for the Kingdom of
							Italy, whence his title. The son of a noble Piedmontese family, destined
							for the Church, who has been offered two bishoprics by Napoleon and one
							by the people, but wishes rather to unfrock himself than to put on the
							mitre. He is a young man about thirty, wears his dark hair combed
							upright, which gives him a wildness of expression not unlike that of
							Alfieri [the Italian Romantic poet]. He is, on the whole, one of the
							most attractive men I ever saw. He gave Lord Byron a most
							warm reception, and as Madame de Stäel had introduced me to him in
							her letter in favourable terms, was pointedly civil to me. He spoke with
							a certain degree of point on every subject, delivering his apothegems
							and ironies in the gravest tone, which made him quite irresistible.
								(Hobhouse I:
							40-41)</quote>
                     <lb/> Unable to resist, we might say smitten, 
							Hobhouse has his own moment
						of love-at-first-sight. Heady fan-love is in the air, and the scene takes on
						the aspects of a mid-summer Shakespearean romance of mistaken identities,
						multiple love objects and deliriously mobile desires, all predicated upon
						what René Girard refers to
						as the “idolatrous worship of otherness” (197). A sucker for
						grave ironies, Hobhouse
						sees in Brême the same combination of social, cultural and physical
						power associated with the Byronic aura. Brême’s “wildness of
						expression not unlike that of Alfieri” also mediates the Byronic aura
						(as Alfieri's likeness to 
							Byron was noted by contemporaries [see <title level="j">BLJ</title> 9: 11]). It is as though 
							Hobhouse here displaces his own desire for Byron via Alfieri onto
						Brême, who is himself drifting in the homosocially shared trancelike
						obsession with Byron
						that he sponsors in his box. In this series of displacements, the cycle of
						mimetic desire is routed first through 
							Byron and now through Brême, to produce two
						couples of admirer and admiree: 
							Beyle and 
							Byron, 
							Hobhouse and Brême, with Napoleon and to a lesser extent
						Alfieri mediating idols in between.</p>
                  <p>This circle of love recalls another one tenderly fantasized by Byron barely two years
						before, when he had written to 
							Hobhouse to break the news of his engagement to Annabella
						Milbanke. This extraordinarily moving letter entwines Byron's most gentle
						and optimistic feelings for Milbanke (“my intended”, before she
						becomes “ <emph>that woman</emph> ” [<title level="j">BLJ</title> 5: 120]) within a textbook illustration of homosocial
						triangulation, when 
							Byron asks Hobhouse to be witness to the ceremony in the same breath as
						expressing the fond wish that he too might be married, so that they might
						share the experience, “like people electrified in company through the
						same chain” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 4: 213). As it turned out,
							Hobhouse witnessed the
						marriage, the bitter separation and the never-ending degradation of
						“my intended,” Annabella Milbanke, into “the bitch my
						wife” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 95), “that infernal
						fiend” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 129), that “<foreign xml:lang="it">Porca buzzerena</foreign>” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 131), or sodomite sow.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Louis

						early weeks of exile, 
							Hobhouse joins hands to witness the electric chain of fan-love
						with the adoring Italian Romantics. As he wrote after Byron's death,
						“No human being could approach him without being sensible of this
						magical influence” (Hobhouse III: 41).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Earlier in 1816, just before coming to Milan,

								Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley and Claire Clairmont from May
							until August. As 
								Byron was to write of this summer of love, when Shelley
							“dosed” him with Wordsworth as he was writing <title level="m">Childe Harold III</title>, “I was half mad during the time of
							its composition, between metaphysics, mountains, lakes, love
							inextinguishable.”</note> However, as he also knew, especially as
						keeper of the flame, the magical current generated by this Byronic
						“electrified company” could also turn. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> And turn it did, quite badly, with the Italian
							Romantics. The morning after the magical night of October 1816 came in
							July 1818, when 
								Hobhouse's <title level="a">Essay on the Present Literature
								of Italy</title> appeared as part of his <title level="m">Historical
								illustrations of the fourth canto of Childe Harold: containing
								dissertations on the ruins of Rome; and an essay on Italian
								literature</title> (London: John Murray, 1818) and contained not a
							single mention of the irresistible Brême. Brême wrote to Byron to indicate
							his displeasure, and then 
								Hobhouse wrote back to 
								Byron: “Di Breme may be damned! ... Breme
							is vexed because I have ventured to tell some disagreeable truths about
							poor dear Bonaparte and because I have said nothing about his behissed
							comedy. You had better tell him so and then you will succeed to your
							heart's content in making him hate me as much as you have made me hate
							him” (quoted in Vincent 21). In fact, the author of the “Essay”
							was not Hobhouse but
							the exiled Italian patriot and poet Ugo Foscolo, whom Hobhouse had met in
								London, and who agreed to
							write the “Essay” on the condition of secrecy about his
							authorship. 
								Byron himself seemed to enjoy the falling out between Hobhouse and Brême.
							As he wrote to 
								Hobhouse on 3 August 1818, “Enclosed is Breme’s scrawl
							... he gives you devilish bitter words —and I long to see you by
							the ears —that I do.—” (<title level="j">BLJ</title>
							6: 63). And as he wrote to Guiseppino Albrizzi, the son of Countess
							Albrizzi, a major Venetian hostess, known as the Madame de Staël of
							Italy: “Tell Hobhouse —his letter to De Breme has made a great
							Sensation —and is to be published in the Tuscan &amp; other
							Gazettes” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 91). </note> As Girard writes, “the
						disquieting infrastructure of mimetic desire” entails the
						“necessarily jealous and conflictual nature of mimetic convergence on
						a single object” (197). Jealousy is alive and well for Hobhouse, both in Byron's life and
						death, and he was notoriously jealous of other pretenders (such as Thomas
						Moore) to the title of Byron's first-best friend (see Hamilton). Despite these rivalries, he acknowledged
						that Byron's
						“power of attaching those about him to his person was such as no one I
						knew possessed” (Hobhouse I: 41).</p>
                  <p>
						Girard writes about the love
						triangle using fan-love —the “idolatrous worship of
						otherness” —as his model for all desire. Likewise, what Bersani
						says about sexual desire also holds true of fan-love in this giddy scene of
						homosocial desire: “Displacement is endemic to sexuality” and
						“sexual desire initiates, indeed can be recognized by, an agitated
						fantasmatic activity in which original (but from the start, unlocatable)
						objects of desire get lost in the images they generate” (221). The
						confusion is such that objects of hero worship become confused with
						appropriate objects of desire. Napoleon was particularly vulnerable to such
						confusions and displacements, and offers the exemplary case in point here.
						The case is dramatized with spectacular force and piquancy in the bedroom
						farces of Stendhal's
							<title level="m">The Red and the Black</title> (1830), where a portrait
						of Napoleon hidden under the bed of Julien Sorel in the home of his
						Ultra-Royalist employer is mistakenly thought to be a portrait of an
						unidentified secret lover, and Hazlitt's <title level="a">Liber Amoris</title> (1823), where H.
						is simultaneously the rival of a bust of Napoleon for the affections of S.,
						“She is my heart's idol,”, and the rival of S. herself for that
						precious little bust of Napoleon, “the god of my idolatry”
							(Hazlitt 45, 28).
						Struggling in the box at La Scala to maintain the line between homosocial
						and homoerotic desire, it is perhaps just as well that, as Stendhal writes,
						“The company there assembled consists entirely of men of letters. No
						woman ever passes the threshold” (Stendhal, <title level="m">Rome</title> 64). And
						sure enough, Stendhal
						presents Byron
						“declin[ing] the honour” of introductions to the
						“assemblage of lovely women as that which chance had collected in
							Milan” (Lovell 202).</p>
                  <p>This is, then, a highly gendered, male-homosocial space. It is an
						aristocratic social space, but also a cosmopolitan one, and a specifically
						Italian form of cosmopolitanism, as Stendhal is at pains to point out, noting the
						social genre of meeting in the box of the aristocrat as a particular form of
						Italian warmth and informality: “This Italian custom, not generally
						followed in France, banished all ceremony. The affectation that chills the
						atmosphere of a French saloon is unknown in the society of Milan.” As his dismissive
						remarks about French social custom underscore, Stendhal, like Byron, is in happy
						self-exile from his own country (“his blood / Is all meridian”
							[<title level="a">Stanzas to the Po</title> ], and he will eventually
						have inscribed on his gravestone “Arrigo Beyle, Milanese”). In this congenial setting, Stendhal and Byron rewrite the
						hoary old script of chilly Anglo-French hostilities into a congenial
						dialogue of transnational camaraderie, hosted by the Italian informality of
						the box of M. Brême, which welcomes exiles, and the saloon of La Scala.
						They too might have been trapped as prisoners of memories of war, but they
						move beyond these dim, shabby “hulks” into the light, bright and
						airy, liberal and cosmopolitan, space of the box at La Scala. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> As a radical Whig who opposed the Congress
							devised by the Liverpool administration, Hobhouse also thrived in this space: “A
							persuasion that I am of the Liberal English and, more than all, have a
							hatred of the Congress Castlereagh system, gives me a willing audience
							in this place, which is not elsewhere found, at least I have not found
							it” (Hobhouse
							II: 47). </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meeting between Byron and Stendhal dramatizes the poignant liminality of this historical
						moment when Stendhal,
							Byron and
						Napoleon are all freshly exiled, Napoleon himself living on in the period
						that can only just be referred to as post-Napoleonic, so that Stendhal's store of
						Napoleonic reminiscences “still possessed the charm of novelty”
							(<title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence,</title> 1817, quoted in
							Lovell 200). The spectres
						of “hulks” and torture and “infernal machines” of
						recent military conflict, that loom early in the conversation and chill the
						air (making it “rather warm” in the sense of unfriendly),
						disintegrate under the spell of an ecumenical Napoleonic aura that banishes
						these bad memories and baleful animosities as so many gloomy ghosts at the
						table. This reminds us of the powerful mediating force that Napoleon was
						throughout Europe as “an embodiment of liberty and opposition to
						monarchical power” (Bainbridge 137) both while he was in power and
						after. (Of course, Napoleon was also for many the contemporary embodiment of
						despotism. And Byron, who could be full of adoration for Napoleon, was also of
						course famously ambivalent about him and so could be very critical too. But
						that's another story.) <note place="foot" resp="editors"> This
							ambivalence is manifest in the <title level="a">Ode to Napoleon</title>
							(1814), written on the occasion of the first abdication. For a
							compelling analysis of Byron's ambivalent relation to Napoleon in the
							“Ode” and elsewhere, see Bainbridge 134-52. On the diversity
							of views amongst English sympathizers with Napoleon, see the classic
							study by E. Tangye Lean,

								Diasaffection 1760-1960</title>. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For all his later attacks on Stendhal, Hobhouse —also a lover of Napoleon —entered a highly
						appreciative account in his diaries of the anecdotes that Stendhal gave them of
						Napoleon. Stendhal, who
						had been in charge of dispatches, tells of the Emperor Francis carefully
						cutting the seal off dispatches from Napoleon for his Minister, and then
						“rubbing it against his clothes, smelling it, and giving it its due
						praise. The eagle was well done, the sword perfect” (Hobhouse I: 52-3). He tells
						of how Napoleon “never would pronounce the word Kaluga” (a key
						site in the retreat from Moscow), “but called it sometimes Caligula,
						sometimes Salamanca,” and how “[h]is attendants, who knew what
						he meant, went on writing or listening without making any remark”
						(53). And he tells of how he was there during the retreat from Moscow
						(“as the reader of any given five pages of his writing will not fail
						to discover” [James
						188]), and of how during the retreat “the soldiers burst into
						tears” (54).</p>
                  <p>In this encounter in the box at La Scala, the stranger who is being
						introduced is well-known at a distance but can still be introduced into a
						relatively closed circle, according to traditional social protocols. As
						such, the encounter dramatizes a transitional moment in the history of
						celebrity, which is the transition between the domain of the social and what
							Chris Rojek refers to as
						the “para-social”, interactions that occur at a social distance
						with people we don't know (Rojek 52). This is not strictly an interface between the poet
						and the anonymous public, for the box of M. de Brême is a kind of
						liminal space between the traditional, known audience of social equals, and
						the wider, anonymous public that literature is moving towards. It is an
						extremely privileged social space, too, that mixes old social class and old
						money. As Stendhal
						observed, “A box at La Scala is treated as freehold property, like a
						house, and may change hands for as much as twenty-five thousand
						francs” (Stendhal, <title level="m">Rome</title> 24-5). Indeed, after the
						original theatre of Milan (the
						Teatro Regio Ducale) had burned down in 1776, it was the owners of the boxes
						who lobbied Archduke Ferdinand to build a new one, and it was the sale of
						new boxes that financed the building of La Scala to replace it. The box at
						La Scala emblematises the particular conjunction of social, economic and
						cultural power that M. de Brême embodied.</p>
                  <p>Not only Byron, but
							Byron's poetry
						itself charms the box of M. de Brême, as their host M. de Brême
						points out: “So keenly are his works relished by those of his friends
						who know English that, without ever mentioning it, we are endlessly showing
						him our private admiration” (
							Lovell 206). This reserve about Byron's poetry is
						maintained apparently even despite the fact that they have an Italian poet
						in their midst, “the celebrated Monti,” who “graciously
						recited [his poetry] for us,” and who puts “Lord Byron ... in
						raptures.” So relished, so precious is Byron's poetry that it
						has the power to become an object of the unspoken in this circle of socially
						elite men who count a poet among their number. They negotiate this desire,
						and Byron's charm,
						through feats of “private admiration.” Again, like Stendhal not daring to
						kiss Byron's hand,
						we see another form of restraint in this meeting with Byron. As we've seen,
						celebrity culture works not always or only in terms of the spectacular
						displays of outrageous affection. It is marked, too, with the protocols of
						an elite social culture of discretion. And 
							Stendhal's discretion is rewarded. For, after the
						poetry recitation: “From that day, I passed almost every evening with
							Lord
						Byron” (Lovell
						197).</p>

                  <p>In Stendhal's 1829
						letter to Colomb, Byron and Stendhal make their farewells at the end of a delightful
						evening. The recollection is marked by one last moment of self-deprecation,
						as Stendhal responds to
							Byron's request
						for street directions: <quote rendition="#indent2">
							Lord Byron asked
							me, as the only one who knew English, to tell him the names of the
							streets that he would have to pass through on the way back to his inn.
							It was at the other end of town, near the fortress. I saw that he would
							go astray: in that part of Milan, at midnight, all the shops were closed. He would
							wander amidst empty and ill-lit streets, and without knowing a word of
							the language! In my devoted affection I was so foolish as to advise him
							to take a carriage. At once a shade of haughtiness passed over his face:
							he gave me to understand, with all necessary politeness, that what he
							wanted of me was the names of the streets, and not advice as to how to
							use them. He left the box, and I understood why he had reduced it to
							silence. (Lovell
							196)</quote>
                     <lb/> In this brilliant moment, when Stendhal advises Byron to take a
						carriage, Stendhal
						fantasizes being Byron's chaperone, and Byron a stranger in need of protection. Byron declines his
						advice, and the anecdote ends as it opened with Byron reducing the box
						to silence. Another masterful Stendhalian ending that eludes closure:
						returning to the anecdote's beginning —to that “sort of solemn
						and awkward air” and that fraught form of silence that opens the
						encounter —the ending transforms this awkwardness by turning it into a
						moment of comedy.</p>
                  <p>But the story does not end there, for there are other versions of that
						evening that end more optimistically and keep the electrified company there
						despite Byron's
						departure. Later that very same evening, as the 1824 letter to Louise S.
						Belloc recounts, Byron strolls with Stendhal around the “immense and solitary foyer of La
						Scala.” This time, Byron is successfully transformed from stranger into intimate.
						Again, memories of Napoleon are the currency of this transformation, which
						is aided by the social lubricant of their mutual devotion: <quote rendition="#indent2"> I had the good fortune to excite his curiosity, in
							giving him some personal details concerning Napoleon and the retreat
							from Moscow, which in 1816 were not yet commonplace. This species of
							merit procured for me many strolls tête-à-tête, in the
							immense and solitary foyer of Scala. (Lovell, 197-8)</quote>
                     <lb/> Once again, the
						curtain parts, and the scene of the fan's love at second glance is
						consecrated. The supreme transformation of the stranger to intimate occurs
						as Stendhal and Byron share
						“strolls tête-à-tête.” What we also note, as the
						curtains part, is the particular kind of social space that stages—and
						houses—this transformation from stranger to intimate: “the
						immense and solitary foyer of Scala.” This paradoxical figure
						encapsulates marvellously the transformative effect of celebrity as a mode
						of publicity, a mode of intimacy, a mode of public intimacy. That this
						immense public social space should also be nonetheless so
						“solitary” enables it to host and to hold and to bear witness to
						all the paradoxes of intimate strangeness that attend the meeting between
							Byron and his
						enraptured fan of “a hundred irresistible impulses.”</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay investigates how the concept of fandom might make sense of a reading practice that emerged in the romantic period, the practice of visiting places associated with authors and their works in order to re-read their works in situ.  Focussing on Lady Frances Shelley as a typical romantic literary tourist, the essay considers the ways in which she (and by extension others) produced new constructions of reading and the reader in response to the emergent figure of the romantic author. Shelley's various accounts of visiting romantic locales associated with Rousseau, Scott, and Byron not only provides a conspectus of possible tourist-stances and practices but suggests that romantic readers strove to represent themselves on a footing not only of intimacy but of social equality with the author, re-establishing a sense of a coterie audience in the face of the realities of an increasingly heterogenous mass reading public.</p>

               <p>As Eric Eisner has remarked, the Romantic period saw an unprecedented explosion of
					what we would now recognise as “fan practices”: “admirers collected autographs, souvenirs, portraits, and relics
					of celebrity writers, artists, performers, military heroes, and athletes;” “visited the homes and haunts of
					celebrities;” imitated celebrities, and fantasised about becoming their intimates; wrote fan mail, and formed communities of
					like-minded devotees (“Introduction”). Taken together, these practices arguably mark the beginning of what would
					become a mass-cultural phenomenon over the later nineteenth century. This essay therefore addresses itself to a series of
					questions which transfer some of the preoccupations of recent scholarship on contemporary fandom back to the moment of its
					inception. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Scholarship of what we might broadly consider “literary” fandom
						has hitherto largely concentrated on modern popular cultural artefacts rather than the consumption of celebrity authors,
						perhaps because with a couple of notable exceptions such as J.K. Rowling, authors are not today’s super-celebrities.
						Fandom has largely been discussed in relation to such disparate genres and cult phenomena as Hollywood film, soap opera,
						science fiction, <title type="m">Star Trek</title>, <title type="m">The Lord of the Rings</title>, Harry Potter and <title type="m">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</title>. Fan magazines, fictions, canons, discourse, identities, communities, and
						practices have been written about from a variety of perspectives ranging from the psychological to reader response. </note>
					Specifically, what different modes of demonstrating appreciation were precipitated around literary figures between the 1770s and
					the 1830s? How might the concept of “fandom” help us to make sense of one enduring material reading practice that
					became newly prominent at this time—namely, the practice of visiting places associated with authors and their works in order
					to re-read texts <foreign xml:lang="la">in situ</foreign>? And how might attending to that practice of fandom illuminate further
					the development of a new reading culture in the period?</p>
               <p>To attend to the fan rather than the celebrity (although, as I’ll be discussing below, the two are sometimes one and the same
					person) is a relatively novel departure for romantic scholarship. Understandably, perhaps, romantic scholarship has found it much
					more attractive to identify or ally itself with two variant forms of romantic authorial celebrity, the neglected genius,
					associated especially with Keats, and the sexy superstar, embodied by Byron. As an academic, it is particularly seductive to ally oneself with the figure of the neglected genius writing
					for posterity, a figure which, as Andrew Bennett has noted, is the default setting
					for romantic poetics; after all, many of us are neglected geniuses ourselves, teaching a rather unenthusiastic posterity. The
					persistent interest in romantic authors’ self-depiction as suffering constitutively or playfully from an anxiety of
					authorship is another variant of this critical tendency. <note place="foot" resp="editors">For an influential study of Scott’s anxiety of authorship, for example, see 
							Ferris.</note>Alternatively, in the climate of today’s celebrity culture, it has become
					possible to rediscover Byron as a necessary precondition for Mick Jagger,
					as the first famous poet to inspire certain modes of feeling on an international scale. <note place="foot" resp="editors">For studies of Byronic celebrity see, for example, Watson
						<title type="a">Transfiguring;</title>
						Wilson; Mole.</note>Tellingly,
					even the scholarship on Byron’s celebrity has displayed a marked
					tendency to twist away from the fact of his huge fame to concentrate instead upon the ways in which (allegedly) Byron never fully or willingly occupied it, preferring to ironise his
					massively popular public persona in a suitably “romantic” and, let it be whispered, attractively elitist and
					aristocratic fashion (see Christensen; Bennett). The scholarship on Byron’s
					celebrity additionally typically, if inexplicitly, describes the madness that endeavouring either to master or emulate Byron might threaten; how much safer and more respectable to be his 
						Hobhouse than to be just another one amongst his many unhappy shadowers, amongst
					them Caroline Lamb, Claire Clairmont, John Clare, and Samuel Egerton Brydges. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> For John Clare’s relation to Byronic celebrity, see, for example, 
							Martin, Goldsmith; for Lamb
						see Watson, Soderholm; for
						Wilson see Watson. </note>(The alternative available role, to construct
					oneself as an efficient and commercial sponger off the noble Lord in the manner of a Harriette Wilson, Leigh Hunt or a John
					Murray, is probably nearer the mark for the modern critic, but possibly represents an even more unwelcome and unromantic
					construction of the academic enterprise.) Such writing on Byron has only partially acknowledged that there is no such thing as the
					celebrity without the fan; as Eisner notes, literary celebrity “is not simply
					one form of authorship, but rather…a form of the relationship between writers and readers” (Eisner 3). If and when the fan <emph>is</emph> acknowledged, he or she often appears as a flattering
					avatar for the scholar, a special, tormented, and intimate soul (Soderholm). In
					short, the fan is an embarrassment, and the fan in the academic even more so. Supposedly naïve, obsessive, desirous, and
					dangerously predatory, the fan has arguably hitherto been the abjected of the history of romantic culture and of romantic
					criticism itself, both in criticism written during the period and that produced since.</p>
               <p>My focus in this essay, however, is on the case-history of a romantic fan who was neither naïve, obsessive, desirous, nor
					predatory (shortcomings which, may, of course, disqualify her from the status of fan in some eyes). Charming, lively, beautiful,
					humorous, well-read yet unintellectual, and a crashing snob, Lady Frances Shelley counted amongst the amusements of her life the
					pleasures of literary fandom. Her diary and letters, unpublished until the early twentieth century, supply a first-hand
					description of multiple instances of a particular mode of reading that emerged in the period—the idea of reading authors in
					and against places associated with them, combining literary connoisseurship with dilettante travel. Her accounts of this practice
					exemplify what a variety of site-specific modes of appreciating the literary the romantics developed, and they also suggest some
					of the disparate and unevenly operating factors that underlay them. My discussion therefore follows in her well-shod footsteps
					across England, Scotland, Germany, Switzerland and Italy over the years between 1815 and 1854, considering not only what she does
					say and do as a literary tourist, but what she doesn’t choose to do, for both are equally telling.</p>
               <p>I have chosen to concentrate on Lady Shelley as a central consciousness largely for her conventionality and typicality, something
					for which I imagine she would not have thanked me. Unhampered by literary ambition and anxiety, she was not weighed down by the
					need to produce competitively fine writing for a public beyond her own immediate circle; she was cheerfully unobsessed by any of
					the literary lions she met or pursued; and she was markedly mobile in her ability to occupy a variety of possible tourist stances
					and fan pleasures. Reviewing her diary and letters on their publication in 1912, the <title type="j">New York Times</title> took the view that she was not romantic or enthusiastic enough, remarking that
					“mostly the impressions are too matter-of-factly recorded, and lead one to conclude that Lady Shelley generally recorded
					inferences which others around her had expressed”; the writer was especially cutting about her account of her visit to Rousseau’s house on the Île St Pierre—“matter of fact
					and almost schoolgirlish.” These strictures usefully identify her as disappointingly commonplace in her sentiments and
					commentary. <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title type="j">New York Times</title> Sunday, August 12, 1912. </note>As such, she
					serves here as a conveniently representative case-study in romantic literary fandom of the fairly casual and thoroughly ordinary
					sort, always bearing in mind the proviso that, as I’ll be noting below, her stances and destinations are determined both by
					her class status as an aristocrat and by her gender.</p>
               <p>To attend to Shelley’s literary pleasures is to discover something of how romantic readers produced new constructions of
					themselves in relation to the emergent romantic author. Recent scholarship has been interested not only in the emergence of new
					models of authorship but in how this was produced in response to a new literary marketplace, a reading-boom, defined by a vastly
					expanded literacy and mass print-production. Although, following from Robert
						Darnton’s pioneering work, there have been a number of recent influential studies of romantic readership and
					romantic reading practices, most notably by scholars such as William St Clair and
						H.J. Jackson, scholarship has only just begun systematically to investigate how
					individual romantic readers constructed themselves as such in relation to the romantic author. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Particularly pertinent to my argument here is Robert
						Darnton’s essay <title type="a">Readers Respond to Rousseau:
							The Fabrication of Romantic Sensitivity</title> which explored the possibility of constructing a history of a new romantic
						reading experience through a case-study of one reader of Rousseau. Others
						have also described emergent modes of reading in the period. Altick looked at
						the emergence of a mass reading public; Sutherland early surveyed the
						reading-boom; Lynch argues that the trope of reading and re-reading in the
						contemporaneous novel is evidence that reading became a technique of romantic identity-production, noting “a new
						insistence on distinguishing between styles of reading and on propagating the decorums that separate one reader’s
						refined receptiveness to literary meanings from another, vulgar reader’s avid following of fashion” (127), an
						insistence that, as I shall be arguing below, characterises the contemporary discourse of literary tourism as well.</note>I
					have argued elsewhere that literary tourism developed in response to a variety of stimuli—the need to model the romantic
					self, for example, to which both Rousseau and Byron were so important; the desire to verify a national landscape mapped
					within a newly national literature; the desire to assert a fictional intimacy and kinship between the author and reader which
					bridged the alienation of print culture. But here I want to concentrate on the relation between the development of literary
					tourism and the development of the romantic reader. Shelley’s account of herself as a reader-tourist revealingly suggests
					that romantic readers strove to represent themselves as on a footing not only of intimacy but of social equality with the author,
					to re-establish a sense of a coterie audience in the face of the realities of a mass heterogenous reading public.</p>

					Fig. 1 Lady Frances Shelley. Frontispiece, Edgcumbe (1912). Author’s
					own collection.</p>
               <p>For those unacquainted with her, Frances Shelley was born in 1787, the daughter of Thomas Winckley of Preston and connected
						through her mother to the Dalrymples. Against her family’s advice, in 1807 she married Sir John Shelley, gamester,
						horse-fancier, and friend of the heir to the throne, with whom she seems to have been happy. She was thus a member of the
						upper ten thousand, with the entrée into the highest circles. A noted beauty, accomplished conversationalist, and an
						amateur musician with literary interests and connections (including her distant relative Percy Bysshe Shelley), she moved for the most part in high Tory circles. She was introduced to 
							Lord Byron through his sister, became a longtime intimate and passionate
						hero-worshipper (indeed a fan) of the Duke of Wellington, and was socially prominent enough for Victoria to come to pay her
						respects on her deathbed in 1873. Courtesy of these connections, in July 1815 she made her way to the Continent in pursuit of
						a long-held ambition and arrived at Paris in the immediate aftermath of Waterloo, where she met, amongst many others, Sir Walter Scott. Like many others, including 
							Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and their
						companions and hangers-on, she took the opportunity afforded by the cessation of war to travel to Italy via Geneva, her stay
						in the summer of 1816 coinciding with Byron’s occupancy of the
						Villa Diodati in Cologny; her tour of the locality corresponded at many points with the excursions that Byron was making with the Shelleys and 
							Hobhouse to sites associated with Rousseau and
						others, which he wrote up in <title type="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage III</title>. In 1819 she made the tour of
						Scotland, and, meeting up again with Scott, was invited to stay at his show-home Abbotsford,
						then in the throes of alteration and extension. In 1834, she made another trip to the Continent, and repeated it for one last
						time in 1853. On these trips she made a series of excursions to sites associated with poets of an earlier age—most
						especially to locales associated with Ariosto, Petrarch and Tasso —which she seems to have understood in part as
						repetitions of literary pilgrimages earlier made by Byron and recorded
						in <title type="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage IV</title>. and in this, again, she was thoroughly conventional for her
						time. In the course of these travels, she therefore traversed a variety of sites associated with three of the four romantic
						figures — Rousseau, Scott, Byron, and Burns—who elicited the highest
						levels of romantic fandom and tourism.</p>

               <head>II. On holiday with Rousseau, 1816</head>
               <p>Driving along the margins of Lake Geneva on her way from Besançon to Neuchâtel in 1816, Frances Shelley’s party
						passed through Môtiers-Travers. Môtiers-Travers was where Rousseau had spent some time living in retirement, where he received many visitors, including the young James
						Boswell, and from which he was, famously, driven out by the villagers in May 1765. In 1816, the house itself had shared that
						fame for some time, in large part because there were a number of important engravings in circulation which illustrated Rousseau’s <title type="m">Confessions</title> and represented his
						various houses, most particularly, the four volume publication by Jean-Benjamin de Laborde and Beat Fidel Zurlauben, <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                     <title type="m">Tableaux topographiques, pittoresques, physiques, historiques, moraux, politiques, littéraires de la
								Suisse</title>
                  </foreign>(c. 1784), which included no fewer than four engravings relating to Rousseau’s life in the village. (The publication in 1819 of de Last’s and Lameau’s <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                     <title type="m">Vues de differentes habitations de J.J. Rousseau
							</title>
                  </foreign>would expand this canon.) Shelley’s account makes it plain that she was aware both of the story and of the
						house. She notes that “we passed the house in which [ Rousseau ]
						had lived” (Edgcumbe 1: 219) and further remarks that “when we came to
						Motiers-Travers we longed to live there, and fully understood Rousseau’s regret at being driven from it” (Edgcumbe 1:
						219). Shelley’s self-placing as Rousseau is brief but typical of
						the self-representation of contemporary tourists. Such pilgrims aspired both to “be” Rousseau and to join the select club of those who could boast a sufficiency
						of Rousseauistic sensibility. However, the locus classicus for this sort of self-identification with Rousseau was not Môtiers-Travers but the little Île St Pierre,
						located in the Lac de Bienne, where Rousseau had spent a few short but
						idyllic months writing his <title type="m">Confessions</title> and collecting material for the <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                     <title type="m">Rêveries d’un Promeneur Solitaire</title>
                  </foreign>before being forced to leave there, too, in October 1765.

					Author’s own collection.</p>
               <p>The experience of visiting the Île St Pierre seems to have been particularly powerful for contemporaries—there is
						much more written about it than about any other Rousseau site—and
						looking at a few of the many visitors’ accounts extant allow us to get a flavour of the experience Rousseau’s many fans were seeking. Shelley’s own narrative of
						her visit may most usefully be understood in relation to the accounts of other contemporary visitors, who wrote about the
						experience at enthusiastic length. For example, Friedrich von
							Matthisson’s account of his trip to the Île, made some time between 1785 and 1794, makes plain the ways
						in which Rousseau’s autobiography powerfully mapped and narrated
						place for the tourist, allowing the recreational insertion of the reader-tourist’s body and sensibility within the
						author’s; Matthisson’s identification of the pleasures of
						reading “on the very spot” as a form of touristic “self-forgetfulness” as well as a self-amplification
						underscores how this reading practice was designed to meld reader and author together: <quote rendition="#indent2">How deeply
							were we affected with reading this most interesting writer’s description of St Peter’s Island on the very
							spot. What a melancholy delight did we feel in following his footsteps from the room he inhabited, to the orchard, where,
							with his bag girt round him, he often gathered fruit in company with his honest domestics: then to the hills, the meads
							and the groves where first, with Linnaeus in his hands, he studies the distinction of the genus of plants, till we come to
							the very spot on the shore, where on a fine evening he would stretch himself, contented and happy, with his eyes fixed on
							the flood, in the sweet calm of self-forgetfulness. (Matthisson
							522)</quote>
                  <lb/>Such representations of a ghostly figure of “Rousseau”
						as a double for the reader-tourist were common. So was the, at first glance, rather paradoxical construction of this
						experience as not simply one-to-one, but communal. The young German Friedrich
							Stolberg, for example, more explicitly describes a conversation with his friends on a very similar walk in 1791:
							<quote rendition="#indent2">
                     <lb/>Here, said we, did the pensive Jean
								Jacques ruminate. On this steep height, and, glowing with all the delightful sweets of rectitude, he
							contemplated the clear waters of the lake. Here he did calm his ardent sensibility, by viewing the dewy plants, which he
							took so much pleasure to collect. Under this rock, reclining in a boat, he touched the soft flute. Yonder is the
							diminutive island, which he peopled with rabbits: that small spot, which, comparatively, makes the mother island a
							continent...</quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <quote rendition="#indent2">As we left the island, we were awakened by the recollection of what must have been the sensation
							of Rousseau, when he was obliged to leave this place of refuge...
								(Stolberg 1:142-3)</quote>
                  <lb/>A third young man, Nikolai Karamzin, may serve as a final example, if
						only because he wrote at such length and performed these emotional evolutions so thoroughly. Visiting in 1790, he both
						simulates Rousseau by re-experiencing Rousseauistic emotions on the spot, and extends this to summoning a fanciful vision of the
						philosopher: <quote rendition="#indent2">
                     <lb/>Not long ago I went to the island of St Pierre, where the greatest writer of the
							eighteenth century took refuge from the wickedness and intolerance of mankind, which, like the Furies, drove him from
							place to place. It was a beautiful day. Within a few hours I had wandered about the entire island, seeking everywhere
							traces of Geneva’s citizen and philosopher, beneath the boughs of ancient beech and chestnut trees, in the beautiful
							walks of the dark forest, in the faded meadows and rocky prominences of the shore.</quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <quote rendition="#indent2">“Here” I thought, “here, forgetting cruel and ungrateful people—
							ungrateful and cruel! My God! How sad it is to feel and to write!—here, forgetting all worldly tumult, he enjoyed
							the tranquil evening of life in solitude. Here his soul rested from its mighty labours. Here he found peace in quiet and
							sweet repose! Where is he? Everything remains as it was, but he is gone —gone!”</quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <quote rendition="#indent2">Now I thought I heard the forest and meadow sigh, or were they only repeating the deep sigh of my
							heart? I glanced about me. The entire island seemed in mourning...I sat down upon the shore...My fancy imagined a boat
							gliding over the placid waters, moved by a gentle breeze which guided it in place of a helmsman. In the boat lay [the aged
								Rousseau,] a venerable old man in Armenian dress; his eyes, fixed
							on heaven, reflected a noble soul, depth of thought, and pensiveness. (Karamzin 162-3)</quote>
                  <lb/>
						Karamzin’s experience is wholeheartedly sentimental and pleasingly
						typical in its final fanciful summoning of Rousseau to inhabit the
						emptiness of the island in his daydream. The thoroughly paradoxical quality of this Rousseauistic tourist experience as at
						once empty, solitary, alienated, private, and “of the heart,” while nonetheless full, communal, performative,
						cosmopolitan, and print-based, is epitomised in Karamzin’s anecdote of
						his encounter with an equally young Englishman: <quote rendition="#indent2">
                     <lb/>As I sat meditating, I suddenly saw a young
							man, with a round hat pulled down over his eyes, approaching me with unhurried steps. In his right hand he was carrying a
							book. He stopped, looked at me, and said, “<foreign xml:lang="fr">Vous pensez à lui</foreign>.” Then he
							walked away with the same unhurried steps. (163)</quote>
                  <lb/> This moment when the solitary fan turns out to have company, and company of a congenial kind, demonstrates the way that
						this sort of fandom is imagined as ambiguously intimate <emph>and</emph> communal, original <emph>and</emph> derivative.</p>
               <p>The presence of others was in practice essential to the experience, because it described an exclusive club of admirers. This
						club was most vividly evidenced in the habit (prevalent before the institution of a visitors’ book) of writing lengthy
						inscriptions on the walls of the pavilion and of Rousseau’s
						bedroom. This practice of inscription on literary sites was widespread at the time; the sentimental graffiti on the Île
						St Pierre are especially well-documented and it is clear that Rousseau
						inspired a particular mode of verse-inscription which was designed to perform an intimate identification between author and
						reader to other readers. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a discussion of the practice of inscription and
							associated practices at writers’ graves as acts of readerly aggression, which makes a suggestive companion-piece to
							the practice I’m describing here, see Matthews. </note>Such
						verses universally describe a romantic privacy of physical encounter. The privacy was manifestly a fiction —not only
						were the inscriptions there intended for all to see who cared to look, but travellers’ accounts and later, guidebooks,
						often quoted them at length. Madame de Gauthier, for instance, who was
						sufficiently taken with the experience to visit the island not once but twice in 1790, transcribed many, waspishly calling
						them <quote rendition="#indent2">

                  <lb/>
						Sigismond Wagner’s guidebook, first published in 1798, reinforces
						this convention. Wagner had acted as guide to the island for a number of
						years, before writing it, so it is reasonable to assume that it embodies the tourist experience that was being delivered at
						the time. He describes “<foreign xml:lang="fr">une foule de noms et d’inscriptions, dont les murs de la rotunde
							sont couverts au-dedans et au-dehors</foreign>”, which, he says, “<foreign xml:lang="fr">attestent la vive
							impressions que ce lieu produit sur tous ceux qui viennent le visiter</foreign>” (Wagner 15) [“a mass of signatures and inscriptions, with which the walls of the rotunda are
						covered above and below...attest to the vivid impression which this place produces on all who come to visit it”]. He
						dwells upon the inscriptions both in the pavilion and the bedroom as evidence of the sheer volume of Rousseauistic experience
						supplied by the island to readers of many nationalities, but he also spends time listing the eminent names amongst these
						graffiti, including Pitt the Younger, Immanuel Kant, the Empresses Josephine and Marie-Louise, and Napoleon himself. Those
						inscriptions he chooses to transcribe are striking in their insistence upon tourism as romantic substitution and encounter,

						fans.</p>
               <p>Shelley herself made the trip on July 15 1816, a day characteristic of the awful weather of the summer of 1816. Her diary
						spends an unusually long time describing the locale: <quote rendition="#indent2">
							Rousseau’s room is merely four bare walls, with a stove in it.
							The house is very large, and stands alone on the island...In the centre there is a court, with open arcades on three sides
							of it. In the middle of the court flourishes a large lime tree, which casts its shade over the whole space. On the back of
							the court there is a wood, in which stands a small pavilion surrounded by grass, with oaks and beeches close at hand. In
							spite of the rain, we visited this spot. Alas! Our imagination was forced to supply the brilliant sunshine which would
							have enhanced its beauties. (Edgcumbe 1: 222)</quote>
                  <lb/>The torrential rain rendered the whole experience downright “unsentimental”: <quote rendition="#indent2">
                     <lb/>As we were determined to be gay in spite of the weather we amused ourselves by talking bad German to the peasants,
							and very unsentimentally ate bread and cheese, where Rousseau had
							lived and dreamed, and where he had, for a short time, enjoyed that idyllic existence which he loved. We returned, wet
							through... (Edgcumbe 1:223)</quote>
                  <lb/>Shelley’s playfulness about the failure of sentiment on this occasion nonetheless stands as a pointer to the
						experience that the Île St Pierre was supposed to promise, a sentimental location and recapitulation of Rousseau’s emotions and “idyllic existence,” conceived as

               <head>III. Scott At Home, 1819</head>
               <p>Rousseau’s ghostliness was both convenient and inconvenient to
						fandom. It was convenient in the sense that there was no obstacle in the shape of the living celebrity to the
						tourist-experiment of “being” Rousseau. Indeed, Rousseau’s ghost could be ventriloquised to approve of the romantic
						sensibility that these writers variously set out to inhabit and display, whether in handwritten inscriptions, in their letters
						and travel diaries, or through a full-blown print guidebook. It was inconvenient in the sense that, unlike a living celebrity,
						he could not be viewed and pursued in person. Death was not yet a drawback in the cases of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Byron, the leading
						poetic celebrities of the age. Shelley’s interest in both of these figures provides evidence of other possible modes and
						practices of fandom.</p>
               <p>In July 1819, Shelley renewed her hitherto slight acquaintance with the Minstrel of the North, and was subsequently invited to
						pay a visit to the literary lion’s show-home, Abbotsford, still under construction. Scott acted as her guide over Melrose Abbey, famous in itself, but also as the setting for part of
						his best-selling poem <title level="m">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title> (1805), and he also drove her over to Dryburgh
						Abbey, another favourite Gothic ruin (where he would eventually be buried). A few days were spent at Abbotsford, admiring the
						house, its curiosities, and the anecdotal and complimentary conversation of its owner, before leaving for Edinburgh.

               <p>Her diary records three remarks of note with regard to Scott. The
						first, made in August 1815 at Paris when they first found themselves in each other’s company at a picnic, endeavours
						with only moderate success to collate the poet with his poetry—an exercise in making romantic authorship in a way
						already possible around the Byron of <title level="m">The
							Corsair</title>: disappointed in his appearance (“not prepossessing...a club-foot, white eyelashes, and a clumsy
						figure. He has no expression when his face is in repose” Edgcumbe
						1:139), she was more taken with his talk, because it was more poetic: “His conversation reminds me of his
						poems—the same ideas and images recurring—and often the same careless manner of expressing them” (Edgcumbe 1:139). The second, made during her visit to the North, is a comment
						that the Border landscape owed all its charms to Scott’s powers of
						description, and that it was in danger of being in itself anti-climactic: <quote rendition="#indent2">
                     <lb/>There is not a spot
							mentioned by this romantic poet which does not owe its renown for beauty and charm to the exquisite description of it, as
							seen through his magic glass. As in a highly skilled miniature every blemish of complexion vanished without destroying the
							likeness, so is it with Scott’s descriptions. Although they are
							accurate, the poet heightens every beauty and conceals every defect. (Edgcumbe 2:43)</quote>
                  <lb/>This sense of viewing a visually uninteresting landscape made romantic purely by superimposed literary association was
						not confined to Lady Shelley; Washington Irving, visiting three years
						earlier, and undergoing much the same routine of guided visits, seems equally to have experienced the same initial
						disappointment in the landscape: <quote rendition="#indent2">
                     <lb/>I gazed about me with mute surprise, I may almost say, with
							disappointment. I beheld a mere succession of grey waving hills, line beyond line, as far as my eye could reach,
							monotonous in their aspect, and so destitute of trees, that one could almost see a stout fly walking along their profile;
							and the far-famed Tweed appeared a naked stream, flowing between bare hills, without a tree or a thicket on its banks; and
							yet, such had been the magic web of poetry and romance thrown over the whole, that it had a greater charm for me than the
							richest scenery...(Irving 17)</quote>
                  <lb/>The third remark of note that Shelley makes amplifies this sense of Scott’s “magic”, but characterises it rather less generously as the reader’s power to conjure
						up from the landscape, and Edinburgh in particular, fictional characters drawn from Scott’s oeuvre: “The Castle, Arthur’s Seat, and Salisbury Crags, conjured up fairy visions of
						historic, classic, and poetic interest, all equally absorbing. As in a vision, I saw one form succeeding another —the
						unfortunate Mary, the poetic Marmion, and the fascinating Effie Deans” (Edgcumbe 2:54).</p>
               <p>Taken together, Shelley’s remarks suggest some of the resistance that the figure of Scott put up to the early culture of romantic fandom. Unlike 
							Byron, although famous and sought after, he was not personally exciting to the fan, and he offered
						none of the extremer emotional pleasures of “being” the author that Rousseau had and that Lord Byron would. <note place="foot" resp="editors">
							McDayter notes in passing that Scott did not elicit the sort of fandom that Byron
							did, and attributes this to the fact that his “role in cultural production never challenged the fragile lines which
							had been drawn between the literary and the real” (60n.). Although this explanation is open to question because of
								Scott’s re-description of history as fiction, it is undoubtedly
							the case that Scott did not produce in his readers quite what moderns would
							describe as fandom. </note> His poetry and fictions, on the other hand, certainly inspired admiration, but the
						tourist-practices associated with them seem calculated as much to describe the reader’s imaginative flair as the
						writer’s. Where they discuss Scott’s “magic powers”, both Washington Irving and Shelley verge on charging him with fraud, promising the
						reader-tourist rather more than actuality can deliver. Shelley’s thank-you letter to Scott makes this explicit: <quote rendition="#indent2">I hope that you will allow me to take
							advantage of this opportunity to express the very great pleasure which we have derived from our tour in Scotland. That
							pleasure is in a great measure due to the romantic interest given to every mountain and glen that you have mentioned,
							either in verse, in conversation, or in prose. To speak the truth, those parts of Scotland which have not been celebrated
							in song have but small attraction for me...In the neighbourhood of Abbotsford, as seen through your magic glass, I wished
							to have been born in some Highland glen before the ’45...But I must confess to you that the scenery of Scotland is,
							in general, too tame to satisfy my taste for romantic grandeur... (Edgcumbe 2:62)</quote>
                  <lb/>Shelley’s compliment to Scott is double-edged—on the one hand,
						she thanks him for giving “romantic interest” to the landscape; on the other, she suggests that she has a more
						romantic taste in scenery than he must have, preferring the genuinely sublime to the poetically exaggerated. This slight
						condescension reverberates too in her estimate of the social pretensions of Abbotsford (“[it] has the appearance of a
						castle built of pastry—something like those we see on a supper table. But one must not quiz the castle or criticise the
						whims of such a genius” (Edgcumbe 2:46). And it colours her account of
						one mildly flirtatious exchange: <quote rendition="#indent2">
                     <lb/>
							Scott paid me a very pretty compliment upon my riding at Paris...[He]
							remarked that no-one could ride so well as I did...He concluded with these words: “I am quite sure that the author
							of the Scottish novels must have seen Lady Shelley ride, ere he described Die [sic] Vernon.” (Edgcumbe 2:48)</quote>
                  <lb/>
						Scott here offers Shelley the chance to occupy the position of the originator of
						fiction, something that she is very ready to do, as her sense that it is she who conjures up “fairy visions” from
						the landscape as a reader also suggests. Scott’s well-documented
						vanishing-act in the games he played with anonymity as “the Author of Waverley” is here played out in miniature,
						and suggests some of the ways that, as a narrative poet and fiction-writer, he could be written out of romantic authorship by
						the romantic reader, and so disqualified as an object of fandom.</p>

               <head>IV. Running after Byron, 1834</head>
               <p>In December 1813, when she first met him, Shelley was decidedly not one of Byron’s many fans. She recorded her first verdict on the poet then working on <title level="m">The
							Corsair</title> thus: “He is decidedly handsome, and can be very agreeable. He seems to be easily put out by
						trifles, and, at times, looks terribly savage” (Edgcumbe 1:52). (She
						did him the justice, however, of saying that he had been very patient with his young nephews and nieces). Accompanying Augusta
						Leigh to pay a formal visit to Lady Byron and her new husband on the occasion of their marriage in April 1815, she had a very
						uncomfortable time of it, offering congratulations that were coldly received by Byron with a “demoniacal” expression, and summing up her experience by remarking that
						“I felt like a young person who has inadvertently dipped her finger into boiling water” (81, 82). She coincided
						with the poet again in Lady Dalrymple Hamilton’s salon in Geneva in 1816, after he had left England in the wake of the
						scandal of his separation from his wife, and expressed much the same views in much the same language, amplified with
						incredulity at the fan phenomenon that surrounded him at the time: <quote rendition="#indent2">
							Lord Byron looked in for a moment, but on seeing so many people he
							went away without speaking to anyone. He was evidently very much put out by something; and the expression on his face was
							somewhat demoniacal. What a strange person! They say he will have nothing to say to the crowds of English who almost dog
							his footsteps. (236)</quote>
                  <lb/>Given this pronounced distaste for the person of Byron, it is all
						the more striking that following his death (an occasion marked for her by Sir Humphrey Davy inscribing verses “On the
						Death of Lord Byron” in her album [2:123]), she would become a
						completely conventional Byron fan; once his living and embarrassing
						social person was out of the way, it seems, her acquaintance with this celebrity at last became desirable. It is
						well-documented that post-Napoleonic travellers on the Continent would come to see the landscape through which they passed
						through Byron’s eyes and to ape his emotional stances courtesy
						of <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage III</title> and <title level="m">IV</title>. which would eventually be
						conveniently extracted into Murray’s guidebooks (Buzard 125-30). Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges, for example, noted in the same year that
						Shelley would set off on her travels again, 1834, that “[Byron’s] spirit always haunts me on the lake of Geneva; and I behold him forever floating on its waves in all
						the shadowy brilliance of his imaginations...[I] behold him at Venice, at Ravenna, at Ferrara, at Florence, at Rome, and at
						Pisa; and I see him enter the soul of Dante, to wander with him in his exile among the sombre woods” (Brydges 256-7). This effect was very strong in relation to literary
						sites, partly because one of the projects of <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> could be said to be to provide Byron with the chance to strike canonical fan postures at European
						writers’ houses and haunts, thus inserting him within a cosmopolitan classical poetic tradition. Recapitulating Byron’s tourist itinerary, tourists therefore engaged in the
						exercise of “being” Byron not so much as an author (as
						with Rousseau), but as a prototypical romantic fan.</p>
               <p>Shelley’s visit to the continent is accordingly marked by a tendency to refer her sightseeing experiences to those
						represented as Byron’s in <title level="m">Childe Harold’s
							Pilgrimage IV</title>. Describing her visit to Ariosto’s house, she frames the experience in terms of Byron’s literary celebrity and fandom: <quote rendition="#indent2">In Ariosto’s house I visited the room in which he was born and in which he died. It was here that he wrote in
							winter. In summer-time he sat on a bench in the garden, with a candle beside him after dark. Everything remains exactly as
							it was in his time. The garden is about thirty feet square; thus confirming what I have often observed—since the
							days when Byron wrote <title level="a">The Corsair</title> in his
							sister’s small cottage on Newmarket Heath— that real creative genius is not dependent on its environments, and
							that a poet’s fancy is often more brilliant when the mind is not distracted by exterior objects... The people here
							tell us that Lord Byron shut himself up for a whole day in this
							damp place! He has cut his name on the stone outside. The names of Samuel Rogers, Hobhouse, and Casimir de la Vigne, prove that this much ridiculed custom is, after all, natural
							to the whole human race. Following the example of others, my son Frederick added the name of Shelley. This may in future
							be mistaken for the name of my young kinsman, Percy Bysshe, by future
							pilgrims to this shrine... (Edgcumbe 2:234)</quote>
                  <lb/>This meditation on the nature of fandom is wonderfully snobbish in its implicit argument that if the aristocratic Byron and other celebrities can practise fan inscription, then it will
						be all right for her son to do so, especially since he is the kinsman of a literary celebrity himself. (It is, however,
						noticeable that she excludes herself from this practice of inscription; though it would become much more common later in the
						century for women to compose tribute poetry and album verses, they seem rarely to have found it socially possible to cut
						graffiti).

						Fig. 4 Petrarch’s house at Arquà. From the author’s own collection.
					</p>
               <p>Nor is this the sole example of Shelley’s appeal to the Byronic to license her fandom. When she visits Petrarch’s
						house at Arquà, she is equally aware of Byron’s previous
						visit, recorded in <title level="m">Childe Harold IV</title>. and goes out of her way to look for its physical traces: <quote rendition="#indent2">Petrarch’s home has been so accurately and so beautifully described by Byron, that I fully expected to find his name among those who have
							visited this romantic spot; but there was no trace of it. (2:238)</quote>
                  <lb/>On this occasion, she is obliged to make do with a different celebrity-fan as a model in his place: “Alfieri has
						written a sonnet on the wall, but it has been scribbled over and much damaged. It is now protected by a glass frame”
						(2:238). Venice is not only suffused for her with Byron, whom she
						reads on the spot (“Every spot is vivified by the author of <title level="a">Childe Harold,</title> and is reminiscent
						of his tragedies” [2:241]), but is also authoritatively signed by Byron, something she records with some satisfaction: “We saw the ‘Bridge of Sighs,’ which is now
						no longer open to the public. Byron, according to his usual practice,
						has inscribed his name here” (2:243). Running through these scattered remarks is a recurring sense of privilege
						—in this case, the satisfaction with which she records that this signature of Byron’s is not available to the general public. It reiterates that sense of being in a
						distinguished fan club that I’ve already noted as operating in the case of Rousseau, with the twist that its exclusivity is here not merely a matter of exhibiting enough fine feeling but
						having the social clout to gain access to closed sites.</p>
               <p>For Shelley, the traces of Byron’s pilgrimage as a celebrity fan
						legitimate her own practice of literary tourism and associated practices of fandom; equally, the stories retailed in <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> and Byron’s tragedies help
						her to experience these locales as vivid and colourful. This latter effect, sadly, was not proof against time and grief over
						Wellington’s death. One last snapshot gives us Lady Frances Shelley in August 1853 trying to access the same reading
						experience while travelling along the Rhine: <quote rendition="#indent2">I read the third canto of <title level="a">Childe
								Harold</title> on the scene itself, but the romance had faded, and I sadly wanted “the hand to clasp in
							mine!”</quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <quote rendition="#indent2">Alas! I now see things as they are, and not as they used to be when I cast around them a halo of
							historical and legendary romance. Every castle and every rock has been so often described, that the subject is worn
							threadbare. (2:321)</quote>
                  <lb/>Shelley herself does not attribute this failure of romance primarily to age and sorrow, but to the wear and tear of
						cliché —the subject has become too common, the genre too well-used, perhaps the landscape had become too well-used
						as well. Writing and travelling in 1853, the age of the railway, mass leisure travel, and Murray’s guidebooks, was
						another thing to writing and travelling in the age of the carriage.</p>

               <p>Shelley’s sense of cliché may also have been one reason for her surprising failure to visit one famous literary
						locale, Loch Katrine and the Trossachs, the celebrated setting of Scott’s
						poem <title level="m">The Lady of the Lake</title> (1810). After her visit to Abbotsford in 1819, Shelley travelled on up into
						the Highlands. One of the standard destinations of the time would have been the Trossachs and Loch Katrine, and these were not
						much out of her route. Popular as a beauty spot even before 1810, largely because this wooded gorge was so uncharacteristic of
						the surrounding bare Highland scenery, with the publication of Scott’s
						poem it was flooded with enthusiastic tourists.

               <p>Two satirical accounts of visiting the Trossachs throw a sidelight on Shelley’s decision not to visit Loch
						Katrine. The first is by James Hogg, a friend and critic of Scott, who published
						a long, sardonic, and fictional account of the experience of visiting Loch Katrine entitled <title level="a">Malise’s
							Journey to the Trossacks</title> in the periodical <title level="j">The Spy</title> for 1811. <title level="a">Malise</title> is represented discussing his projected journey with an old Highlander: <quote rendition="#indent2">
                     <lb/>He said, I was right to do so, else I would not be in the fashion, but it was a sign, I was too idle, and had very
							little to do at home; but that a Mr Scott had put all the people mad by
							printing a <emph>lying poem</emph>, about a man that never existed... (Bohls &amp; Duncan 178)</quote>
                  <lb/>If the Highlander is meant to represent an abrasively common-sense, lower-class view of this particular leisure pastime,
						Malise himself represents the class aspirations typical of the literary tourist. Hogg makes him Rousseauist in language and
						stance, but, comically, as not quite fully inhabiting either: <quote rendition="#indent2">
                     <lb/>I wished to lose myself in the
							Trossachs alone; to have no interruption in my contemplations; but to converse only with nature, please myself with

                  <lb/>Malise records his enjoyment of the experience, but this enjoyment is represented not so much as the result of his
						refined reading sensibility as of a little fine whisky; concluding his account, he provides this advice to any who would
						follow in his footsteps: <quote rendition="#indent2">
                     <lb/>Whoever goes to survey the Trossachs, let him have the 11th, 12th
							and 13th division of the first canto of <title level="m">The Lady of the Lake</title> in his heart; a little Highland
							whisky in his head; and then he shall see the most wonderful scene that nature ever produced. (179-180)</quote>
                  <lb/>Hogg’s suggestion that the performance of Rousseauistic sensibility is class-bound is not uncommon in itself;
						usually, however, accounts of these displays of literary sensibility are more sympathetic exactly because they are supposed to
						define and describe class membership. A complementary account of class and reading-practices informs, for example, the remarks
						of John MacCulloch—another sophisticated, not to say a jaundiced,
						reader of his friend Scott—who has much to say on the ways in which the
						landscape of Loch Katrine was being read in the immediate aftermath of the poem’s success. In his letters to Scott detailing his journeys across Scotland between 1811 and 1820 he displays
						considerable class animus in complaining fretfully about the crowds newly infesting the Trossachs—“barouches and
						gigs, cocknies and fishermen and poets, Glasgow weavers and travelling haberdashers” (MacCulloch 194), expressing especial annoyance at the 
							Londoner who arrived with a French horn so as to make the most of the echoes made famous by Fitz-James’
						horn-call. Typical of this flush of tourists and their practices was the young actor William Charles Macready, who took a three week holiday after giving performances in Glasgow in the
						summer of 1818, walking to Loch Katrine, “the object of my most ardent wishes”, specifically for the pleasure of
						rowing “merrily up the lake, visiting the island, the Goblin’s Cave, and every spot that Scott’s poetry has invested with a never-dying interest” (
							Macready 1:182, 183, 187). 
							MacCulloch speculates sourly on the nature of the “never-dying interest” with which the poem inspired
						such tourists: “Why the scenes of a fictitious tale should excite the same interest as those where the great drama of
						life has been acted in its various forms, I shall leave you to explain...but I am quite sure that many of the well-informed
						personages who come here to see, believe the whole thing” (MacCulloch
						1:193). MacCulloch’s lack of enthusiasm for this down-market literalism
						informs his slightly vindictive pleasure in retailing the discomfiture of a too-credulous reader whom he had accompanied in a
						search for the Goblin’s Cave, Ellen’s second place of refuge: “I had accompanied, on one occasion, a cockney
						friend whom I met here, and who, after scrambling among the rocks and bogs for an hour, expressed vast indignation when he had
						reached the Coir nan Uriskin. ‘Lord, sir,’ said the [guide], ‘there is no cave here but what Mr Scott made himself.’ ‘What the d—l, no cave?’ ‘Na,
						Sir, but we go where the gentry chooses, and they always ask for the goblin cave first’” (1:165). MacCulloch’s self-distancing from these tourists as middle-class, urban,
						ignorant, and literalist only echoes in another register and from a different class perspective Hogg’s
						Highlander’s sardonic account of how in order to enhance the tourist experience there was to be a girl impersonating the
						lady of the lake and a man hired to represent the Goblin himself (Bohls and
							Duncan 178).</p>
               <p>Shelley herself made no comment upon the phenomenon of Loch Katrine, so one is left to speculate on whether this passion for
						the scenes of fiction, unsecured by the presence of the author, imagined or physical, as tour-guide, was either too
						unsophisticated or too popular an experience to seek out in 1819. It is conceivable that it was both. It may well have been
						the case that there was something of a hierarchy between the two modes of literary fandom. The one, author-centred and
						organised towards visiting, being or envisioning the author, encoded the social equality and literary clubbability of the
						reader; the other, equally well-established in the period, fiction-centred and organised towards being a spectator of
						narrative, connoted a propensity to confuse the real and the fictional, a dangerous and risible lack of sophistication which
						contemporary discourse typically associated with the new mass readership. Between seeing a vision of Rousseau, and believing in a girl impersonating the Lady of the Lake, lay a
						rather thin, but acutely class-conscious line between active fancy and sensation-seeking, one that persists to this day in the
						distinction between visiting Austen’s Chawton and Dickens’ World.</p>
               <p>Over the course of a lifetime, Shelley thus experimented with a variety of forms of literary tourism and fandom. She visited
						both the living and the dead, seeing their landscapes through their eyes and under their signatures. On balance, she adopts an
						author-centred model of fandom, despite her early flirtation with seeing Scott’s environs through a visionary haze of Scott’s
						characters. Her sense that sites could be worn threadbare by over-use suggests some of the reasons that literary tourism
						evolved as a mode of fandom in the period, because what comes through most clearly in Shelley’s diaries and letters is
						the sense of an anxiety of readership which fuels literary tourism. To indulge in literary tourism was a class-marker, for in
						the early nineteenth century only a few had the luxuries of sufficient education, idleness and wealth to go in the footsteps
						of their favourite authors to any of the places I’ve been discussing in this paper. As such, the practice served, or was
						supposed to serve, to distinguish the elite tourist-reader from an otherwise worryingly large and undifferentiated mass
						readership. If romantic authors appealed to posterity in order to save themselves from contemporary mass audiences, romantic
						readers turned tourist in order to distinguish themselves from the same mass-audience. Their self-representation as literary
						tourists was designed to distinguish their practice of sophisticated re-reading and re-representation from the mere unthinking
						consumption associated with mass culture. Our own time, in which it is those readers who <emph>do</emph> write their names in
						the visitors’ books of writers’ houses who are regarded as unsophisticated, was still undreamed of.</p>
