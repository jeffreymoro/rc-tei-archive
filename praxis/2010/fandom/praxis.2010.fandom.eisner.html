            <p class="noCount">Romantic-era audiences participated enthusiastically in what we would now recognize
               as fan practices and fan cultures. In his introduction to this volume, Eisner proposes
               an understanding of fandom as a culturally situated, qualitatively distinctive, and
               complexly mediated form of audience response, arguing that fandom rewards analysis
               as a historical phenomenon in its own right and not simply as a register of the celebrity
               of the objects of fan interest. Pointing out the ways in which the volume’s essays
               frame the topic of fandom as a provocation to methodological innovation, Eisner’s
               introduction locates the volume’s approach to fandom in relation to recent scholarship
               in Romantic studies and cultural studies, and in contradistinction to more traditional
               studies of reception. The introduction argues that the volume’s essays deepen our
               understanding of Romanticism’s publics as socially heterogeneous, inventive, and unpredictable,
               shaped by and shaping rapidly changing institutions of performance, publication, reading,
               spectatorship, leisure and consumption. By mapping the complicated social dynamics
               informing the activity of particular fans, the essays in this volume demonstrate both
               the diversity of Romantic fan practices and the historical particularity of the forms
               Romantic fandom takes. While these essays contest literary criticism’s often habitual
               abjection of the fan, Eisner emphasizes that they also resist conflating Romantic
               fandom with our own.</p>

               <p>Depending on your perspective, this volume’s title might appear either oxymoronic
                  or simply redundant. If your Romanticism tends to be disdainful, even phobic, of popularity;
                  if it is self-reflexive and critical, full of obstinate questioning of sense and outward
                  things; if it is dedicated to reforming as well as experimenting on the public’s taste,
                  then fandom might look to you like Romanticism’s very opposite: fandom after all marks
                  the faddish and the popular; we often characterize it as embracing its objects with
                  reckless abandon or unthinking absorption. If on the other hand your Romanticism involves
                  primarily the overflow of powerful feeling, an exuberance recollected perhaps somewhat
                  ashamedly in moments of tranquility, a going out of our own nature in search of an
                  ideal other, you might ask what kind of fandom worth the name wouldn’t be deemed Romantic.</p>

                  <p>While commentators in the early nineteenth century would not yet have spoken of “fans”—the
                     term is an American coinage from later in the century—the period swirled with talk
                     about crazes, manias, idols and idol-worshippers, enthusiasts, and devotees. The period
                     also saw the popularization of recognizable “fan practices,” spurred by the growth
                     of consumer culture and the development of a mass audience for culture generally.
                     Admirers collected autographs, souvenirs, portraits and relics of celebrity writers,
                     artists, performers, military heroes, and athletes; snapped up mementos associated
                     with beloved plays or books or music; visited the homes and haunts of celebrities;
                     pored over gossip-filled periodicals and newspaper notices; imitated celebrities’
                     fashion statements; fantasized about becoming friends or lovers with celebrities;
                     wrote fan mail and formed communities of like-minded aficionados.

                     </div> Romantic-era celebrities, of course, not only encouraged but also frequently participated
                     in such practices themselves: Leo Braudy observes of Byron, for example, that he was
                     “a fan before he was a star…[a]ll sorts of fame intrigued him,” from the world-historical
                     to the more local and ephemeral (407). Byron famously adorned his rooms with a portrait
                     of his “little pagod” Napoleon, but also kept a “screen pasted with scraps of boxers
                     and actresses” (Marchand 4:256; Peter Quennell, qtd. in Braudy 407).</p>

                  <p>This volume does not propose a single definition of fandom, and it does not isolate
                     a particular moment in time when modern fandom can be said to begin. In general terms,
                     however, we might distinguish fandom from other forms of admiration or interest by
                     foregrounding a few distinctive qualities. Fandom is, as John Fiske puts it, an “intensely
                     pleasurable, intensely signifying” form associated with mass-cultural structures and
                     mass-mediated society, though it may not be restricted to mass-cultural or mass-mediated
                     objects (30). Fandom is a participatory activity embedded in a series of more or less
                     routinized practices or rituals (e.g., collecting, writing fan mail), and connected
                     to more or less exhibitionistic forms of display. Fandom has powerful emotional and
                     affective dimensions—it can involve love, passion, excitation, unbearable curiosity
                     or longing, near-total absorption, as well as feelings of shame, anxiety or abjection—though
                     again, degrees of fandom obviously vary and such passions come and go. Fandom is also
                     powerfully linked to fantasy, and often to forms of transferential identification.
                     Both its emotional component and its fantasy elements often make it central to constructions
                     of identity, but fandom also gives rise to communities of like-minded fans, to a fan
                     culture. Finally, fandom can be crucially productive or creative: most clearly in
                     the genre of fan fiction or the playful readerly practice David A. Brewer has called
                     the “imaginative expansion” of narratives or characters (<em>Afterlife</em> 2), but also more generally in the invention of modes of engagement, expression and
                     performance.

                              into some form of textual production that can circulate among—and thus help to define—the
                              fan community. Fans create a fan culture with its own systems of production and distribution
                              that forms…a ‘shadow cultural economy’ that lies outside that of the cultural industries

                  <p>When I contacted potential contributors to this volume, I suggested they consider
                     some of the following questions: How does the concept of fandom help us think about
                     the development of new kinds of publics, new formations of culture, and new ways of
                     consuming culture in the Romantic period? What dynamics of class, gender, nation and
                     sexuality emerge around the figure of the fan or specific forms of fandom in the Romantic
                     period? How do Romantic writers themselves participate in such cultures of fandom?
                     How do the material practices around fandom condition, reflect or support specific
                     modes of reading or spectatorship associated with Romanticism? What can fan practices
                     tell us about the development of new kinds of subjectivity or feeling in the period?
                     How do we understand the fan’s desire, and how does that desire mirror, predict, or
                     precede our own investments in Romantic-era texts and writers, as scholars, teachers,
                     and 21st-century fans? Contributors were free to look at any of the possible topics
                     projected by the phrase “Romantic Fandom”: Romantic-era fans; fans of the Romantics;
                     fandom that is in some sense Romantic. Responding to these questions and possibilities,
                     the four very diverse essays in this volume together show how taking fandom seriously
                     might help reshape our understanding of Romantic-era audiences and Romantic-era forms.
                     Conversely, these essays also demonstrate that attention to emerging practices of
                     fandom in the Romantic period can open up valuable comparative perspectives on our
                     own modes of admiration and response.

               <p>Celebrity has become something of a hot topic within Romantic studies, with a wave
                  of studies building on groundbreaking articles and books by Peter Manning, Susan Wolfson,
                  Judith Pascoe, and Karen Swann, and including recent work by Tom Mole, Ghislaine McDayter,David
                  Higgins, Clara Tuite, myself and many others. There have been, too, in recent years
                  several excellent collections of essays examining the fan cultures built up around
                  individual writers: Frances Wilson’s <em>Byromania</em> and Deidre Lynch’s <em>Janeites</em>, for example. This volume aims to continue the conversation this scholarship has
                  begun, but asks what different questions or insights arise if we shift the emphasis
                  from the celebrity to the fan. The essays in this volume use this shift in emphasis
                  to open up alternative views of the history of reading, and they take up the problem
                  of fandom as a methodological challenge that requires new thinking about how to recover
                  and analyze varieties of audience response. That is, the focus here is not on the
                  topics of traditional reception history: the development of reputation, the strategies
                  by which texts are marketed or distributed, a legacy of changing judgments or expectations
                  or interpretations. Nor is the focus on cults of a particular author as reflections
                  or betrayals of the reception that author might imagine. Rather, these are essays
                  about the sometimes very ordinary, often very quirky activities of fans, though they
                  show, unavoidably, the complex interrelation and interaction—mutually influential
                  but not mutually determining—between forms of response and the forms that inspire
                  such response in the first place. These essays reveal Romanticism’s publics as highly
                  complicated, heterogeneous, inventive and unpredictable.</p>
               <p>Nicola Watson’s essay makes clear both the diversity of modes of fandom in the period
                  and how little these fan practices actually conform to some of our frequent assumptions
                  about the period. Watson’s topic is the practice of reading writers <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</span>—touring locations associated with writers or their characters and experiencing those
                  scenes through the lens of one’s literary experience, often with book in hand. Her
                  essay takes as a case study the cultural tourism of the socialite Lady Frances Shelley—a
                  distant relative of the poet, “well-read yet unintellectual, and a crashing snob”—whose
                  encounters with writers and the places they made famous are richly detailed in nearly
                  half a century’s worth of letters and diaries. While we now typically see such tourism
                  as a middle-brow if not mass-cultural phenomenon, Watson explains by contrast how
                  Lady Shelley’s fandom is in fact dogged by an “anxiety of readership” tied to her
                  elite class position. Though it anticipates later throngs of tourists in the Lake
                  District in the nineteenth century or to places like Stratford or Haworth today, Lady
                  Shelley’s reading of landscapes and locales reflects an effort to “distinguish the
                  elite tourist-reader from an otherwise worryingly large and undifferentiated mass
                  readership” (Watson).</p>
               <p>The social distinctions Watson turns up in her analysis of this particular reader’s
                  fan practices have suggestive implications for our understanding of the relationships
                  between readers and books more generally in the Romantic period and, indeed, in the
                  present. Watson uncovers a contest between two modes of literary fandom driving the
                  cultural tourism she investigates: on the one hand, an “author-centered” mode “organized
                  towards visiting, being, or envisioning the author;” on the other hand, a “fiction-centered”
                  mode through which the tourist-reader uses a particular landscape to project himself
                  or herself imaginatively into a narrative, or imaginatively to project the reality
                  of fictional scenes. If the author-centered mode of fandom suggests the writer and
                  reader are on equal footing, Watson argues, the fiction-centered mode of fandom “connoted
                  a propensity to confuse the real and the fictional, a dangerous and risible lack of
                  sophistication which contemporary discourse typically associated with the new mass
                  readership” (Watson). As Watson observes, this is a distinction still active in the
                  gap between visiting someplace like Austen’s Chawton or the Keats House and a theme
                  park like Dickens’ World. Yet I might add that these two modes of fandom, of course,
                  draw on and feed back into types of fantasy and identification possibly present, and
                  overlapping, in any given experience of losing oneself in a book. Watson’s discussion
                  ultimately, then, points us to the spillover—in both directions—between the way we
                  experience imaginative worlds in reading and the cultural practices through which
                  we seek to extend those experiences into reality.</p>
               <p>While all of the essays in this volume bring out fandom’s richly social and even communal
                  dimensions, it’s also a paradox of fandom that the typicality of any given fan’s pleasures
                  must lie in their idiosyncrasy. Clara Tuite’s case history of Stendhal’s momentous
                  meeting with Byron in 1816 builds a strong argument both for the individuality of
                  Stendhal’s response to Byron (it’s a quintessentially Stendhalian response) and for
                  its representative status with regard to Byronic fandom in particular and modern mass-cultural
                  fandom, perhaps modern masculinity, more generally. Floored when he realizes he’s
                  sharing an opera box with the poet he idolizes, Stendhal is at once thrilled and deeply
                  embarrassed, but in Tuite’s account this is not just another story of enthrallment
                  to Byron’s seductive figure. Indeed, part of what’s so intriguing about this exchange
                  is the uneasy, competitive, and erotically charged triangular relationship that governs
                  it— Stendhal/Napoleon/Byron—with both Stendhal and Byron engaged in an on-going and
                  unstable process of identity-formation through the public performance of ambivalent
                  identification with figures <em>also</em> engaged in such an on-going and unstable process of self-invention. As Watson does
                  also, Tuite emphasizes that the fan acts in ways not always scripted or anticipated
                  by the author, but here the fan’s independence takes on a more Barthesian quality.
                  In Tuite’s provocative argument, fandom “spectacularizes the transformative agency
                  of the reader, producing new circuits of exchange that empower reading and reception,
                  and endow them with new pleasures and sensations. Far from entailing an exclusively
                  passive position—in docile thrall to the sovereignty of author and text—fandom can
                  be seen to transform a traditional textual economy of active and passive, thereby
                  enabling reception as a mode of delirious productivity—proliferating often disobedient
                  and indiscreet disclosures” (Tuite). But Tuite painstakingly shows as well how Stendhal’s
                  emotion and its display are conditioned by and as the social ritual of a very specific
                  time and place, the immediately post-Napoleonic moment of the encounter between these
                  two recent exiles, one British and one French, at the opera in Italy.</p>
               <p>Crucial to Tuite’s analysis of the affective dimension of Stendhal’s fandom is the
                  category of the “impulse,” on the edge point between “the desire to act and the act
                  itself,” and ambiguously located between body and mind (Tuite). Stendhal’s experience
                  of fandom as unwilled feeling chimes not only with accounts of present-day fandom
                  but also with the language of other nineteenth-century accounts of fan feeling: Elizabeth
                  Barrett Browning would write in the 1840s of her own “impulses to lionizing,” for
                  example (1:145). As Tuite suggests in linking Stendhal’s “impulse” to the older literary-historical
                  and philosophical category of the “sensation”—important in Stendhal’s thinking about
                  love, memory and emotion— Stendhal’s fascination with his feeling on this occasion
                  might be assimilated to the entire complex project through which Romantic writers
                  work to refashion and revalue eighteenth-century understandings of the relation of
                  emotion and knowledge, producing a new “history or science of feelings” (Wordsworth,
                  Note to 
                  “The Thorn,”
                  <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> 289). (We might, for example, read Tuite’s discussion of impulse and sensation in
                  Stendhal’s fan feeling against Noel Jackson’s recent work on sensation in British
                  Romantic poetry: Tuite sees Stendhal pushing sensation away from scientific knowledge
                  while Jackson sees the two as more closely allied in British Romantic thought [ Jackson
                  1-2]). Tracing Stendhal’s shifting recollections and rewritings of the encounter with
                  Byron over the years, Tuite zeros in on what these rewritings tell us about “that
                  most Stendhalian concern with the fraught interrelation between desire and memory”—a
                  concern so central to Romantic writing generally. As I have suggested elsewhere, Romantic
                  fandom turns out in this way to be surprisingly close to the dynamics of the Romantic
                  lyric, with its focus on memory and memorialization and its attempted coordination
                  between deeply personal and transpersonal feeling. Just as the Romantic lyric is supposed
                  to provide a passage between an almost incommunicable meaning and public meaning,
                  the fan’s response is felt at once as uniquely individual experience and as shared
                  or social experience. Is it possible really to imagine oneself the lone fan of anything?
                  Fandom is perhaps always something we think of as shared, or at least as something
                  we want to share, even as our embarrassment about our fandom speaks not just to its
                  excesses of feeling but to the way we take it as revealing deeply personal truth.
                  It’s too much sharing.</p>
               <p>Mark Schoenfield’s engaging contribution to this volume, 
                  “Byron in the <em>Satirist</em>,”
                  analyzes a much less adulatory—if perhaps no less obsessed—response to Byron. Schoenfield
                  teases out the complex political and cultural rhetorics through which the journal
                  refracts the figure of Byron in its reviews, its social satire, and its verbal and
                  visual parodies, starting with its 1807 review of Byron’s <em>Hours of Idleness</em>. Animating this interaction in large part is the personal animus between Byron and
                  the <em>Satirist</em> writer Hewson Clarke, who was at Cambridge with Byron and for whom Byron represented
                  not only a rival but the (frustrating) epitome of aristocratic privilege, a privilege
                  Clarke and <em>The Satirist</em> will target in attacks on what they brand Whiggish indolence. Schoenfield demonstrates
                  how even at this early stage in Byron’s career, the <em>Satirist</em>’s attacks function to deflate, by redeploying, Byron’s figuration of his own fame,
                  reflecting back to the poet and his audience “the fragility of his public self.” In
                  other words, despite being captivated by Byron’s figure, Clarke is hardly a fan of
                  the poet, but both Clarke and Clarke’s Byron write with an anxious eye on the poet’s
                  real or potential audience of devoted admirers, the “real” Byron’s claims to nonchalance
                  or indifference notwithstanding. In Schoenfield’s nice summary, the journal thus influentially
                  produces “a competing version of Byronic celebrity to that produced by Byron.”</p>
               <p>Schoenfield’s essay is perhaps most exciting in the way it shows us the vexed interdependence
                  of periodical writing and poetic production in the first decades of the nineteenth
                  century, a mutually bound relationship whose antagonistic dynamic is captured by the
                  reversibility of these hostilities: as Schoenfield explains, “who binds whom is determined
                  by an economy of cultural production.” The antagonism of satire in this way proves
                  suggestively parallel to the mutually bound and sometimes very antagonistic relationship
                  between fans and the objects of their interest. The close connection Schoenfield examines
                  between poetic production and periodical culture reflects, of course, the position
                  of each within a rapidly developing literary marketplace, but also, especially in
                  Byron’s case, the way a kind of seriality was emerging in the publication of poetry
                  (even before the Oriental Tales) that lent itself to sustained engagement with and
                  by the seriality of magazine publication. If periodicals like <em>The Satirist</em> require a Byron as an organizing figure for their own reading of culture, we’re also
                  coming more and more to see how powerful a role the periodicals played not just in
                  the reception of Byron but in shaping the poet’s self-representation.</p>
               <p>While Schoenfield, Tuite and Watson each describe how particular individuals responded
                  to famous writers and their works, Brewer’s essay on the craze for Pierce Egan’s <em>Life in London</em> asks a somewhat different question about fandom: how to account for the “phenomenon”
                  of a book like <em>Life in London</em>? As Brewer recounts, it’s not just that the book itself sparked a craze, but that
                  it gave rise to so many also wildly popular imitations, theatrical adaptations and
                  spin-offs, and even cross-merchandising (clothiers pushed Tom and Jerry fashions,
                  for example). Histories of reading and reception have a tough time making convincing
                  sense of such reader response: the mania inspired by <em>Life in London</em> may stand as a particularly inexplicable instance, but, as Brewer points out, we
                  still need to develop critical languages or frameworks through which we might approach
                  this kind of fandom productively. Brewer’s brilliant solution is radically to shift
                  the scale of analysis: rather than situate the response to <em>Life in London</em> within ideological or cultural patterns mapped through broad swaths of literary or
                  social history, or even the more limited “Regency culture,” Brewer’s analysis goes
                  micro. Building on Franco Morretti’s <em>Graphs, Maps, Trees</em>, Brewer’s essay literally maps the publication, adaptation and reception of <em>Life in London</em> down to the month-by-month level of the book’s serial appearance and down to the
                  street-by-street level of the particular London neighborhoods where the characters
                  go on their larks, where theaters stage adaptations, or where we have evidence of
                  particular reader response (including police reports of overexcited readers acting
                  out Tom and Jerry’s sprees). The results are astonishing: not only do we, in reading
                  this essay and looking at these maps, experience the temporality of reception in an
                  entirely new way, but we see in new terms how and why this craze played out as it
                  did across forms and media. As in all the essays in this volume, we get a powerful
                  sense of the peculiarly mediated space fandom occupies. We also, excitingly, get a
                  new sense of how we might understand the history of reading and theatergoing through
                  the problematic of form.</p>

                  <p>I confess that when I began contacting potential contributors to this volume, I was
                     anxious about the terminology I’d chosen: would the label “fandom” impel readings
                     that merely projected our own forms of desire back onto Romantic-era readers? Surely,
                     there are striking continuities between today’s fan practices and their pre-history
                     in Romantic-era forms of reception, as Nicola Watson remarks: “in the climate of today’s
                     celebrity culture, it has become possible to rediscover Byron as a necessary precondition
                     for Mick Jagger, as the first famous poet to inspire certain modes of feeling on an
                     international scale.”

                     reading practices in terms of a “presentist” understanding of the affective dynamics
                     of celebrity and fandom (“presentist” because derived from an analysis of those dynamics

                     difference that separates Romantic-era fandom from more familiar fan routines, rather
                     than any putative similarity between the two. If these essays contest literary criticism’s
                     abjection of the fan as “naïve, obsessive, desirous, and dangerously predatory” (Watson),
                     they also resist simply celebrating the fan or identifying Romantic-era readerly desire
                     with our own.

               <p>Indeed, each of these essays describes scenes of fandom that come very quickly to
                  belong emphatically to the past. Travelling down the Rhine in the 1850s, Lady Shelley,
                  Watson tells us, finds herself unable to re-experience her own earlier feelings of
                  romance amid these scenes, even though she keeps her copy of <em>Childe Harold</em> open beside her. Stendhal’s encounter with Byron may set the stage for later developments
                  in his life and his writing, but almost on the scene, in Tuite’s account, it is already
                  subject to the revising and corroding action of memory. <em>The Satirist</em>’s exchanges with Byron set in motion recurring tropes in the poet’s reception, but
                  as Schoenfield explains, these exchanges belong to an early moment in Byron’s career,
                  before the full appearance of “Byronism” and its transformative effects on the poet’s
                  public persona and on the literary market itself. Brewer explains that the craze for
                  <em>Life in London</em> faded as quickly as it came on; by the middle of the century, even those who’d been
                  swept up in it in their youth professed themselves mystified by the book’s popularity.
                  This pattern isn’t just about aging or the passage of time: what it reveals is the
                  way fandom is always historically situated, always tied to specific and shifting cultural
                  as well as individual situations. In the Romantic period in particular, the <em>fading</em> of forms of fandom indexes the rapid and uneven development and transformation of
                  institutions of writing, reading, and publication across the period. The essays in
                  this volume show how an analysis of fandom can limn these changes in provocative and
                  revelatory fashion. They point the way to more work on Romantic-era readers and reading
                  practices that needs to be done, and they suggest some of the innovative and varied
                  methodologies scholars might put to use in charting this underexplored but very rich
                  terrain.</p>

               fan culture can be found in Altick 112-45. On fandom and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
               reading practices, see also previous work by the contributors to this volume, including
               David A. Brewer’s work on eighteenth-century fan fiction in <em>The Afterlife of Character</em>, Clara Tuite’s analysis of the Byron-Caroline Lamb relationship in 
               “Tainted Love,”
               and Nicola Watson’s <em>The Literary Tourist</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">John Fiske observes that “all popular audiences engage in varying degrees of semiotic
               productivity, producing meanings and pleasures that pertain to their social situation
               out of the products of the culture industries. But fans often turn this semiotic productivity
               into some form of textual production that can circulate among—and thus help to define—the
               fan community. Fans create a fan culture with its own systems of production and distribution
               that forms…a ‘shadow cultural economy’ that lies outside that of the cultural industries
               yet shares features with them which more normal popular culture lacks” (30). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               “Lord Byron’s life of bling, booze and groupie sex,”
               <em>The Sun</em>’s 2008 article reporting (somewhat spuriously) on Corin Throsby’s research on love
               letters to Byron in the John Murray archive: “His passions included brandy and bling…and
               bedding hundreds of lust-crazed groupies. The dashing aristocrat’s racy lifestyle,
               palatial homes and oceans of female fan mail created a circus not unlike the one surrounding
               David Beckham today… Now never-before-published letters have emerged proving his female
               fans were every bit as smitten as those who were later to swoon over Becks and his
               fellow stars.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
