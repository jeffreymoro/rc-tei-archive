            <p class="noCount">This article analyzes the complex political and cultural rhetorics through which the
               journal <em>Satirist</em> refracts the figure of Byron in its reviews, its social satire, and its verbal and
               visual parodies, starting with its 1807 review of Byron’s <em>Hours of Idleness</em>. Animating this interaction in large part is the personal animus between Byron and
               the <em>Satirist</em> writer Hewson Clarke, who was at Cambridge with Byron and for whom Byron represented
               not only a rival but the (frustrating) epitome of aristocratic privilege, a privilege
               Clarke and <em>The Satirist</em> will target in attacks on what they brand Whiggish indolence. Schoenfield demonstrates
               how even at this early stage in Byron’s career, the <em>Satirist</em>’s attacks function to deflate, by redeploying, Byron’s figuration of his own fame,
               reflecting back to the poet and his audience “the fragility of his public self.” The
               journal thus influentially produces “a competing version of Byronic celebrity to that
               produced by Byron.”</p>

                     “Byron in the <em>Satirist</em>: <br/> Aristocratic Lounging and Literary Labor”
                     </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>When Byron sent a copy of his first publically printed volume, <em>Hours of Idleness</em>, to his ineffectual guardian, Lord Carlisle, the elder poet evaded an assessment
               of the poems by writing his thanks in advance of (and perhaps entirely in lieu of)
               reading the poems. Carlisle assured Byron that however the public and reviewers received
               the volume, Byron “will stand better with the world than others who only pursue their
               studies in Bond St. or at Tatershall's” (<a class="link_ref" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=J2ERAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=%22pursue+their+studies+in+Bond%22">Byron, <em>Works</em> 1:138</a>) Poetry, Carlisle suggests, may not be actual labor, but it is better than dissipating
               consumption on Bond Street, a high-end shopping district, or horse racing and gambling
               at Tattersall's. This tepid response, with its emphasis on the “studies” of other
               aristocrats, underscores Carlisle's frustration with Byron's indifference to his studies
               at Cambridge. Henry Brougham's review of <em>Hours</em> in the <em>Edinburgh Review,</em> urges Byron to “forthwith abandon poetry, and turn his talents, which are considerable,
               and his opportunities, which are great, to better account” (<a class="link_ref" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NmIRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=%22which+are+considerable,+and+his+opportunities%22"><em>ER</em> 9: 286</a>). Like Carlisle, Brougham raises the issue of the public perception of aristocratic
               labor, a subject that provoked both class-based and party-affiliated responses that
               ranged from anger to amusement. Reviews, both positive and negative, registered the
               issue, which was signaled not only by the title's emphasis on “idleness,” but the
               Preface's insistence on Byron's status as a poetic dabbler. Byron's public performance,
               thus, is refracted through competing understandings of the relationship between class
               privilege and forms of labor, both working-class and professional.</p>
            <p>Among the most virulent of the reviews was the notice by Hewson Clarke, who was at
               Cambridge at the same time as Byron, in the first issue of <em>The Satirist, or the Monthly Meteor</em> (this summary of Clarke's review draws from my longer account of it in <em>British Periodicals</em> 142-6). Probably suppressing a personal knowledge of the identity of the reviewer,
               Byron's main complaint about the review, expressed to Elizabeth Pigot, is that “my
               censor only quotes <em>two lines</em> from different poems” to support his position (<a class="link_ref" href="http://discoverarchive.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/2314/Byron%20to%20Elizabeth%20Pigot%20-%20Oct%2026%2c%201807.pdf?sequence=1"><em>BLJ</em> 1:136</a>). This charge is somewhat imprecise, and the <em>Satirist</em>'s weird quotation makes the review potent. <em>The Satirist</em>, emphasizing the name's absence from the annals of accomplishment, quotes six times
               (once in the possessive case) the full denomination of the author announced on the
               title page: “<em>George Gordon Lord Byron, a minor</em>” (<a class="link_ref" href="http://discoverarchive.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/2548/Satirist%20No.%201%20-%20Oct.%201807%20-%20Review%20of%20Hours%20of%20Idleness.pdf?sequence=1">1: 77-81</a>). This repetition (of a pseudo-trimeter line of amphibrachs, with strong caesuras
               emphasizing the rhythm) asserts the mannered construction not only of the poetry,
               but of Byron's self-conception. As Jerome Christensen has noted, Henry Brougham, writing
               several months later in the <em>Edinburgh</em>, exploited the tension between Lordship and minority (21-23), and, like Hewson, queried
               the relevance of either to poetic production.</p>
            <p>Clarke's review begins, “There certainly must be a wonderful charm in the name of
               <em>author</em>, and a prodigious desire in men to see their own works in <em>print</em>, or what could have induced <em>George Gordon Lord Byron, a minor</em>, to have favoured the world with this collection of poems” (<em>Satirist</em> 1:77). Drawing on his own experience as a young author, Clarke adumbrates the method
               of the “wonderful charm” in which “<em>print</em>” becomes a mirror in which men can “see” their works—and work—materialized, yet such
               sight can be a delusion. Using the charmed “name of <em>author</em>” to undercut the awkward amalgam that identifies Byron particularly, the reviewer
               insists on his right to regulate excess and authenticity. The <em>Satirist</em> reads <em>Hours of Idleness</em> as self-exposure that confirms Byron's inability to produce and not as his record
               of the poetic process of transforming idle moments into verse: if Byron had not published,
               “no human being would have guessed the quantity of time he had spent in <em>doing nothing</em>.” For the <em>Satirist</em>, Byron's minority is not, as Byron himself positions it, an anteroom to lordship,
               but an expression of his personality. The <em>Satirist</em>'s review mentions thirteen poems, nearly the most of any notice of <em>Hours</em>, while paraphrasing or, as Byron complains, quoting short phrases. In the paragraph
               on 
               “On a Distant View of the Village and School, of Harrow, on the Hill,”
               Clarke reduces its title to 
               “Harrow on the Hill,”
               collapsing the poetic distance and distorting Byron's generic signals. Such a reduction
               strips 
               “On a Distant View”
               of its ironic perspective and represents, as the poem's central point, Byron's notion
               that “he spoke better than Mossop, and acted better than Garrick” (<em>Satirist</em> 1:78). In context, the poem's point is that such sensations of fame occur by confusions
               of scale—mistaking (even while cognizant of the mistake) the school auditorium for
               Drury Lane and thereby mishearing the conventions of applause: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">While, to swell my young pride, such applauses resounded,</div>
                  <div class="l">I fancied that Mossop himself was outshone</div>
                  <div class="l">... fir'd by loud plaudits, and self adulation,</div>
                  <div class="l">I regarded myself as a Garrick reviv'd.</div>
               </div>(18-23)</blockquote>
            <p>The comparison with Mossop creates a fantasy of fame that the poem discounts but which
               the review attributes to Byron. Byron saw, in Clarke's review, the fragility of his
               public self, because the redeployment of his words altered his character and exposed
               his anxieties about, and commitments to, that character. 
               “Harrow”
               is, in part, a meditation on the mechanism of the “wonderful charm” of authorship,
               in which applauses are reiteratively <em>re</em>sounded, both seductive and treacherous, yet Clarke insists that Byron is oblivious
               to and enthralled by this “charm.” Byron read the <em>Satirist</em> review within a few weeks of its appearance and wrote to Elizabeth Pigot about it
               on October 26, 1807. The letter compares Cambridge to Southwell, before discussing
               the <em>Satirist</em>: “This place is wretched enough...Oh! the misery of doing nothing but make <em>Love, Enemies</em>, and <em>Verses</em>” (<em>BLJ</em> 1:135). “This place” is where Byron encountered Hewson Clarke, and the phrase “doing
               nothing” echoes the <em>Satirist</em>'s accusation of Byron's idleness. But Byron's “doing nothing” is supplemented— stylized—by
               his making “love, enemies, and verses.” The asymmetrical meanings of “making” as applied
               to each of the nouns gives it triple meaning, and signals the serial nature of Byron's
               own construction as a form of valid labor, of continual and varied “making.”</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>From its inaugural issue, in which it skewered <em>Hours of Idleness</em>, <em>The Satirist</em> both reviewed Byron's work and injected sightings of Byron into its social commentary.
                  Spurred in part by personal animosity between Byron and Hewson Clarke, these references
                  often played on private information, and functioned to expose Byronic nonchalance
                  as a façade for ambition and privilege, thereby producing a competing version of Byronic
                  celebrity to that produced by Byron.

                  </div> When Byron published the next edition of <em>Hours</em>, retitled <em>Poems, Original and Translated</em>, in 1808, he dropped the appellation “a minor” as well as the Preface and several
                  poems. The <em>Satirist</em>, nonetheless, revives the title in its review of the newer volume, and continues
                  to refer to him as “George Gordon, Lord Byron, a Minor.” The review invents the title 
                  “Prayer of George Gordon, Lord Byron, a Minor”
                   for [
                  “May Heaven so guard my lovely Quaker”
                  ] (3:82). Further insisting on the durable trace of <em>Idleness</em>, this review discusses—and quotes at varying lengths—six of the poems omitted from
                  the <em>Poems, Original and Translated</em>. While Byron's career flees from <em>Hours</em>, the <em>Satirist</em> maintain its centrality to Byronism, even after Clarke had left the journal, because
                  of its affinity with the journal's construction of the Whig aristocracy as enablers
                  of fictitious labor. In the March, 1808 number, the <em>Satirist</em> publishes a correspondent's praise, 
                  “Address to the Satirist,”
                   which begins “Health to the Satirist! Whose daring hand/Scourges the rampant follies
                  of the land” (2: 7). Almost certainly written by Clarke, the poem associates the <em>Satirist</em>'s attacks on idle poetry with its repudiation of the “All the Talents” government
                  led by the Whig Lord Grenville. Framed by two articles—
                  “The School of Eloquence and Grace”
                   and 
                  “Female Costume”
                  —that demonstrate the connections between economic activity and personal perceptions
                  and experiences, the poem, with guiding footnotes, references Mr. Satirist's many
                  cuts from prior reviews, political and poetical. In contrast to the characters of
                  the surrounding articles, the poem argues for a consistency in the <em>Satirist</em> that runs contrary to contemporary society. He “Gives to each author's work strict
                  review:/ Whether a Lord step forth, whose <em>Idle Hours</em>,/ Display, midst petty wits, his minor powers” (2: 8). The “petty wits” invoke the
                  scene of Cambridge elites who scorned Hewson Clarke and clustered around Byron. In
                  the May, 1808 number, the <em>Satirist</em> compiles snippets that review 
                  “Hours of Idleness, a Series of Poems; by George Gordon, Lord Byron, a Minor,”
                   ranging from the <em>British Critic</em>'s “this is very ingenious Idleness” to the <em>Monthly Mirror</em>'s “This Minor certainly is a <em>minor poet</em> at present; and will, we think, at <em>any age continue</em> to be so.” It concludes by quoting the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> on “the noble Minor's <em>volume</em>,” whose Ossianic poetry is “<em>stupid</em> and <em>tiresome</em>” (335).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Hewson Clarke, as a sizar at Emmanuel College had, at least potentially, to work for
               his reduced expenses. He would have been among the poorer students, and, in considering
               himself a writer, would have recognized Byron as a local rival. Byron, by contrast,
               affected a complete indifference for Clarke, except in his character as a writer in
               <em>The Satirist</em>, although in a footnote to <em>English Bards</em>, <span class="name">Byron</span> notes that Newcastle, “the town in whose markets he [Clarke] had sold meat, and in
               whose weekly journal he had written, deserved better treatment” than it is given in
               Clarke's later writing (<a class="link_ref" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BJUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=byron+%22hewson+clarke%22">124</a>), a comment that registers, and personalizes, Clarke's class politics. Ben Wilson
               notes that Clarke worked as “an errand boy at a chemists” while writing “satires for
               <em>The Tyne Mercury</em>” and, once at Cambridge, “developed a lasting and fathomless enmity toward the upper
               class” (173). In the March 1808 issue of <em>The Satirist</em>, the first of an extended sequence, 
               “The Cantab”
               appeared; it ran until its ninth number in February, 1809, and represented itself
               as debunking the myth of Cambridge maintained “by the visionary retrospections of
               its departed members” (2:42). In 
               “Cantab VIII,”
               both “Lord B—“ (with his bear) and Mr. Hewson Clarke” appear, the former rescuing
               his “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chere amie</span>” from a fire and the latter completing his 
               “<em>Art of Pleasing</em>”
               (3:478). These articles drew on Clarke's experiences, though they projected his own
               dissipation (some of which Cyrus Redding recounts in <em>Fifty Years' Recollections</em>; <a class="link_ref" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=78YEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22fifty+years%27+recollections%22+hewson">1: 245-6</a>) onto others, as when another student harasses his patron for funds. In the first
               number, he sets the intellectual standard: “A student generally comes to the university
               with a sufficient knowledge of the classics, and if he be not ruined by the dissipation
               of the place, he may easily retain it” (2:43). Throughout, especially as it is highlighted
               by the <em>Satirist</em>'s Tory leanings, the series connects college dissipation with Whig ambitions, and
               underscores the problems of aristocratic labor, which is associated with the Whigs'
               indolence as a party indifferent to workers but mired in the abstractions of political
               economy (see figure one).</p>

            <p>In the June, 1808, <em>Satirist</em>, Clarke published, as part of 
               “Cantab No. 3,”
               a parodic “Student's Memorandum-Book,” which begins with an editorial introduction
               dividing Cambridge students into three groups: “the studious, the idle, and the profligate”
               (364). The time of the first is spent examining Newton, of the second in “doing nothing,”
               and that of the “profligate in drinking, wh[orin]g, betting, &amp;c, &amp;c.” This language
               locates Byron among the idle, and more, makes him representative of a social class
               for whom idleness constitutes character. The memorandum book covers roughly a week
               in the life of the profligate student, Sir G W, that is, Sir Godfrey Webster, Lady
               Holland's son (whom Lady Caroline Lamb would satirize in <em>Glenarvon</em> along with Lord Byron, for much the same reasons if with only a shadow of the passion;
               like Buchanan, his pseudonym in Glenavron, Godfrey “only came alive while driving
               at top speed through town, or conversing with famous pugilists” [Wilson 176]).</p>

                  with “Hell Fire Dick,” one Richard Vaughan, whom Robert Dighton painted in 
                  “<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?search=ss&amp;firstRun=true&amp;sText=richard+vaughan&amp;LinkID=mp18176&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit">A View of the Telegraph</a>”
                  (1808) and Egan applauded in <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20484/20484-h/london1.htm"><em>Real Life in London</em></a>. The driver of the Cambridge Telegraph, Hell Fire Dick was, according to Francis
                  Grose's 1811 <em>Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</em>, “the favorite companion of the University fashionables, and the only tutor to whose
                  precepts they attend.” According to Lewis Benjamin, “it was a fad of many <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">beaux</span> to dress as stage-coachmen and to imitate their conversation and habits,” even going
                  so far as to drive private vehicles to “pretend to deliver parcels” (a practice to
                  which Byron alludes in his 1813 
                  “The Devil's Drive”
                   [1: 206-7]). Our Student, then, unwilling to perform labor, instead chooses to imitate
                  it; his being is constituted by a satirical relation to work, both his own (as a nascent
                  Whig propagandist) and that of others. The next day, the student receives bills for
                  “whips, dogs, etc. etc.,” and for six “interviews” with “Fanny W[e]lls” Despite his
                  being broke, the last of these is easily handled—he sends her wine and a broach, but
                  for the other debts, he must write his guardian, to whom he argues that his “tutor
                  knows it is proper for me to have the <em>wherewith</em> to be in a genteel way,” and that requires ready money. On Wednesday, he stumbles
                  across the Dean of his College, who gives him “an imposition out of some stuff or
                  other called the Rambler.” As Clarke himself had published the <em>Saunterer</em>, a deliberate echo of Johnson's <em>Rambler</em>, when at Cambridge, Webster's literary ignorance is aligned with his idleness and
                  his Whig perspective. Instead of reading Johnson, Webster is taken by “Devilish funny
                  caricatures” and a “d[amne]d clever thing” by Lord Byron, 
                  “Lord Byron to his Bear”
                  , which the idle poet sings to an adoring audience of young men:

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Byron told Elizabeth Pigot about his bear in the same letter he complained about the
                           Satirist. Nicholas Joukovsky provides a sketch of the literary career of Byron's bear:
                           On 26 October 1807, he announced in a letter to Elizabeth Pigot: "I have got a new
                           friend, the finest in the world, a tame Bear, when I brought him here, they asked
                           me what I meant to do with him, and my reply was 'he should sit for a Fellowship.'
                           ... This answer delighted them not." [I: 135] The bear, who naturally created a sensation
                           when Byron walked him on a chain in Cambridge, was eventually rusticated to Newstead
                           Abbey…</span></div>
                  </div> Once master of his own domain of “consorts,” the bear is now “slave to a Lord.” Such
                  slavery, a subjugation of labor to lordship, imputes to Byron and his fellow students
                  an indifference to the bear's—or any laborer's—rights. The second stanza equates the
                  bear's pranks with Byron's own poetry, equally likely to arouse and to lull to sleep.
                  The <em>Satirist</em> had, in both its reviews of <em>Hours of Idleness</em>, indicated the dullness of Byron's work and its soporific effect. In the final stanza,
                  the juvenile Byron makes the great discovery of sympathy: the bear's enslavement to
                  him is parallel to Byron's enslavement to love. Of course, this is once again a misunderstanding
                  of the laboring class, as the bear's subjugation is inflicted upon it, while Byron's
                  is merely a stylistic choice of his, evident in the conventionality of his poetry.</p>

            <p>In the July, 1808 issue, an article mockingly defends the “Whip and Varmint Clubs,”
               clubs of mostly students who dash around in their coaches and “may achieve great advantages
               to their country, by breaking the necks of a few of the useless mortals who are merely

            <p>Although the <em>Satirist</em> does not go so far as to place the empowered Whigs in this camp, it does suggest
               that, just as some Cambridge scholars are best suited for merely racing around in
               coaches, Whigs, too, have their ideal, Platonic professions: “Mr. Sheridan ..as a
               mountebank, Mr. Windham admired as a conjurer, Lord Grenville celebrated as a Roman
               Catholic Priest, Lord Temple eminent as a stationer, Lord Petty unrivalled as an opera
               dancer, Mr. Walter Scott [thrown in with the Whigs either through ignorance, because
               of his association with the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, or as wit] excellent as a compiler of nursery tales, and George Gordon, Lord Byron,
               a minor,...as the keeper of a <em>bear-garden</em>” (489). Guided by the sound echo of “Whig club” and “Whip Club,” the <em>Satirist</em>, as it does elsewhere, associates Whig theorizing with unregulated consumption and
               undisciplined governance. In its satiric voice, the article notes it can only discover
               “one adverse effect” of such clubs, a “want of employment to those who drive not for
               notoriety but for bread.” The club, however, is alert to this problem and “keeps up
               the spirits of desponding stage and hackney coachmen” by “frequently treat[ing] them
               to a ride in their dashing barouches, and giv[ing] them as much gin and bitters as
               they can drink.” The article turns next to the “Varmint Club,” founded by Lady Holland's
               son, Godfrey Webster, our student who so much admired Byron's song to his bear and
               whom Clarke would, in the <em>Scourge</em>, associate with the economic disaster of paper money, an institutionalized form of
               false promises and unrestrained consumption. Webster's club, again, impersonates labor,
               choosing to dress with “hats...never exceeding three and sixpence and...all their
               other habiliments...proportionally cheap.” Clarke's commentator wonders that so few
               ladies are attracted to these “gentlemen rat-catchers”: “We heard a lovely girl (no
               relation to Lord Byron) declare, that she would sooner marry a <em>bear</em> than a <em>barouche driver</em>...perhaps she wished to keep the <em>whip</em> and reins in her own hands” (491; figure three). </p>

            <p>The following month, the review of <em>Poems, Original and Translated</em> appeared. The <em>Satirist</em> was one of the few journals to review both versions. Clarke asked pardon for again
               intruding on the public “this eccentric <em>minor</em> poet;—but stay, ladies, stay, 'tis a truly harmless Lord, now—he is without his Bear,
               and is himself muzzled” (3: 78). This review divides Byron into two corporate entities,
               the minor Lord who produced <em>Hours</em> and 
               “Bruin and Co.,”
               the somewhat wiser, though no more poetic, construct, disciplined by the periodicals
               which are given credit for Byron's deletions in the new edition. In the December issue
               of 1808, a correspondent named “An Alarmist”—consistent in tone with Hewson's Clarke's
               work, and probably his—writes Mr. Satirist a “Warning”; it begins: “Are you mad, or
               have you as little feeling for yourself as you have for other people?..you have almost
               flayed your victims...till they have roared with the smart, and almost gone mad with
               pain...you had better look about you, Mr. Satirist, [to] escape in your whole skin.”
               On one hand, this parodies the corporate body, which has no “skin” but only a surface
               of paper. But it also plays on the exchange of madness and lashing between the <em>Satirist</em> and its victim-attackers. Who binds whom is determined by an economy of cultural
               production.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The correspondent declares, “I go nowhere now, indeed, but I hear you abused” (3:
                  467). This is hyperbole, increasing the presumed clout of <em>The Satirist</em> by making it the object of universal recognition, and to prove his case, he relays
                  an impromptu, overheard conversation about the journal. A trio of a “gentleman in
                  black,” a “sullen, male novelist,” and a “fine woman with very prominent beauties”
                  agree, as the woman puts it, they must “join our forces to crush these fellows, or
                  we shall positively be all Gothicized;” their anxiety—and therefore the <em>Satirist</em>'s boast—is the control of a public image, to the extent that the novelist can no
                  longer sell his work. As the conversation turns to defending the utility of Criminal
                  Conversation (without which, a new interlocutor injects, “what would be the use of
                  a pretty wife?”), another man then makes this appeal to a thus-far silent interlocutor:
                  “ ‘You are an author, my Lord,' added he, turning to a man who was hanging on the
                  arm of a tall masculine woman, that looked like a Holland <em>frow</em>; ‘suppose you were to take them in hand, and write them down.'” Noting that he is
                  “just now going to Spain,” he replies he might do something “ ‘when I am half-seas
                  over. I and my bear will be a match for them' exclaims [the] <em>minor</em> peer. ‘...And as for what they say of me, I don't care a d[amn].'” The man in black
                  replies, with unintended irony, “Why, surely, it is not possible for them to libel
                  you” (470). This might represent some rumored knowledge of the forthcoming <em>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</em> in which Byron would skewer Hewson Clarke; Byron's letters reflect an anxiety about
                  whether the secret of his poem would hold. In it, he wrote:

                                    the poet and his entire family," to which Byron's immediate response was to institute

                  (that apparently went undelivered).

                  </div> In response to <em>English Bards</em>, Clarke, in the March 1811 <em>The Scourge</em>, accused Byron of being “illegitimate descendant of a murderer” (1:191), prompting
                  Byron to seek legal counsel regarding a law suit for libel, though that was quickly
                  abandoned (<a class="link_ref" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=t-xxjGeVyoMC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=byron+%22hewson+clarke%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3">Byron, <em>Works</em> 226</a>).</p>

            <p>The <em>Satirist</em>, now without Clarke, would go on to review, mostly favorably, <em>Childe Harold</em>, several of Byron's tales, and <em>The Waltz</em> (though probably without knowing Byron wrote it) before it folded in 1814. But the
               figure of “idleness” as the propensity of lordship was easily reinvoked, and constituted,
               for the journal, a recurrent critique. The reviewer of <em>The Giaour</em> concludes by suggesting that, while Byron is “reveling in all the sensual and intellectual
               luxury which the successful sale of Newstead Abbey has procured for you, you little
               think of the privations to which you have subjected us, unfortunate Reviewers; compelled...to
               subsist for a week on half our usual allowance of ‘broth and bullock's liver' in order
               to afford the expensive publication of 41 octavo pages of a ‘rivulet of text flowing
               through a meadow of margin'” (13 [n.s. 3]: 88-9). Even as the Tories reasserted governmental
               control with the establishment of the Regency, the Whig intellectual power, articulated
               in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> and in the rising economic discourse, shifted the battle into a cultural war.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To conclude, I want to glance briefly at one final article. When Henry Pye died in
                  1813 and the office of Poet Laureate fell vacate, the following application was made
                  to the Lord Chamberlain: “Having many hours of idleness upon my hands, and being an
                  adept at versification, it would not be unacceptable to me to try the experiment of
                  writing the Laureate Odes” (13 [n.s. 3]: 246) The author's rationale was that “Being
                  in politics between a Whig and a Jacobin, the subject of our Sovereign's praise will
                  have so much of the Romaunt in my eyes, as sufficiently to resemble that species of
                  composition in which I am most successful.” Signed simply “ Byron,” the signature
                  is in marked contrast to the next applicant, who ends, 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="l">I am,</div> 
                     <div class="l">My Lord,</div> 
                     <div class="l">With the utmost gratitude,</div> 
                     <div class="l">Respect, and admiration,</div>

                     <div class="l">W. Wordsworth.</div>
                  </blockquote> This parodic Byron argues the value of the Laureateship will be to “kill the <em>ennui</em> by which I am devoured”; he maintains that “Wine I now loath—money I detest—praise
                  is irksome to me—and the world only one dull round of apathy and misanthropy.” Just
                  as the earlier Byron of <em>Hours of Idleness</em> positions poetic production as a form of self-amusement, this Byron positions the
                  laureateship as appropriate for him, precisely for his indifference to its rewards.
                  By comparison, Wordsworth's sample poem is a montage of various poems, remarking:

                  </blockquote>These two applications are among the “twelve” that the <em>Satirist</em> denotes as the best among the thousands made. Among the applicants were Walter Scott
                  and Robert Southey. Walter Scott's letter is among the most financially astute: “I
                  begin to be afear'd that the Booksellers will soon think meet to retrench in the purchase
                  of my ballads,” so “I submit my claims to your judgment, as a Candidate for a hundred
                  pounds sterling per annum, and a butt of good sack,...on condition of furnishing a
                  certain quantum of rhyme, at which your Lordship may have heard I possess great alacrity.”
                  This is a great image of the competitive marketplace of fame, matching Scott, Southey,
                  Byron, and others against one another. It is, alas, like the fabulous image from the
                  2002 <em>Observer</em> that begins Tom Mole's book on Byron's fame, of girls screaming at his poetry readings
                  (xi; presumably to Ringo's back beat). Neither happened.

                  </div> There was, of course, no application process for the Poet Laureate, but in imagining
                  it, the <em>Satirist</em> constitutes poetry as a professional market, allied tightly with other government
                  offices. Its proposal is to form a committee of the twelve best, to replace the single
                  laureate (and divide the emolument evenly among them to curtail expenses). When Walter
                  Scott received, to his declared surprise, the offer of the Poet Laureateship, he declined
                  and, with apologies, wrote Southey that he had hinted to Croker that Southey should
                  take up the laurel. Of course, the closest Byron came to the laureateship were his
                  satires on and of Robert Southey. But Mr. Satirist, if making up the scene, caught
                  the emerging dynamic of the literary marketplace, and—caught in it as he was, with
                  his own journal on the financial ropes—recognized the need, the gain, even the inevitability
                  of bringing the poets—even Lord Byron who had refused the profits of his first works—into
                  its sphere. Such competition provided both a ready comparison and a proxy for the
                  political skirmishes between Whigs and Tories.

                  friend, the finest in the world, a <em>tame Bear,</em> when I brought him here, they asked me what I meant to do with him, and my reply
                  was 'he should <em>sit</em> for a <em>Fellowship.</em>' ... This answer delighted them not."

                  having embraced one of his Lordship's fellow students a little too warmly. He later
                  gained a wider notoriety through Hewson Clarke's articles in <em>The Satirist</em>—which included a burlesque poem, 
                  “Lord B——n to his Bear”
                  —and through Byron's attack on Clarke in the Postscript to the second edition of <em>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</em> (1809). Byron's curious notion that [Thomas Love Peacock's] Sir Oran Haut-ton was
                  inspired by his bear was recorded by Thomas Medwin in 1821 or 1822 and published in
                  Medwin's <em>Conversations of Lord Byron</em> in 1824.</span> Graham Chainey provides an account of the known facts and legends about the bear
