			<div type="abstract">
				<p rend="noCount">This article analyzes the complex political and cultural rhetorics
					through which the journal <title level="j">Satirist</title> refracts the figure
					of Byron in its reviews,
					its social satire, and its verbal and visual parodies, starting with its 1807
					review of Byron&#8217;s
						<title level="m">Hours of Idleness</title>. Animating this interaction in
					large part is the personal animus between Byron and the <title level="j">Satirist</title> writer
					Hewson Clarke, who was at Cambridge with Byron and for whom Byron represented not only a rival but the
					(frustrating) epitome of aristocratic privilege, a privilege Clarke and <title
						level="j">The Satirist</title> will target in attacks on what they brand
					Whiggish indolence. Schoenfield demonstrates how even at this early stage in Byron&#8217;s career, the
						<title level="j">Satirist</title>&#8217;s attacks function to deflate, by
					redeploying, Byron&#8217;s figuration of his own fame, reflecting back to the poet
					and his audience &#8220;the fragility of his public self.&#8221; The journal
					thus influentially produces &#8220;a competing version of Byronic celebrity to
					that produced by Byron.&#8221;</p>

				<p>When Byron sent a copy
					of his first publically printed volume, <title level="m">Hours of
						Idleness</title>, to his ineffectual guardian, Lord Carlisle, the elder poet
					evaded an assessment of the poems by writing his thanks in advance of (and
					perhaps entirely in lieu of) reading the poems. Carlisle assured Byron that however the
					public and reviewers received the volume, Byron &#8220;will stand better with the world than
					others who only pursue their studies in Bond St. or at Tatershall's&#8221; (<ref
						target="http://books.google.com/books?id=J2ERAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=%22pursue+their+studies+in+Bond%22"
							>Byron, <title
							level="m">Works</title> 1:138</ref>) Poetry, Carlisle suggests, may not
					be actual labor, but it is better than dissipating consumption on Bond Street, a
					high-end shopping district, or horse racing and gambling at Tattersall's. This
					tepid response, with its emphasis on the &#8220;studies&#8221; of other
					aristocrats, underscores Carlisle's frustration with Byron's indifference to
					his studies at Cambridge. Henry Brougham's review of <title level="m"
						>Hours</title> in the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review,</title> urges Byron to &#8220;forthwith
					abandon poetry, and turn his talents, which are considerable, and his
					opportunities, which are great, to better account&#8221; (<ref
						target="http://books.google.com/books?id=NmIRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=%22which+are+considerable,+and+his+opportunities%22"
							><title level="j">ER</title> 9: 286</ref>). Like Carlisle, Brougham
					raises the issue of the public perception of aristocratic labor, a subject that
					provoked both class-based and party-affiliated responses that ranged from anger
					to amusement. Reviews, both positive and negative, registered the issue, which
					was signaled not only by the title's emphasis on &#8220;idleness,&#8221; but the
					Preface's insistence on Byron's status as a poetic dabbler. Byron's public
					performance, thus, is refracted through competing understandings of the
					relationship between class privilege and forms of labor, both working-class and
					professional.</p>
				<p>Among the most virulent of the reviews was the notice by Hewson Clarke, who was
					at Cambridge at the same time as Byron, in the first issue of <title level="j">The
						Satirist, or the Monthly Meteor</title> (this summary of Clarke's review
					draws from my longer account of it in <title level="m">British
						Periodicals</title> 142-6). Probably suppressing a personal knowledge of the
					identity of the reviewer, Byron's main complaint about the review, expressed to Elizabeth
					Pigot, is that &#8220;my censor only quotes <emph>two lines</emph> from
					different poems&#8221; to support his position (<ref
						target="http://discoverarchive.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/2314/Byron%20to%20Elizabeth%20Pigot%20-%20Oct%2026%2c%201807.pdf?sequence=1"
							><title level="j">BLJ</title> 1:136</ref>). This charge is somewhat
					imprecise, and the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s weird quotation makes the
					review potent. <title level="j">The Satirist</title>, emphasizing the name's
					absence from the annals of accomplishment, quotes six times (once in the
					possessive case) the full denomination of the author announced on the title
					page: &#8220;<emph>George
							Gordon Lord Byron, a minor</emph>&#8221; (<ref
						target="http://discoverarchive.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/2548/Satirist%20No.%201%20-%20Oct.%201807%20-%20Review%20of%20Hours%20of%20Idleness.pdf?sequence=1"
						>1: 77-81</ref>). This repetition (of a pseudo-trimeter line of amphibrachs,
					with strong caesuras emphasizing the rhythm) asserts the mannered construction
					not only of the poetry, but of Byron's self-conception. As Jerome Christensen has noted, Henry Brougham, writing
					several months later in the <title level="j">Edinburgh</title>, exploited the
					tension between Lordship and minority (21-23), and, like Hewson, queried the
					relevance of either to poetic production.</p>
				<p>Clarke's review begins, &#8220;There certainly must be a wonderful charm in the
					name of <emph>author</emph>, and a prodigious desire in men to see their own
					works in <emph>print</emph>, or what could have induced <emph>George Gordon Lord
							Byron, a minor</emph>, to have favoured the world with this
					collection of poems&#8221; (<title level="j">Satirist</title> 1:77). Drawing on
					his own experience as a young author, Clarke adumbrates the method of the
					&#8220;wonderful charm&#8221; in which &#8220;<emph>print</emph>&#8221; becomes
					a mirror in which men can &#8220;see&#8221; their works&#8212;and
					work&#8212;materialized, yet such sight can be a delusion. Using the charmed
					&#8220;name of <emph>author</emph>&#8221; to undercut the awkward amalgam that
					identifies Byron
					particularly, the reviewer insists on his right to regulate excess and
					authenticity. The <title level="j">Satirist</title> reads <title level="m">Hours
						of Idleness</title> as self-exposure that confirms Byron's inability to
					produce and not as his record of the poetic process of transforming idle moments
					into verse: if Byron
					had not published, &#8220;no human being would have guessed the quantity of time
					he had spent in <emph>doing nothing</emph>.&#8221; For the <title level="j"
						>Satirist</title>, Byron's minority is not, as Byron himself positions it, an anteroom to lordship,
					but an expression of his personality. The <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s
					review mentions thirteen poems, nearly the most of any notice of <title
						level="j">Hours</title>, while paraphrasing or, as Byron complains, quoting
					short phrases. In the paragraph on <title level="a">On a Distant View of the
						Village and School, of Harrow, on the Hill,</title> Clarke reduces its title
					to <title level="a">Harrow on the Hill,</title> collapsing the poetic distance
					and distorting Byron's
					generic signals. Such a reduction strips <title level="a">On a Distant
						View</title> of its ironic perspective and represents, as the poem's central
					point, Byron's notion
					that &#8220;he spoke better than Mossop, and acted better than Garrick&#8221;
						(<title level="j">Satirist</title> 1:78). In context, the poem's point is
					that such sensations of fame occur by confusions of scale&#8212;mistaking (even
					while cognizant of the mistake) the school auditorium for Drury Lane and thereby
					mishearing the conventions of applause: <quote>
						<lg type="stanza">
							<l rend="indent2">While, to swell my young pride, such applauses
								resounded,</l>
							<l rend="indent2">I fancied that Mossop himself was outshone</l>
							<l rend="indent2">... fir'd by loud plaudits, and self adulation,</l>
							<l rend="indent2">I regarded myself as a Garrick reviv'd.</l>
						</lg>(18-23)</quote>The comparison with Mossop creates a fantasy of fame
					that the poem discounts but which the review attributes to Byron. Byron saw, in Clarke's
					review, the fragility of his public self, because the redeployment of his words
					altered his character and exposed his anxieties about, and commitments to, that
					character. <title level="a">Harrow</title> is, in part, a meditation on the
					mechanism of the &#8220;wonderful charm&#8221; of authorship, in which applauses
					are reiteratively <emph>re</emph>sounded, both seductive and treacherous, yet
					Clarke insists that Byron is oblivious to and enthralled by this &#8220;charm.&#8221;
						 Byron read the
						<title level="j">Satirist</title> review within a few weeks of its
					appearance and wrote to Elizabeth Pigot about it on October 26, 1807. The letter
					compares Cambridge to Southwell, before discussing the <title level="j"
						>Satirist</title>: &#8220;This place is wretched enough...Oh! the misery of
					doing nothing but make <emph>Love, Enemies</emph>, and
					<emph>Verses</emph>&#8221; (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 1:135). &#8220;This
					place&#8221; is where
						Byron encountered Hewson Clarke, and the phrase &#8220;doing
					nothing&#8221; echoes the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s accusation of
						Byron's idleness.
					But Byron's &#8220;doing
					nothing&#8221; is supplemented&#8212; stylized&#8212;by his making &#8220;love,
					enemies, and verses.&#8221; The asymmetrical meanings of &#8220;making&#8221; as
					applied to each of the nouns gives it triple meaning, and signals the serial
					nature of Byron's own
					construction as a form of valid labor, of continual and varied
					&#8220;making.&#8221;</p>
				<p>From its inaugural issue, in which it skewered <title level="m">Hours of
						Idleness</title>, <title level="j">The Satirist</title> both reviewed Byron's work and injected
					sightings of  Byron into
					its social commentary. Spurred in part by personal animosity between Byron and Hewson Clarke,
					these references often played on private information, and functioned to expose
					Byronic nonchalance as a fa&#231;ade for ambition and privilege, thereby
					producing a competing version of Byronic celebrity to that produced by Byron. <note
						place="foot" resp="editors">The collaborative production of Romantic
						celebrity, particularly with regard to Byron, has been productively explored by Tom Mole and Eric Eisner in his first chapter,
						note 6 of which provides a useful bibliography of critical approaches to
						fame.</note> When 
						Byron published the next edition of <title level="m">Hours</title>,
					retitled <title level="m">Poems, Original and Translated</title>, in 1808, he
					dropped the appellation &#8220;a minor&#8221; as well as the Preface and several
					poems. The <title level="j">Satirist</title>, nonetheless, revives the title in
					its review of the newer volume, and continues to refer to him as &#8220;George Gordon, Lord Byron,
					a Minor.&#8221; The review invents the title <title level="a">Prayer of George Gordon, Lord
							Byron, a Minor</title> for [<title level="a">May Heaven so guard
						my lovely Quaker</title>] (3:82). Further insisting on the durable trace of
						<title level="m">Idleness</title>, this review discusses&#8212;and quotes at
					varying lengths&#8212;six of the poems omitted from the <title level="m">Poems,
						Original and Translated</title>. While Byron's career flees from <title level="m"
						>Hours</title>, the <title level="j">Satirist</title> maintain its
					centrality to Byronism, even after Clarke had left the journal, because of its
					affinity with the journal's construction of the Whig aristocracy as enablers of
					fictitious labor. In the March, 1808 number, the <title level="j"
						>Satirist</title> publishes a correspondent's praise, <title level="a"
						>Address to the Satirist,</title> which begins &#8220;Health to the
					Satirist! Whose daring hand/Scourges the rampant follies of the land&#8221; (2:
					7). Almost certainly written by Clarke, the poem associates the <title level="j"
						>Satirist</title>'s attacks on idle poetry with its repudiation of the
					&#8220;All the Talents&#8221; government led by the Whig Lord Grenville. Framed
					by two articles&#8212;<title level="a">The School of Eloquence and Grace</title>
					and <title level="a">Female Costume</title>&#8212;that demonstrate the
					connections between economic activity and personal perceptions and experiences,
					the poem, with guiding footnotes, references Mr. Satirist's many cuts from prior
					reviews, political and poetical. In contrast to the characters of the
					surrounding articles, the poem argues for a consistency in the <title level="j"
						>Satirist</title> that runs contrary to contemporary society. He
					&#8220;Gives to each author's work strict review:/ Whether a Lord step forth,
					whose <title level="m">Idle Hours</title>,/ Display, midst petty wits, his minor
					powers&#8221; (2: 8). The &#8220;petty wits&#8221; invoke the scene of Cambridge
					elites who scorned Hewson Clarke and clustered around Byron. In the May, 1808
					number, the <title level="j">Satirist</title> compiles snippets that review
						<title level="a">Hours of Idleness, a Series of Poems; by George Gordon, Lord
							Byron, a Minor,</title> ranging from the <title level="j">British
						Critic</title>'s &#8220;this is very ingenious Idleness&#8221; to the <title
						level="j">Monthly Mirror</title>'s &#8220;This Minor certainly is a
						<emph>minor poet</emph> at present; and will, we think, at <emph>any age
						continue</emph> to be so.&#8221; It concludes by quoting the <title
						level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> on &#8220;the noble Minor's
						<emph>volume</emph>,&#8221; whose Ossianic poetry is
						&#8220;<emph>stupid</emph> and <emph>tiresome</emph>&#8221; (335).</p>
				<p>Hewson Clarke, as a sizar at Emmanuel College had, at least potentially, to work
					for his reduced expenses. He would have been among the poorer students, and, in
					considering himself a writer, would have recognized Byron as a local rival.
						Byron, by contrast,
					affected a complete indifference for Clarke, except in his character as a writer
					in <title level="j">The Satirist</title>, although in a footnote to <title
						level="m">English Bards</title>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
						type="person"> Byron</name> notes that Newcastle, &#8220;the town in whose
					markets he [Clarke] had sold meat, and in whose weekly journal he had written,
					deserved better treatment&#8221; than it is given in Clarke's later writing
						(<ref
						target="http://books.google.com/books?id=BJUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=byron+%22hewson+clarke%22"
						>124</ref>), a comment that registers, and personalizes, Clarke's class
					politics. Ben Wilson notes that
					Clarke worked as &#8220;an errand boy at a chemists&#8221; while writing
					&#8220;satires for <title level="j">The Tyne Mercury</title>&#8221; and, once at
					Cambridge, &#8220;developed a lasting and fathomless enmity toward the upper
					class&#8221; (173). In the March 1808 issue of <title level="j">The
						Satirist</title>, the first of an extended sequence, <title level="a">The
						Cantab</title> appeared; it ran until its ninth number in February, 1809,
					and represented itself as debunking the myth of Cambridge maintained &#8220;by
					the visionary retrospections of its departed members&#8221; (2:42). In <title
						level="a">Cantab VIII,</title> both &#8220;Lord B&#8212;&#8220; (with his
					bear) and Mr. Hewson Clarke&#8221; appear, the former rescuing his
						&#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">chere amie</foreign>&#8221; from a fire and
					the latter completing his <title level="a">
						<emph>Art of Pleasing</emph>
					</title>(3:478). These articles drew on Clarke's experiences, though they
					projected his own dissipation (some of which Cyrus Redding recounts in <title level="m">Fifty Years'
						Recollections</title>; <ref
						target="http://books.google.com/books?id=78YEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22fifty+years%27+recollections%22+hewson"

				<p>In the June, 1808, <title level="j">Satirist</title>, Clarke published, as part
					of <title level="a">Cantab No. 3,</title> a parodic &#8220;Student's
					Memorandum-Book,&#8221; which begins with an editorial introduction dividing
					Cambridge students into three groups: &#8220;the studious, the idle, and the
					profligate&#8221; (364). The time of the first is spent examining Newton, of the
					second in &#8220;doing nothing,&#8221; and that of the &#8220;profligate in
					drinking, wh[orin]g, betting, &amp;c, &amp;c.&#8221; This language locates Byron among the idle, and
					more, makes him representative of a social class for whom idleness constitutes
					character. The memorandum book covers roughly a week in the life of the
					profligate student, Sir G W, that is, Sir Godfrey Webster, Lady Holland's son
					(whom Lady Caroline Lamb would satirize in <title level="m">Glenarvon</title>
					along with Lord Byron,
					for much the same reasons if with only a shadow of the passion; like Buchanan,
					his pseudonym in Glenavron, Godfrey &#8220;only came alive while driving at top
					speed through town, or conversing with famous pugilists&#8221; [Wilson 176]).</p>
				<p>On Monday, G.W. wakes at noon with a &#8220;D[amne]d headache,&#8221; an <foreign

					the prior night. Later that day, he meets up with &#8220;Hell Fire Dick,&#8221;
					one Richard Vaughan, whom Robert Dighton painted in <title level="a">

					Telegraph, Hell Fire Dick was, according to Francis Grose's 1811 <title level="m">Dictionary of the
						Vulgar Tongue</title>, &#8220;the favorite companion of the University
					fashionables, and the only tutor to whose precepts they attend.&#8221; According
					to Lewis Benjamin, &#8220;it was
					a fad of many <foreign xml:lang="fr">beaux</foreign> to dress as stage-coachmen
					and to imitate their conversation and habits,&#8221; even going so far as to
					drive private vehicles to &#8220;pretend to deliver parcels&#8221; (a practice
					to which Byron alludes
					in his 1813 <title level="a">The Devil's Drive</title> [1: 206-7]). Our Student,
					then, unwilling to perform labor, instead chooses to imitate it; his being is
					constituted by a satirical relation to work, both his own (as a nascent Whig
					propagandist) and that of others. The next day, the student receives bills for
					&#8220;whips, dogs, etc. etc.,&#8221; and for six &#8220;interviews&#8221; with
					&#8220;Fanny W[e]lls&#8221; Despite his being broke, the last of these is easily

					write his guardian, to whom he argues that his &#8220;tutor knows it is proper
					for me to have the <emph>wherewith</emph> to be in a genteel way,&#8221; and
					that requires ready money. On Wednesday, he stumbles across the Dean of his
					College, who gives him &#8220;an imposition out of some stuff or other called
					the Rambler.&#8221; As Clarke himself had published the <title level="j"
						>Saunterer</title>, a deliberate echo of Johnson's <title level="j">Rambler</title>, when at
					Cambridge, Webster's literary ignorance is aligned with his idleness and his
					Whig perspective. Instead of reading Johnson, Webster is taken by &#8220;Devilish funny
					caricatures&#8221; and a &#8220;d[amne]d clever thing&#8221; by Lord Byron, <title

						Graham Chainey provides an
						account of the known facts and legends about the bear (126-9).</note> Once
					master of his own domain of &#8220;consorts,&#8221; the bear is now &#8220;slave
					to a Lord.&#8221; Such slavery, a subjugation of labor to lordship, imputes to
						 Byron and his
					fellow students an indifference to the bear's&#8212;or any
					laborer's&#8212;rights. The second stanza equates the bear's pranks with Byron's own poetry,
					equally likely to arouse and to lull to sleep. The <title level="j"
						>Satirist</title> had, in both its reviews of <title level="m">Hours of
						Idleness</title>, indicated the dullness of Byron's work and its
					soporific effect. In the final stanza, the juvenile Byron makes the great
					discovery of sympathy: the bear's enslavement to him is parallel to Byron's enslavement to
					love. Of course, this is once again a misunderstanding of the laboring class, as
					the bear's subjugation is inflicted upon it, while Byron's is merely a
					stylistic choice of his, evident in the conventionality of his poetry.</p>

				<p>	Although the <title level="j">Satirist</title> does not go so far as
					to place the empowered Whigs in this camp, it does suggest that, just as some
					Cambridge scholars are best suited for merely racing around in coaches, Whigs,
					too, have their ideal, Platonic professions: &#8220;Mr. Sheridan ..as a
					mountebank, Mr. Windham admired as a conjurer, Lord Grenville celebrated as a
					Roman Catholic Priest, Lord Temple eminent as a stationer, Lord Petty unrivalled
					as an opera dancer, Mr. Walter Scott [thrown in with the Whigs either through
					ignorance, because of his association with the <title level="j">Edinburgh
						Review</title>, or as wit] excellent as a compiler of nursery tales, and
						George Gordon, Lord
						Byron, a minor,...as the keeper of a <emph>bear-garden</emph>&#8221;
					(489). Guided by the sound echo of &#8220;Whig club&#8221; and &#8220;Whip
					Club,&#8221; the <title level="j">Satirist</title>, as it does elsewhere,
					associates Whig theorizing with unregulated consumption and undisciplined
					governance. In its satiric voice, the article notes it can only discover
					&#8220;one adverse effect&#8221; of such clubs, a &#8220;want of employment to
					those who drive not for notoriety but for bread.&#8221; The club, however, is
					alert to this problem and &#8220;keeps up the spirits of desponding stage and
					hackney coachmen&#8221; by &#8220;frequently treat[ing] them to a ride in their
					dashing barouches, and giv[ing] them as much gin and bitters as they can
					drink.&#8221; The article turns next to the &#8220;Varmint Club,&#8221; founded
					by Lady Holland's son, Godfrey Webster, our student who so much admired Byron's song to his bear
					and whom Clarke would, in the <title level="j">Scourge</title>, associate with
					the economic disaster of paper money, an institutionalized form of false
					promises and unrestrained consumption. Webster's club, again, impersonates
					labor, choosing to dress with &#8220;hats...never exceeding three and sixpence
					and...all their other habiliments...proportionally cheap.&#8221; Clarke's
					commentator wonders that so few ladies are attracted to these &#8220;gentlemen
					rat-catchers&#8221;: &#8220;We heard a lovely girl (no relation to Lord Byron) declare, that
					she would sooner marry a <emph>bear</emph> than a <emph>barouche
					driver</emph>...perhaps she wished to keep the <emph>whip</emph> and reins in
					her own hands&#8221; (491; figure three).

				<p>The following month, the review of <title level="m">Poems, Original and
						Translated</title> appeared. The <title level="j">Satirist</title> was one
					of the few journals to review both versions. Clarke asked pardon for again
					intruding on the public &#8220;this eccentric <emph>minor</emph> poet;&#8212;but
					stay, ladies, stay, 'tis a truly harmless Lord, now&#8212;he is without his
					Bear, and is himself muzzled&#8221; (3: 78). This review divides Byron into two corporate
					entities, the minor Lord who produced <title level="m">Hours</title> and <title
						level="a">Bruin and Co.,</title> the somewhat wiser, though no more poetic,
					construct, disciplined by the periodicals which are given credit for Byron's deletions in the
					new edition. In the December issue of 1808, a correspondent named &#8220;An
					Alarmist&#8221;&#8212;consistent in tone with Hewson's Clarke's work, and
					probably his&#8212;writes Mr. Satirist a &#8220;Warning&#8221;; it begins:
					&#8220;Are you mad, or have you as little feeling for yourself as you have for
					other people?..you have almost flayed your victims...till they have roared with
					the smart, and almost gone mad with pain...you had better look about you, Mr.
					Satirist, [to] escape in your whole skin.&#8221; On one hand, this parodies the
					corporate body, which has no &#8220;skin&#8221; but only a surface of paper. But
					it also plays on the exchange of madness and lashing between the <title
						level="j">Satirist</title> and its victim-attackers. Who binds whom is
					determined by an economy of cultural production.</p>
				<p>The correspondent declares, &#8220;I go nowhere now, indeed, but I hear you
					abused&#8221; (3: 467). This is hyperbole, increasing the presumed clout of
						<title level="j">The Satirist</title> by making it the object of universal
					recognition, and to prove his case, he relays an impromptu, overheard
					conversation about the journal. A trio of a &#8220;gentleman in black,&#8221; a
					&#8220;sullen, male novelist,&#8221; and a &#8220;fine woman with very prominent
					beauties&#8221; agree, as the woman puts it, they must &#8220;join our forces to
					crush these fellows, or we shall positively be all Gothicized;&#8221; their
					anxiety&#8212;and therefore the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s
					boast&#8212;is the control of a public image, to the extent that the novelist
					can no longer sell his work. As the conversation turns to defending the utility
					of Criminal Conversation (without which, a new interlocutor injects, &#8220;what
					would be the use of a pretty wife?&#8221;), another man then makes this appeal
					to a thus-far silent interlocutor: &#8220; &#8216;You are an author, my Lord,'
					added he, turning to a man who was hanging on the arm of a tall masculine woman,
					that looked like a Holland <emph>frow</emph>; &#8216;suppose you were to take
					them in hand, and write them down.'&#8221; Noting that he is &#8220;just now
					going to Spain,&#8221; he replies he might do something &#8220; &#8216;when I am
					half-seas over. I and my bear will be a match for them' exclaims [the]
						<emph>minor</emph> peer. &#8216;...And as for what they say of me, I don't
					care a d[amn].'&#8221; The man in black replies, with unintended irony,
					&#8220;Why, surely, it is not possible for them to libel you&#8221; (470). This
					might represent some rumored knowledge of the forthcoming <title level="m"
						>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</title> in which Byron would skewer Hewson
					Clarke; Byron's letters
					reflect an anxiety about whether the secret of his poem would hold. In it, he
					wrote: <quote>
						<lg type="stanza">

								piteously 'to please',</l>
							<l rend="indent2">Forgetting doggerel leads not to degrees,</l>

							<l rend="indent2">And furbish falsehoods for a magazine,</l>

									institute a libel suite which he ultimately did not pursue
									(28).</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote>Soon after this, Hewson Clarke, who never received his degree from
					Cambridge, left <title level="j">The Satirist</title> and edited <title

							>Byron, <title
							level="m">Works</title> 226</ref>).</p>
				<p>The <title level="j">Satirist</title>, now without Clarke, would go on to review,
					mostly favorably, <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, several of Byron's tales, and <title
						level="m">The Waltz</title> (though probably without knowing Byron wrote it) before it
					folded in 1814. But the figure of &#8220;idleness&#8221; as the propensity of
					lordship was easily reinvoked, and constituted, for the journal, a recurrent
					critique. The reviewer of <title level="m">The Giaour</title> concludes by
					suggesting that, while Byron is &#8220;reveling in all the sensual and intellectual luxury
					which the successful sale of Newstead Abbey has procured for you, you little
					think of the privations to which you have subjected us, unfortunate Reviewers;
					compelled...to subsist for a week on half our usual allowance of &#8216;broth
					and bullock's liver' in order to afford the expensive publication of 41 octavo
					pages of a &#8216;rivulet of text flowing through a meadow of margin'&#8221; (13
					[n.s. 3]: 88-9). Even as the Tories reasserted governmental control with the
					establishment of the Regency, the Whig intellectual power, articulated in the
						<title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> and in the rising economic
					discourse, shifted the battle into a cultural war.</p>
				<p>To conclude, I want to glance briefly at one final article. When Henry Pye died
					in 1813 and the office of Poet Laureate fell vacate, the following application
					was made to the Lord Chamberlain: &#8220;Having many hours of idleness upon my
					hands, and being an adept at versification, it would not be unacceptable to me
					to try the experiment of writing the Laureate Odes&#8221; (13 [n.s. 3]: 246) The
					author's rationale was that &#8220;Being in politics between a Whig and a
					Jacobin, the subject of our Sovereign's praise will have so much of the Romaunt
					in my eyes, as sufficiently to resemble that species of composition in which I
					am most successful.&#8221; Signed simply &#8220; Byron,&#8221; the
					signature is in marked contrast to the next applicant, who ends, <quote>
						
							<l>I am,</l>
							<l>My Lord,</l>
							<l>With the utmost gratitude,</l>
							<l>Respect, and admiration,</l>
							<l>Your Lordship's</l>
							<l>Most obedient, devoted,</l>
							<l>And very humble servant,</l>
							<l>
								W.
								Wordsworth.</l>
						
					</quote>
					This parodic
						Byron argues the value of the Laureateship will be to &#8220;kill the
						<emph>ennui</emph> by which I am devoured&#8221;; he maintains that
					&#8220;Wine I now loath&#8212;money I detest&#8212;praise is irksome to
					me&#8212;and the world only one dull round of apathy and misanthropy.&#8221;
					Just as the earlier Byron of <title level="m">Hours of Idleness</title> positions poetic
					production as a form of self-amusement, this Byron positions the laureateship as appropriate for
					him, precisely for his indifference to its rewards. By comparison, Wordsworth's sample poem is a
					montage of various poems, remarking: <quote>
						<lg type="stanza">
							<l rend="indent2">
								<emph>Sack and a salary</emph> are &#8220;there,</l>
							<l rend="indent2">Few visions have I seen more fair;&#8221;</l>
							<l rend="indent2">and</l>
							<l rend="indent4">&#8220;My heart leaps up when I behold</l>
							<l rend="indent5">An office rear'd on high:&#8221;</l>
							<l rend="indent2">and concluding:</l>

							<l rend="indent2">And I could wish my days to be <lb/>Bound each to each
								by&#8221; <emph>Sack and Salary</emph>.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote>These two applications are among the &#8220;twelve&#8221; that the
						<title level="j">Satirist</title> denotes as the best among the thousands
					made. Among the applicants were Walter Scott and Robert Southey. Walter Scott's
					letter is among the most financially astute: &#8220;I begin to be afear'd that
					the Booksellers will soon think meet to retrench in the purchase of my
					ballads,&#8221; so &#8220;I submit my claims to your judgment, as a Candidate
					for a hundred pounds sterling per annum, and a butt of good sack,...on condition
					of furnishing a certain quantum of rhyme, at which your Lordship may have heard
					I possess great alacrity.&#8221; This is a great image of the competitive
					marketplace of fame, matching Scott, Southey, Byron, and others against one another. It is, alas,
					like the fabulous image from the 2002 <title level="j">Observer</title> that
					begins Tom Mole's book on Byron's fame, of girls
					screaming at his poetry readings (xi; presumably to Ringo's back beat). Neither
					happened. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Lamb's reaction to

							Byron's version
						of their affair or to Byron's canonical authorial power" (61) and so complicates
						psychological models by demonstrating a complex rhetoric of fame.</note>
					There was, of course, no application process for the Poet Laureate, but in
					imagining it, the <title level="j">Satirist</title> constitutes poetry as a
					professional market, allied tightly with other government offices. Its proposal
					is to form a committee of the twelve best, to replace the single laureate (and
					divide the emolument evenly among them to curtail expenses). When Walter Scott
					received, to his declared surprise, the offer of the Poet Laureateship, he
					declined and, with apologies, wrote Southey that he had hinted to Croker that
					Southey should take up the laurel. Of course, the closest Byron came to the
					laureateship were his satires on and of Robert Southey. But Mr. Satirist, if
					making up the scene, caught the emerging dynamic of the literary marketplace,
					and&#8212;caught in it as he was, with his own journal on the financial
					ropes&#8212;recognized the need, the gain, even the inevitability of bringing
					the poets&#8212;even Lord
						Byron who had refused the profits of his first works&#8212;into its
					sphere. Such competition provided both a ready comparison and a proxy for the
					political skirmishes between Whigs and Tories. <note place="foot"

							<emph> Living in Style;, Or, The Miseries of Infidelity. A Satirical
								Novel</emph> By Hewson Clarke, Esq.</title> Worldcat shows no record
						of this particular work, but its title makes an intriguing final comment
						upon Byron. (A later
						advertisement announces an "Account of the Cause and Separation of Lord and
						Lady Byron, with some interesting Anecdotes of his Lordship, never before
						published.")</note> If the initial skirmishes I have traced can be viewed as
					the juvenile squabbling of two under-achieving Cambridge students, their
					escalation into battles on and of the national stage signaled not only the
					maturing of George Gordon, Lord
						Byron, a minor, but of his rivals and the poetic marketplace.</p>
