         	<p rend="noCount">This article analyzes  the complex political and cultural rhetorics through which the journal <title level="j">Satirist</title> refracts the figure of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> in its reviews, its social satire, and its verbal and visual parodies, starting with its 1807 review of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s <title level="m">Hours of Idleness</title>. Animating this interaction in large part is the personal animus between <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and the <title level="j">Satirist</title> writer Hewson Clarke, who was at Cambridge with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and for whom <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> represented not only 	a rival but the (frustrating) epitome of aristocratic privilege, a privilege Clarke and <title level="j">The Satirist</title> will target in attacks on what they brand Whiggish indolence. <name ref="#SchoenfieldMark" type="person">Schoenfield</name> demonstrates how even at this early stage in <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s career, the <title level="j">Satirist</title>&#8217;s attacks function to deflate, by redeploying, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>&#8217;s figuration of his own fame, reflecting back to the poet and his audience &#8220;the fragility of his public self.&#8221; The journal thus influentially produces &#8220;a competing version of Byronic celebrity to that produced by <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>.&#8221;</p>

				<p>When <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> sent a copy of his first publically printed volume, <title
						level="m">Hours of Idleness</title>, to his ineffectual guardian, Lord Carlisle, the elder poet evaded an assessment of the
					poems by writing his thanks in advance of (and perhaps entirely in lieu of) reading the poems. Carlisle assured <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> that however the public and reviewers received the volume, <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> &#8220;will stand better with the world than others who only pursue
					their studies in Bond St. or at Tatershall's&#8221; (<ref
						target="http://books.google.com/books?id=J2ERAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=%22pursue+their+studies+in+Bond%22"><name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, <title level="m">Works</title> 1:138</ref>) Poetry, Carlisle
					suggests, may not be actual labor, but it is better than dissipating consumption on Bond Street, a high-end shopping district, or
					horse racing and gambling at Tattersall's. This tepid response, with its emphasis on the &#8220;studies&#8221; of other
					aristocrats, underscores Carlisle's frustration with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s indifference
					to his studies at Cambridge. Henry Brougham's review of <title level="m">Hours</title> in the <title level="j">Edinburgh
						Review,</title> urges <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> to &#8220;forthwith abandon poetry, and
					turn his talents, which are considerable, and his opportunities, which are great, to better account&#8221; (<ref
						target="http://books.google.com/books?id=NmIRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=%22which+are+considerable,+and+his+opportunities%22"
							><title level="j">ER</title> 9: 286</ref>). Like Carlisle, Brougham raises the issue of the public perception of
					aristocratic labor, a subject that provoked both class-based and party-affiliated responses that ranged from anger to amusement.
					Reviews, both positive and negative, registered the issue, which was signaled not only by the title's emphasis on
					&#8220;idleness,&#8221; but the Preface's insistence on <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s status as
					a poetic dabbler. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s public performance, thus, is refracted through
					competing understandings of the relationship between class privilege and forms of labor, both working-class and professional.</p>
				<p>Among the most virulent of the reviews was the notice by Hewson Clarke, who was at Cambridge at the same time as <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, in the first issue of <title level="j">The Satirist, or the Monthly
						Meteor</title> (this summary of Clarke's review draws from my longer account of it in <title level="m">British
						Periodicals</title> 142-6). Probably suppressing a personal knowledge of the identity of the reviewer, <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s main complaint about the review, expressed to Elizabeth Pigot, is
					that &#8220;my censor only quotes <emph>two lines</emph> from different poems&#8221; to support his position (<ref
						target="http://discoverarchive.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/2314/Byron%20to%20Elizabeth%20Pigot%20-%20Oct%2026%2c%201807.pdf?sequence=1"
							><title level="j">BLJ</title> 1:136</ref>). This charge is somewhat imprecise, and the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s
					weird quotation makes the review potent. <title level="j">The Satirist</title>, emphasizing the name's absence from the annals of
					accomplishment, quotes six times (once in the possessive case) the full denomination of the author announced on the title page:
							&#8220;<emph><name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">George Gordon Lord Byron</name>, a minor</emph>&#8221; (<ref
						target="http://discoverarchive.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/2548/Satirist%20No.%201%20-%20Oct.%201807%20-%20Review%20of%20Hours%20of%20Idleness.pdf?sequence=1"
						>1: 77-81</ref>). This repetition (of a pseudo-trimeter line of amphibrachs, with strong caesuras emphasizing the rhythm)
					asserts the mannered construction not only of the poetry, but of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s
					self-conception. As <name ref="#ChristensenJerome" type="person">Jerome Christensen</name> has noted, Henry Brougham, writing
					several months later in the <title level="j">Edinburgh</title>, exploited the tension between Lordship and minority (21-23), and,
					like Hewson, queried the relevance of either to poetic production.</p>
				<p>Clarke's review begins, &#8220;There certainly must be a wonderful charm in the name of <emph>author</emph>, and a prodigious
					desire in men to see their own works in <emph>print</emph>, or what could have induced <emph><name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
							type="person">George Gordon Lord Byron</name>, a minor</emph>, to have favoured the world with this collection of
					poems&#8221; (<title level="j">Satirist</title> 1:77). Drawing on his own experience as a young author, Clarke adumbrates the
					method of the &#8220;wonderful charm&#8221; in which &#8220;<emph>print</emph>&#8221; becomes a mirror in which men can
					&#8220;see&#8221; their works&#8212;and work&#8212;materialized, yet such sight can be a delusion. Using the charmed &#8220;name
					of <emph>author</emph>&#8221; to undercut the awkward amalgam that identifies <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">
						Byron</name> particularly, the reviewer insists on his right to regulate excess and authenticity. The <title level="j"
						>Satirist</title> reads <title level="m">Hours of Idleness</title> as self-exposure that confirms <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s inability to produce and not as his record of the poetic process of
					transforming idle moments into verse: if <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> had not published,
					&#8220;no human being would have guessed the quantity of time he had spent in <emph>doing nothing</emph>.&#8221; For the <title
						level="j">Satirist</title>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s minority is not, as <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> himself positions it, an anteroom to lordship, but an expression of
					his personality. The <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s review mentions thirteen poems, nearly the most of any notice of <title
						level="j">Hours</title>, while paraphrasing or, as <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> complains,
					quoting short phrases. In the paragraph on <title level="a">On a Distant View of the Village and School, of Harrow, on the
						Hill,</title> Clarke reduces its title to <title level="a">Harrow on the Hill,</title> collapsing the poetic distance and
					distorting <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s generic signals. Such a reduction strips <title
						level="a">On a Distant View</title> of its ironic perspective and represents, as the poem's central point, <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s notion that &#8220;he spoke better than Mossop, and acted better
					than Garrick&#8221; (<title level="j">Satirist</title> 1:78). In context, the poem's point is that such sensations of fame occur
					by confusions of scale&#8212;mistaking (even while cognizant of the mistake) the school auditorium for Drury Lane and thereby
					mishearing the conventions of applause: <quote>
						<lg type="stanza">
							<l rend="indent2">While, to swell my young pride, such applauses resounded,</l>
							<l rend="indent2">I fancied that Mossop himself was outshone</l>
							<l rend="indent2">... fir'd by loud plaudits, and self adulation,</l>
							<l rend="indent2">I regarded myself as a Garrick reviv'd.</l>
						</lg>(18-23)</quote>The comparison with Mossop creates a fantasy of fame that the poem discounts but which the review
					attributes to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">
						Byron</name> saw, in Clarke's review, the fragility of his public self, because the redeployment of his words altered his
					character and exposed his anxieties about, and commitments to, that character. <title level="a">Harrow</title> is, in part, a
					meditation on the mechanism of the &#8220;wonderful charm&#8221; of authorship, in which applauses are reiteratively
						<emph>re</emph>sounded, both seductive and treacherous, yet Clarke insists that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
						type="person">Byron</name> is oblivious to and enthralled by this &#8220;charm.&#8221; <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
						type="person"> Byron</name> read the <title level="j">Satirist</title> review within a few weeks of its appearance and wrote
					to Elizabeth Pigot about it on October 26, 1807. The letter compares Cambridge to Southwell, before discussing the <title
						level="j">Satirist</title>: &#8220;This place is wretched enough...Oh! the misery of doing nothing but make <emph>Love,
						Enemies</emph>, and <emph>Verses</emph>&#8221; (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 1:135). &#8220;This place&#8221; is where <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> encountered Hewson Clarke, and the phrase &#8220;doing nothing&#8221;
					echoes the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s accusation of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s
					idleness. But <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s &#8220;doing nothing&#8221; is supplemented&#8212;
					stylized&#8212;by his making &#8220;love, enemies, and verses.&#8221; The asymmetrical meanings of &#8220;making&#8221; as applied
					to each of the nouns gives it triple meaning, and signals the serial nature of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
						>Byron</name>'s own construction as a form of valid labor, of continual and varied &#8220;making.&#8221;</p>
				<p>From its inaugural issue, in which it skewered <title level="m">Hours of Idleness</title>, <title level="j">The Satirist</title>
					both reviewed <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s work and injected sightings of <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> into its social commentary. Spurred in part by personal animosity
					between <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> and Hewson Clarke, these references often played on private
					information, and functioned to expose Byronic nonchalance as a fa&#231;ade for ambition and privilege, thereby producing a
					competing version of Byronic celebrity to that produced by <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. <note
						n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The collaborative production of Romantic celebrity, particularly with regard to <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, has been productively explored by <name ref="#MoleThomas"
							type="person">Tom Mole</name> and <name ref="#EisnerEric" type="person">Eric Eisner</name> in his first chapter, note 6 of
						which provides a useful bibliography of critical approaches to fame.</note> When <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord"
						type="person"> Byron</name> published the next edition of <title level="m">Hours</title>, retitled <title level="m">Poems,
						Original and Translated</title>, in 1808, he dropped the appellation &#8220;a minor&#8221; as well as the Preface and several
					poems. The <title level="j">Satirist</title>, nonetheless, revives the title in its review of the newer volume, and continues to
					refer to him as &#8220;<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">George Gordon, Lord Byron</name>, a Minor.&#8221; The
					review invents the title <title level="a">Prayer of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">George Gordon, Lord
							Byron</name>, a Minor</title> for [<title level="a">May Heaven so guard my lovely Quaker</title>] (3:82). Further
					insisting on the durable trace of <title level="m">Idleness</title>, this review discusses&#8212;and quotes at varying
					lengths&#8212;six of the poems omitted from the <title level="m">Poems, Original and Translated</title>. While <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s career flees from <title level="m">Hours</title>, the <title
						level="j">Satirist</title> maintain its centrality to Byronism, even after Clarke had left the journal, because of its
					affinity with the journal's construction of the Whig aristocracy as enablers of fictitious labor. In the March, 1808 number, the
						<title level="j">Satirist</title> publishes a correspondent's praise, <title level="a">Address to the Satirist,</title> which
					begins &#8220;Health to the Satirist! Whose daring hand/Scourges the rampant follies of the land&#8221; (2: 7). Almost certainly
					written by Clarke, the poem associates the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s attacks on idle poetry with its repudiation of the
					&#8220;All the Talents&#8221; government led by the Whig Lord Grenville. Framed by two articles&#8212;<title level="a">The School
						of Eloquence and Grace</title> and <title level="a">Female Costume</title>&#8212;that demonstrate the connections between
					economic activity and personal perceptions and experiences, the poem, with guiding footnotes, references Mr. Satirist's many cuts
					from prior reviews, political and poetical. In contrast to the characters of the surrounding articles, the poem argues for a
					consistency in the <title level="j">Satirist</title> that runs contrary to contemporary society. He &#8220;Gives to each author's
					work strict review:/ Whether a Lord step forth, whose <title level="m">Idle Hours</title>,/ Display, midst petty wits, his minor
					powers&#8221; (2: 8). The &#8220;petty wits&#8221; invoke the scene of Cambridge elites who scorned Hewson Clarke and clustered
					around <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. In the May, 1808 number, the <title level="j"
						>Satirist</title> compiles snippets that review <title level="a">Hours of Idleness, a Series of Poems; by <name
							ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">George Gordon, Lord Byron</name>, a Minor,</title> ranging from the <title
						level="j">British Critic</title>'s &#8220;this is very ingenious Idleness&#8221; to the <title level="j">Monthly
						Mirror</title>'s &#8220;This Minor certainly is a <emph>minor poet</emph> at present; and will, we think, at <emph>any age
						continue</emph> to be so.&#8221; It concludes by quoting the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> on &#8220;the noble
					Minor's <emph>volume</emph>,&#8221; whose Ossianic poetry is &#8220;<emph>stupid</emph> and <emph>tiresome</emph>&#8221;
					(335).</p>
				<p>Hewson Clarke, as a sizar at Emmanuel College had, at least potentially, to work for his reduced expenses. He would have been among
					the poorer students, and, in considering himself a writer, would have recognized <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"
						>Byron</name> as a local rival. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, by contrast, affected a
					complete indifference for Clarke, except in his character as a writer in <title level="j">The Satirist</title>, although in a
					footnote to <title level="m">English Bards</title>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> notes that
					Newcastle, &#8220;the town in whose markets he [Clarke] had sold meat, and in whose weekly journal he had written, deserved better
					treatment&#8221; than it is given in Clarke's later writing (<ref
						target="http://books.google.com/books?id=BJUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=byron+%22hewson+clarke%22">124</ref>), a comment
					that registers, and personalizes, Clarke's class politics. <name ref="#WilsonBen" type="person">Ben Wilson</name> notes that
					Clarke worked as &#8220;an errand boy at a chemists&#8221; while writing &#8220;satires for <title level="j">The Tyne
						Mercury</title>&#8221; and, once at Cambridge, &#8220;developed a lasting and fathomless enmity toward the upper class&#8221;
					(173). In the March 1808 issue of <title level="j">The Satirist</title>, the first of an extended sequence, <title level="a">The
						Cantab</title> appeared; it ran until its ninth number in February, 1809, and represented itself as debunking the myth of
					Cambridge maintained &#8220;by the visionary retrospections of its departed members&#8221; (2:42). In <title level="a">Cantab
						VIII,</title> both &#8220;Lord B&#8212;&#8220; (with his bear) and Mr. Hewson Clarke&#8221; appear, the former rescuing his
						&#8220;<foreign xml:lang="fr">chere amie</foreign>&#8221; from a fire and the latter completing his <title level="a">
						<emph>Art of Pleasing</emph>
					</title>(3:478). These articles drew on Clarke's experiences, though they projected his own dissipation (some of which <name
						ref="#ReddingCyrus" type="person">Cyrus Redding</name> recounts in <title level="m">Fifty Years' Recollections</title>; <ref
						target="http://books.google.com/books?id=78YEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22fifty+years%27+recollections%22+hewson"> 1:
						245-6</ref>) onto others, as when another student harasses his patron for funds. In the first number, he sets the intellectual
					standard: &#8220;A student generally comes to the university with a sufficient knowledge of the classics, and if he be not ruined
					by the dissipation of the place, he may easily retain it&#8221; (2:43). Throughout, especially as it is highlighted by the <title
						level="j">Satirist</title>'s Tory leanings, the series connects college dissipation with Whig ambitions, and underscores the
					problems of aristocratic labor, which is associated with the Whigs' indolence as a party indifferent to workers but mired in the
					abstractions of political economy (see figure one).</p>

				<p>In the June, 1808, <title level="j">Satirist</title>, Clarke published, as part of <title level="a">Cantab No. 3,</title> a parodic
					&#8220;Student's Memorandum-Book,&#8221; which begins with an editorial introduction dividing Cambridge students into three
					groups: &#8220;the studious, the idle, and the profligate&#8221; (364). The time of the first is spent examining Newton, of the
					second in &#8220;doing nothing,&#8221; and that of the &#8220;profligate in drinking, wh[orin]g, betting, &amp;c, &amp;c.&#8221;
					This language locates <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> among the idle, and more, makes him
					representative of a social class for whom idleness constitutes character. The memorandum book covers roughly a week in the life of
					the profligate student, Sir G W, that is, Sir Godfrey Webster, Lady Holland's son (whom Lady Caroline Lamb would satirize in
						<title level="m">Glenarvon</title> along with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>, for much the
					same reasons if with only a shadow of the passion; like Buchanan, his pseudonym in Glenavron, Godfrey &#8220;only came alive while
					driving at top speed through town, or conversing with famous pugilists&#8221; [ <name ref="#WilsonBen" type="person">Wilson</name>
					176]).</p>
				<p>On Monday, G.W. wakes at noon with a &#8220;D[amne]d headache,&#8221; an <foreign xml:lang="la">in medias res</foreign> opening
					that hints at epic struggles the prior night. Later that day, he meets up with &#8220;Hell Fire Dick,&#8221; one Richard Vaughan,
					whom Robert Dighton painted in <title level="a">

					&#8220;it was a fad of many <foreign xml:lang="fr">beaux</foreign> to dress as stage-coachmen and to imitate their conversation

						<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> alludes in his 1813 <title level="a">The Devil's Drive</title>
					[1: 206-7]). Our Student, then, unwilling to perform labor, instead chooses to imitate it; his being is constituted by a satirical
					relation to work, both his own (as a nascent Whig propagandist) and that of others. The next day, the student receives bills for
					&#8220;whips, dogs, etc. etc.,&#8221; and for six &#8220;interviews&#8221; with &#8220;Fanny W[e]lls&#8221; Despite his being
					broke, the last of these is easily handled&#8212;he sends her wine and a broach, but for the other debts, he must write his
					guardian, to whom he argues that his &#8220;tutor knows it is proper for me to have the <emph>wherewith</emph> to be in a genteel
					way,&#8221; and that requires ready money. On Wednesday, he stumbles across the Dean of his College, who gives him &#8220;an
					imposition out of some stuff or other called the Rambler.&#8221; As Clarke himself had published the <title level="j"
						>Saunterer</title>, a deliberate echo of <name ref="#JohnsonSamuel" type="person">Johnson</name>'s <title level="j"
						>Rambler</title>, when at Cambridge, Webster's literary ignorance is aligned with his idleness and his Whig perspective.
					Instead of reading <name ref="#JohnsonSamuel" type="person">Johnson</name>, Webster is taken by &#8220;Devilish funny

					</figure> Although the <title level="j">Satirist</title> does not go so far as to place the empowered Whigs in this camp, it does
					suggest that, just as some Cambridge scholars are best suited for merely racing around in coaches, Whigs, too, have their ideal,
					Platonic professions: &#8220;Mr. Sheridan ..as a mountebank, Mr. Windham admired as a conjurer, Lord Grenville celebrated as a
					Roman Catholic Priest, Lord Temple eminent as a stationer, Lord Petty unrivalled as an opera dancer, Mr. Walter Scott [thrown in
					with the Whigs either through ignorance, because of his association with the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>, or as wit]
					excellent as a compiler of nursery tales, and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">George Gordon, Lord Byron</name>, a
					minor,...as the keeper of a <emph>bear-garden</emph>&#8221; (489). Guided by the sound echo of &#8220;Whig club&#8221; and
					&#8220;Whip Club,&#8221; the <title level="j">Satirist</title>, as it does elsewhere, associates Whig theorizing with unregulated
					consumption and undisciplined governance. In its satiric voice, the article notes it can only discover &#8220;one adverse
					effect&#8221; of such clubs, a &#8220;want of employment to those who drive not for notoriety but for bread.&#8221; The club,
					however, is alert to this problem and &#8220;keeps up the spirits of desponding stage and hackney coachmen&#8221; by
					&#8220;frequently treat[ing] them to a ride in their dashing barouches, and giv[ing] them as much gin and bitters as they can
					drink.&#8221; The article turns next to the &#8220;Varmint Club,&#8221; founded by Lady Holland's son, Godfrey Webster, our
					student who so much admired <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s song to his bear and whom Clarke
					would, in the <title level="j">Scourge</title>, associate with the economic disaster of paper money, an institutionalized form of
					false promises and unrestrained consumption. Webster's club, again, impersonates labor, choosing to dress with &#8220;hats...never
					exceeding three and sixpence and...all their other habiliments...proportionally cheap.&#8221; Clarke's commentator wonders that so
					few ladies are attracted to these &#8220;gentlemen rat-catchers&#8221;: &#8220;We heard a lovely girl (no relation to <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>) declare, that she would sooner marry a <emph>bear</emph> than a
						<emph>barouche driver</emph>...perhaps she wished to keep the <emph>whip</emph> and reins in her own hands&#8221; (491; figure
					three).</p>

				<p>The following month, the review of <title level="m">Poems, Original and Translated</title> appeared. The <title level="j"
						>Satirist</title> was one of the few journals to review both versions. Clarke asked pardon for again intruding on the public
					&#8220;this eccentric <emph>minor</emph> poet;&#8212;but stay, ladies, stay, 'tis a truly harmless Lord, now&#8212;he is without
					his Bear, and is himself muzzled&#8221; (3: 78). This review divides <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">
						Byron</name> into two corporate entities, the minor Lord who produced <title level="m">Hours</title> and <title level="a"
						>Bruin and Co.,</title> the somewhat wiser, though no more poetic, construct, disciplined by the periodicals which are given
					credit for <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s deletions in the new edition. In the December issue of
					1808, a correspondent named &#8220;An Alarmist&#8221;&#8212;consistent in tone with Hewson's Clarke's work, and probably
					his&#8212;writes Mr. Satirist a &#8220;Warning&#8221;; it begins: &#8220;Are you mad, or have you as little feeling for yourself
					as you have for other people?..you have almost flayed your victims...till they have roared with the smart, and almost gone mad
					with pain...you had better look about you, Mr. Satirist, [to] escape in your whole skin.&#8221; On one hand, this parodies the
					corporate body, which has no &#8220;skin&#8221; but only a surface of paper. But it also plays on the exchange of madness and
					lashing between the <title level="j">Satirist</title> and its victim-attackers. Who binds whom is determined by an economy of
					cultural production.</p>
				<p>The correspondent declares, &#8220;I go nowhere now, indeed, but I hear you abused&#8221; (3: 467). This is hyperbole, increasing
					the presumed clout of <title level="j">The Satirist</title> by making it the object of universal recognition, and to prove his
					case, he relays an impromptu, overheard conversation about the journal. A trio of a &#8220;gentleman in black,&#8221; a
					&#8220;sullen, male novelist,&#8221; and a &#8220;fine woman with very prominent beauties&#8221; agree, as the woman puts it, they
					must &#8220;join our forces to crush these fellows, or we shall positively be all Gothicized;&#8221; their anxiety&#8212;and
					therefore the <title level="j">Satirist</title>'s boast&#8212;is the control of a public image, to the extent that the novelist
					can no longer sell his work. As the conversation turns to defending the utility of Criminal Conversation (without which, a new
					interlocutor injects, &#8220;what would be the use of a pretty wife?&#8221;), another man then makes this appeal to a thus-far
					silent interlocutor: &#8220; &#8216;You are an author, my Lord,' added he, turning to a man who was hanging on the arm of a tall
					masculine woman, that looked like a Holland <emph>frow</emph>; &#8216;suppose you were to take them in hand, and write them
					down.'&#8221; Noting that he is &#8220;just now going to Spain,&#8221; he replies he might do something &#8220; &#8216;when I am
					half-seas over. I and my bear will be a match for them' exclaims [the] <emph>minor</emph> peer. &#8216;...And as for what they say
					of me, I don't care a d[amn].'&#8221; The man in black replies, with unintended irony, &#8220;Why, surely, it is not possible for
					them to libel you&#8221; (470). This might represent some rumored knowledge of the forthcoming <title level="m">English Bards and
						Scotch Reviewers</title> in which <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> would skewer Hewson Clarke;
						<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s letters reflect an anxiety about whether the secret of his
					poem would hold. In it, he wrote: <quote>

						</lg>
					</quote>Soon after this, Hewson Clarke, who never received his degree from Cambridge, left <title level="j">The Satirist</title>

							><name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, <title level="m">Works</title> 226</ref>).</p>
				<p>The <title level="j">Satirist</title>, now without Clarke, would go on to review, mostly favorably, <title level="m">Childe
						Harold</title>, several of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s tales, and <title level="m">The
						Waltz</title> (though probably without knowing <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> wrote it) before
					it folded in 1814. But the figure of &#8220;idleness&#8221; as the propensity of lordship was easily reinvoked, and constituted,
					for the journal, a recurrent critique. The reviewer of <title level="m">The Giaour</title> concludes by suggesting that, while
						<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is &#8220;reveling in all the sensual and intellectual luxury
					which the successful sale of Newstead Abbey has procured for you, you little think of the privations to which you have subjected
					us, unfortunate Reviewers; compelled...to subsist for a week on half our usual allowance of &#8216;broth and bullock's liver' in
					order to afford the expensive publication of 41 octavo pages of a &#8216;rivulet of text flowing through a meadow of
					margin'&#8221; (13 [n.s. 3]: 88-9). Even as the Tories reasserted governmental control with the establishment of the Regency, the
					Whig intellectual power, articulated in the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> and in the rising economic discourse,
					shifted the battle into a cultural war.</p>
				<p>To conclude, I want to glance briefly at one final article. When Henry Pye died in 1813 and the office of Poet Laureate fell
					vacate, the following application was made to the Lord Chamberlain: &#8220;Having many hours of idleness upon my hands, and being
					an adept at versification, it would not be unacceptable to me to try the experiment of writing the Laureate Odes&#8221; (13 [n.s.
					3]: 246) The author's rationale was that &#8220;Being in politics between a Whig and a Jacobin, the subject of our Sovereign's
					praise will have so much of the Romaunt in my eyes, as sufficiently to resemble that species of composition in which I am most
					successful.&#8221; Signed simply &#8220;<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name>,&#8221; the signature is in

					</quote>These two applications are among the &#8220;twelve&#8221; that the <title level="j">Satirist</title> denotes as the best
					among the thousands made. Among the applicants were Walter Scott and Robert Southey. Walter Scott's letter is among the most
					financially astute: &#8220;I begin to be afear'd that the Booksellers will soon think meet to retrench in the purchase of my
					ballads,&#8221; so &#8220;I submit my claims to your judgment, as a Candidate for a hundred pounds sterling per annum, and a butt
					of good sack,...on condition of furnishing a certain quantum of rhyme, at which your Lordship may have heard I possess great
					alacrity.&#8221; This is a great image of the competitive marketplace of fame, matching Scott, Southey, <name
						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, and others against one another. It is, alas, like the fabulous image
					from the 2002 <title level="j">Observer</title> that begins <name ref="#MoleThomas" type="person">Tom Mole</name>'s book on <name

						ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person"> Byron</name> came to the laureateship were his satires on and of Robert Southey.
					But Mr. Satirist, if making up the scene, caught the emerging dynamic of the literary marketplace, and&#8212;caught in it as he
					was, with his own journal on the financial ropes&#8212;recognized the need, the gain, even the inevitability of bringing the
					poets&#8212;even <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> who had refused the profits of his first
					works&#8212;into its sphere. Such competition provided both a ready comparison and a proxy for the political skirmishes between
