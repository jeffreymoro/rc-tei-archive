            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Coleridge’s most orthodox concerns sometimes led him to unorthodox conclusions. In <em>Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit</em>, for instance, his defense of human autonomy and agency caused him to identify the
                  Bible as a human document rather than a divinely dictated set of revelations. Coleridge
                  was deeply invested in the Biblical writers’ status as full human agents, not mere
                  vessels for the inspired word. In <em>Confessions</em> he makes this argument most forcefully as a claim about poetry, specifically about
                  the Biblical poet King David: <span class="quote">‘[L]et me once be persuaded that all these heart-awakening Utterances of <em>human</em> hearts—Men of like faculties and passions with my own [...] are but as a “Comedia
                     Divina” of a superhuman—O bear with me, if I say, Ventriloquist—that the Royal Harper,
                     to whom I have so often submitted myself as a “many-stringed instrument” [...] was
                     as mere an instrument as his Harp, an <em>automaton</em> Poet, Mourner, &amp; Supplicant—all is gone! all sympathy, at least, all <em>example</em>! (<em>Shorter Works</em> II:1136)

                     </div>’</span> Coleridge—or his persona—will submit himself to the poet, a mere “instrument” to be
                  played, such that “every several nerve of emotion, passion, thought, that thrids the <em>flesh-and-blood</em> of our common Humanity responds to the Touch” (1136). But the poet himself must be
                  no such passive thing. Importantly, Coleridge pursues this argument about the integrity
                  of human action not by appealing to scriptural authority, but instead to a more self-evident
                  fact about reading: that readers have bodies, and those bodies feel. Poetry is an
                  example—in fact, <em>the</em> example—of free human action, and that freedom is crucial both for the historical
                  efficacy of writing and the experience of reading. The issue at stake is not the authority
                  of scripture, but the value of poetry. Historical actors cannot be made into automata,
                  especially if they are poets.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This essay is about the privilege poetry enjoyed as a marker for a particular Romantic-era
               argument about the mind’s internal structure. Coleridge’s repudiation of the “automaton
               poet” is but one example of the overdetermined status of poetry in Romantic-era philosophy
               of mind. His most frequent target was the materialist claim, launched from various
               angles throughout the period, that if the mind was identical with its physical substrate
               (the pineal gland, the vital spirits, the nerves, or the brain), then it could be
               divided into, or reduced to, its component parts. Poetry, on the other hand—as Coleridge
               famously puts it—“brings the whole soul of man into activity” (<em>Biographia</em> II:13). The first part of this essay shows how, on this argument, poetry modeled
               cognition as at once an embodied process, and one that could not be divided into its
               component parts. I then turn to an alternative formulation in <em>Waverley</em>, where Walter Scott embraces "automatic" <em>poiesis</em>, or something like it, in the character of Davie Gellatley, the cognitively disabled
               minstrel of Tully-Veolan. With Davie, Scott toys with the notion of reducing lyric
               expressivity to the brute elements of memorization and counting time. He thus raises
               the specter of the “automaton poet” that Coleridge had sought to exorcise. I conclude
               with a look at the broader turn Scott signals toward this competing account of the
               poetic mind, which gained particular traction in late Romantic Edinburgh.</p>
            <p>Coleridge had already invoked the “automaton poet” in <em>Biographia Literaria</em>, in order to accuse David Hartley’s associationist system of being deterministic.
               According to Hartley, Coleridge alleges: <span class="quote">‘The inventor of the watch did not in reality invent it; he only looked on, while
                  the blind causes, the only true artists, were unfolding themselves. [ . . . ] So must
                  it have been with Mr. SOUTHEY and LORD BYRON, when the one <em>fancied</em> himself composing “RODERICK,” and the other his “CHILDE HAROLD.” (119-20)’</span> Hartley, in other words, implies an insult to the dignity of poetic activity much
               like the insult Coleridge takes in the <em>Confessions</em>, on behalf of the Davidic psalms. The writing processes of Southey and Byron are
               sacred enough to be juxtaposed with the image of the watch and watchmaker, an analogy
               of mechanical operation with strong echoes of natural theology. The so-called “blind
               causes” would assail divine creativity, but also willful human action, for which poetry
               is the metonym of choice: it proves that we are not mechanical beings.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>While this argument culminates in Coleridge’s allusion to the imagination as a transcendental
                  faculty, it begins with a claim about how the mind is organized. The <em>Biographia</em>’s most sustained objection to association theory is that it makes people into automata
                  because of its impoverished model of the sensorium. Because in Hartley’s system impressions
                  were tied to particular physical locations, Coleridge argues, they could only influence
                  one another by “proximity in place,” and the whole of mental life would reduce to
                  a set of determined interactions between them. “[I]nstead of being the determining
                  causes of association,” then, “the will, the reason, the judgement, and the understanding
                  [...] must needs be represented as its <em>creatures</em>, and among its mechanical effects” (I:110). Setting aside the question of whether
                  Coleridge was taking aim at a straw man here, the result was an insistence that mental
                  functioning hinged on central processing.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For the argument that Coleridge chose Hartley as an easy, “dated” target by comparison
                           with more contemporaneous biologies of mind, see Richardson 9ff.</span></div>
                  </div> Mindedness may involve many different abilities, but its core is one centralized power
                  that can take hold of the “immense” and “unwieldy spectacle” presented by sensation.
                  Poetry offered a model of such central processing. Increasingly aligned with “feeling”
                  (at once a term for embodied response and inward, subjective experience), poetry offered
                  to demonstrate most robustly that the mind was one single, indivisible entity, which
                  had access to the full storehouse of signifiers to use according to its will or whim.
                  If people have diverse faculties, poetry “brings the whole soul of man into activity,
                  with the subordination of its faculties to each other, according to their relative
                  worth and dignity” (II:15-16). The poet, whether Southey, Byron, or King David, imaged
                  a mental life that coordinated the sum total of experience to the purposes of free
                  human action.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Entangling his claim about mental processing with a claim about poetry was a risk,
               since Coleridge’s model of <em>poeisis</em> was hardly the only one in circulation at the time. Walter Scott’s <em>Waverley</em>, for example, invokes quite a different model of poetic production. Scott’s most
               striking figure of the poetic process is another David: not the Biblical psalmist,
               but the minstrel figure Davie Gellatley, the Baron of Bradwardine’s cognitively-disabled
               attendant, who first enters <em>Waverley</em>’s pages singing “with great earnestness, and not without some taste, a fragment of
               an old Scotch ditty” (41). Davie has a penchant for memorizing scraps of traditional
               songs, and he sings apparently by rote, taking advantage of what the novel calls his
               “prodigious memory" (58). It is an openly pondered question—by the narrator, and by
               local gossips—whether he knows more than he lets on, or simply repeats without understanding
               the songs he learned in childhood. When he first approaches Waverley, Davie is totally
               engrossed in his minstrelsy, to the point that he fails to notice Waverley and almost
               runs into him. When Waverley asks him (“though with little hope of receiving answer
               to any constant question”) if Baron Bradwardine is at home, Davie “replied, and, like
               the witch of Thalaba, ‘still his speech was song’”: </p>

            <p> “This,” the narrator archly explains, “conveyed no information” (41).</p>
            <p>Presumably sticking close to Waverley’s point of view, the narrator here suggests
               that Davie’s recitation is a kind of automatically-prompted tune. The comedy of the
               scene derives from Davie’s response to a serious question with an apparently whimsical
               association: a reflex-like turn to his mental storehouse of verse, whether memorized
               by rote or “remixed” from multiple balladic sources. The song draws its proper names
               and its keywords from traditional ballads, notably “Burd Ellen and the Young Tamlane.”
               Burd Ellen is a disaffected mother who, when the young Tamlane asks her to rock their
               child, replies bitterly, before Tamlane goes to sea. The first line of the ballad
               locates her sitting “in her bower window” (Child I:256). So, although Scott’s footnote
               asserts that the song is “original,” the model of authorship actually at work draws
               on existing sources, takes meanings out of context, and splices them into the word-game
               or children’s rhyme that appears in the text.</p>
            <p>I am thinking here of Alan Richardson’s reading of Davie as a figure marking a historical
               shift in the way cognition was understood: rather than a general slowness of thought,
               Davie’s disability is characterized by a selective <em>overdevelopment</em> of one particular aptitude—the lyrical—at the expense of others. Richardson links
               selective overdevelopment to the nascent “biological psychology” that would culminate
               in phrenology, and which generates a small repertoire of “‘partial’ idiots” in Romantic
               literature (164). It is telling, though, that Davie’s selective ability is for poetry,
               rather than some other task. He is not an “automaton poet,” but his poetic practice
               seems associative or automatically prompted, a poetics of the "fancy" that runs afoul
               of Coleridge’s association of poetry with rationality and freedom.</p>
            <p>This rote poetics would have invoked a long history of identifying the prodigious
               with the mechanical, or indeed with the “automatic.” It was Descartes’ description
               of selective overdevelopments, after all, that underwrote the eighteenth-century discourse
               of automation, as well as arguments about the relation between humans and nonhuman
               animals. For Descartes, mind and body were two separate substances, and while he argued
               that the mind was immaterial, unitary, and free, he did so by painting a thoroughly
               mechanistic picture of both the human body and of animals (which he conceived as mindless
               bodies). Unlike humans, animals simply acted according to the disposition of their
               various organs, and even their greatest abilities could be regarded as symptoms of
               mindlessness. When animals outdo humans, Descartes writes: <span class="quote">‘the fact that they do better than we do, does not prove that they are endowed with
                  mind, for in this case they would have more reason than any of us, and would surpass
                  us in all other things. It rather shows that they have no reason at all, and that
                  it is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of their organs, just
                  as a clock, which is only composed of wheels and weights is able to tell the hours
                  and measure the time more correctly than we can do with all our wisdom. (1:117)’</span> Since animals are essentially machines on this argument, they can dramatically outperform
               humans at particular, highly selective tasks, but cannot display the general “dexterity”
               that characterizes the human. Descartes’ favorite metaphor for such automatic, mechanical
               tasks—and one still at work when Coleridge repudiates “blind causes”—was the clock,
               which counts time with great precision because of its underlying mechanism. Birds
               may sing adeptly, and parrots or magpies may be skilled at retaining words, but those
               remain isolated, context-specific skills, the product not of mental states, but of
               “wheels and weights.”</p>
            <p>One of the most direct retorts to that Cartesian position was Locke’s insistence that
               birdsong itself could not be an automatic activity. While <em>hearing</em> a tune could “mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal Spirits” in a bird’s
               brain, which would “contin[ue] on to the Muscles of the Wings,” Locke attributes this
               to the role song could play in warning a bird of danger and “tend[ing] to the Birds
               Preservation.” But Locke can find no such explanatory basis for automation in <em>singing</em>, “which imitation can be of no use to the Bird’s Preservation” (154-5). Not even
               poetry, but the birdsong to which it is compared in caricatures of Romantic poetics,
               was too willful an activity to be considered automatic. For Locke, song breaks free
               from the explanatory power of material psychology.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Figures like Davie Gellatley—those dexterous at keeping time, memorizing tunes, or
                  playing with phonemic and prosodic patterns—would have challenged that equation of
                  song with undetermined action, and would have recalled instead the time-keeping of
                  the Cartesian clock. If Davie is, as Alan Richardson suggests, a figure for an increasingly
                  material, differentiated model of the mind-brain that was emerging in the first decades
                  of the nineteenth century, then his variety of popular song additionally offers an
                  alternative to the rational, imaginative, or “organic” models of cognitive functioning
                  that appear as recognizable commonplaces in Romantic discourse. This ground is increasingly
                  being explored by scholars working on the ballad, the “lesser lyric,” and Romantic
                  poetry’s origins in popular narrative and communal song—a body of traditional literature
                  that proceeds collectively, by drawing together disparately memorized materials, and
                  without necessarily having recourse to the expressive or sentimental protocols typically
                  ascribed to the construction of the lyric in the period.

                  </div> Scott’s deployment of the “automaton poet” figure signals a different Romantic model
                  of poetry, as well as a different sense of what poetic activity illuminates about
                  human mental life.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At around the same time that Scott was beginning his series of <em>Waverley</em> novels, a new generation of materialists found in poetry evidence of the sub-rational,
                  quasi-automatic basis of the mind. George Combe, the Edinburgh-based phrenologist,
                  proselytized his new science with case studies that resonate strongly with Davie.
                  In the <em>Transactions of the Phrenological Society</em>, for instance, he notes as particularly illustrative those “cretins,” who, though
                  “endowed with weak minds, are born with a partic[ul]ar talent,” such as “for copying
                  paintings, for rhyming, or for music” (32). Combe’s paradigmatic example is the latter:
                  the local, Scottish example of the “tuneful idiot.” He writes, “In Edinburgh, an idiot
                  is seen upon the streets who whistles correctly several tunes, but cannot connect
                  three abstract ideas; while we all know men of powerful intellects, who cannot perform
                  three notes of the gamut” (30). Examples of such selective abilities, which Combe
                  presents as if they would be familiar to anyone, serve as a kind of common sense evidence
                  for a (supposedly intuitive) materialist account of the mind. Combe concludes, in
                  fact, that “When these facts are seen and considered by men of plain sense they are
                  impressed with the conviction that the human mind is endowed with a variety of powers,”
                  and that those powers are equivalent to particular organs in the brain (30). This
                  “conviction” is actually something that Combe, alluding to the firm foothold phrenology
                  found north of the Tweed, calls a bit of Scottish “common sense,” as opposed to an
                  ostensibly English prejudice in favor of the mind’s unity.

               <p>Poetry here serves as a window into cognitive functioning for very different reasons
                  than it does in Coleridge’s writing. Yet even in this more materialist climate, the
                  lure of poetry as a quintessentially human activity—as an act of the whole mind—does
                  not go away quite so easily. One anecdote about Robert Burns, with which I will conclude,
                  demonstrates the legacy of the centralized, holistic model of lyrical cognition in
                  late Romantic Edinburgh’s phrenological circles. On March 31, 1834 Burns’s body was
                  exhumed from its grave, in order (as one commentator put it), to “suppl[y] what had
                  so long been desiderated by phrenologists—a correct model of our immortal poet’s head.”

                  canon is Robert Cox’s discussion of the 1834 cranial measurements, his <em>Essay on the Character and Cerebral Development of Robert Burns</em>. The <em>Essay</em>, which first appeared in the <em>Phrenological Journal</em> that same year, and was reprinted by Alexander Stewart (the curator of the Edinburgh
                  Phrenological Museum) for a “centenary celebration” of the poet’s birth, is a medically-based
                  character study (18). Medicalized diagnosis was already an important part of the tradition
                  of Burns biography, as Nigel Leask has recently demonstrated.

                  </div> Where texts like James Currie’s <em>Life of Burns</em> (1800) grounded their analysis in a philosophy of the will, though, Cox reads Burns’s
                  character by correlating his poetry with his cranial measurements, and cataloguing
                  the various organs those measurements supposedly represented. The <em>Essay</em> catalogues the lot of them: the “organ of Tune,” the organ of “Adhesiveness” or sociability,
                  the organ of secretiveness, and so on. Those which appeared slightly larger or more
                  developed—especially the organs of “amativeness” and “love of approbation”—would,
                  according to phrenology’s main tenet, help confirm or explain Burns’s notorious proclivities
                  and failings.</p>
            </div>
            <p>It is surprising, then, that after detailing such particularly developed areas, Cox
               concludes that those differences were minor: “none of the regions of Burns’s brain
               was, relatively to the others, deficient; its total size, we have also seen, was great,
               and its activity was uncommon” (9). Though all of Burns’s organs were exceptionally
               large, in other words, they were all of more or less the same size: he was a rare
               specimen of an exceptional, well-rounded brain. Cox perhaps owed this concession to
               literary-critical precedent. He immediately cites Dugald Stewart’s “well-known” pronouncement
               that “all the faculties of Burns’s mind were, as far as I could judge, equally vigorous;
               and his predilection for poetry was rather the result of his enthusiastic and impassioned
               temper, than of a genius exclusively adapted to that species of composition” (10).
               He no doubt also owed a great deal to Burns’s status as a national hero, someone who
               ought to be carefully distanced from the image of the rural, “tuneful Idiot,” gifted
               at numerous verse, but “deficient” in other matters.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In Cox’s <em>Essay</em>, then, poetry becomes a general or undifferentiated ability once again, but only
                  because it is the sum of many smaller, discrete abilities, which happen to have developed
                  equally. Cox’s praise of Burns’s poetic abilities thus cites many individual strengths—like
                  “philoprogenitiveness,” a “sympathy for weak and helpless objects in general” that
                  could have attuned Burns to the plight of a field-mouse—but culminates in generalities
                  like his “force of character,” the “respect which men instinctively paid him,” and
                  the “native dignity” he evinced when among great literary minds (9). By backing away
                  from phrenology’s emphasis on local, discrete cognitive powers toward this picture
                  of general well-being, balance, and health (a brain in which “none of the regions
                  [...] was, relatively to the others, deficient"), Cox accommodates the divided mind
                  to the idea of poetry as a unified or coordinated act. The model of poetic production
                  invoked here owes a debt to the longstanding, Coleridgean emphasis on “the whole soul
                  of man”—but reconstitutes it in the new language of the material, divisible mind.
                  Coleridge and Cox agree, in other words, that poetry deserving of the name is the
                  product of the whole person. What makes a poet is not the honing of one specialized
                  faculty, such as a prodigious memory, but an engagement with the full domain of human
                  experience.

                  architecture underlying the act. Rather than invoking a centralized power, Cox’s model
                  of the great poet simply implies disparate faculties, possessed in equal measures.

                  or simply to evolutionary adaptations. Thus, on one popular evolutionary account of
                  what literature does, fiction “constitutes an adaptation in its own right” because
                  it “exercis[es] our capacities for handling social information.”

               <p>There are other ways to approach literature from the sciences, however. Some seek

                  In her essay “Making Quite Anew: Brain Modularity and Creativity,” Ellen Spolsky defines
                  artistic creativity in terms of the modular mind (a more recent model of the mind
                  as consisting of many distinct, encapsulated processes, rather than a central, undifferentiated
                  process).

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Like the disagreement represented in this essay by Coleridge and Cox, the more recent
                           philosophical debate around modularity centers on the question of central processing:
                           how much mental functioning can be attributed to innate, functionally specific, encapsulated
                           mechanisms, and how much remains the domain of centralized functions like reasoning
                           and decision-making. For the classic starting point of these discussions, see Fodor.
                           For the “massive modularity” argument, which reduces central processing to a minimum,
                           see Cosmides and Tooby. For a more recent overview of the debate, see Barrett an…</span></div>
                  </div> On her argument, because people’s cognitive categories emerge as the result of different,
                  often competing modular systems, on occasion “[s]ignificant and stubbornly resistant
                  conflicts may emerge.” It is at such moments, Spolsky argues, that “we might observe
                  the work of particularly imaginative artists feeding a community facing a particularly
                  hungry cognitive problem by re-representing the situation in a different modality”
                  (94). In Spolsky’s example of Raphael’s <em>Transfiguration</em>, the cognitive systems deployed by (Biblical) textual information needed to be transposed
                  onto those used to process visual information (85). As with Coleridge’s definition
                  of poetry, a quintessentially human ability—here “creativity”—acquires its rhetorical
                  force by emphasizing an ability to cross between encapsulated realms of experience.
                  Of course, Spolsky’s argument also resembles Robert Cox’s reformulation of that Coleridgean
                  argument, in his picture of Burns as a gifted individual (like Spolsky’s Raphael)
                  who is able to compensate for the constraints ordinarily imposed by the mind’s dividedness.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Spolsky’s argument joins an increasingly audible refrain in empirical approaches to
               literature, one that emphasizes “culture” and “literariness” as qualities worth pursuing
               on their own terms. That impulse—to show that “the literary” mirrors something about
               human cognitive architecture—has a long, Romantic history. Sometimes, “literature”
               names one faculty out of many that seems particularly “human”: narrative, social cognition,
               play with pattern, and so on. On this account, “the literary” continues to name those
               acts that are quintessentially human. But this version of “literature” is now defined
               according to many discrete abilities rather than Coleridge’s synthetic power. In other
               cases, the impulse is still to describe “literature” (or “creativity”) as a triumph
               of the whole mind over its parts, of central processing over modularity. There are
               several ways to read that impulse. One would be to see it as an endeavor in the spirit
               of Coleridge, where an emerging interdisciplinary language offers critics a new purchase
               on humanistic concepts. Another, somewhat less utopian, would be to compare it to
               Robert Cox’s dilemma: he needed, on the one hand, to gesture toward domain-general
               creativity or literariness, because they are the literary critic’s stock in trade;
               but he also needed to redescribe those concepts in terms of the new and largely antithetical
               methodology of phrenology, with its enumeration of the mind’s distinct and domain-specific
               organs. On this latter construal, invoking “the literary” is a simple matter of staking
               out disciplinary territory by scholars who in fact consider it an outmoded term—like
               Cox’s approximation of the unified poetic mind within a paradigm that had little room—or
               need—for it.</p>

               theory (<em>On the Origin of Stories </em>189, 190). For a critique of the impulse to explain literature as an adaptation, see

         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">Like the disagreement represented in this essay by Coleridge and Cox, the more recent
               philosophical debate around modularity centers on the question of central processing:
               how much mental functioning can be attributed to innate, functionally specific, encapsulated
               mechanisms, and how much remains the domain of centralized functions like reasoning
               and decision-making. For the classic starting point of these discussions, see Fodor.
               For the “massive modularity” argument, which reduces central processing to a minimum,
               see Cosmides and Tooby. For a more recent overview of the debate, see Barrett and
               Kurzban. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
