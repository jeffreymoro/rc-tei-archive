            <p>Each of the papers in this second "set" traverses, we might say, a calculus and a
               discourse (lyric in Savarese and Earle, population theory in Broglio). They offer
               extremely different, yet complementary, routes into the terrain of “Romantic
               Number(s)”; they also resonate with some of the concerns of the first "set" of
               essays. Among the operations we encounter here: ranking, assembling, operating,
               making, surveying, enclosing, forecasting, measuring. One notes in this work an
               oscillation between quantitative and qualitative accountings—between the uncountable
               “mass” in Broglio and “mere countability” (to quote Earle) in Earle and Savarese.
               Here Hegel’s reflections in the <title level="m">Logic</title> might help clarify
               what is at stake: “<emph>Measure</emph> is a <emph>relation</emph>, but not relation
               in general, for it is the specific relation between <emph>quality</emph> and
                  <emph>quantity</emph>” (Volume One, Book One, General Division of Being, “Being,”
               §128). And: “Measure is the qualitative quantum, in the first place as immediate—a
               quantum, to which a determinate being or a quality is attached.<anchor
                  xml:id="id_SL107n"/> Measure, where quality and quantity are in one, is thus the
               completion of Being” (“Measure,” §107).</p>
            <p>Whether the “cranial measurements” of Robert Burns’s skull (introduced as a case for
               reflection in Savarese) align with a Hegelian discourse of measure is doubtful:
               though certainly such excursions attest to the longstanding fantasy of generating
               “quality” (of mind, of genius, what have you) undialectically out of “quantity.” One
               finds in this longing for the materialization of mind—whether evidenced in
               phrenological or more current neuro-imaging technologies—a profound and in some ways
               disquieting continuity between the romantic period and our own, as Savarese makes
               clear. (On romanticism as a kind of cognitive science <emph>avant la lettre</emph>,
               see, for example, Alan Richardson. On the pleasures and dangers of the new “science”
               for literary study, see, e.g., Jonathan Kramnick, “Against Literary Darwinism,” and
               the array of responses in the Winter 2012 issue of <title level="j">Critical
                  Inquiry</title>; see too Saverese’s and Jager’s acute review essay on recent work
               in cognitive science and romanticism.) If faculty psychology would seem to be
               obsolete, contemporary theories of “the modular mind” (see Savarese) have re-opened
               the historical question of what precisely romantic poetry was supposed to do (as it
               were) for faculty psychology. “Being, as we first apprehend it, is something utterly
               abstract and characterless; but it is the very essence of Being to characterise
               itself, and its complete characterisation is reached in Measure,” writes Hegel.
               “Measure . . . may serve as a definition of the Absolute” (§107); measure also, in
               another key, manifests itself in historically inflected forms of techne and praxis,
               as these essays all demonstrate.</p>
            <p>Earle and Savarese are preoccupied by the question of poetry: for each, poetry has a
               special status in theories of mind, yet is also specifically embodied—whether in
               Savarese’s diagnostically “idiot minstrel,” Scott’s Davie Gellatley (“the cognitively
               disabled minstrel of Tully-Veolan” in <title level="m">Waverley</title>), or in the
               notional poet-athlete proposed by Mina Loy and amplified in Earle’s meditation. Earle
               explores a Benthamite refunctioning of romantic lyric, that notorious mode of
               defining and communicating individuality. Like Broglio, Earle reactivates a
               calculating discourse (here Benthamite “ranking” as opposed to the “counting” of
               population) to show how romantic lyric ceaselessly “stag[es] a breakdown of the act
               of romantic lyric subjectivity,” yet also invites us “to make rehearsal of the
               inevitable failure of this pursuit a new more modest kind of aesthetic aim.” He
               continues: <quote>This is not to make failure the basis of just another disciplinary
                  norm, but to wager a new more formally complex, tenuous and nonviolent mode of
                  sustaining social normativity, weave enactments of failure as such into the
                  texture of a new Wittgensteinian or Loy-ian “way of life.” </quote> Earle’s essay
               takes up Ferguson’s work such that romantic lyric emerges as a peculiarly triumphant
               way of reckoning with and dissolving “calculating subjectivity”—Earle’s Shelley, for
               example, “evoking a non-calculating and incalculable subjectivity not as a
               determinate cause unto itself but as an emphatically absent cause,” opening the space
               for an unforeseen future, anticipating “the rigorously negative aesthetics of
               art.”</p>
            <p>Earle’s essay explores a poetry which renounces knowledge transmission in favor of
               perpetuating a certain formal pattern. Savarese’s Scott also explores this
               possibility: “With Davie, Scott toys with the notion of reducing lyric expressivity
               to the brute elements of memorization and counting time. He thus raises the specter
               of the ‘automaton poet’ that Coleridge had sought to exorcise.” Building on previous
               scholars’ reckonings with Davie Gellatley, Savarese takes up the figure of automata
               haunting Scott, Coleridge, and romantic philosophy and <emph>poiesis</emph> more
               broadly. Hartleian mechanism here gets its due and its come-uppance, as Savarese
               incisively explores Scott’s minstrel’s materialist yet non-mechanistic
               time-keeping.</p>
            <p>Both Earle and Broglio speak to the socio-political implications of numbering and
               ranking operations: one might think of Earle’s essay as a Rancièreian meditation on
               the use and abuse of hierarchy for democracy, the problem of “staging” equality first
               emergent around 1800 and still very much with us. Broglio proposes an “ordering of
               life” which resists organization into “population”: surveying not only Malthus but
               other visual and textual representations of “the swinish multitude,” Broglio explores
               how “bodies resist quantification where biopower of the body cannot be subsumed by
               population, statistics, and homogenization of the biopolitical apparatus of capture.”
               Food—people’s preferences, aversions, local foodways—becomes in his account a crucial
               “way in which that the biopower of the masses, the swinish multitude, resist
               quantification.” Broglio astutely proposes “<emph>homo oeconomicus</emph>,” that bane
               of Horkheimer and Adorno (among others), as a peculiar opportunity emergent in the
               romantic period: with Foucault’s analytic of biopower in mind, Broglio observes that
                  <emph>homo oeconomicus</emph> is resistant to certain constructions of <emph>homo
                  legalis</emph> or <emph>homo juridicus</emph>. He further suggests (following
               Foucault) that the subject of interest (as the State conceives <emph>homo
                  oeconomicus</emph>) might escape the strictures of the subject of right (as the
               State previously construed <emph>homo juridicus</emph>); that the emergence of
               calculating, economic man (so passionately decried by Wordsworth and in Shelley’s
                  <title level="m">Defence</title>) offered in fact a moment of contingent freedom
               before regimens of governmentality were fully established and legitimized: <quote>In
                  other words, modes of quantification—counting bodies and counting them as citizens
                  of the State subject to its control—become the means of rhetorical and material
                  control of peoples. In contrast, <emph>homo oeconomicus</emph> uses qualitative
                  differences between peoples as a way of evading quantification and counting.
                     <emph>Homo oeconomicus</emph> leverages a biopower—the biological capacities
                  and resistances of bodies—as that which has yet to be co-opted by the
                  biopolitical.</quote>
               <emph>Homo oeconomicus</emph>, on this account, can exploit qualitative differences
               (and here we might recall Earle’s discourse on ranking), however much he might also
               be counted by the census or massified into population tables or mustered into armies.
               There are many ways of being interpellated, these essays point out, incommensurate
               modes of becoming-a-(perceivable)-subject. </p>
            <p>If Earle proposes a kind of Beckettian “Fail Better” as an optimistic slogan we might
               embrace in a universe of ranked yet, because ranked, perceivable subjects, Broglio
               tells a story—despite flashes of chances for freedom—about the growth of a restricted
               economy and the loss of commons. Here we might think of other contemporary (re)turns
               to the commons, including Peter Linebaugh’s suggestion that we would do well to think
               of “the commons” as a verb, not a noun: “to common” (279): “[i]t might be better to
               keep the word as a verb, an activity, rather than as a noun.” Drawing on Linebaugh,
               Lauren Berlant writes in “Austerity, Precarity, Awkwardness”: <quote>It’s not “the
                  people,” but the common. Not “citizenship” or social membership or “belonging” but
                  “being with.” Not suffering or precarity, but awkwardness and a world-building
                  endurance. </quote> Berlant’s embrace of “awkwardness and a world-building
               endurance” chimes with Earle’s optimism-via-failure—a call for a deeper playing of
               the ranked game, a persistence and inclination toward other palms and other races we
               in common might yet run. Taken together, these essays offer a preliminary sketch of a
               political economy of Romantic perceptibility—whereby such formulations as “We are the
               99%” (say) become not the rallying cry of a swinish multitude nor the idiot-savant
               automatized chant of the lower ranks but the calling out of an emergent collectivity,
               uncapturable because nondenumerable by the State. This work helps us to think, both
               for the romantic period and our own, what we needs must feel.</p>
