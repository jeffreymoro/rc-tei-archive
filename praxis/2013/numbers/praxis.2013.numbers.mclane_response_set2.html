                     “Afterword: Body, Number, Rank, Measure: Romantic Reckonings”
                     
                     “Romantic Number(s) Set 2”
                     </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Each of the papers in this second "set" traverses, we might say, a calculus and a
               discourse (lyric in Savarese and Earle, population theory in Broglio). They offer
               extremely different, yet complementary, routes into the terrain of “Romantic Number(s)”;
               they also resonate with some of the concerns of the first "set" of essays. Among the
               operations we encounter here: ranking, assembling, operating, making, surveying, enclosing,
               forecasting, measuring. One notes in this work an oscillation between quantitative
               and qualitative accountings—between the uncountable “mass” in Broglio and “mere countability”
               (to quote Earle) in Earle and Savarese. Here Hegel’s reflections in the <em>Logic</em> might help clarify what is at stake: “<em>Measure</em> is a <em>relation</em>, but not relation in general, for it is the specific relation between <em>quality</em> and <em>quantity</em>” (Volume One, Book One, General Division of Being, “Being,” §128). And: “Measure
               is the qualitative quantum, in the first place as immediate—a quantum, to which a
               determinate being or a quality is attached.<a id="id_SL107n"><!--anchor--></a> Measure, where quality and quantity are in one, is thus the completion of Being”
               (“Measure,” §107).</p>
            <p>Whether the “cranial measurements” of Robert Burns’s skull (introduced as a case for
               reflection in Savarese) align with a Hegelian discourse of measure is doubtful: though
               certainly such excursions attest to the longstanding fantasy of generating “quality”
               (of mind, of genius, what have you) undialectically out of “quantity.” One finds in
               this longing for the materialization of mind—whether evidenced in phrenological or
               more current neuro-imaging technologies—a profound and in some ways disquieting continuity
               between the romantic period and our own, as Savarese makes clear. (On romanticism
               as a kind of cognitive science <em>avant la lettre</em>, see, for example, Alan Richardson. On the pleasures and dangers of the new “science”
               for literary study, see, e.g., Jonathan Kramnick, “Against Literary Darwinism,” and
               the array of responses in the Winter 2012 issue of <em>Critical Inquiry</em>; see too Saverese’s and Jager’s acute review essay on recent work in cognitive science
               and romanticism.) If faculty psychology would seem to be obsolete, contemporary theories
               of “the modular mind” (see Savarese) have re-opened the historical question of what
               precisely romantic poetry was supposed to do (as it were) for faculty psychology.
               “Being, as we first apprehend it, is something utterly abstract and characterless;
               but it is the very essence of Being to characterise itself, and its complete characterisation
               is reached in Measure,” writes Hegel. “Measure . . . may serve as a definition of
               the Absolute” (§107); measure also, in another key, manifests itself in historically
               inflected forms of techne and praxis, as these essays all demonstrate.</p>
            <p>Earle and Savarese are preoccupied by the question of poetry: for each, poetry has
               a special status in theories of mind, yet is also specifically embodied—whether in
               Savarese’s diagnostically “idiot minstrel,” Scott’s Davie Gellatley (“the cognitively
               disabled minstrel of Tully-Veolan” in <em>Waverley</em>), or in the notional poet-athlete proposed by Mina Loy and amplified in Earle’s meditation.
               Earle explores a Benthamite refunctioning of romantic lyric, that notorious mode of
               defining and communicating individuality. Like Broglio, Earle reactivates a calculating
               discourse (here Benthamite “ranking” as opposed to the “counting” of population) to
               show how romantic lyric ceaselessly “stag[es] a breakdown of the act of romantic lyric
               subjectivity,” yet also invites us “to make rehearsal of the inevitable failure of
               this pursuit a new more modest kind of aesthetic aim.” He continues: <span class="quote">‘This is not to make failure the basis of just another disciplinary norm, but to wager
                  a new more formally complex, tenuous and nonviolent mode of sustaining social normativity,
                  weave enactments of failure as such into the texture of a new Wittgensteinian or Loy-ian
                  “way of life.” ’</span> Earle’s essay takes up Ferguson’s work such that romantic lyric emerges as a peculiarly
               triumphant way of reckoning with and dissolving “calculating subjectivity”—Earle’s
               Shelley, for example, “evoking a non-calculating and incalculable subjectivity not
               as a determinate cause unto itself but as an emphatically absent cause,” opening the
               space for an unforeseen future, anticipating “the rigorously negative aesthetics of
               art.”</p>
            <p>Earle’s essay explores a poetry which renounces knowledge transmission in favor of
               perpetuating a certain formal pattern. Savarese’s Scott also explores this possibility:
               “With Davie, Scott toys with the notion of reducing lyric expressivity to the brute
               elements of memorization and counting time. He thus raises the specter of the ‘automaton
               poet’ that Coleridge had sought to exorcise.” Building on previous scholars’ reckonings
               with Davie Gellatley, Savarese takes up the figure of automata haunting Scott, Coleridge,
               and romantic philosophy and <em>poiesis</em> more broadly. Hartleian mechanism here gets its due and its come-uppance, as Savarese
               incisively explores Scott’s minstrel’s materialist yet non-mechanistic time-keeping.</p>
            <p>Both Earle and Broglio speak to the socio-political implications of numbering and
               ranking operations: one might think of Earle’s essay as a Rancièreian meditation on
               the use and abuse of hierarchy for democracy, the problem of “staging” equality first
               emergent around 1800 and still very much with us. Broglio proposes an “ordering of
               life” which resists organization into “population”: surveying not only Malthus but
               other visual and textual representations of “the swinish multitude,” Broglio explores
               how “bodies resist quantification where biopower of the body cannot be subsumed by
               population, statistics, and homogenization of the biopolitical apparatus of capture.”
               Food—people’s preferences, aversions, local foodways—becomes in his account a crucial
               “way in which that the biopower of the masses, the swinish multitude, resist quantification.”
               Broglio astutely proposes “<em>homo oeconomicus</em>,” that bane of Horkheimer and Adorno (among others), as a peculiar opportunity emergent
               in the romantic period: with Foucault’s analytic of biopower in mind, Broglio observes
               that <em>homo oeconomicus</em> is resistant to certain constructions of <em>homo legalis</em> or <em>homo juridicus</em>. He further suggests (following Foucault) that the subject of interest (as the State
               conceives <em>homo oeconomicus</em>) might escape the strictures of the subject of right (as the State previously construed
               <em>homo juridicus</em>); that the emergence of calculating, economic man (so passionately decried by Wordsworth
               and in Shelley’s <em>Defence</em>) offered in fact a moment of contingent freedom before regimens of governmentality
               were fully established and legitimized: <span class="quote">‘In other words, modes of quantification—counting bodies and counting them as citizens
                  of the State subject to its control—become the means of rhetorical and material control
                  of peoples. In contrast, <em>homo oeconomicus</em> uses qualitative differences between peoples as a way of evading quantification and
                  counting. <em>Homo oeconomicus</em> leverages a biopower—the biological capacities and resistances of bodies—as that
                  which has yet to be co-opted by the biopolitical.’</span> <em>Homo oeconomicus</em>, on this account, can exploit qualitative differences (and here we might recall Earle’s
               discourse on ranking), however much he might also be counted by the census or massified
               into population tables or mustered into armies. There are many ways of being interpellated,
               these essays point out, incommensurate modes of becoming-a-(perceivable)-subject.</p>
            <p>If Earle proposes a kind of Beckettian “Fail Better” as an optimistic slogan we might
               embrace in a universe of ranked yet, because ranked, perceivable subjects, Broglio
               tells a story—despite flashes of chances for freedom—about the growth of a restricted
               economy and the loss of commons. Here we might think of other contemporary (re)turns
               to the commons, including Peter Linebaugh’s suggestion that we would do well to think
               of “the commons” as a verb, not a noun: “to common” (279): “[i]t might be better to
               keep the word as a verb, an activity, rather than as a noun.” Drawing on Linebaugh,
               Lauren Berlant writes in “Austerity, Precarity, Awkwardness”: <span class="quote">‘It’s not “the people,” but the common. Not “citizenship” or social membership or
                  “belonging” but “being with.” Not suffering or precarity, but awkwardness and a world-building
                  endurance. ’</span> Berlant’s embrace of “awkwardness and a world-building endurance” chimes with Earle’s
               optimism-via-failure—a call for a deeper playing of the ranked game, a persistence
               and inclination toward other palms and other races we in common might yet run. Taken
               together, these essays offer a preliminary sketch of a political economy of Romantic
               perceptibility—whereby such formulations as “We are the 99%” (say) become not the
               rallying cry of a swinish multitude nor the idiot-savant automatized chant of the
               lower ranks but the calling out of an emergent collectivity, uncapturable because
               nondenumerable by the State. This work helps us to think, both for the romantic period
               and our own, what we needs must feel.</p>
