            <p>I was being a little playful with the title of this talk, but not much. “Notes and
               Queries” really is the genre, though for accuracy’s sake I should have reversed the
               order. All I want to do is to raise some questions about a very familiar poem and
               then show you some resources and lines of thought that speak to those questions. This
               research isn’t in aid of devising and defending a new reading of a particular text—in
               this case, Wordsworth’s <em>She dwelt among th’ untrodden ways</em>, second in the standard sequencing of the Lucy poems. What excites me is the way
               that this poem’s resistances to reading—obvious and much remarked—open onto analytic
               models that are not often part of our critical repertoire in general (meaning, among
               students of literature), or that are unlikely for readers of Wordsworth. Shifting,
               enlarging, refining our understanding of a single work—if that happens, it would be
               a bonus. The aim, however, is to experiment with new ways of responding to language
               patterns that are important in Wordsworth’s poetry and, by extension, other poetries
               of the modern periods, and to discover new things to do with those patterns.</p>
            <p>My research has pulled me in a few directions; the first, cited in the second half
               of my title (“Names and Numbers”), is toward formal-language theory—sometimes called
               philosophy of reference. I say <em>pulled</em> because I certainly didn’t choose that path. It’s arid and thorny and makes our formalism
               look like a walk in the park. But there it was, coming out of the process of asking
               very basic, small-scale, and un-coordinated usage questions and following leads that
               seemed promising for each question individually. I’ll retrace the trodden way, leaving
               in the false starts and dead-ends. I do that—and I want you to hear that I’m doing
               it—for two reasons. One is that the sources I’ve been looking at were new to me and
               I think they might have their own independent interest for you. Second, though some
               of these paths run at a tangent to my through-line, I haven’t ruled out their relevance.
               And I’m hoping that when I finish, you can point out things I’ve missed and maybe
               help me to integrate some of the outlying parts.</p>
            <p>Not to make a mystery, I’ve been reading in John Stuart Mill’s <em>System of Logic</em>, 1843, and in Gottlob Frege, both the <em>Foundations of Arithmetic</em> and <em>On Sense and Reference</em>, 1884 and 1892. Both philosophers describe what they take to be the logical structure
               of proper names; they also describe the logical structure of numbers. Each writer’s
               treatment of the two includes rationalist and empiricist elements; neither Mill nor
               Frege reflects on this mixture and I’m not yet able to articulate the logical necessity
               of these cross-currents. The independent interest I find in these treatises concerns
               ways to think about poetry and grammar that seem new for Romantic studies. I borrow
               the phrase <em>poetry and grammar</em> from Gertrude Stein’s lecture by that title, a work that to my complete surprise
               emerged as one of my principal aids to reflection. I turned to Stein because, strange
               as it sounds, hers was the one corpus showing clear affinities with the usages that
               interested me in Wordsworth. The eureka moment came when I happened on an article
               by Jennifer Ashton, a wonderfully clarifying commentary, which had the added attraction
               of confirming my hunch that ordinary language philosophy could speak to the language
               patterns I’d found in Wordsworth. Without Ashton’s reading of Stein, I wouldn’t have
               known how to use my own readings in reference theory to open up the poetry. So, huge
               thanks to her, and a plug for the book in which that article forms the second chapter,
               <em>From Modernism to Postmodernism: American Poetry and Theory in the Twentieth Century</em>. Let me also give credit to one of my graduate students, Rebecca Porte, who put me
               onto Ashton’s work and is now writing about twentieth-century poetry and the genre
               of thought-experiment in the period’s philosophical and scientific discourse. And
               to Anahid Nersessian, who kindled to my interest in analytic philosophy and sent me
               two wonderful articles as well as her thoughts on the topic, yet more thanks. I’m
               sure you’ve forgotten my aids to reflection by now, so here’s the list again. Mill,
               Frege, and Stein.</p>
            <p>One last preliminary. The Lucy poems have a long and illustrious critical history.
               I’ll honor just one reading in this talk, Frances Ferguson’s “Wordsworth’s Quest for
               a Poetic Object” (1973), because I see it as normative both for <em>She dwelt</em> and for the Lucy poems overall. I mean <em>normative</em> in the strict sense, i.e., a best-practice standard. Ferguson organizes the poems
               as “a quest in which the adequacy of poetic language depends precisely upon the poet’s
               renunciation of any claims to appropriate the object of his poems” (536). On this
               reading, Lucy is the ever elusive object of desire at once brought into being by writing
               and forever deferred by it (<em>do</em> hear the rhyme in <em>Lucy/elusive</em>). By tracking the paradoxes of writing and difference, Ferguson for the first time
               in the poems’ critical history explained their mixed genre: elegy and blazon, with
               “the speaker...trying to describe an object of love, when that love is compounded
               of nothing but <em>absence</em>” (540, emphasis Ferguson’s). My interest in <em>She dwelt</em> comes as an annotation to Ferguson’s reading or a burrowing into one corner of it.
               She takes on “a variety of problems about poetic representation and naming” (532-533)
               whereas I look only at number representation and at grammatically specific kinds of
               naming. The textual bridge carrying me from number to name has three planks: 1) what
               I take to be an allusion to Gray’s <em>Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard</em>; 2) the appositional structure of the first long sentence; and 3) the foregrounding
               of ordinary pronouns, so-called determiner pronouns (like <em>none</em> and <em>few</em>), and proper names.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My questions about <em>She dwelt</em> are not new but they work differently, I think, in the critical frameworks I propose.
                  First of my queries: the obvious logical contradiction lodged in the two <em>none/few</em> usages, their illogic underscored by the oxymoron of “untrodden ways.” By shifting
                  this illogic from grammatology (the domain of desire, <em>différance</em>, and discourse) to the context of analytic philosophy’s treatments of number and
                  name, we might arrive at a new place. Second, the bareness of the poem—borrowing a
                  phrase from the Emily Dickinson scholarship, its “inhuman lyricism”—is also in play
                  for me, its ontic emphasis marking a sharp difference from Wordsworth’s typically
                  epistemic focus. 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>“In the condensed phrase ‘inhuman lyricism’ I mean to recall the nineteenth century’s
                           association of birdsong with a pure expressive capacity the poet cannot own...a song
                           the poet cannot voice” (Jackson 27). See also Milne. </span></div>
                  </div> Third, I’d remark a certain resemblance to the form of the riddle, the sort of thing
                  we find in Stevens’ anecdote poems (i.e., when is a jar not a jar? or, what is round
                  upon the ground?). Or, when is a girl not a girl? When she’s Lucy. Riddle-language
                  points to itself even as it points to an object, and there’s something about how it
                  does that that seems different from garden-variety reflexivity. I won’t get to this
                  in my talk, but I’m wondering if the double-pointing of riddles might be illuminated
                  by some basics of set theory. What I have in mind is Bertrand Russell’s famous paradox,
                  which builds on set-theory’s distinction between normal sets (which do not contain
                  themselves) and abnormal ones, which do. Russell puts the question: what about the
                  set of all normal sets? Does it or does it not contain itself; in other words, is <em>it</em> abnormal or normal? The answer is both and neither. A full stop in logic as we know
                  it, and therefore an opening onto other systems.</p>
            </div>
            <p>I anchor the poem’s numbering pattern to the operators <em>zero</em> and <em>one</em>, figures that govern both its mimetic and diegetic dimensions. These numbers yield
               different poetic values and I don’t yet understand the logic of their coexistence
               in the text (that’s one of those thought-tangents I mentioned). <em>Zero</em> comes first, and I mean first in both textual prominence and in the Wordsworth scholarship,
               not the ordinal sequence. The aching last line of <em>She dwelt</em>—“and, oh! / The difference to me”—makes the case for <em>zero</em> all by itself. The exclamatory “oh” recalls the apostrophic “o” and in the same stroke,
               empties it out, collapsing apostrophic subject and object into a single figure: namely,
               “the difference.” That word thematizes the subtractive procedures that have led to
               this bare place, to this nothing that is. The leading is indirect, however —even,
               <em>mis</em>-leading—in that the central stanza stacks simile upon metaphor in what looks like
               an effort to hang onto the vanishing object, to catch it—catch <em>her</em>—in a net of names before she vanishes for good. Orpheus, calling Eurydice. In other
               words, the poem’s procedures seem additive until we hit the juxtaposition of “difference”
               (the substantive of absence), and “me.” “Me,” the dative pronoun, indirect object,
               rather than “I”—the nominative of agency—which we’ve a right to expect from the only
               first-person usage in so pure a lyric strain. I read this displacement as suggesting
               an economy of perfect subtraction, a zero sum, rather than a productive negation bringing
               forth the subject who speaks. In dramatic terms, it feels like a tragic reversal and
               recognition scene rolled into one. We suddenly feel not only how the loss and the
               beloved have been linked from the start but how utterly figuration has failed. The
               word is <em>not</em> “elegy to what it signifies” (Hass); the loss in this poem carries language, carries
               speaking, carries figuration along with it.</p>
            <p>We get to two places by thinking <em>zero</em> rather than loss, renunciation, or <em>différance</em> as the poem’s focalizer. I’ll say what they are (in the spirit, again, of presenting
               options), but because they only extend existing readings of the poem rather than move
               us in a different direction, I’ll be brief. One line of thought triggered by <em>zero</em> opens onto ontology via German idealism, and from there through Heidegger and ultimately
               to Badiou. Listen to this sound bite from Lorenz Oken’s <em>Elements of Physiophilosophy</em>, 1847: “The zero is an eternal act; numbers are repetitions of this eternal act,
               or its halting points, like steps in progression” (13). (And by the way, the reason
               this sounds so much like Coleridge is that Oken borrowed as heavily from Fichte as
               Coleridge did. The <em>zero</em>, however, is Oken’s contribution.) “Out of nothing,” writes Oken, “it is possible
               for something to arise, for mathematics, consisting of propositions, is a something
               in relation to 0” (5). Extrapolating, he avers that “The Real and Ideal are one and
               the same, only under two kinds of form. The latter is the same under an indefinite,
               eternal, single form [zero]; but the Real is . . . under the form of quantity...and
               multiplicity [numbers]” (6-7). Badiou’s discussion of the <em>void</em> in his masterwork, <em>Being and Event</em>, carries forward this idealist tradition in ways I can’t fathom. Believe me, I’ve
               tried. The reason I’ve tried is that Badiou links the void, his figure for “being-qua-being”
               and for the sheer possibility of presentation, to the name: in his words “the pure
               utterance of the arbitrariness of a proper name” (59). The way that he structures
               the void (as both “pure multiplicity” [passim] and “the multiple of nothing”), suggests
               that he has a really interesting angle on naming and singularity. But all I can get
               from those descriptions is Badiou rejecting traditional constructs for origination
               as proceeding from either <em>plenum</em> or withdrawal, creation in both those models entailing a negativity—either fracture
               or contraction. In other words, I sympathize with Badiou’s effort to think “beyond
               essence,” as Levinas put it, which is also beyond existence as negation of essence.
               But as I said, I don’t get it.</p>
            <p>Here’s the second place <em>zero</em> can lead. Math historians see the invention of <em>zero</em> as a watershed because it enables “positional notation,” a system wherein place comes
               to stand for value. Without this (or, what is the same thing), without a symbol to
               stand for the <em>empty</em> place, numbering can’t rise from describing to discovering: or from what is called
               “hand-work,” by reference to the counting-board or abacus, to mind-work. Prior to
               <em>zero’s</em> invention, math is arithmetic, the study of quantities; math as we know it studies
               the relations <em>between</em> quantities, which are seen strictly as anchors for those relations. To see in this
               way requires that numbers be fully abstracted from the things they count. Or, to use
               our idiom, it requires seeing them as nouns—stand-alones, points, symbols in their
               own right—rather than as adjectives, describing a temporary condition of the counting-board.
               <em>Zero’s</em> emergence is proof that the shift from an adjectival to a substantive concept of
               number has occurred, for where on the counting board or anywhere else could you find
               a nothing—an empirical datum—which <em>zero</em> could modify?</p>
            <p>That’s what <em>zero</em> shows. What it <em>does</em> is allow for a process called “recursive abstraction,” a formalizing mechanism. <em>zero</em> marks the spot where a network of relations among things (say, things 1-10) gets
               formalized as a sign of those relations—the sign and its value necessarily located
               outside the network that it represents. At that higher level and supported by that
               value-sign, another system of relations comes into being (things 10-20, for instance).
               And so on and so forth (Kaplan, 9, 16, 22, 36, 76, 90, 115). Although this maps generally
               onto our schemas for meta-narrative, meta-poetics, and reflexivity in general, we
               might learn something by exploring the similarities and differences between our own
               critical constructs on the one hand, and the boot-strapping, formalizing processes
               by which math rises from the study of quantities to the study of relations. But I
               want to get to the other and, to me, more interesting figure organizing <em>She dwelt</em>—the number <em>one</em>.</p>
            <p>To get a leg up on its workings in this poem, I’ll recap the classic scene of instruction
               in Wordsworth, using <em>Nutting</em> as my example (and it may be germane that <em>Nutting</em> dates from the same compositional place and time as <em>She dwelt</em>, written in Goslar, 1798; in other words, one could imagine Wordsworth conducting
               two different experiments with the singular). Here’s <em>Nutting</em>: “It seems a day, / (I speak of one from many singled out).” So opens the poem’s
               mock-epic struggle over signification: <em>agon</em> between being and meaning, process and event, the <em>One</em> as <em>plenum</em> and the numerical <em>one</em>—“from many singled out.” The poem stages the fertile but fatal attraction of the
               singular as the violence and narcissism of desire, troped as sexual aggression and
               moralized through the closing admonition to the maiden. By “violence and narcissism,”
               I mean the deep-structure drive of the poem toward a fusion of ego and object into
               a single speaking, a <em>one</em> of poetic power to take the place of an original wholeness, abandoned or back-projected
               in the interest of achieving freedom and mastery. Wordsworth’s characteristic recoil
               from that hypostatized <em>one</em> and his repertoire of strategies for remedial follow-up are by now staples of the
               criticism.</p>
            <p>I see a different kind of <em>one</em> surfacing in <em>She dwelt</em>, and it does so on the back of Gray’s <em>Elegy</em>. The poems are linked through their flower tropes—conventional in Gray, intentional,
               I believe, in Wordsworth. Here’s Gray’s metaphor for the class or type of the rustic
               beauty: “Full many a flower . . . born to blush unseen, / And waste its sweetness
               on the desert air.” In <em>She dwelt</em>, those many flowers fine down to <span class="underline"><em>a</em></span> flower particularized (“hopelessly over-particularized,” writes Ferguson [541]) not
               just by name but circumstantially: “A Violet by a mossy Stone / Half-hidden from the
               Eye!” For me, that excess of detail calls up the <em>Elegy</em>—a mossy head-stone, perhaps, in a country church-yard, marking the grave of one Lucy
               . . . <em>Gray</em>? Read against the high-cultural inter-text of Gray’s <em>Elegy</em> rather than through the ballad tradition, where it’s usually situated, <em>She dwelt</em> starts looking like a companion piece to the <em>Elegy’s</em> closing epitaph: that one, for a melancholy youth, “<em>to Fortune and to Fame unknown</em>”—Wordsworth’s, for one of Gray’s flower girls. That her sweetness be not entirely
               wasted, he confers “the passing tribute of a sigh”: to wit, “and, oh! / The difference
               to me.”</p>
            <p>The <em>Elegy </em>doesn’t just deploy general ideas and categorical kinds; it raises reference—naming
               and numbering—to a thematic level. One thinks first of the famous conversions of proper
               names into natural-kind names (“some” Milton, Cromwell, village Hampden), but once
               you start down this path, the workings of the nominative jump out at you: collective
               nouns, general nouns, concept names, count- and non-count nouns, definite/indefinite
               /and quantifier pronouns, emblems, personifications, determiners, and deictics—a veritable
               riot of naming. Moreover, as if to do in a dramatic register what happens in the philosophical,
               line 93 launches the <em>Elegy’s</em> notorious narrational pile-up, wherein pronouns cut loose from their antecedents,
               taking on an autonomy that multiplies reference rather than anchoring it. I’m referring
               to the cast of characters who suddenly start drifting in and out of each other’s frames
               of reference: rustic moralist, hoary-headed swain, melancholy poet, “thou” who “canst
               read,” unmarked over-voice, etc.</p>
            <p>Putting Wordsworth alongside Gray’s quintessential mid-century elegy highlights the
               singularizing agenda of <em>She dwelt</em> and its late-century shift from types to individuals. The shift is from exemplarity—understood
               as the rationally derived <em>one</em>—to singularity, which we <em>could</em> call a numerical <em>one</em> but only under a concept of number that is non-additive and in that respect (maybe
               others too) analogous to the proper name. Both belong to the grammatical category
               of non-count nouns. This is what I’ll try to get at below: the structure of a singularity
               to which Johnson’s famous jibe about the Metaphysical poets—that they “number the
               streaks of the tulip”—would not apply. Also, and in light of the fact that the name,
               <em>Lucy</em>, is itself a “neo-Arcadian commonplace, an eighteenth-century elegiac fixture” (as
               I only recently learned; Hartman 141), I think you could make an even stronger claim:
               namely, that the Lucy poems intend this shift from exemplarity to singularity as part
               of their operating program. One might even suggest that this agenda is our best rationale
               for grouping them.</p>
            <p>Another effect of the Gray resonance is to highlight the difference between the singularizing
               action of <em>She dwelt</em> and what happens in <em>Nutting</em>, the spots of time, and other defining Wordsworthian moments. Desire powers those
               struggles between the mind of man and nature, ensuring reciprocal individuation of
               subject and object by poem’s or passage’s end. <em>She dwelt</em>, its erotic dynamics tempered by elegy, suspends that shaping spirit. And, while
               it brings forth a <em>one</em> remaindered by the labor of <em>ascesis</em> (this, on the standard view of the poem), the allusion to Gray suggests a <em>one</em> arising from a trio of naming functions: namely, apposition, pronominal substitution,
               and the proper name.</p>
            <p>Roger Slakey, in an excellent essay from 1972, unpacks the logic of apposition both
               in general and in <em>She dwelt</em>: “Grammatically, the first two lines are a proposition, a simple statement of fact;
               the next six are three parallel phrases, in apposition with the subject ‘She’” (631).
               With predication, Slakey writes, “We seem . . . to have a large frame of reference,
               other possible attributions, and to have chosen this or that through some mental process”
               (631). With appositives, however, we seem to have so “fixed our attention upon the
               object that it has unfolded itself to us and suggested the attribution itself” (631).
               You can see how great a solution apposition might be to what is always for Wordsworth
               the problematically purposeful action of singling out. But I think the appositives
               do even more than that.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Slakey quotes a grammarian, J. E. Conner: “‘in an appositive construction, the two
                  apposed elements are [not additive but] identical in the sense that one is a substitute
                  for the other’” (631). 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Slakey includes “fair” in the list of appositives: “‘Fair’ is adjectival in form,
                           yet it has the same function as the words “Maid’ and ‘violet.’ It is an appositive,
                           not a modifier, of “She’” (634). </span></div>
                  </div> I agree that the elements are not additive, but substitution doesn’t seem right either,
                  or not for this poem. That’s because substitution seems to privilege one name or phrase—conventionally
                  the first—over the others which stand in for it. <em>She dwelt</em> shows no such hierarchy. At the same time, however, the “halved” violet and the star’s
                  solitude are skewed analogs, not interchangeable epithets. (Logically, it should have
                  been either half a star, the other half obscured by cloud or some such thing; or,
                  a lone violet.) So, if it’s not 1-<span style="font-weight:bold">plus-</span>1 (violet+star etc), and not 1-<span style="font-weight:bold">or</span>-1 (either/or, that is), then maybe Wordsworth’s appositives code for 1-<span style="font-weight:bold">and</span>-1. <em>She</em> and <em>maid</em> and <em>violet</em> and <em>star</em> and <em>Lucy</em>. If that’s how it works, then we have to press on for the kind of identity obtaining
                  among items in an appositive construction. Simply put, what does <em>and</em> mean if it doesn’t mean <em>plus</em>?</p>
            </div>
            <p>The easiest answer is that the elements are identical in the sense that a pronoun
               is identical to the noun it references. I think that’s unlikely, though, not just
               due to the slippage between half a violet and solitary star, but because the in-your-face
               self-contradictory usage of quantifier pronouns in <em>She dwelt</em> (none <span style="font-weight:bold">and</span> few; <span style="font-weight:bold">un</span>-known/<span style="font-weight:bold">few</span> could know) complicates what should be a direct mapping of pronoun onto noun. Could
               we say then that both pronouns and appositives have the same kind of identity with
               their object (and the same relation to each other) that we get between two proper
               names for the same referent? Let’s see.</p>
            <p>The textbook example of that is Phosphorus (morning star) and Hesperus (evening star),
               different names for the planet Venus. The example isn’t as random as it sounds: “Fair
               as a star when only one / Is shining in the sky!” Readers often see this as alluding
               to Venus in her two presentations and they use it to explore what kind of object Lucy
               is. I’d like to get at what kind of <em>name</em> Lucy is: or what it is that this particular poem means (in the sense of <em>picks out</em> <span style="font-weight:bold">)</span> when it says <em>Lucy</em>. How does that relate to what’s picked out by <em>she</em>, <em>maid</em>, <em>violet</em>, and <em>star</em>? And, what light does that throw on the structure and workings of singularity in
               this poem, especially as compared to others by Wordsworth?</p>
            <p>In analytic philosophy, the Hesperus/Phosphorus example is closely linked to Frege’s
               essay <em>On Sense and Reference</em>, which defines each of those names as a “mode of presentation,” “definite description,”
               or “<em>sense</em>” of a shared referent, the planet, Venus. Each <em>sense</em> is said to <em>express</em> its object, the expression carrying descriptive value. If this were not the case,
               saying “Hesperus is Venus” would be a meaningless identity statement (like, “x is
               x”). The reason the statement is informative is of course that the terms are <span style="font-weight:bold">not</span> interchangeable. You can’t say, “I saw Hesperus this morning”; or you could, but
               you would be wrong. And the fact that you would be wrong means not just that sense
               is informative but that it’s public and shareable, not a subjective idea about which
               we might disagree. All proper names are said to have senses but they need not have
               referents: <em>Pegasus</em> is Frege’s example. In such cases, we “stipulate” a referent (e.g., let Pegasus be
               the winged horse) and this becomes the de facto meaning of that presentational mode.
               We do this—stipulate reference—so as to “anchor [reference] amidst the transitory
               currents of sense” (Ashton 82) lest it become indeterminate. And of course, those
               of us who read, write, or write about fictions do this more, and also more self-consciously
               than other people.</p>
            <p>Frege’s descriptivist account tallies with our ordinary language use. Applied to Wordsworth’s
               poem, it smoothes out the attribution difference between violet and star. The half-hidden
               violet is determined by its visual incompleteness, the star by its solitude. Frege’s
               sense/meaning dyad turns this asymmetry into a simple analogy. The flower is specified
               by its spatial partiality, the star by its temporal partiality. Both senses reference
               Lucy, setting a clear agenda for the poetic eye, namely, to half-<em>complete</em> what it half-perceives, and by that action, to realize itself as well as its object.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>And yet, that schema—so satisfying for so many Wordsworth poems—feels stylistically
                  off for <em>She dwelt</em>, whose “mysterious object” seems located in “the imageless realm of the supra-human”
                  (Ferguson 541), the realm of the Dickinson poem. (In this spirit, Slakey titles his
                  essay “At Zero,” referencing the famous last line of Dickinson’s <em>A narrow fellow in the grass</em>, i.e., “zero at the bone.”) There is that about the naming in <em>She dwelt</em> which seems better served by Mill’s theory of names, the model against which Frege
                  pushes. On Mill’s account, proper names are concrete but not connotative. “[M]erely
                  distinguishing marks, [they are] given perhaps originally for a reason, but, when
                  once given, [are] independent of it” (Stebbing 5). Thus conceived, proper names have
                  no descriptive content; their meaning, as it were, is exhausted by their referent,
                  just as the meaning of a label is simply the object to which it attaches—a case of
                  direct reference, so-called. (Russell’s notion of direct reference is so strict that
                  he limits proper names to those where the referent is present either through acquaintance
                  [personal experience] or ostention [showing, deictic]. In other words, the only two
                  bona fide proper names are <em>I</em> and <em>this</em>. Everything else is a descriptive phrase in disguise.) Anyway, that kind of directness—Mill’s
                  kind, or something like it, wherein the referent is <em>entailed</em> by the name, or intrinsic to rather than indexed by or related to it—is, I believe,
                  a common experience of this Lucy poem. And arguably the others as well; perhaps another
                  reason we call them “the Lucy poems” when there are excellent reasons—bibliographic,
                  textual, and biographical—not to.

            <p>Frege’s number theory adds another facet to the thinking of name in <em>She dwelt</em> and to the thinking of <em>one</em> or the “singling out” process peculiar to this poem and perhaps others in the sequence.
               Here again, Frege pushes against Mill, this time, however, with Frege taking the idealist
               position against Mill’s empiricism. “Each of the numbers...,” writes Mill, “denotes
               physical phenomena, and connotes a physical property of those phenomena. Two, for
               instance, denotes all pairs of things, . . . connoting what makes them pairs.... What,
               then, is that which is connoted by a name of number? Of course some property belonging
               to the agglomeration of things which we call by the name; and that property is, the
               characteristic manner in which the agglomeration is made up of, and may be separated
               into, parts” (<em>System of Logic</em> 164-165). Mill’s “characteristic manner” of composition (and thus his empiricist
               theory of number) is easily challenged. Here’s Frege: “Mill is, of course, quite right
               that two apples are physically different from three apples.... But are we to infer
               from this that their twoness or threeness is something physical?” (<em>Foundations</em> 32-33). He parries Mill by noting, “<em>one</em> pair of boots may be the same visible and tangible phenomenon as <em>two</em> boots” (33). He then tries on another theory: if not an abstraction from observed
               collections, maybe number results from the annexing of thing to thing. But how to
               define <em>thing</em> or <em>unit</em> in the first place? He ventures another hypothesis: maybe a unit is such by virtue
               of the condition of being “self-contained and incapable of dissection” (43). But is
               there really anything that’s incapable of dissection; aren’t all units in theory,
               anyway, infinitely divisible and/or overlapping? And a more cogent objection, I should
               think, is that if we didn’t already recognize what a unit is, how could we tell if
               it was isolated or undivided—as it were, a star or a violet?</p>
            <p>Frege has us where he wants us, at the weak spot in both descriptive and psychological
               number theories: his last nail in the coffin is that “none of these can serve as a
               criterion for what we express by the word ‘one’” (58); “What will not work with 0
               and 1 cannot be essential to the concept of number” (57).</p>
            <p>To get at that—the special cases of <em>zero</em> and <em>one</em>—Frege recasts the definitional exercise itself. Instead of asking what kind of thing
               number is, he asks what we mean when we use it. “When we make a statement of number,
               what is that of which we assert something?.... If I say ‘Venus has zero moons,’ there
               simply does not exist any moon or agglomeration of moons for anything to be asserted
               of; but what happens [he says] is that a property is assigned to the <em>concept</em>, ‘moon of Venus,’ namely that of including nothing under it” (59). How, though, to
               build a set with nothing in it, “<em>nothing</em>” being unavailable empirically? His answer: we perform a logical operation, a call
               for the set of all items that are not self-identical (in other words, where “<em>A does-not-equal A”</em>). Since everything is self-identical, there’s only one item in the set “<em>A does-not-equal-A</em>.” I repeat: that set contains just <em>one</em> item—and it is <em>zero</em>. In other words, we’re now in possession not just of <em>zero</em> but of <em>one</em>. We have logically constructed both those numbers. Precisely what, then, do we possess
               in the case of number? Frege answers, “number is neither spatial and physical...nor
               yet subjective, like ideas” (38). Like color, he says, number is “independent of our
               sensation, intuition and imagination, and of all construction of mental pictures out
               of memories of earlier sensations” (36). In number, we have an item that is “non-sensible
               and objective...[its] objectivity...based...only, so far as I can see, on reason”
               (38). I quote: “[A] statement of number expresses something factual independent of
               our way of regarding things...” (60). Frege notes that we can actually hear that factual
               status when instead of saying “Saturn has 4 moons,” we say, “the number of moons of
               Saturn is 4.” I think we also hear it when a little girl, asked to count her brothers
               and sisters, says, “We are seven.”</p>
            <p>“In 1,” Frege writes, “we have a proper name, which as such does not admit of a plural
               any more than ‘Frederick the Great’ or ‘the chemical element gold’ (49). “When we
               speak of ‘the number one,’ we indicate by means of the definite article a definite
               and unique object of scientific study. There are not divers number ones” (49). For
               this reason, Frege argues, it is impossible to define number as sets or collections,
               or “as units, or as 1 and 1 and 1”; for “if ‘and’ is used as in ‘Bunsen and Kirchhof,’
               then 1 and 1 and 1 is not 3 but one, just as gold and gold and gold is never anything
               but gold; the plus symbol...must, therefore, be interpreted differently from the ‘and’
               which we use in symbolizing a collection or a ‘collective idea’” (50). With “the chemical
               element gold,” Frege invites comparisons between numbers and the grammatical form
               of the non-count noun.</p>
            <p>This takes us back to my earlier question regarding “she and maid and violet and star
               and Lucy”: what does <em>and</em> mean if not <em>plus</em>? Does each <em>one</em> (noun, pronoun, proper name) reference a common object either in or outside the text—like
               cloves stuck in an orange each from a different angle? Does the language build or
               project a composite <em>one</em>—what Badiou calls “a count-as-one”—from the several instances? I think we can agree
               that the special difficulty of this poem is that it disallows both those accounts—mimetic
               and constructivist—and it also rules out the transactional semiotics which readers
               of Wordsworth have come to expect. This Lucy poem projects an absolute co-incidence
               of word and thing, not a coupling of the two brokered by convention or by a reflective
               consciousness either hovering over the text, weaving its diverse threads into whole
               cloth, or, more frequent in Wordsworth, parachuting into its narrative frame.</p>
            <p>My picture of the relation between <em>ones</em> and <em>one</em> in <em>She dwelt</em> would look something like Duchamp’s <em>Nude Descending a Staircase #2</em>, a picture that calls up and in the same stroke cancels out the analogy to film animation—cancels
               it out, because contracting the recurrent into the continuous and the many into the
               one is exactly what does <em>not</em> happen in the painting. Each riser on the staircase brings forth a new mark, a new
               name, not indexing but <em>instantiating</em> the referent “nude descending a staircase.” We do not have one continuous meaning
               dragged along from step to step, or projected back before the first step and beyond
               the last step in the series. This nude has no memory. She begins—<em>is beginning</em>, more like—<em>again and again</em>. Like the x in a mathematical expression, each image signifies the formal function
               of reference itself. (And isn’t it apt, gorgeously ironically apt, to use a nude—a
               nude <em>woman</em>—to figure a function rather than a content?) What’s crucial to see, however, is that
               even as each image—again, each x in the equation of the picture—signifies the formal
               function of reference (that’s what x’s <span style="font-weight:bold">do</span>), the value of each and every mark is utterly determined (Frege would say, <em>stipulated</em>) by its context. For instance, in <em>3x+ 1=7</em>, x can only be 2. In other words, in some nearly imponderable way, we get recurrence
               of reference <span style="font-weight:bold">and</span> baptismal naming with each mark, each step of Duchamp’s nude, each Lucy noun, pronoun,
               appositive, and name. The reference is in each case intrinsic and inalienable, entailed
               or effected by each mark, not “related” to it in some way that could change. Using
               Frege’s terms, we could say that each mark discovers a new sense of its referent:
               where “sense” is not a point of view, an experience, or an imitation, but “an intellectual
               recreation.”</p>

               <p>I take that phrase from Stein (and also, “beginning again and again” (313), from “Composition
                  as Explanation”). I get the analogy to “x in a mathematical expression”—a brilliant
                  comparison—from Ashton (<em>Modernism</em>, 87).

                  (She defines prose in terms of balance at the level of the sentence and paragraph,
                  and links it to the verb.) Not all nouns can sponsor poetry, only a noun whose meaning
                  is or has become <em>entailed</em> by its name, in the way I just described. Most nouns have gone over so wholly to their
                  generic object—have become, as Stein says “the name of anything,” as in, “any” cat,
                  dog, tree—that they have lost their possibility of being something: of being <em>this</em> cat, dog, tree. What they’ve lost is their active and inalienable attachment to their
                  bearer, and in consequence, they have lost their grammatical liveliness and delicacy.
                  Who could love such a noun—and in Stein’s view, that’s what poetry <em>is</em>, loving a name, and because one loves it, “using losing refusing and pleasing and
                  betraying and caressing” it (327).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The reason Stein likes pronouns so much is that they wear their referential function

                  see their unique value or identity in that place, every time we look at them. (In
                  this, they are not unlike the <em>zero</em> which enables positional notation.) They “acquire the logical function of the proper
                  name each time [they] appear.... The reference is concentrated in each instance of
                  the word, rendering it an autonomous, self-same entity” (Ashton, “Rose” 594, 595).</p>
            </div>
            <p>The appositives, pronouns, determiners, and proper name in <em>She dwelt</em> (and certainly also in <em>A slumber did my spirit seal</em>) do feel like entities, autonomous and selfsame. But so do the proper names in very
               different poems, such as <em>Michael</em>, <em>Simon Lee</em>, and many others. In fact, consider the striking number of poems in the corpus that
               are eponymously titled, either by Wordsworth or by scholarly convention: not just
               <em>Michael</em> and <em>Simon Lee</em>, but <em>Alice Fell</em>, <em>Louisa</em>, the <em>Matthew</em> poems, and others (along with such quasi-proper names as <em>The Solitary Reaper</em>, <em>The Ruined Cottage</em>, <em>The Old Cumberland Beggar</em>, <em>The Discharged Soldier</em>). Moreover, many of the common nouns in those poems also feel <em>entailed</em>. Think of the sheepfold, the tree stump, the cloak, the wooden dipper, the weathercock.
               You almost feel as if you could pick up that dipper or stand beside that sheepfold
               and each would speak its story. But think again. All these objects start out as <em>a</em> so-and-so, article indefinite. Only by poem’s end has the object acquired the <em>the</em>, the definite article. (Borrowing from Stein, only by the end has the poem meshed
               “character and career” [Stein, quoted in Ashton, “Rose” 584]). It is, of course, the
               narrator’s and the poem’s labor of relating the tale that ends up relating meaning
               to each noun and pronoun within it. Much of the force and all of the drama of these
               poems derives from the active encounter between an object and “an experiencing subject—any
               dog will do—to remember and identify [it]” (Ashton, “Rose” 602). “Beside the brook
               / Appears a straggling heap of unhewn stone! / And to that simple object appertains
               / A story . . . .” Wordsworth gives no clearer statement of his referential practice—his
               poetics, really. It’s all there in the verb, <em>appertains</em>.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>“I am I because my little dog knows me” is how Stein formulates “identity” in <em>The Geographical History of America, or The Relation of Human Nature to the Human
                     Mind</em> and <em>What Are Master-Pieces and Why Are There So Few of Them</em> (355, 402). And that is just how it works in <em>Michael</em>, <em>The Ruined Cottage</em>, and the others I mentioned: Michael, Margaret, the “four naked walls that star[e]
                  upon each other”—they are they, discrete entities, because a narrator remembers and
                  identifies them.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Apropos the other proper name in the poem, springs of Dove, Hartman suggests that
                           the reference is “not [to] the river which divides Derby from Stafford, but the district
                           of Dovedale, Westmorland, below Dove Crag—a region which the poet had explored during
                           his Hawkshead vacation of 1788” (136-137). He quotes from the 1850 Prelude: “That
                           streamlet whose blue current works its way / Between romantic Dovedale’s spiry rocks”
                           (Slakey 137). In a private correspondence, Tim Fulford offered the following: “What
                           I wondered about the other proper name in the poem was that Wordsworth’s phrasing
                           gestures …</span></div>
                  </div> And of course, we are we—becoming fully ourselves, becoming <em>humanized</em>—as our reading inscribes us in that dramatic recognizance.</p>
            </div>
            <p>That’s so much <em>not</em> what happens in the Lucy poems, where the name takes on the characteristics of <em>entity</em>, Stein’s opposite number to <em>identity</em>. In the Lucy poems, everything works to abstract the name from any kind of lived
               continuum, any kind of history, any scene of recognition. It’s not that those contexts,
               content, and relationships go missing, rather that they seem to get drawn up into
               the name, like the forest pools in the Robert Frost poem, that go wholly into leaf,
               into the bordering trees. Merely by saying the name—she, violet, star, Lucy—one seems
               to blossom a world.</p>
            <p>The names that we love—that we love to say over and over without getting bored—belong
               to that category; they are <em>entities</em>. For Stein, such names are “the proper object of poetry.” “Anybody knows how anybody
               calls out the name of anybody one loves” (314, 327, 329). I’ll wind this up with a
               genre thought, turning to Jonathan Culler’s discussion of lyric (he makes <em>Spring Pools</em> his example; hence my borrowing, above). Culler ties the special temporality of lyric
               to its “calling,” or as he says, its defining “call to be calling” (“Why Lyric?” 204),
               evidenced (or effected) by hyperbole and much more so by apostrophe. Quoting from
               Culler now: “Nothing need happen [in a lyric poem] because the poem itself is to be
               the happening.... The clearest example of this structure is of course the elegy” (“Apostrophe,”
               149-150). In other words, it is the lyric’s <em>eventual</em> status, its status as an event of simultaneous cancellation and conjuration, which
               makes its structures, unlike those of narrative, untranslatable. It is, I believe,
               the <em>entailment</em> of meaning in name, or noun, or word, or poem, which intuitively signals <em>lyric</em> to us. What my thoughts here may possibly add to that general or ideal(ist) model
               of lyric (against which historical poetics pushes) are angles on the nature of the
               singularity that is conjured by the form, and angles too on the structure of the fantasy
               behind that singular sense. By <em>fantasy</em>, I mean that the proper name—the <em>one</em>, the singularity—set forth by lyric unleashes a dream of individuation or determination
               without negation: a <em>something</em> that is not over against <em>nothing</em>, not over against <em>anything</em>, and not over against <em>everything</em>. A singularity that feels self-grounded, as in,” the presentation of presentation
               itself” (Badiou’s definition of “being qua being”).</p>
            <p>Obviously, it’s not that, not any of those dream things. To read in this way, to feel
               the poem as fully lyric, fully worded, self-same and autonomous, requires the kind
               of formalization I’ve been doing and describing here. I hope to hear from you whether
               and why you might agree or disagree that there are reasons to do this, or do it now,
               just as nearly thirty years ago there were reasons to do the opposite. <em>Then</em>, to wrest the word from its abstractions—to single out the poetic word—required re-inserting
               it into a lived continuum: the domain of reference, of recognition, of <em>identity</em> by Stein’s usage, as distinct from <em>entity</em>. “—But there’s a Tree, of many, one, / A single Field which I have looked upon, /
               Both of them speak of something that is gone.” Not “<em>a</em>” tree, I proposed, but “<em>the</em>” tree, Tree of Liberty, planted not in “<em>a</em>” field but in “<em>the</em>” Field, Champs du Mars, circa 1789. The “something” that is gone is, or was, the
               Revolution in its republican phase, and with it, Wordsworth’s joy in that spontaneous
               overflow of powerful feeling, upsurge of collective energy.</p>
            <p>Maybe it’s as simple as the windshield conundrum; you know how it is, how you can
               never see it, see the glass, see the <em>smudge</em> on the glass, while you’re looking through it at the road. One makes a choice. I
               want to say that in some cases, such as the Lucy poems, the glass itself invites one
               kind of viewing or it discourages the other. But I don’t say this because anyone would
               have said the same thing about the <em>Immortality Ode</em>, or <em>Tintern Abbey</em>, or the many other poems released into time by historicist methods—or, put another
               way, <em>singled out</em> by desire, discourse, and <em>différance</em>. I suppose what I’ve been about here, in this talk, is a sifting and sorting, an
               effort to get at the different kinds of things we pick out when we say or see or construct
               a <em>one</em>.</p>

                  local knowledge—as if he doesn’t need to specify it as the river Dove, because we’d
                  all already know where/what it is. Obviously, he does this a lot in poems with Lake
                  District place names—but this one isn’t very specific (unlike, say, Helvellyn)—and
                  so it tantalises; it seems almost deixical but we can’t point to it—  which Dove,
                  where? There’s one in the Lakes, another in Yorkshire, a famous one in Derbyshire
                  . . .    There are many rivers of that name in England . . . many ‘ones’ as you’d
                  put it . . .   so the name almost seems generic, but can’t quite be that either—unless
                  Lucy is also generic . . .     It’s as if it hovers between deixis and genericism. I
                  feel a little jolt of uncertainty or inadequacy as I read/hear it. How to construe?
                  as if for a flicker the springs of Dove might not be a stream but the flight of a

                  of mystery the poem wants . . . but on the other it calls naming and the knowledge
                  naming provides into doubt . . . ” I wonder if Stein’s entity/identity distinction
                  (and Ashton’s distinction between meanings entailed versus indexed or related) helps
