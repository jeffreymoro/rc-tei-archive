                     “Docile Numbers and Stubborn Bodies: Population and the Problem of Multitude”
                     </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Edmund Burke’s brief comment in <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> about the “swinish multitude” trampling on learning unleashed a swarm of cultural
               responses. In his swinish multitude comment, he makes clear the distinction implicit
               elsewhere in <em>Reflections</em>. Burke attempted to keep separate “the deferential subjects, instinctively loyal,
               and the [learned] argumentative citizens”; the later being the “tiny political nation
               needed to—could be permitted to—shoulder the daunting demands of citizenship” (Herzog
               511). However, his comments created an uproar from the underclass. This essay is concerned
               with the problem of figuring the multitude and how the multitude figures in politics
               during the Romantic period. In particular, it is worth noting how in the age of political
               economy swine and populous masses are subsumed and resist biopolitical ends.</p>
            <p>Perhaps most striking among the cultural responses are James Gillray’s 1795 illustrations:
               the apocalyptic pigs and the starving swine. In the apocalyptic pigs image <a class="link_ref" href="http://bit.ly/YpD22l"><em>Presage of the Millennium</em></a>, William Pitt rides a white Hanoverian horse and wields famine and destruction on
               a herd of pigs and politicians, the “souls of Multitude.” The textual commentary at
               the foot of the image is adapted from the Book of Revelations: <span class="quote">‘And e’er the Last days began, I looked &amp; beheld a White Horse, &amp; and his name was
                  Death, &amp; Hell followed after him... And I saw under him the Souls of the Multitude,
                  those who were destroy’d for maintaining the word of Truth, &amp; for the Testimony. (Gillray
                  <em>Presage</em>)’</span> Kissing Pitt’s backside is George, Prince of Wales, while emerging from the horse’s
               tail are horned and winged figures, the Secretary of State for War and Edmund Burke.
               Whig leader Charles Henry Fox, who holds a plea for Peace with France, is trampled
               along with various parliamentary allies and a sea of swine (Fitzwilliam).</p>
            <p>Later in the same year, Gillray illustrates the <a class="link_ref" href="http://bit.ly/115zaqr"><em>Substitutes for Bread</em></a> which calls attention to the poor harvests of 1794 and 1795 and the famine that followed.
               The laboring poor amass in the streets and outside the window of a landowner’s house.
               They hold signs including “Petitions from Starving Swine” and seem poised to rush
               upon the wealthy who inside and in luxurious attire consume roast beef, poultry, and
               gold coins in the shape of fish as their opulent “substitutes” for bread. On the wall
               of the gentleman’s house hangs a notice “Proclamation for a General Fast, in order
               to avert the impending Famine” besides which hangs a separate note of acceptable substitutes
               for bread including venison, roast beef, champaign, etc. (Gillray <em>Substitutes</em>). So, during this grain crisis, the elite turn to a range of food which signifies
               their place apart from the crowd. Pork is not on the list of items to be eaten but
               the swinish masses clearly feel eaten into as they call out to be noticed. In Gillray’s
               illustrations, the swinish multitude works as a figure for masses that cannot be contained
               nor controlled by institutional authority.</p>
            <p>Gillray joins together the human masses as “swinish multitude” with a noted characteristic
               of swine—stubbornness. As the traditional Sussex folk verse of the period says:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">And you can pook</div>
                  <div class="l">And you can shove</div>
                  <div class="l">But a Sussex pig</div>
                  <div class="l">He won't be druv.</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The final line appears on Sussex Rye pig mugs of the late 1800s. The head of the
               clay pig comes off and the mug is stood on its tail. The decanter is traditionally
               filled with beer. Around the neck of the clay pig is often embossed “He won't be druv”
               (Legge 9). So accumulates the signification of the masses—a swinish, beer drinking,
               intoxicated, stubborn multitude. The unmovable nature of pigs were used in a number
               of political forums, even prior to Burke. As Dr. Johnson notes (in Boswell’s <em>The life of Samuel Johnson</em>): “The peers have but to <em>oppose</em> a candidate, to ensure him success. It is said, the only way to make a pig go forward
               is to pull him back by the tail. These people must be treated like pigs” (cited in
               Herzog 507).</p>
            <p>One might add to the accumulation several 1790s tracts: the socialist utopics of Edmund
               Spence’s <em>Pig’s Meat</em> and Daniel Issac Eaton’s <em>Politics for the People; or A Salmagundy for Swine</em> (Gallop, Gigante 110-111). Likewise, Eaton’s <em>Hog’s Wash</em> is populated with swinish contributors such as Brother Grunter, Porkulus, A Liberty
               Pig, and The Learned Pig, among others (Herzog 513). Robert Southey’s political pig
               of 1799 is another example: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Is he [the pig] obstinate?</div>
                  <div class="l">We must not, Jacob, be deceived by words,</div>
                  <div class="l">By sophist sounds. A democratic beast</div>
                  <div class="l">He knows that his unmerciful drivers seek </div>
                  <div class="l">Their profit and not his. (“The Pig: a Colloquial Poem” qtd in Herzog 525)<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> And if Gillray can invoke the Book of Revelations for his apocalyptic pigs, then
               the other pig of the New Testament worth noting is the herd of swine into which Christ
               cast demons which had possessed a man. From the point of view of the wealthy who dine
               on lavish “Substitutes for Bread,” the swinish multitude of mankind indeed seemed
               possessed with a force beyond their comprehension. These cultural and intertextual
               references for the swinish multitude seem to multiply much like the innumerable voices,
               bodies, and demands they are meant to represent.</p>
            <p>Gillray’s <em>Substitutes for Bread</em> is occasioned by the food crisis of 1794 and 1795. In the wake of the crisis, a number
               of agricultural, governmental, and charity institutions developed a new discourse
               of population for describing the disaffected masses. The gambit for these institutions
               was that by understanding population—numbers of people, their distribution, their
               ages, and their occupations—they could create policies to control and appease the
               crowd of distressed poor and working class peoples. As Foucault notes with his term
               “biopower,” the politics of population serves as a narrow space through which the
               multitude of life is contained. The political forces manipulating biopower, forces
               Foucault terms “biopolitics,” did not spring fully formed into being. According to
               Foucault, this ability to regulate life begins in the late eighteenth century. The
               early years of creating a population from the masses saw many complex problems of
               how to manage human and animal bodies. While population provides an ordering of life,
               the “swinish multitude” serves as a figure for life in excess of population. The goal
               of this essay is to sketch some of the lines of biopolitical construction and resistance
               early in the Romantic period by beginning with Foucault’s 1976 lecture on biopower
               and then placing it in relation to a mosaic of period texts.</p>
            <p>Foucault’s March 17, 1976 lecture published in <em>Society Must be Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France 1975-1976</em> provides the touchstone for understanding biopower. Biopower is the biological which
               becomes tended and controlled by State (Foucault, <em>Society</em> 240). The political rationale and the legal and rhetorical justification for such
               control are termed biopolitics. Foucault explains “Biopolitics deals with the population,
               with the population as political problem, as a problem that is at once scientific
               and political, as a biological problem and as power's problem" (Foucault, <em>Society</em> 245). While regulating the citizens as a mass is a general concern of government
               throughout the ages, Foucault claims that the eighteenth century saw a rise in technologies
               for regulating the life of citizens. Such regulation was not the age-old negative
               modality of regulating death: the right of a State to take the life of a citizen who
               violates its laws and the right of the State to send citizens to war. This new power
               included <span class="quote">‘mechanisms with a certain number of functions that are very different from the functions
                  of disciplinary mechanisms. The mechanisms introduced by biopolitics include forecasts,
                  statistical estimates, and overall measures. . . . [they] intervene at the level at
                  which these general phenomena are determined, to intervene at the level of their generality.
                  (Foucault, <em>Society</em> 246)’</span> At the turn of the nineteenth century a number of mechanical, information, and economic
               technologies align to "maintain an average, establish a sort of homeostasis" for the
               population of bodies (Foucault, <em>Society</em> 246). The State co-opts and fosters these technologies toward a greater control of
               the population. It is not that the State has control of these technologies. Rather
               a critical number of biopolitical technologies emerge—such as cartography, surveys,
               and statistics. Under the banner of rising nationalism and under fear of the French—from
               French Revolution to Napoleon—the State corrals and co-opts these techniques, technologies,
               rhetorics, and ultimately powers.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The poor harvest and lack of grain in 1795 figures as an event and rupture that reveals
                  the way biopower began to get a hold of bodies in the British Isles. Rather than a
                  singular narrative, I’ll provide instances within this event. These instances form
                  a mosaic of power relations within Britain and a figure of resistance, what Foucault
                  calls “homo oeconomicus.” As Cary Wolfe explains: <span class="quote">‘In opposition to what Foucault calls <em>homo juridicus</em> (or <em>homo legalis</em>)—the subject of law, rights, and sovereignty—we find in this new subject, <em>homo oeconomicus</em>, “an essentially and unconditionally irreducible element against any possible government,”
                     a “zone that is definitively inaccessible to any government action,” “an atom of freedom
                     in the face of all the conditions, undertakings, legislation, and prohibitions of
                     a possible government.” “The subject of interest,” Foucault writes, thus “constantly
                     overflows the subject of right. He is therefore irreducible to the subject of right.
                     He is not absorbed by him. He overflows him, surrounds him, and is the permanent condition
                     of him functioning.” <em>Homo oeconomicus</em> thus founds a new domain of “irrational rationality” that is of a fundamentally different
                     order from sovereignty and the juridical subject. “Economic rationality,” Foucault
                     writes, “is not only surrounded by, but founded on the unknowability of, the totality
                     of the process” and <em>homo oeconomicus</em> thus says to the sovereign “you cannot because you do not know, and you do not know
                     because you cannot know.” But such a creature, of course—and for that very reason—poses
                     a threat to power. And this threat is what will in time give rise to the regime of
                     governmentality and its exercise of biopower.

                     </div> (Cary Wolf <em>Before the Law</em>)’</span> I will briefly trace this <em>homo oeconomicus</em> as a mass or stubborn bodies against the docility of manipulating numbers. In other
                  words, modes of quantification—counting bodies and counting them as citizens of the
                  State subject to its control—become the means of rhetorical and material control of
                  peoples. In contrast, <em>homo oeconomicus</em> uses qualitative differences between peoples as a way of evading quantification and
                  counting. <em>Homo oeconomicus</em> leverages a biopower—the biological capacities and resistances of bodies—as that which
                  has yet to be co-opted by the biopolitical.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Scarcity in 1795 set in motion a number of biopolitical debates as to if and how the
               government should intervene in the problem of hunger. King George’s October 1795 speech
               on the high price of goods motivated the November 3<sup>rd</sup> parliamentary debate on the laws regarding Assize of Bread and other governmental
               means of conserving grain and curbing costs. Pitt and with him Fox were cautious of
               any intervention in markets; however, they did advocate for the laboring poor who
               had been brought to a degraded state. Samuel Whitbread advanced a bill to set minimum
               wages for the poor but despite repeated attempts, the bill failed. Edmund Burke replied
               to Whitbred first in parliament then in <em>Thoughts and Details on Scarcity</em> published posthumously in 1800. The treatise is a mixture of political conservatism
               and agrarian observations; the political elements are mainly at the outset of the
               book and read like a political treatise while the agricultural details are in fragments
               at the end of the work and read something akin to a report to the Board of Agriculture.</p>
            <p>Contrary to Whitbread, Burke does not believe in setting a minimum wage but rather
               believes that the market of supply and demand should set the labor prices. More astonishingly
               and contrary to Adam Smith, Burke believes “in the case of the farmer and the labourer,
               their interests are always the same, and it is absolutely impossible that their free
               contracts can be onerous to either party” (10). While Burke doubts that workers are
               worse off in 1795 than in the past, his remedy for any low costs of labor and high
               prices for food is charity rather than government intervention. As David Collings
               explains: “The duties of public office and of private charity that Burke tries to
               separate had long since been blended in the tradition, which regarded the church or
               the state as the agent of collective charity and which therefore build an element
               of communitas into its public institutions. By attempting to strip away this element
               [the poor laws], Burke violates his cardinal principle, the maintenance of long usages”
               (88). Burke as advocate of custom becomes Burke advocate of the free market.</p>
            <p>Yet, oddly, agrarian parts of Burke’s <em>Thoughts and Details Written on Scarcity</em> are not always on the side of the market. He delineates for pages the poor quantity
               of the year’s wheat, oats, barley, beans, clover, rye, hay and grasses. He then extrapolates
               from this to the costs and quality of meat, noting “When the food of the animal is
               scarce, his flesh must be dear” (39). This is in contrast to his political claim early
               in the book that it is in the best interest of farmer and worker that “the labourer
               is well fed, and otherwise found with such necessaries of animal life, according to
               its habitudes, as may keep the body in full force, and the mind gay and cheerful”
               (10). One might combine Burke’s two observations: when the food of the human animal
               is scarce, his flesh must be dear. It is the very dearness of their flesh to which
               the multitude gives voice in pressing against hunger. Burke praises the laboring man
               as an “instrumentum vocale” or full throated voice but then seems deft to the cries
               (10).</p>
            <p>Not long after Burke’s 1795 speech, his health began to fail. Nevertheless Sir John
               Sinclair, President of the Board of Agriculture and author of <em>Statistical Account of Scotland</em>, leaned on Burke to write a chapter on wages and food for the report to the Board.
               Sinclair was rapidly compiling agricultural statistics and reports. In his July address
               to the Board of Agriculture, Sinclair announced that every county of Britain had an
               agricultural survey in print or soon to be in print. From these, “the public would
               see to what a pitch of perfection agricultural knowledge was likely to be brought,
               by the accumulation of so many valuable materials” (Annual Register 1795, 97). From
               surveys the Board hoped that methods in “improved” agriculture would spread; indeed
               “there is no duty more incumbent on a board of agriculture than that of recommending
               such measures as are most likely to provide a sufficient quantity of food for the
               people” (Annual Register 1795, 98).</p>
            <p>To press Sinclair’s case, the ailing Burke was visited in May of 1796 by the notable
               agricultural improver, Arthur Young, then Secretary of the Board. Young reported back
               that Burke would be unable to fulfill the requested chapter on wages and food: “His
               conversation was remarkably desultory, a broken mixture of agricultural observation,
               French madness, price of provisions, the death of his son, the absurdity of regulating
               labour, the mischief of our Poor-laws, and the difficulty of cottagers keeping cows”
               (Betham-Edwards xlv). Indeed, much of <em>Thoughts and Details Written on Scarcity</em> carries this same “broken mixture.” Yet the mixture is revealing. Agriculture does
               not stand on its own but is part of a larger political and labor ecology. How and
               what people eat is dependent upon a mixture of agricultural observation, “French madness,”
               prices of provisions, labor regulations, poor laws, and a cottager’s cows. Burke’s
               only fault here is not keeping these various categories from spilling out one into
               another and so too haphazardly showing the effects of one upon the other.</p>
            <p>Burke’s unwritten chapter—partly visible in <em>Thoughts and Details Written on Scarcity</em>—shows how administrative tools were deployed toward developing a biopolitics of Britain.
               Sinclair’s other administrative works serve as good examples. In accord with a number
               of agricultural treatises and surveys of the period, Sinclair created and managed
               the ambitious twenty-one volume <em>Statistical Account of Scotland</em> (1791-1799). His use of the word "statistical" was rather novel at the time and called
               for his explanation: <span class="quote">‘Many people were at first surprised at my using the words "statistical" and "statistics",
                  as it was supposed that some in our own language might have expressed the same meaning.
                  But in the course of a very extensive tour through the northern parts of Europe, which
                  I happened to take in 1786, I found that in Germany they were engaged in a species
                  of political enquiry to which they had given the name "statistics," and though I apply
                  a different meaning to that word—for by "statistical" is meant in Germany an inquiry
                  for the purposes of ascertaining the political strength of a country or questions
                  respecting matters of state—whereas the idea I annex to the term is an inquiry into
                  the state of a country, for the purpose of ascertaining the quantum of happiness enjoyed
                  by its inhabitants, and the means of its future improvement; but as I thought that
                  a new word might attract more public attention, I resolved on adopting it, and I hope
                  it is now completely naturalised and incorporated with our language. (Sinclair 20:xiii)
                  ’</span> Sinclair relied primarily on roughly 900 local parish ministers to conduct the survey
               with some help from hired agents. The survey included 160 questions covering geography,
               population, agriculture and industry. While ostensibly seeking "the quantum of happiness
               enjoyed by its inhabitants," the survey actually recorded normative behavior of the
               population and laid the groundwork by which Sinclair and others would argue for improvements.
               Furthermore, it made significant inroads in representing Scotland to the rest of Great
               Britain and through quantification categorized and normalized Scottish life.</p>
            <p>While conducting the survey, in 1793 Sinclair was instrumental in establishing The
               Board of Agriculture (officially chartered as the Board or Society for the Encouragement
               of Agriculture and Internal Improvement). With a number of individuals and local societies
               advocating improvement of agriculture and livestock, it was simply a matter of time
               before matters were centralized and nationalized in a Board of Agriculture. According
               to the biography of Sinclair by his son, Rev. John Sinclair, the idea of forming a
               national board first occurred through Sinclair's discussion of the Corn Bill in 1791
               entitled "An Address to the Landed Interest on the Corn Bill." Sinclair had "been
               deeply impressed by the fact, that while we were alleged to be dependent on foreign
               countries for food, their existed in England alone twelve millions of acres almost
               in a state of nature; and that many statesmen were looking helplessly for subsistence
               to other countries, while they overlooked the abundant capabilities of their own”
               (Rev. Sinclair 2:46). According to the biography, Prime Minister Pitt was impressed
               with this information which would prove "important to the safety and independence
               of the kingdom" (Rev. Sinclair 2:46). From his 1791 Society for the Improvement of
               British Wool to the <em>Statistical Account</em> to the Board of Agriculture, Sinclair is fundamentally interested in what Michel
               Foucault would call biopolitics.</p>
            <p>One could add the cartographic survey of the nation and the census to the list of
               biopolitical machinery. Both are underway at the turn of the century, and over the
               coming decades these inscriptions become refined instruments for representing a population.
               It is from such work that later John Snow will be able to create his famous epidemiological
               map of the cholera epidemic and trace a particular outbreak to the Broad Street water
               pump. For agriculture, maps of low laying swamps and bogs reveal places that will
               over the course of the century see drainage and “improvement” toward greater enclosure
               as well as expanded tillage. Additionally, Sinclair’s study can be placed in the lineage
               of what the seventeenth-century author William Petty termed “political arithmetic.”
               Perry is the “progenitor of quantitative study of ‘power’” who considered quantitative
               data as a means of revealing new sets of relationships at the national level. Even
               with the incomplete quantitative studies of his period he attempted to estimate the
               wealth potential of territory and compare English wealth potential against that of
               other nations (Innes 119-20). Closer to Sinclair’s own time and region, Andrew Wight
               published <em>Present State of Husbandry in Scotland</em> in 1778 and James Anderson <em>Account of the Present State of the Hebrides</em> in 1785 (Innes 147-48). More ambitious is the Scotsman George Chalmers <em>Estimate of the Comparative Strength of Great Britain, during the present and four
                  preceding reigns</em> which was “the first work successfully to pull together a picture of national wealth
               and power using chiefly central sources” (Innes 149). All of these were efforts post
               1745 to accord the productivity of Scotland with that of Great Britain as a whole
               and reveal Scotland as a significant contributor to the wealth of the nation.</p>
            <p>In cartography and the census everyone counts, which is to say every one is folded
               into quantity indifferent to difference in kind. Every <em>one</em> is interpellated as citizen within the nation and folded within a common system of
               evaluation. As Althusser lays out in “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses”:
               “<em>all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects</em>” (173). Ideology happens concretely and we are folded into it by concrete circumstances,
               by the accepted practices and rituals of a culture: “you and I are <em>always already</em> subjects, and as such constantly practice the rituals of ideological recognition,
               which guarantee for us that we are indeed concrete, individual, distinguishable and
               (naturally) irreplaceable subjects” (172). Finding oneself on a map or being counted
               as part of a population of a locale means being a subject given over to the representation
               of the map, survey, or census. As Steven Daniels explains, “Maps were not merely illustrations
               of the changing economic and political landscape of Britain; they were instruments
               of its planning, production, and regulation. They helped to coordinate Britain, in
               people’s minds as well as on the ground, as a national network of localities and regions”
               (61).</p>
            <p>The power of the census and cartography is evident in the Settlement Act and subsequent
               settlement laws. These serve as an example of biopolitics at work. The laws prevent
               moving from one parish to another without gainful employment. The settlement laws
               were passed to prevent vagrants from drawing charity from parishes of which they are
               not native; however, they also had an effect on field workers and day laborers. When
               workers were in demand, authorities overlooked the law so as to bring in more hands
               to tend to the fields and with more workers followed a lowering of wages; only when
               there was little work did the authorities prevent movement into their parish. By binding
               the laboring poor to a particular locale, by preventing freedom of movement, the law
               prevented the laborer from selling on the free market his one commodity, himself as
               labor. In <em>Wealth of Nations</em> Adam Smith takes to task this prohibition: <span class="quote">‘The obstruction which corporation laws give to the free circulation of labour is
                  common, I believe, to every part of Europe. That which is given to it by the poor
                  law is, so far as I know, peculiar to England. It consists in the difficulty which
                  a poor man finds in obtaining a settlement, or even in being allowed to exercise his
                  industry in any parish but that which he belongs. . . . The difficulty of obtaining
                  settlements obstructs even that of common labour. (107) ’</span> Parish boundaries, citizenship, and economic pricing of labor are accepted practices
               and rituals in culture. These biopolitical apparatus move from textual inscriptions
               on paper to interpellation of bodies in which the laborers are “<em>always already</em> subjects.”</p>
            <p>Thomas Malthus’s sheer quantification of bodies in his <em>Essay on the Principle of Population</em> provides an exemplary instance of quantification of bodies. Malthus’s fundamental
               formula raises great anxiety: a human population grows exponentially while agriculture
               grows arithmetically. Such a quantification of bodies in dire circumstances serves
               as a justification for the expansion of biopolitics in a range of areas including
               but not limited to enclosure, agriculture, animal husbandry, and the clearances in
               Scotland (McLane 109-111). In terms of bodies made “<em>always already</em> subjects,” throughout <em>Principle of Population</em> Malthus makes individuals responsible for their place in society. It is only by their
               industry that they contribute to the body politic. In a particularly shocking passage,
               the orphan without parents to care for him and unable to provide for himself “is,
               comparably speaking, of no value to society, as others will immediately supply its
               place” (Malthus quoted in Collings 169). Note here the use of the words “comparably”
               and “others.” Every person is placed in equal quantitative relation to the next and
               comparable to the next. Each person counts equally and must supply his or her “value”
               to society.</p>
            <p>In <em>Monstrous Society</em>, David Collings points to a curious moment in the 1803 edition of Malthus’s essay
               and not appearing in subsequent editions. Here Malthus employs the figure of the harvest
               table but with an inversion of the figure’s normal use. Traditionally, the harvest
               table—both in custom and in texts about the event—is a moment when the cornucopia
               of earth’s bounty is on display. The landowner sits with his laborers to share a feast
               from the harvest. The harvest table is employed in a number of labor class poems and
               is perhaps best known in Robert Bloomfield’s <em>Farmer’s Boy</em>: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Yet Plenty reigns, and from her boundless hoard,</div>
                  <div class="l">Though not one jelly trembles on the board,</div>
                  <div class="l">Supplies the feast with all that sense can crave;</div>
                  <div class="l">With all that made our great forefathers brave (44)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Bloomfield goes on to lament the loss of this custom as landowners sit at a separate
               table and eat “refined” rather than wholesome foods of their forefathers.</p>
            <p>Malthus employs the table differently: <span class="quote">‘A man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot get subsistence from
                  his parents on whom he has a just demand, has no claim of <em>right</em> to the smallest portion of food, and in fact, has no business to be where he is.
                  At nature’s mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone,
                  and will quickly execute her own orders, if he do not work upon the compassion of
                  some of her guests. If these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders
                  immediately appear demanding the same favor. (quoted in Collings 164)’</span> Malthus continues by explaining that “harmony” of the feast is placed off balance
               and scarcity ensues. Eventually, “The guests learn too late their error, in counteracting
               those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who,
               wishing that all her guests should have plenty, and knowing that she could not provide
               for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already
               full” (quoted in Collings 164). For Malthus, no longer is the landowner and community
               responsible for who attends the feast; instead, “the great mistress” Nature dictates
               the limit in numbers. Indeed, the table becomes about counting rather than surplus,
               excess, bounty and a joyous mass of humanity. In short Malthus inverts the festival
               of the feast. Now each individual must bring something to the table in order to gain
               admission. Taken alongside other texts laid out above, Malthus constructs a biopolitical
               individual who is responsible to the state but to whom the state bears no responsibility
               should the individual not meet a requisite productivity.</p>
            <p>A pause here is in order to consider the implications of these diverse biopolitical
               inscriptions. As already noted, these works are not always a coordinated effort. They
               may draw one from another—as, for example, Malthus in each of his progressively copious
               editions of <em>Principle of Population</em> adds more and more data taken from surveys and census reports—but the works are not
               centralized. Nor is the government the sole or even main force initiating the quantification.
               Over the nineteenth century, the government will increasingly take control of methods
               for gathering data as well as providing government imprimatur for published reports.</p>
            <p>The general drift of these works is to place all citizens within a restricted economy.
               The general, or unrestricted economy, of heterogeneous place, personhood, and food
               is narrowed. In a restricted economy all bodies within the cartographic borders of
               the state fall under the rubrics of citizenship and the census. All bodies count quantitatively.
               Later, there is room for some qualitative and quantitative differentiation—comparing
               populations from different regions or by livelihood, gender, wealth, ethnicity, etc.
               However any differentiation is subordinated to or falls “below” the categories determined
               by the matrix of quantification. Quantified sets of information determine in advance
               the status of the bodies. So, one is or is not a citizen. From there, one is from
               a region, of a particular gender, a particular trade, a particular race and religion,
               etc.. There is no room for qualitative differentiation, no space by which the matrix
               allows at the outset for a heterogeneity or general economy in which, for example,
               one is a fieldworker by day, a weaver in the evenings and a maker of homemade cheese
               to be sold at market. In other words, identity fits within a matrix of information.
               </p>
            <p>Food is a way in which that the biopower of the masses, the swinish multitude, resist
               quantification. In food fights, the masses demand a heterogeneity of eating habits
               that does not fit within prescribed homogeneity of citizenship and ideal distributions
               of food. This resistance and demand can be illustrated through the substitute for
               bread debates of which Gillray’s illustration discussed above is one example. Potatoes
               and potato bread are perhaps the most famous substitutes advocated by agriculturalists.
               Catherine Gallahger has provided an exemplary overview of the potato versus wheat
               debates in England. As for potato bread, this too is a complex subject. The ratio
               and contents of bread had undergone a variety of regulation for some time as in the
               Act for the Making of Bread, 1763, in which the size, weight, and cost of white and
               wheat breads are regulated as well as labeled. Introducing potato bread complicated
               the bread category. The wetness of potatoes varied as did the texture and cooking
               rate. </p>
            <p>Shifting to potato bread was not a simple task. “Whimsical Expenses of Economy” in
               <em>Gentlemen’s Magazine</em> of 1795 parodies the situation. The speaker tells a Mr. Urban that he has decided
               to abide by “the number of substitutes for flour which have been suggested by the
               ingenious Sir John Sinclair, president of the board of agriculture” (Cakeling 135).
               He then relates a long story of purchasing potatoes, ordering a home oven, and purchasing
               fuel for the fire followed by his wifes various trial recipes for potato bread with
               some very soggy, some burnt, others half done until “we had reduced 20lbs of potatoes
               to 2, and had made excellent starch of it, though we could not make bread. We had
               consumed half the stock of potatoes that was to serve us all winter, without getting
               a single loaf that was eatable” (137). The narrator tells Mr. Urban “Never did a poor
               man pay so dear in order to save money and it is all owing to the cry that you and
               others have set up about scarcity, that I am fairly driven out of my own house, and
               am the laughing-stock of all my neighbours” (135). While potato bread makes sense
               economically as a mode of distributing food, it meets resistance in practical application—where
               the materiality of the food items meets preparation, tastes, and digestibility.</p>
            <p>Even amid scarcity and a fifty percent increase in wheat prices during the blight
               of the 1795 harvest and 1800, laborers demanded fine wheaten bread. As E. P. Thompson
               explains “laborers accustomed to wheaten bread actually could not work—suffered from
               weakness, indigestion, or nausea—if forced to change to rougher mixtures” (191). Thompson
               uses this among other food riot examples to explain the “delicate tissue of social
               norms which regulate life” which he characterizes as the moral economy of the crowd.
               In an excellent study of shifts from fine wheat bread to coarser cereal grains, Roger
               Wells details resistance from working-class consumers and even the millers who knew
               such shifts in food stuffs would not be palatable and would go undersold—indeed at
               times even risking riots (Wells 202-03, 209). In brief, the swinish multitude could
               demand fine wheaten bread over more course and indigestible substitutes because it
               was perceived as a right or a custom which linked the citizens within the community.
               </p>
            <p>Other food resistances reveal how the restricted economy of a homogeneous diet for
               the nation runs afoul of the heterogeneity of stomachs and kitchens. Consider oats.
               They are an acceptable food in Scotland and a number of writers correlate the hardiness
               of the Scots to their eating oats. More negatively said, the oats considered for animals
               is attributed as digestible to Scots because of their more animal constitution. J.
               L and Barbara Hammond give a more comprehensive overview of the ecology and economy
               of eating oats. They explain that with a diet of bread and tea, laborers in Southern
               England had “too delicate a digestion to assimilate the courser cereals, and that
               there was, apart from climate and tradition, a very important difference between the
               labourer in the north and the labourer in the south” (Hammond 122-123). There is a
               heterogeneity in climate, geography and tradition and as the Hammonds note, there
               is also the problem of access to milk: “Now oatmeal eaten with milk is a very different
               food from oatmeal taken alone, and it is clear from a study of the budgets that if
               oatmeal was to be acclimatized in the south, it was essential to increase the consumption
               of milk. But the great difference in consumption represented not a difference of demand,
               but of supply” (Hammond 123). In brief, enclosure had fenced in (or fenced out) commons
               by which the laborer would be able to keep a cow. Large dairies in the south sent
               much of their supply to Bath and London. There are even complaints that the hogs had
               more access to milk for fattening than did the worker. So, just as eating potato breads
               is not a satisfactory equivalent to wheaten breads, eating oats is not equal for all
               laborers. People repeatedly present qualitative differences in that which is digestible.
               Theirs is a protest of culture and of the stomach—a resistance even at the most biological
               levels. </p>
            <p>But eat one must. Just as the worker’s power to sell his labor is restricted by the
               Settlement Act, enclosure restricted food production. Loss of common pasture lands
               means forfeiting a cow which would provide milk, cheese, and butter without a need
               to purchase these goods at market. As the Hammonds explain: <span class="quote">‘The loss of his cow and his produce and his common and traditional rights was rendered
                  particularly serious to the labourer by the general growth of prices. For enclosure
                  which had produced the agrarian proletariat, had raised the cost of living for him.
                  The accepted opinion that under enclosure England became immensely more productive
                  tends to obscure the truth that the agricultural labourer suffered in his character
                  of consumer, as well as in his character of producer, when the small farms and the
                  commons disappeared. (Hammond 106) ’</span> In short: the laborer must buy items. He does not possess the work of his brow nor
               the capacities for sustenance that a garden and cow supply. He cannot buy wholesale
               from a local farmer as the increasingly large farms sell only to middlemen. The laborer
               is forced onto a particular capitalist market configured in a restricted way. Roger
               Wells summarizes the dynamics of the “improved agriculture”: <span class="quote">‘heavy capital investment underpinned marked rises in agricultural productivity while
                  increased market orientation of profit-maximising farmers came to dominate most rural
                  communities economically. . . . Farmers’ demand for labour therefore became paramount
                  and the main source of agrarian labour’s exposure to free-market forces. Workers’
                  dependency on the market for employment was paralleled by their dependency on it as
                  consumers, for food, fuel, clothing and housing. (211) ’</span> Such an economy restricts what constitutes economic activity as opposed to a general
               economy by which the laborer with cow and commons supplements his livelihood.</p>
            <p>In <em>Annals of Agriculture</em> Arthur Young sympathizes with laborers who have been stripped of the commons: “The
               poor in these parishes may say, and with truth, all I know is that I had a cow and
               the Act of Parliament has taken it from me” (Young 42-43). And as with cows so too
               with a number of cottage industries which promote a self-reliance outside the restricted
               economy of labor exchanged for wages. In place of work at home, the laborer must work
               for another and make wages that can then be sold for goods at market. In sum, the
               laborer is forced into a national monetary economy.</p>
            <p>This shift from a general economy to a restricted economy is illustrated by George
               Willis’s report printed in Arthur Young’s <em>Annals of Agriculture</em>: <span class="quote">‘The cottager who commands milk, has within himself, a daily supply of a nutrition’s
                  aliment for the purpose of his family, while another who has not these advantages
                  out of his poor pittance, purchases at the village shop, <em>this black compound</em> of trash and inequity [tea], at the same time he empties his purse, he brings home
                  to his miserable wife and family, a gradual and corrosive poison. (560)’</span> The role of cows as companion species to humans is a long history even to the present.
               Willis’s report illustrates the cow as a biopolitical animal claimed by the laborer
               on one side and the Act of Parliament on the other. At work here is a question of
               who can make claim to the animal’s productivity and how such productivity is to be
               channeled within a cultural (and eventually a monetary) economy.</p>
            <p>With some brevity I will mark out two more examples of production and labor shifting
               from a general economy to a restricted economy: beer and gleaning. While John Barrell
               has commented on the political role of the ale house as depicted in the paintings
               of George Moreland, William Cobbett’s occasional hobbyhorse of beer is also worth
               noting. Cobbett decorates his entries of <em>Rural Rides</em> with a report of the size, quantity, and the quality of beer he tastes while working
               up a thirst traveling across the countryside and giving speeches. He gives report
               of the joyous company he meets in ale houses. Most distinctly, he notes when a landowner
               entertains him with beer rather than foreign wine and comments on the loss of making
               beer. Cobbett notes that with the rise in taxes for the wheat and barley, beer making
               is no longer a common cottage industry. The tax money for military barracks, he comments,
               “came out of the people’s labour; and when you hear Mr. Ellman tell the Committee
               of 1821, that forty-five years ago every main in his parish brewed his own beer, and
               that now not one man in that same parish does it. . . [you] might be able to estimate
               the effects of what has produced the barrack ” (Cobbett 161). For Cobbett, taxes redistributed
               productivity to nonworking thieves, naves, and nobles, but more to the point here,
               beer was no longer a local, inexpensive, home skill. It was a commodity bought on
               the market.</p>
            <p>Cobbett also laments the loss of gleaning where workers—often women and children—gather
               or glean wheat that was not bundled in the harvest and so claimed by the landowner.
               Cobbett comments: “I saw several wheat stubbles from 40 rods to 10 rods. I asked one
               man how much wheat he had from about 10 rods. He said more than two bushels. Here
               is bread for three weeks or more, perhaps; and a winter’s straw for the pig besides”
               (Cobbett 35). Capel Lofft—known for his patronage of Robert Bloomfield—also advocated
               gleaning as a traditional and common right. Yet as the price of grain rose during
               years of scarcity, the landowners pushed harder against the tradition and prosecuted
               gleaners for the wheat they labored to gather (Hammond 105, Archer 30). With wheat
               as with milk and beer, all labor and objects become commodities within a restricted
               economy. The prohibition against laborers and their families gleaning from their labors
               was seen to work against the biblical adage “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth
               out the corn” (Deuteronomy 25:4). As Thompson summarizes the dilemma, “The breakthrough
               of the new political economy of the free market was also the breakdown of the old
               moral economy of provision” (258).</p>
            <p>As I hope these pieces of a mosaic illustrate, bodies resist quantification where
               biopower of the body cannot be subsumed by population, statistics, and homogenization
               of the biopolitical apparatus of capture. Either workers are given wheaten bread or
               they and their stomachs will not work. Either a family has a cow and milk or they
               will not eat oats. Either beer is accessible to laborers or the alehouse becomes a
               meeting ground for political discontent. Either the workers are granted the right
               to glean wheat or their families will be hard pressed to survive the winter. The heterogeneous
               demands of bodies weigh not only by quantification but also by a massification—a mass
               in excess of capture, a mass that pushes, resists and weighs (Nancy 198). Like the
               possessed demon swine of the New Testament, the swinish multitude resist control.</p>
