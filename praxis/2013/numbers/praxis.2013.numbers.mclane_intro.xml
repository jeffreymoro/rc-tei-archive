            <head><title level="a">Romantic Number(s): A Brief Introduction</title></head>

            <byline><docAuthor>Maureen N. McLane</docAuthor>
               <affiliation>New York University</affiliation></byline>
            <p>When the MLA’s Division on the English Romantic Period called in 2011 for papers on
               Romantic Number(s), we hoped to register and promote several new lines of inquiry in
               romanticism and in the humanities more broadly. We hoped the panel discussion might
               reckon with any or all of the following: older and newer logics of “matching” and
               “counting” and “measuring” (whether statistical, geometric, or otherwise
               un/calculable); what seems to be a broader Spinozan turn (itself indebted partly to
               Gilles Deleuze and Alain Badiou), not least in emergent accounts of “life” and
               “morphology” (see—among many sources—Frances Ferguson’s, Timothy Morton’s, and
               Marjorie Levinson’s recent work); challenges to Euclidean projections of/onto spatial
               order (both in the romantic period and in recent theorization, including Bruno
               Latour’s work); the impulse to rethink such categories as “bodies,” “multitudes,”
               “subjectivity” along different axes. (Here one might invoke—in addition to Deleuze
               and Hardt and Negri—Frances Ferguson’s <emph>Pornography: The Theory</emph> as one
               index of this turn: a rethinking of Benthamite calculuses as mechanisms for making
               subjects newly perceptible, in ways not always registered by Foucauldian analysis.)
               We hoped we might register as well such diverse phenomena as the resurgent interest
               in Malthusian population problematics and the revivified inquiries into metrics,
               prosody, and what Leigh Hunt called “numerous verse.”</p>
            <p>The response to our initial CFP was in fact so overwhelming—in both quantity and
               quality—that we were moved to propose a special second session under the Romantic
               Number(s) rubric. The work in these two "sets" of essays—occasioned by and developed
               since those panels—both answers and productively complicates our initial call for
               reflections on Romantic Number(s). We would not have anticipated, for example, a turn
               to formal-language theory (as witnessed in Levinson’s essay here) nor a turn to
               phrenology (see John Savarese). Certainly many possible lines of inquiry go unpursued
               in what follows here; and sharp-eyed readers will note a lack of
               quantitatively-oriented <emph>method</emph> (if not <emph>discourse</emph>) in what
               follows. So be it. Our panelists offered remarkable presentations at the 2012 MLA and
               they have revised them into the richly textured essays presented here. We offer these
               "sets" as provocations hopefully good to think with, as registrations of some current
               thinking, and as goads for new—and perhaps radically different—work. And we thank as
               well the Divisional Committee on the English Romantic Period for their conceptual and
               institutional élan, Romantic Circles Praxis Series editor Orrin Wang for his
               intellectual camaraderie and his astute shepherding of this volume, and the anonymous
               reader of these galleries for his/her trenchant and timely comments on all essays. We
               are also grateful to Site Manager Dave Rettenmaier and his team at Romantic Circles.
               Such a venture, in its communal and fortifying exchange, has helped dispel (at least
               for this editor/commentator) whatever remains of the romantic ideology of “the one,”
               singular, scholarly isolato.</p>
