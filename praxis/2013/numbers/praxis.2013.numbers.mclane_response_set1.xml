            <p>I will take as an epigraph and perhaps an epitaph for this "set" of essays a question
               from Frege’s <title level="m">Foundations of Arithmetic</title>, courtesy of Marjorie
               Levinson: “When we make a statement of number, what is that of which we assert
               something?”</p>
            <p>Of romantic number: what is that of which our essayists have asserted something?</p>
            <p> As a preliminary reflection on this first "set" of essays, and as an algorithmic
               operation performed on our essayists’ vocabularies, I offer here <ref
                  target="#wordClouds">three word clouds</ref>, derived from each paper, followed by
               the mega- (or meta-)word cloud, the set of all sets (to invoke Wickman’s and
               Levinson’s turns to set theory, Bertrand Russell in particular): The Panel Word
               Cloud. (See <ref target="#wordClouds">Appendix</ref> for all word clouds.) As these
               word clouds suggest, Wickman, Levinson, and Brooke-Smith highlight some points of
               intersection and divergence in their consideration of romantic number.</p>
            <p>Wickman and Brooke-Smith differently explore in their papers the relations between
               literature and geometry—viz. the status of geometry as a “national language” for the
               Scots (in Wickman), or the way Wordsworth (in Brooke-Smith) offers in his “dream
               vision of the survival of poetry and geometry, as represented by the allegorical
               figures of a shell and a stone” an “allegory of remediation.” So too these papers
               offer striking excavations (archaeologies, we might say) of conceptual preconditions
               and grids—as in the way geometry offers eighteenth-century thinkers a route out of
               the “ontological confusion” produced by “[a]lgebraic innovations,” “compensating
               visually for technical failures of calculation” (in Wickman’s account), or in the
               “media-less media theory” emergent in Brooke-Smith’s Wordsworth and Babbage. Drawing
               on formal language theory, Levinson frames a discussion of “number” (in Wordsworth,
               but by implication, not only) in terms of “name,” via the philosophy of reference.
               This is a new formalism, we might say, wholly other than the new formalism with which
               many romanticists might feel well acquainted. Brooke-Smith gives us a new medialism.
               Set theory makes its appearance in Wickman’s and Levinson’s inquiries—their work
               differently inflected by a genealogy running from Spinoza to the mathematician Georg
               Cantor to Deleuze and Badiou. </p>
            <p>What is the set of romanticism and number? Of romantic numbers?</p>
            <p>The word clouds suggest some provisional answers: the set of romantic number(s)
               includes Scottish geometry; Scott’s Badiou; many kinds of equations, problems, and
               operations; great webs; proper nouns; dream patterns; Wordsworth’s world; proper
               mathematical media. Numbers invoked include Zero, One, Two, a Million. (That these
               are not the same kind of number, that these invoke extremely different frames of
               reference, Levinson makes plain.) We encounter multitudes and singularities. An
               inquiry into romantic number has brought our essayists to consider number, measure,
               name, and medium. And so, in the spirit of their ranging inquiries, I will briefly
               turn to another lesson in number, measure, name and medium: offered by that great
               postromantic cohort, The Jackson Five—whose very name suggests a numbered
               singularity: <hi rendition="#underline"><emph>The</emph></hi>
               <emph>Jackson</emph>
               <hi rendition="#underline"><emph>Five</emph></hi>. </p>
            <p>I direct you to their 1970 hit, “ABC,” viewable/audible on YouTube in several
               iterations—not least their appearance on <ref
                  target="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho7796-au8U#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho7796-au8U"
                  >Dick Clark</ref>. (Or see <ref
                  target="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9hQIrsHaS4#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9hQIrsHaS4"
                  >this</ref> for a fuzzier version of the performance, with the words helpfully
               subtitled over the video.)</p>
            <p>Consider the lyrics of the chorus: <quote><lg>
                     <l>A-B-C . . </l>
                     <l>Easy as 1-2-3</l>
                     <l>Or simple as Do-Re-Mi </l>
                     <l>A-B-C</l>
                     <l>1-2-3</l>
                     <l>Baby you and me, girl!</l>
                  </lg></quote> In “ABC,” we encounter number as series—both finite and infinite
               series: ABC pointing to the finite series of the alphabet; 1-2-3 to the infinite set
               of real numbers; Do-Re-Mi to the notionally finite tones of the octave of a diatonic
               major scale. In the 4/4 pop meter of the song, the series become functionally
               equivalent sets: A-B-C = 1-2-3 = Do-Re-Mi = YOU AND ME. Items in a series, these sets
               are nonetheless bound and accounted for by the song’s rhythm, each series grouping
               working with (albeit syncopatedly) a 4/4 pattern, and each set consisting internally
               of three phonemes: <quote>A-B-C = 1-2-3 = Do-Re-Mi = YOU AND ME</quote> These serial
               sets point, we might say, to an erotic and phonemic surplus governed by musical
               measure: Baby you and me, girl!</p>
            <p>In the Jackson Five’s “ABC” we have an infectious pedagogy of accounting—in which
               series is converted to, and comes out of, structure: out of the alphabet, the set of
               real numbers, the <emph>solfège</emph> of the octave. Each series is meant to point
               to a single set, to a conceptual unity: the alphabet, real numbers, the scale, erotic
               union. </p>
            <p>I invoke The Jackson Five’s “ABC” because their song raises and rephrases, in another
               medial key, the questions preoccupying these essays: how to get from series to
               totality? To the One? Is “romantic number” a route to new forms, new questions, new
               horizons? Or a recapitulation of old transcendentalizations?</p>
            <p>Wickman’s Galt’s geometry is a wholly other thing than Brooke-Smith’s Wordsworth’s
               phantasmatic Euclidean geometry, yet “geometry” in both papers raises the question of
               reckoning with wholes and with complexity. In Brooke-Smith’s Wordsworth, for example,
               we find poetry and mathematics proposed as two routes to totality. Are these
               geometries merely figural? Do they perform actually mathematical and philosophical
               work? As Wickman notes, “Romantic-era numbers, even statistics and simple arithmetic,
               were effectively tropological constructs. Two plus two equaled a red, red rose.”</p>
            <p>These papers invite us to reflect: is the turn to number, and to mathematics—both in
               these essays and more broadly in our discipline—a rebuke to recent modes of
               historicism, a triumph of a different kind of formalism, and/or a way of submitting
               the historical to the askesis of a much longer, perhaps species durée? And/or might
               these mathematical turns, both in the romantic period and our own, be themselves
               historicized in productive fashion? </p>
            <p>Wickman directs us through Galt’s <title level="m">Annals</title> and Badiou to the
               problem of the One—“the irreducible complexity of the world, prompting intellectuals
               to seek a new basis on which to order experience.” The collective work of these
               essays suggests to me that romanticists, like many scholars, are increasingly
               interested less in the production of knowledges than in the logic of emergent
               complexity. We see in Levinson’s and Brooke-Smith’s papers sharp meditations on
               measure and number, recurrence relations, the possible scaling up of the world. As
               Brooke-Smith writes, juxtaposing Wordsworth’s and Babbage’s projects, “Like
               Wordsworth’s dream vision, Babbage’s thought experiment contains at its center an
               image of fractal organization: the spiral of the shell-poem and the exfoliating
               algorithm of the difference engine both repeat the same pattern at different levels
               of scale and complexity.”</p>
            <p>An awareness of emergent complexity (what Brooke-Smith calls “emergent patterns of
               organization”) prompts in some thinkers (romantic-era and now) a resistance to
               totalization and even to formalization: this is one way to understand Wickman’s
               productively resistant Galt. Wickman’s essay suggests that while Scott’s prose
               fictions might be converted into (and reliant upon) equations, Galt’s fiction eludes
               such calculability and formalization: “In <title level="m">Waverley</title>, national
               culture is the effect of narrative closure, the product of a classical equation in
               which 1 + 1 = 1: Edward Waverley plus Rose—two characters—equals one estate; England
               plus Scotland—two nations—equals one Britain. Galt, however, complicates this
               equation by adding narrative elements that, in great webs of <emph>narrative</emph>
               reciprocities, never wholly resolve themselves into one.” </p>
            <p>And so we are moved in these essays from Galt’s refusal of “one” (of a premature
               totalization) to Babbage’s difference engine to Levinson’s Gertrude Stein: Stein who
               wrote in <title level="m">Tender Buttons</title>: “The difference is spreading”
               (313). And Oh, the difference engine to me!—and to you: baby you and me, girl.</p>
            <p>Wickman offers us, via Badiou, a vision of Romanticism as the great evental
               subtraction: Scott’s narrators, and by extension lyrically sublime egos, Napoleonic
               colossi, and other romantic phenomena, emerge as the fabulously achieved product of a
               subtracting and abstracting operation. “[O]ne might say that the narrator of <title
                  level="m">Waverley</title> initiates a kind of event by subtracting himself from
               the chaos of experience (and from the ‘great web’ of national and picaresque tales)
               and thus converts a welter of aleatory occurrences and character types into a legible
               ordering of history, a grand narrative of the etiology of modern Britain.” In
               Wickman’s account we get a sense of the latent radical potential in Scott’s
               historical arithmetic—“despite Scott’s reputation for ideological conservatism.” Here
               Wickman’s account of Scott aligns intriguingly with Lukács’s and with more recent
               inquiries into Scott, notably James Chandler’s and Ian Duncan’s. </p>
            <p>Wickman’s excursion into Badiou’s subtracting operations raises a number of
               questions, not least: Are subjects of history sums or remainders? </p>
            <p>Levinson might be seen to answer this question, at least for Wordsworth’s “She Dwelt
               Among The Untrodden Ways.” As she notes in her intricate reading of the poem,
               conventional readings of “She Dwelt” often note how “it brings forth a
                  <emph>one</emph> remaindered by the labor of <emph>ascesis</emph>.” Yet this
                  <emph>one</emph> is also specifically <emph>produced</emph>, in her account:
                  “<emph>one</emph> aris[es] from a trio of naming functions: namely, apposition,
               pronominal substitution, and the proper name.”</p>

            <p>After reading Levinson on <emph>one</emph> as itself perhaps a proper name, we might
               return to Wallace Stevens, with his own caressed and salvaged vocabularies, his
               ceaseless inquiry into “naming functions.” In “The Man on the Dump,” Stevens offers a
               degraded series, emptied postromantic contents: <quote><lg type="stanza">

                  </lg></quote> Following Levinson, we should take Stevens’s “One” not as a
               third-person impersonal pronoun but as a proper name—a number substantialized into a
               subject: “<emph>One</emph> grows to hate these things except on the dump.”</p>
