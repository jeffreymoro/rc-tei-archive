                     </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>One of the central questions of Romantic media studies is precisely how to conduct
               such studies in relation to a historical epoch that lacked our own concepts of medium
               and media. Many scholars have pointed out that it was not until the later nineteenth
               century that these concepts emerged in their characteristically modern forms—that
               is, medium as a technological channel of communication, and media as an abstract noun
               that denotes both a plurality of mediums and a general domain of social production
               (Elliasen and Jacobsen 65; Guillory 322; Kittler 5-6). This is not to say that Romantic
               authors failed to engage with the wider media ecology within which their works circulated—the
               ubiquitous printed word, the oral forms of balladry, conversation, sermon, and public
               lecture, the optical telegraph, the postal service, various forms of engraving and
               image making—but rather that the conceptual and rhetorical means at their disposal
               were different from our own. Kevis Goodman, for instance, has shown how debates about
               media and mediation in this period were often conducted in the georgic, the literary
               mode traditionally devoted to representations of agricultural labor and technology
               (8). What Goodman’s genealogy reveals is the conceptual breadth of early discussions
               of media. Writers in this period operated with a wide-ranging conception of “medium”
               that denoted many different states of “in-betweenness”: the natural and social environments
               through which objects and information travelled; the organs of perception by means
               of which those objects were rendered sensible to human observers; and the technological
               prostheses by which humans extended their capacity to send and receive information.
               In this earlier dispensation, the media concept did not refer exclusively, nor indeed
               primarily, to the technological channel of communication; rather, it included that
               channel within a wider network of actions, vessels, and environments that stood between
               physically distant points.</p>
            <p>My aim in this essay is to show how two very different early nineteenth-century writers,
               William Wordsworth and Charles Babbage, did media theory in the absence of a <em>technological</em> media concept. My argument hinges on the role played by mathematical analogies within
               this media-less media studies. The two examples on which I focus are the episode of
               the shell and the stone in Book Five of <em>The Prelude</em>, in which Wordsworth pairs poetry with Euclidean geometry as “the knowledge that
               endures” (436), and Chapter 2 of Babbage’s <em>Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</em>, in which he uses the mathematical structure of the difference engine as a model
               for the divine first cause. The central point that I want to make is that Wordsworth
               and Babbage use number in order to think nature and medium as discrete yet inter-connected
               objects. Indeed, we might even say that in these passages number itself mediates between
               nature and medium; number both separates and connects what were increasingly seen
               over the course of the nineteenth century as two distinct realms. We can thus read
               these passages as moments in the longer history of the articulation of the medium
               as a technological channel of communication, one that stands out and apart from that
               wider range of actions, vessels, and environments that are “in between” physically
               distant points.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As we shall see, both authors use mathematics in order to imagine an ideal medium
                  that approaches the condition of immediacy. For Wordsworth, this medium is poetry
                  (coupled with the ascesis of geometrical form); for Babbage, it is the computational
                  machinery of the difference engine.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Ashworth and Schaffer for arguments about Babbage’s use of the difference engine
                           as a means of embodying mathematical thought processes in mechanical form. While he
                           does not refer to the difference engine itself, Eduardo Ortiz supports the view that
                           Babbage sought to capture thought in mathematical form with his account of the influence
                           of Condillac and the French “ideologists” on Babbage’s work on the differential calculus.
                           For a contrary view, see Christopher Green’s argument against the view that Babbage
                           believed the difference engine to embody “authentic mental powers” (35). </span></div>
                  </div> Numerous scholars have identified an idealist bent within early nineteenth-century
                  mathematical discourse. Daniel Cohen has shown how early nineteenth-century mathematicians
                  cast mathematics as a conduit between the sacred realm of divine truth and the profane
                  world of matter (15). Mathematical notation was thus seen as a uniquely capable mediator
                  that disclosed within the natural world essential truths that emanated from sources
                  of order and design that were metaphysical or divine in nature. Alice Jenkins has
                  described the role played by Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> within early nineteenth-century liberal education as a means of teaching students
                  to reason “in an abstract realm removed from sensory perception, a process of . .
                  . anti-reification” (270). 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Jenkins also points out the curious status of Euclid’s Elements within nineteenth-century
                           pedagogy as a work considered so elegant and concise in its formulations as not to
                           require further mediation in the form of textbooks and primers for non-expert learners
                           (269).</span></div>
                  </div> In both contexts, mathematics served as an ideal language, ideal both for its parsimony
                  and elegance, and also in the sense of its resting upon metaphysical foundations that
                  exceed the material substance of nature. Drawing upon these associations, Wordsworth
                  and Babbage deploy geometry and arithmetic as aids to reflection, conceptual tools
                  that help to clarify the otherwise turbid media of poetry and industrial machinery,
                  the first dependent on the material technology of the printed book, and the second
                  associated within early nineteenth-century scientific discourse with a reductive,
                  anti-religious materialism (Secord 52).</p>
            </div>
            <p>But this process of “anti-reification” does not entail a complete de-materialization
               of the medium. Simon Jarvis has suggested that for Wordsworth, “verse itself is a
               kind of cognition, with its own resistances and difficulties” (4). In making verse
               his medium of thought, however, Wordsworth inevitably sees the world as a kind of
               poem. The “resistances and difficulties” of verse can refer both to the torqued metrics
               of the poet’s “philosophic song” (Jarvis 3) and to the inherent “bias” that accompanies
               the use of any specific medium (Innis). Babbage, too, sees the universe through the
               lens of the medium in which he models it. Selecting the difference engine as his ideal
               form, Babbage produces a computational universe that unfolds from the infinite iterations
               of a single, divine algorithm. Let it be clear, however, that my aim in highlighting
               the co-constitutive relationship between medium and nature is not one of demystification
               or debunking. My intention is not to scold Wordsworth and Babbage for their blindness
               to the productive powers of the medium, but rather to demonstrate the ways in which
               they imagine a condition of immediacy that is immanent to the natural world that poetry
               and computation mediate. Within Wordsworth and Babbage’s media-less media theory,
               immediacy consists not in standing outside of mediation, but rather in producing locally
               bounded mediations that embody general principles of order and design that operate
               at the scale of the cosmos as a whole. Immediacy consists in a felicitous and seamless
               ordering of parts and wholes, rather than a view from nowhere. I turn in the final
               section of the essay to a consideration of the implications of Bruno Latour’s actor-network
               theory for both the history and future of media studies. Latour argues that, “Euclidean
               space is itself the object of media studies,” and formulates a methodology that seeks
               to account both for the deductive rigor of mathematical thinking and for its media
               dependence (“Where is Res Extensa?”).</p>
            <p>Book Five of <em>The Prelude</em> marks a moment of transition from the author’s youthful interaction with the natural
               world to his adolescent interaction with the world of books, a transition that signals
               both a growing maturity and a newly mediated relationship to nature and knowledge.
               It is at this juncture that Wordsworth includes the dream vision of the survival of
               poetry and geometry, as represented by the allegorical figures of a shell and a stone,
               of a catastrophic flood that wipes all traces of human history from the face of the
               earth. I read this passage as an allegory of remediation, in which Wordsworth appraises
               different media in virtue of their capacities to encode, transmit, and store knowledge.
               Indeed, the frame narrative that precedes the dream is animated by Wordsworth’s fantasy
               of an as-yet-inexistent medium that would bypass the materiality and fragility of
               the printed book. “Why hath not the mind,” he asks, “Some element to stamp her image
               on / In nature somewhat nearer to her own” (435). This mind-like medium, built not
               from pulped rags, ink, and glue, but from the reified substance of thought itself,
               approaches the conditions of immateriality and immediacy and hence escapes the noise
               and distortion that are the inevitable products of all material channels of communication.
               Wordsworth’s imagined medium suggests telepathy or spiritualism, a form of disintermediation
               that joins mind with mind across historical generations.</p>
            <p>And yet Wordsworth’s vision of natural immediacy is itself encased in multiple layers
               of mediation. The narrative of the shell and the stone is a passage of reported speech,
               a tale told to the author by his friendly interlocutor. But this is merely the tip
               of the mediatory iceberg: this is an oral conversation, recorded within the medium
               of a printed book, framed by the author’s musings on the desirability of immediate
               and immaterial communication, that describes, via allusions to Cervantes, Shakespeare,
               Milton, and Descartes, the survival of a catastrophic flood by poetry and geometry
               in virtue of their instantiation within the very medium of nature itself, a shell
               and a stone. The passage embodies what Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin call the
               “double logic of remediation” (5). For Bolter and Grusin, immediacy is always the
               product of hypermediacy, or the incorporation of old media forms as the content of
               a new technology: text on digital screens, radiophonic voices on television sets,
               ballads and bards in Romantic print culture. We see this “double logic” in the multiple
               layers of mediation that wrap around Wordsworth’s allegorical vision. Wordsworth’s
               dream of immediacy is framed within, indeed, enabled by, a narrative framework that
               draws attention to its own hypermediacy.</p>
            <p>It is within this context that Wordsworth deploys the analogy between poetry and geometry
               as “the knowledge that endures.” Both mathematics and poetry serve within the passage
               as vehicles for immediacy; they serve a minimalist impulse to practice a form of mediation
               that replicates as closely as possible the ideal forms of nature itself. The counterpoint
               to this minimalist impulse is Wordsworth’s well-documented distaste for the maximalist
               outpourings of the popular press, those all-too-numerous “frantic novels, sickly and
               stupid German tragedies, and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse” that
               he scorns in the Preface to the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (599). By pairing poetry with the allegorical figure of the shell, Wordsworth identifies
               the zero degree of inscription required to encode, communicate, and store knowledge.
               The involuted curlicues of the shell’s organic form exist at the very interface between
               revelation and inscription, nature and medium. This is true both phenomenologically
               and mathematically. Theresa Kelly has noted that the mathematical structure of Wordsworth’s
               shell-poem is that of a logarithmic spiral or golden section (572). The shell-poem
               is thus fractal and infinite: its spiral pattern expresses the same formal properties
               at different levels of scale, ad infinitum. Moreover, the infinity of the shell-poem
               survives alongside the closed and perfect mathematical form of the stone-circle. The
               stone and the shell are thus twinned figures of one and infinity, indestructible unity
               and an open-ended, yet formally patterned proliferation. In their rigorous simplicity
               and minimalist design, the shell-poem and stone-circle gesture towards a means of
               encoding and storing knowledge that escapes the contingency of technological mediation
               and is instead inscribed within the ideal language of nature itself.</p>
            <p>I want to stress at this point, however, that Wordsworth is far from naïve about the
               possibility of immediate and immaterial communication. Even within the structure of
               the dream, he draws attention to the ineradicable presence of the printed book. The
               Arab horseman who warns Wordsworth’s sleeping friend of the impending flood acts as
               both mystagogue and demystifier. He presents the stone and the shell to the dreamer,
               but in the same breath he also explains that the stone and the shell are allegorical
               symbols for Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> and “something of more worth”—a book of poetry (436). The Arab horseman, or “Semi-Quixote”
               as Wordsworth dubs him, draws our attention to the peculiar two-in-one logic of allegorical
               representation. The dreamer tells Wordsworth that: “I wondered not, although I plainly
               saw / The one to be a Stone, the other a Shell, / Nor doubted once but that they both
               were books” (437). Thus Wordsworth encapsulates within the diegesis of the dream the
               “double logic” of remediation, the way in which immediacy acts as a regulative ideal
               within new media practice, yet remains inevitably out of reach—“something evermore
               about to be” (464). It is this double logic that renders the form of the allegory
               essential to Wordsworth’s media-less media theory. Allegory is a mode of representation
               that is capable of bypassing the law of the excluded middle. Under the generic conditions
               of allegory, the statement “X AND not X” is admissible. The stone and the shell are
               the pure unmediated language of nature AND they are technological artifacts created
               under the conditions of print capitalism. Indeed, we seem to experience this very
               same logic—or perhaps <em>illogic</em>—every time we sit down to read a book. The object before us is a material artifact
               composed of pulped wood, ink, and glue, or, if you’re already using the Kindle, silicon
               chips, copper logic gates, and electronic ink, AND it is a window onto a rich and
               absorbing sensory experience that transports us into a different world. Wordsworth’s
               allegory, as I say, both separates and connects nature and medium. It uses a mode
               of representation that is adequate to the “double logic” of remediation, the two-in-oneness
               of nature and medium, immediacy and hypermediacy, organic form and technological construction.</p>
            <p>Celeste Langan highlights a similar dynamic in her discussion of the relationships
               between print, orality, and the “glamour” or magic practiced by the necromancer, Michael
               Scott, in Walter Scott’s <em>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</em>. Langan points to the connection between the “audiovisual hallucination” of the reading
               experience and the “impoverishment of the senses” inherent within the technology of
               print (62). Following Friedrich Kittler, Langan insists that it is the relative sparsity
               of the visual information encoded upon the printed page, coupled at the turn of the
               nineteenth century with the newly normative practice of <em>silent</em> reading, which acts as the support for the sensory richness of the imagined “content”
               of the text (and by extension the interiority of the reading subject). In short, it
               is precisely the blankness of the orderly rows of printed marks that enables the simulated
               phantasmagoria of the reading experience. Langan’s analysis provides a clue as to
               the specific virtue of geometry within Wordsworth’s allegory of remediation. Geometry,
               of course, functions by a rigorously productive “impoverishment of the senses.” Geometrical
               reasoning—and in particular the medium of the geometrical diagram—subtracts extraneous
               detail from the visual field in order to render a schema that encodes only the most
               essential and useable (computable) features of the phenomenon. When Wordsworth places
               geometry and poetry side-by-side as his ideal media forms, he suggests a specific
               kind of relationship between the bare bones of the stone-circle and the complex, non-linear
               structure of the shell-poem. The poem may be “something of more worth,” but it nevertheless
               remains an expression of mathematical principles that are consistent across both forms.
               Just as for Langan the “glamour” of literary simulation emerges from the flat “grammar”
               of the printed text, so too for Wordsworth the rich complexities of poetic form emerge
               from—and remain ontologically consistent with—the minimal structures of Euclidean
               geometry.</p>
            <p>We can situate the passage of the shell and the stone alongside numerous examples
               from the poem of what I’d like to call Wordsworth’s “elementary media aesthetics.”
               Before I offer a brief sketch of some of these moments, I first want to unpack what
               I mean by this. The term “elements” has a genealogy as rich and complex as that of
               “medium.” Its historical usage encompasses everything from the letters of the alphabet,
               to the foundations of a scientific field, a pedagogical manual or textbook, earth,
               air, water, and fire, the contents of the periodic table. In each of these cases,
               “element” denotes something foundational, the minimal units beyond which analysis
               cannot proceed, the very building blocks from which complex systems are composed.
               And yet the term can also refer to the larger system that those units collectively
               make. One of the chief significations of “elements” is the weather systems—rain, wind,
               storms, fronts, etc.—that produce the total climate or environment in which we live.
               “Elements” refers across the boundary between micro and macro. Hence, I use the term
               “elementary media aesthetics” to signal the way in which Wordsworth’s account of mediation
               is premised upon a specific relationship between part and whole, or medium and nature.
               At the heart of Wordsworth’s elementary media aesthetics is a model of how localized
               and particular practices of mediation can embody the general patterns of organization
               that constitute the “one Surpassing Life” of the cosmos as a whole (454).</p>
            <p>In <em>The Prelude</em> Wordsworth uses the term “element” to denote each of the key terms that I have used
               in this paper: number, medium, and nature. In the dream vision, Wordsworth identifies
               the stone-circle as a figure for Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>, the founding document of geometry, the art and science of applying number to nature.
               As we have already seen, moreover, in the framing passage that precedes the dream
               vision, Wordsworth asks “Why hath not the mind / Some <em>element</em> to stamp her image on / In nature somewhat nearer to her own.” In this case, the
               term serves as a placeholder for the absent media concept; element here refers to
               the reified substance of thought, the vehicle or <em>medium</em> in which the author seeks to encode and communicate knowledge. And lastly, in the
               opening book of <em>The Prelude</em>, Wordsworth uses the term to indicate the transcendental forms of reason and imagination
               that govern the growth of the poet’s mind. The author claims special access to “general
               truths which are themselves a sort / Of <em>Elements</em> and Agents, Under-Powers, / Subordinate helpers of the living mind” (379). In this
               latter instance, “elements” refers to the monumental unity of Man and Nature, the
               forms of intuition and imagination that bind the human mind together with the foundational
               structures of the natural world.</p>
            <p>When we weave these strands together, we find that number, and in particular, geometry,
               occupies a central role within Wordsworth’s elementary media aesthetics as part of
               a foundational thread of order and pattern that is repeated at each stage of <em>The Prelude</em>’s developmental narrative. While the larger structure of Wordsworth’s poetic project
               lies outside the scope of the present essay, I would nevertheless like to offer a
               brief sketch of some of the key moments of elementary mediation in the poem. These
               passages are elementary in three senses: first, they focus on the inscription of the
               simple spatial forms that are the foundations of geometry; second, they occur in a
               state of juvenility, either within the life of an individual or the life of a race
               or civilization; and third, the message or content of the inscription is impressed
               upon the very surface of nature itself.</p>
            <p>In Book Six, Wordsworth borrows from the 1764 travel narrative, <em>An Authentic Narrative of Some Remarkable and Interesting Particulars in the life
                  of John Newton</em>, for his description of a ship-wrecked sailor who salvages a copy of Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> and whiles away his time on a desert island by drawing geometric diagrams in the
               sand. The description of the stranded sailor is presented in the context of Wordsworth’s
               account of his own mathematical study at Cambridge and his “Indian awe and wonder”
               at the pure and crystalline forms of Euclidean geometry (454). In both cases—the shipwrecked
               sailor and the awe-struck undergraduate—geometry transports us to the early stages
               of the mind’s development. The stranded sailor is thrown back into a state of nature;
               his plight places him temporarily on the same scale of civilization that Enlightenment
               anthropologists ascribed to the primitive tribes described in travel narratives such
               as Newton’s. Moreover, the young author’s sense of “Indian awe and wonder” at the
               formal ratios of Euclidean geometry evokes what Alan Bewell has called the “anthropological
               vision” at the heart of Wordsworth’s poetic project (ix). The aim of the work was
               to produce what we can now identify as a <em>fractal</em> history of the human imagination; that is, a history of the imagination as it passes
               through the same patterns of development both at the level of the individual mind
               and at the level of the human race as a whole. The undergraduate’s “Indian awe and
               wonder” replays at the level of the individual the early history of human civilization,
               the first discovery of geometric reasoning in the ancient world. Rather than occupying
               discrete ontological planes, part and whole, individual and species, past and present
               are inter-fused with one another. Geometry is thus “elementary” not only in that it
               marks the first stages of mankind’s scientific education, but also in that it is present
               as an abiding structure within the development of each individual mind. Like the spiral
               of the shell-poem, it recurs at different levels of scale.</p>
            <p>We see a similar association of geometry and the mind’s juvenility in the closing
               book of <em>The Prelude</em>, where Wordsworth describes the archaeological remains on Salisbury Plain:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">

            <p>The “lines, circles, mounts, a mystery of shapes” that Wordsworth sees embedded within
               the landscape do not, in this case, express the mathematized spatial forms of Euclidean
               geometry; rather, they mark an even earlier stirring of the rational sense of number
               and proportion within the mind of pre-literate, Iron Age tribes. The “infant science”
               of Druid astrology recalls the “Indian awe and wonder” that Wordsworth experienced
               as an undergraduate. In each case, the author describes the spatial and mathematical
               elements of human reason as they recur in different stages of history.</p>
            <p>These passages share with the allegory of the shell and the stone the minimalist impulse
               to practice a form of mediation that approaches the condition of nature. As in Plato’s
               <em>Meno</em>, the shipwrecked sailor scratches his Euclidean diagrams “with a long stick upon
               the sand” (171). He impresses abstract geometric forms into the pliant and amorphous
               stuff of nature itself. The Sarum druids arrange blocks of stone upon a flat plain
               and carve markings into the ground. Once again, the natural world is the medium upon
               which they impress the abstract forms of their “infant science.” We can place the
               sand-diagram and the Druidic stone-circle alongside the shell-poem and the Euclidean
               stone-circle as further instances of Wordsworth’s elementary media aesthetics, which
               imagine a localized, terrestrial mode of inscription that is capable of embodying
               the formal ratios and patterns that govern the cosmos as a whole. Indeed, Wordsworth
               is at pains throughout the poem to differentiate this reverential appreciation of
               geometric form from that “false secondary power” that projects man-made taxonomies
               onto the external world (398). He installs geometry alongside poetry as an essential,
               indeed, an elementary part of human knowledge, an abiding form within the unfolding
               histories of both individual and species.</p>
            <p>I want now to make an abrupt turn to Charles Babbage, mathematician, engineer, radical
               utilitarian, and hence surely one of the least Wordsworthian figures of the early
               nineteenth century. And yet in his <em>Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</em> Babbage engages with the same question of the relationship between number, medium
               and nature that Wordsworth addresses in Book 5 of <em>The Prelude</em>. Where Wordsworth seeks to ground medium in nature, however, what emerges from Babbage’s
               text is a picture of nature itself as a kind of medium, not only as suggested by the
               familiar natural theological trope of the book of nature, but in this case as modeled
               by Babbage’s groundbreaking difference engine, an early forebear of the digital computer.</p>
            <p>Babbage wrote his treatise in order to correct what he saw as the unwarranted exclusion
               of mathematics from the field of natural theology. At the heart of Babbage’s argument
               is the proposition that it is mathematically and logically possible that all of the
               vast complexity to be found in the universe could be the product of a single law implanted
               within the fabric of the cosmos by the divine first cause. This was important for
               Babbage as it would perform two related functions within debates about natural theology.
               First, it would establish mathematics as a valid source of knowledge about God’s creation.
               And second, it would obviate the need for divine interventions or miracles in order
               to explain radical ruptures within the order of nature, such as the cataclysmic flood
               that Wordsworth describes in Book Five of <em>The Prelude</em>. Instead of the result of miraculous intervention or divine tinkering, the irruption
               of difference within nature could be explained as the product of a single mathematical
               law that contained within itself nested layers of emergent complexity.</p>
            <p>And yet we can also read Babbage’s treatise as media-less media theory in the manner
               of Wordsworth’s allegory. Of course, Babbage includes none of the elaborate apparatus
               of frame narrative, reported speech, literary allusions, and allegorical tropes, but
               in the figure of the difference engine he focuses his attention on what we can now
               clearly identify as a new media technology. The elaborate thought experiment through
               which he leads his readers serves the additional purpose of isolating this new medium
               as distinct from, yet intimately connected to, the natural world; indeed, so intimately
               connected that it fosters a speculative, yet rigorous form of mathematical knowledge
               about that world.</p>
            <p>Babbage guides his readers through a series of arithmetical calculations performed
               by the difference engine. First, he prompts us to imagine the machine crunching through
               the natural numbers, from one to two to three to four to five, etc., etc., all the
               way up to 100,000,001 (<em>Bridgewater Treatise</em> 34). Of course, we do not need to clearly and distinctly imagine each step of this
               calculation. Once we recognize that the process is orderly and consistent (N + 1),
               we can leap forward in our minds to one hundred million and one. At this point, however,
               rather than following the cogs’ progress according to the same formula, Babbage instructs
               us that the machine now clicks to 100,010,002, then 100,030,003, then 100,060,004,
               then 100,100,005, etc. (N + [the triangular numbers {10,000}]). The machine now calculates
               according to what seems to be a new formula, until, after 2,761 further iterations,
               it unexpectedly leaps forward again . . . and again . . . and again (<em>Bridgewater Treatise</em> 36). In short, the machine appears to be both simple and complex, mathematically
               regular yet also productive of sudden leaps of difference that create new plateaus
               of mathematical form.</p>
            <p>Babbage assures us, however, that the machine, both as simulated within the thought
               experiment and as a physical contraption sitting in his Walworth Road workshop, calculates
               according to a single, fixed formula. Each leap in complexity is the product of a
               single algorithm that expresses nested layers of order at extended scales of iteration.
               Having established this as a mathematical and mechanical possibility, Babbage extrapolates
               this logic to the scale of the cosmos as a whole. Babbage’s argument hinges on the
               commensurability of the operational logic of the difference engine with the order
               of nature itself. He is at pains to establish what he refers to as the maximum “degree
               of generality” of the difference engine (<em>Bridgewater Treatise</em> 97). In short, the machine serves as a scalable model of the universe, a computational
               crystal ball in which the mathematical patterns that underpin all natural order can
               be glimpsed in their nascent and incomplete forms. Reasoning from medium to nature,
               Babbage arrives at the proposition that all of the complexity to be found in the universe
               could, as a matter of logical possibility, be the product of a single mathematical
               law implanted within the fabric of reality by the divine first cause.</p>
            <p>Unlike <em>The Prelude</em>, with its acute awareness of the proliferation of media forms, the <em>Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</em> focuses primarily on the difference engine, with only a brief excursus on the role
               played by the invention of printing in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth
               century. If we glance sideways, however, to Babbage’s other great work, <em>The Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</em>, we discover the relevance of Bolter and Grusin’s “double logic” to his computational
               thought experiment. <em>The Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</em> is a sprawling catalogue of the new manufacturing technologies that were transforming
               Great Britain’s economy and society in the early-nineteenth century. Among the descriptions
               of iron smelting and pin manufactories, Babbage’s catalogue registers the proliferation
               of new media technologies that was part of the industrial revolution. The work contains
               extensive descriptions of the mechanical processes of engraving, the optical telegraph,
               the postal service, the difference engine, various forms of printing, and, in the
               self-reflexive coup de grace, a lengthy description of how the very book in the reader’s
               hands came into being. It is against the background of this capacious treatment of
               new industrial technologies that we should understand Babbage’s arguments in <em>The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</em>. This account of the difference engine may be directed towards debates within natural
               theology, but it also makes the broader case for the epistemological viability of
               the new media technologies that were the product of Britain’s rapid industrialization
               (Secord 53). Babbage argues, in short, that machines can mediate the natural world
               in such a way as to reveal its foundational logic and structure.</p>
            <p>One of the most interesting features of the <em>Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</em> is the unfamiliarity of the taxonomic categories that Babbage uses to sort and sift
               the heterogeneous products of the industrial revolution. This should alert us to the
               fact that, just as the concept of “medium” was yet to assume its characteristically
               modern form, so too was the concept of “technology” in flux. The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> dates the modern use of “technology” in reference to machinery as an aggregate class
               to the middle of the nineteenth century (<em>OED Online</em>). Before this time, technology referred either to a treatise on the practical arts—that
               is, a book about what we would now identify as technology—or, in its earlier usage,
               the system of nomenclature for classifying subjects in the medieval university curriculum.
               Babbage’s treatise thus registers the fluidity of one of the key conceptual elements
               that would form the modern media concept at the end of the century.</p>
            <p>Babbage classifies mechanical processes according to the formal properties of the
               tasks they execute. He includes chapters on accumulating power, regulating power,
               the increase and diminution of velocity, extending the time of action of forces, exerting
               forces too great for human power, registering operations, and copying. After explaining
               the formal properties of each of these processes, he then proceeds to catalogue and
               describe particular instances as he encountered them on his factory tours. Thus the
               section “Of Copying” includes a startling array of manufacturing processes, including
               steel engraving, calico printing, printing from moveable types, casting in metal,
               production of bricks and tiles, glass seals, horn knife and umbrella handles, coins
               and bank notes, stamping buttons and nail heads, French cliché, tube drawing, lead
               pipes, and vermicelli pasta (<em>Economy</em> 69-113). Babbage’s criteria for classifying machines are emphatically not our own.
               Many of the items in the list are what we would now understand as media technologies,
               but at this early stage in the century, Babbage lacks the vocabularies of both “media”
               and “technology” that we would now use to separate these items from the baffling array
               of tools used for copying. We would not, I dare say, include vermicelli pasta, the
               printing press, and lead pipes within the same class of technologies.</p>
            <p>If we now turn back to the <em>The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</em>, we can see Babbage’s thought experiment as an attempt to demonstrate how the products
               of the industrial revolution could be valid sources of knowledge about the order and
               structure of the natural world. The difference engine does double duty both as a specific
               piece of machinery and as a conceptual vehicle for imagining the fundamental structure
               of the cosmos. It performs an analogous function to that of geometry within Wordsworth’s
               allegory: it distills from the morass of new media technologies their most essential
               and elementary functions. The ratio between the simplicity of the difference engine’s
               operational structure and the complexity of the computations it can perform articulates
               the promise inherent within machinery as such. It is a nice irony of history that,
               due to a combination of bureaucratic entropy and the imprecision of contemporary steel
               milling, the difference engine remained incomplete within Babbage’s life time; indeed,
               it was not until 1991 that Doron Swade and his team at the Science Museum in London
               managed to assemble a working version of the machine. The difference engine, like
               the quality of immediacy towards which it strove, remained from Babbage’s perspective,
               “something evermore about to be.”</p>
            <p>It is striking that the phenomena that Babbage seeks to explain via media-mathematical
               analogy share the same formal structure as Wordsworth’s shell-poem. Babbage deploys
               his thought experiment in order to explain natural systems that leap between stable
               states via passages of seemingly inexplicable turbulence. The angular unconformities
               of geological strata, the phase shift from caterpillar to pupa to butterfly, the passage
               from aquatic to terrestrial habitats, the formation and extinction of species (<em>Bridgewater</em> 43-4): these are all non-linear processes that express emergent patterns of organization
               within the life-span of a single natural system. Like Wordsworth’s dream vision, Babbage’s
               thought experiment contains at its center an image of fractal organization: both the
               spiral of the shell-poem and the exfoliating algorithm of the difference engine repeat
               the same pattern at different levels of scale and complexity.</p>
            <p>What to make of this formal congruence is hard to determine. In lieu of a systematic
               explanation, I simply want to point out that Wordsworth and Babbage reason in different
               directions to arrive at similar conclusions. Wordsworth reasons from nature to medium.
               He casts his ideal media forms—poetry and geometry—in the allegorical garb of the
               shell and the stone. This serves as a means for Wordsworth to imagine a form of mediation
               that avoids what he sees as the disorder and alienation of commercial print culture.
               Nature is the unity, the one and the infinite, upon which he models his ideal mediums.
               Babbage, by contrast, reasons from medium to nature; he begins in his workshop, where
               he distils and universalizes the computational principles of the difference engine,
               then extrapolates to the structure of the cosmos as a whole. Wordsworth constructs
               medium from nature; Babbage constructs nature from medium. And yet in both cases,
               medium and nature display a foundational isomorphism, a common skein of fractal order,
               which is encoded within the vanishing language of mathematics. Poetry for Wordsworth,
               and computation for Babbage, become universal mediums, capable of embodying in the
               very form of their construction—iambs and trochees, on the one hand, cogs, gears,
               and digital bits, on the other—the elementary principles of nature.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>By way of a conclusion, I want to turn to a brief account of contemporary debates
                  about media and mediation. Indeed, my interest in the question “how did Romantic-era
                  writers think and talk about technological media?” is spurred in large part by the
                  assumed relationships between nature and medium that characterize so much media discourse
                  of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. I am referring here to the model of nature
                  and medium as fundamentally distinct domains that stand over and apart from one another.
                  It is this model of dichotomous opposites that gives birth to and enables the arguments
                  both for and against technological determinism that have been central to media theory
                  throughout its history as a discipline. The late Friedrich Kittler stated the techno-determinist
                  position explicitly: media, he claimed, “determine our situation” (xxxix). Kittler’s
                  work does not lack for nuance, nor was he given to naïve generalizations about a pristine
                  and autonomous Nature that suffers at the hands of an equally monolithic Technology.
                  Nevertheless, the point that I want to make here is that this style of thought—that
                  technological media can determine our situation—rests on historically formed assumptions
                  about the relative autonomy of medium and nature. When we turn back to the Romantic
                  period, however, those assumptions are yet to be fully formed. The boundaries between
                  nature and medium are yet to be fixed. Within this more fluid arrangement, the techno-determinist
                  debate is simply moot. It is only when technological media have been separated out
                  from the raw materials from which they are composed—when, for instance, the digital
                  computer is conceived independently of the silicon chips, logic gates, electron pulses,
                  symbolic programming languages, plastic casings, legal frameworks, and learned cultural
                  behaviors that are its constituent parts—that a given medium can be said to impose
                  its logic upon society and culture. Taken instead as an array of component parts,
                  the machine is re-absorbed into the complex ecology of interacting agencies and forces
                  that traverse both nature and medium.

            <p>What we can glean from our readings of Wordsworth and Babbage, I would suggest, is
               a salutary sense of the fluidity and contingency of the relationship between “nature,”
               on the one hand, and “medium” or “technology,” on the other. Rather than casting Wordsworth
               and Babbage in the familiar guises of the nostalgic organicist and the mechanical
               reductionist, we might instead register the ways in which their media theories dispense
               with the dualistic style of thinking that is the condition of possibility for the
               argument from techno-determinism. Indeed, in their attempts to think nature and medium
               together and apart, Wordsworth and Babbage seem to presage some of the most recent
               trends within contemporary media theory. New work within the field signals the emergence
               of a new way of talking and thinking about media that departs from the problematics
               of dualism and determinism that animated the field for so long. Bruno Latour, for
               instance, uses the term “mediator” in his actor-network theory to describe any element
               within a natural or social system that transmits force and thus helps to produce organizational
               structure (<em>Reassembling the Social</em> 39). Everything, for Latour, mediates. Microbes, natural laws, documents, instruments,
               laboratories, scientific theories, scientists, even the cultural abstraction of "Science"
               itself: these are all mediators that interact with one another to form the complex
               and hybrid systems of modernity. For Latour, the concept of the “mediator” helps to
               un-pick the hoary old binaries of nature-culture, subject-object, organic-technological,
               that have for so long formed the chief coordinates on the mental map of modernity.
               Latour’s work presents us with a newly expanded conception of what it means to mediate
               and what kinds of objects can perform this ubiquitous task.</p>
            <p>Latour has recently observed that, “Euclidean space is itself the object of media
               studies” (“Where is Res Extensa?”). Within this “compositionist” philosophy of science,
               geometry remains stubbornly local (“Compositionist Manifesto”). The uniformly extended,
               quantifiable, abstract space projected by Euclidean geometry is precisely that, a
               projection. This space exists only in specific mediums: Euclid’s long-lost parchment
               diagrams, the pages of printed books, chalkboards, notepads, digital models, and,
               we might add, stone-circles, shell-poems, and difference engines. Latour insists that
               it takes work to extend Euclidean space into the world, work that is accomplished
               not only in the minds of geometers but also in the media with which they compose the
               Euclidean universe. Reviel Netz, one of the chief sources for Latour’s argument, explains
               the central function of the diagram within Greek deduction: “each geometrical proposition
               sets up its own universe—which is its diagram” (32). Hence, what we see in Wordsworth’s
               allegory and Babbage’s thought experiment is the composition of portable universes.
               Indeed, both authors derive their media theory and their cosmology at the same time.
               Medium and Nature are co-constitutive: the organic form of the shell-poem helps to
               compose the “one Surpassing Life” of the Divine mind; the mechanical structure of
               the difference engine helps to compose the mathematical sublime of the computational
               universe. Babbage states of the difference engine: “my own views respecting the extent
               of the laws of Nature were greatly extended by considering it” (33). He thus acknowledges
               the essential role played by the medium (a role repeated for the reader in the form
               of the thought experiment) as a prosthesis for thought, an instrument that enables
               him to scale up within the structure of the universe. We can thus place the shell-poem
               and the difference engine alongside the Euclidean diagram, the invention of “zero”—from
               the Sanskrit, “sunya,” which denotes not an absence of number but an empty space on
               the counting tablets used in Indian mathematics, which is to say, the <em>medium</em> itself—and ultra-modern media such as cellular automata and stochastic computer models,
               as machines for extending and compressing scale.</p>
            <p>Both Latour and Netz insist, however, that the deductive rigor of Euclidean geometry
               is not diminished by the fact of its mediation. Latour’s expansive conception of the
               “mediator” is both more and less powerful than our previous model of the technological
               channel of communication. It is more powerful in the sense media technologies become
               part of a vastly expanded “universe of things,” to quote Shelley (120), that mediate.
               The printing press and electric telegraph, or, to use Wordsworth and Babbage’s chosen
               examples, poetry and the difference engine, sit once again alongside gravity, the
               human eye, mathematics, bridges, roads, and cities—in short, “everything that intervenes,
               enables, supplements, or is simply in between” (Siskin and Warner 5). But it is also
               less powerful in the sense that the technological medium ceases to be a uniquely privileged
               mediator. In contrast to Kittler’s claim that media “determine our situation,” within
               this new model technological media become simply part of the situation; they influence
               and are in turn influenced by the teeming range of objects and forces that comprise
               the complex systems of modernity. </p>
