               <p>One of the central questions of Romantic media studies is precisely how to conduct
               such studies in relation to a historical epoch that lacked our own concepts of medium
               and media. Many scholars have pointed out that it was not until the later nineteenth
               century that these concepts emerged in their characteristically modern forms—that is,
               medium as a technological channel of communication, and media as an abstract noun
               that denotes both a plurality of mediums and a general domain of social production
               (Elliasen and Jacobsen 65; Guillory 322; Kittler 5-6). This is not to say that
               Romantic authors failed to engage with the wider media ecology within which their
               works circulated—the ubiquitous printed word, the oral forms of balladry,
               conversation, sermon, and public lecture, the optical telegraph, the postal service,
               various forms of engraving and image making—but rather that the conceptual and
               rhetorical means at their disposal were different from our own. Kevis Goodman, for
               instance, has shown how debates about media and mediation in this period were often
               conducted in the georgic, the literary mode traditionally devoted to representations
               of agricultural labor and technology (8). What Goodman’s genealogy reveals is the
               conceptual breadth of early discussions of media. Writers in this period operated
               with a wide-ranging conception of “medium” that denoted many different states of
               “in-betweenness”: the natural and social environments through which objects and
               information travelled; the organs of perception by means of which those objects were
               rendered sensible to human observers; and the technological prostheses by which
               humans extended their capacity to send and receive information. In this earlier
               dispensation, the media concept did not refer exclusively, nor indeed primarily, to
               the technological channel of communication; rather, it included that channel within a
               wider network of actions, vessels, and environments that stood between physically
               distant points.</p>
               <p>My aim in this essay is to show how two very different early nineteenth-century
               writers, William Wordsworth and Charles Babbage, did media theory in the absence of a
                  <emph>technological</emph> media concept. My argument hinges on the role played by
               mathematical analogies within this media-less media studies. The two examples on
               which I focus are the episode of the shell and the stone in Book Five of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, in which Wordsworth pairs poetry with Euclidean
               geometry as “the knowledge that endures” (436), and Chapter 2 of Babbage’s <title level="m">Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</title>, in which he uses the mathematical
               structure of the difference engine as a model for the divine first cause. The central
               point that I want to make is that Wordsworth and Babbage use number in order to think
               nature and medium as discrete yet inter-connected objects. Indeed, we might even say
               that in these passages number itself mediates between nature and medium; number both
               separates and connects what were increasingly seen over the course of the nineteenth
               century as two distinct realms. We can thus read these passages as moments in the
               longer history of the articulation of the medium as a technological channel of
               communication, one that stands out and apart from that wider range of actions,
               vessels, and environments that are “in between” physically distant points.</p>
               <p>As we shall see, both authors use mathematics in order to imagine an ideal medium
               that approaches the condition of immediacy. For Wordsworth, this medium is poetry
               (coupled with the ascesis of geometrical form); for Babbage, it is the computational
               machinery of the difference engine. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> See
                  Ashworth and Schaffer for arguments about Babbage’s use of the difference engine
                  as a means of embodying mathematical thought processes in mechanical form. While
                  he does not refer to the difference engine itself, Eduardo Ortiz supports the view
                  that Babbage sought to capture thought in mathematical form with his account of
                  the influence of Condillac and the French “ideologists” on Babbage’s work on the
                  differential calculus. For a contrary view, see Christopher Green’s argument
                  against the view that Babbage believed the difference engine to embody “authentic
                  mental powers” (35). </note> Numerous scholars have identified an idealist bent
               within early nineteenth-century mathematical discourse. Daniel Cohen has shown how
               early nineteenth-century mathematicians cast mathematics as a conduit between the
               sacred realm of divine truth and the profane world of matter (15). Mathematical
               notation was thus seen as a uniquely capable mediator that disclosed within the
               natural world essential truths that emanated from sources of order and design that
               were metaphysical or divine in nature. Alice Jenkins has described the role played by
               Euclid’s <title level="m">Elements</title> within early nineteenth-century liberal
               education as a means of teaching students to reason “in an abstract realm removed
               from sensory perception, a process of . . . anti-reification” (270). <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jenkins also points out the curious status of
                  Euclid’s <title level="m">Elements</title> within nineteenth-century pedagogy as a
                  work considered so elegant and concise in its formulations as not to require
                  further mediation in the form of textbooks and primers for non-expert learners
                  (269). </note> In both contexts, mathematics served as an ideal language, ideal
               both for its parsimony and elegance, and also in the sense of its resting upon
               metaphysical foundations that exceed the material substance of nature. Drawing upon
               these associations, Wordsworth and Babbage deploy geometry and arithmetic as aids to
               reflection, conceptual tools that help to clarify the otherwise turbid media of
               poetry and industrial machinery, the first dependent on the material technology of
               the printed book, and the second associated within early nineteenth-century
               scientific discourse with a reductive, anti-religious materialism (Secord 52).</p>
               <p>But this process of “anti-reification” does not entail a complete de-materialization
               of the medium. Simon Jarvis has suggested that for Wordsworth, “verse itself is a
               kind of cognition, with its own resistances and difficulties” (4). In making verse
               his medium of thought, however, Wordsworth inevitably sees the world as a kind of
               poem. The “resistances and difficulties” of verse can refer both to the torqued
               metrics of the poet’s “philosophic song” (Jarvis 3) and to the inherent “bias” that
               accompanies the use of any specific medium (Innis). Babbage, too, sees the universe
               through the lens of the medium in which he models it. Selecting the difference engine
               as his ideal form, Babbage produces a computational universe that unfolds from the
               infinite iterations of a single, divine algorithm. Let it be clear, however, that my
               aim in highlighting the co-constitutive relationship between medium and nature is not
               one of demystification or debunking. My intention is not to scold Wordsworth and
               Babbage for their blindness to the productive powers of the medium, but rather to
               demonstrate the ways in which they imagine a condition of immediacy that is immanent
               to the natural world that poetry and computation mediate. Within Wordsworth and
               Babbage’s media-less media theory, immediacy consists not in standing outside of
               mediation, but rather in producing locally bounded mediations that embody general
               principles of order and design that operate at the scale of the cosmos as a whole.
               Immediacy consists in a felicitous and seamless ordering of parts and wholes, rather
               than a view from nowhere. I turn in the final section of the essay to a consideration
               of the implications of Bruno Latour’s actor-network theory for both the history and
               future of media studies. Latour argues that, “Euclidean space is itself the object of
               media studies,” and formulates a methodology that seeks to account both for the
               deductive rigor of mathematical thinking and for its media dependence (“Where is Res
               Extensa?”).</p>
               <p>Book Five of <title level="m">The Prelude</title> marks a moment of transition from
               the author’s youthful interaction with the natural world to his adolescent
               interaction with the world of books, a transition that signals both a growing
               maturity and a newly mediated relationship to nature and knowledge. It is at this
               juncture that Wordsworth includes the dream vision of the survival of poetry and
               geometry, as represented by the allegorical figures of a shell and a stone, of a
               catastrophic flood that wipes all traces of human history from the face of the earth.
               I read this passage as an allegory of remediation, in which Wordsworth appraises
               different media in virtue of their capacities to encode, transmit, and store
               knowledge. Indeed, the frame narrative that precedes the dream is animated by
               Wordsworth’s fantasy of an as-yet-inexistent medium that would bypass the materiality
               and fragility of the printed book. “Why hath not the mind,” he asks, “Some element to
               stamp her image on / In nature somewhat nearer to her own” (435). This mind-like
               medium, built not from pulped rags, ink, and glue, but from the reified substance of
               thought itself, approaches the conditions of immateriality and immediacy and hence
               escapes the noise and distortion that are the inevitable products of all material
               channels of communication. Wordsworth’s imagined medium suggests telepathy or
               spiritualism, a form of disintermediation that joins mind with mind across historical
               generations.</p>
               <p>And yet Wordsworth’s vision of natural immediacy is itself encased in multiple layers
               of mediation. The narrative of the shell and the stone is a passage of reported
               speech, a tale told to the author by his friendly interlocutor. But this is merely
               the tip of the mediatory iceberg: this is an oral conversation, recorded within the
               medium of a printed book, framed by the author’s musings on the desirability of
               immediate and immaterial communication, that describes, via allusions to Cervantes,
               Shakespeare, Milton, and Descartes, the survival of a catastrophic flood by poetry
               and geometry in virtue of their instantiation within the very medium of nature
               itself, a shell and a stone. The passage embodies what Jay David Bolter and Richard
               Grusin call the “double logic of remediation” (5). For Bolter and Grusin, immediacy
               is always the product of hypermediacy, or the incorporation of old media forms as the
               content of a new technology: text on digital screens, radiophonic voices on
               television sets, ballads and bards in Romantic print culture. We see this “double
               logic” in the multiple layers of mediation that wrap around Wordsworth’s allegorical
               vision. Wordsworth’s dream of immediacy is framed within, indeed, enabled by, a
               narrative framework that draws attention to its own hypermediacy.</p>
               <p>It is within this context that Wordsworth deploys the analogy between poetry and
               geometry as “the knowledge that endures.” Both mathematics and poetry serve within
               the passage as vehicles for immediacy; they serve a minimalist impulse to practice a
               form of mediation that replicates as closely as possible the ideal forms of nature
               itself. The counterpoint to this minimalist impulse is Wordsworth’s well-documented
               distaste for the maximalist outpourings of the popular press, those all-too-numerous
               “frantic novels, sickly and stupid German tragedies, and deluges of idle and
               extravagant stories in verse” that he scorns in the Preface to the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (599). By pairing poetry with the allegorical figure of
               the shell, Wordsworth identifies the zero degree of inscription required to encode,
               communicate, and store knowledge. The involuted curlicues of the shell’s organic form
               exist at the very interface between revelation and inscription, nature and medium.
               This is true both phenomenologically and mathematically. Theresa Kelly has noted that
               the mathematical structure of Wordsworth’s shell-poem is that of a logarithmic spiral
               or golden section (572). The shell-poem is thus fractal and infinite: its spiral
               pattern expresses the same formal properties at different levels of scale, ad
               infinitum. Moreover, the infinity of the shell-poem survives alongside the closed and
               perfect mathematical form of the stone-circle. The stone and the shell are thus
               twinned figures of one and infinity, indestructible unity and an open-ended, yet
               formally patterned proliferation. In their rigorous simplicity and minimalist design,
               the shell-poem and stone-circle gesture towards a means of encoding and storing
               knowledge that escapes the contingency of technological mediation and is instead
               inscribed within the ideal language of nature itself.</p>
               <p>I want to stress at this point, however, that Wordsworth is far from naïve about the
               possibility of immediate and immaterial communication. Even within the structure of
               the dream, he draws attention to the ineradicable presence of the printed book. The
               Arab horseman who warns Wordsworth’s sleeping friend of the impending flood acts as
               both mystagogue and demystifier. He presents the stone and the shell to the dreamer,
               but in the same breath he also explains that the stone and the shell are allegorical
               symbols for Euclid’s <title level="m">Elements</title> and “something of more
               worth”—a book of poetry (436). The Arab horseman, or “Semi-Quixote” as Wordsworth
               dubs him, draws our attention to the peculiar two-in-one logic of allegorical
               representation. The dreamer tells Wordsworth that: “I wondered not, although I
               plainly saw / The one to be a Stone, the other a Shell, / Nor doubted once but that
               they both were books” (437). Thus Wordsworth encapsulates within the diegesis of the
               dream the “double logic” of remediation, the way in which immediacy acts as a
               regulative ideal within new media practice, yet remains inevitably out of
               reach—“something evermore about to be” (464). It is this double logic that renders
               the form of the allegory essential to Wordsworth’s media-less media theory. Allegory
               is a mode of representation that is capable of bypassing the law of the excluded
               middle. Under the generic conditions of allegory, the statement “X AND not X” is
               admissible. The stone and the shell are the pure unmediated language of nature AND
               they are technological artifacts created under the conditions of print capitalism.
               Indeed, we seem to experience this very same logic—or perhaps
               <emph>illogic</emph>—every time we sit down to read a book. The object before us is a
               material artifact composed of pulped wood, ink, and glue, or, if you’re already using
               the Kindle, silicon chips, copper logic gates, and electronic ink, AND it is a window
               onto a rich and absorbing sensory experience that transports us into a different
               world. Wordsworth’s allegory, as I say, both separates and connects nature and
               medium. It uses a mode of representation that is adequate to the “double logic” of
               remediation, the two-in-oneness of nature and medium, immediacy and hypermediacy,
               organic form and technological construction.</p>
               <p>Celeste Langan highlights a similar dynamic in her discussion of the relationships
               between print, orality, and the “glamour” or magic practiced by the necromancer,
               Michael Scott, in Walter Scott’s <title level="m">The Lay of the Last
                  Minstrel</title>. Langan points to the connection between the “audiovisual
               hallucination” of the reading experience and the “impoverishment of the senses”
               inherent within the technology of print (62). Following Friedrich Kittler, Langan
               insists that it is the relative sparsity of the visual information encoded upon the
               printed page, coupled at the turn of the nineteenth century with the newly normative
               practice of <emph>silent</emph> reading, which acts as the support for the sensory
               richness of the imagined “content” of the text (and by extension the interiority of
               the reading subject). In short, it is precisely the blankness of the orderly rows of
               printed marks that enables the simulated phantasmagoria of the reading experience.
               Langan’s analysis provides a clue as to the specific virtue of geometry within
               Wordsworth’s allegory of remediation. Geometry, of course, functions by a rigorously
               productive “impoverishment of the senses.” Geometrical reasoning—and in particular
               the medium of the geometrical diagram—subtracts extraneous detail from the visual
               field in order to render a schema that encodes only the most essential and useable
               (computable) features of the phenomenon. When Wordsworth places geometry and poetry
               side-by-side as his ideal media forms, he suggests a specific kind of relationship
               between the bare bones of the stone-circle and the complex, non-linear structure of
               the shell-poem. The poem may be “something of more worth,” but it nevertheless
               remains an expression of mathematical principles that are consistent across both
               forms. Just as for Langan the “glamour” of literary simulation emerges from the flat
               “grammar” of the printed text, so too for Wordsworth the rich complexities of poetic
               form emerge from—and remain ontologically consistent with—the minimal structures of
               Euclidean geometry.</p>
               <p>We can situate the passage of the shell and the stone alongside numerous examples
               from the poem of what I’d like to call Wordsworth’s “elementary media aesthetics.”
               Before I offer a brief sketch of some of these moments, I first want to unpack what I
               mean by this. The term “elements” has a genealogy as rich and complex as that of
               “medium.” Its historical usage encompasses everything from the letters of the
               alphabet, to the foundations of a scientific field, a pedagogical manual or textbook,
               earth, air, water, and fire, the contents of the periodic table. In each of these
               cases, “element” denotes something foundational, the minimal units beyond which
               analysis cannot proceed, the very building blocks from which complex systems are
               composed. And yet the term can also refer to the larger system that those units
               collectively make. One of the chief significations of “elements” is the weather
               systems—rain, wind, storms, fronts, etc.—that produce the total climate or
               environment in which we live. “Elements” refers across the boundary between micro and
               macro. Hence, I use the term “elementary media aesthetics” to signal the way in which
               Wordsworth’s account of mediation is premised upon a specific relationship between
               part and whole, or medium and nature. At the heart of Wordsworth’s elementary media
               aesthetics is a model of how localized and particular practices of mediation can
               embody the general patterns of organization that constitute the “one Surpassing Life”
               of the cosmos as a whole (454).</p>
               <p>In <title level="m">The Prelude</title> Wordsworth uses the term “element” to denote
               each of the key terms that I have used in this paper: number, medium, and nature. In
               the dream vision, Wordsworth identifies the stone-circle as a figure for Euclid’s
                  <title level="m">Elements</title>, the founding document of geometry, the art and
               science of applying number to nature. As we have already seen, moreover, in the
               framing passage that precedes the dream vision, Wordsworth asks “Why hath not the
               mind / Some <emph>element</emph> to stamp her image on / In nature somewhat nearer to
               her own.” In this case, the term serves as a placeholder for the absent media
               concept; element here refers to the reified substance of thought, the vehicle or
                  <emph>medium</emph> in which the author seeks to encode and communicate knowledge.
               And lastly, in the opening book of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, Wordsworth
               uses the term to indicate the transcendental forms of reason and imagination that
               govern the growth of the poet’s mind. The author claims special access to “general
               truths which are themselves a sort / Of <title level="m">Elements</title> and Agents,
               Under-Powers, / Subordinate helpers of the living mind” (379). In this latter
               instance, “elements” refers to the monumental unity of Man and Nature, the forms of
               intuition and imagination that bind the human mind together with the foundational
               structures of the natural world.</p>
               <p>When we weave these strands together, we find that number, and in particular,
               geometry, occupies a central role within Wordsworth’s elementary media aesthetics as
               part of a foundational thread of order and pattern that is repeated at each stage of
                  <title level="m">The Prelude</title>’s developmental narrative. While the larger
               structure of Wordsworth’s poetic project lies outside the scope of the present essay,
               I would nevertheless like to offer a brief sketch of some of the key moments of
               elementary mediation in the poem. These passages are elementary in three senses:
               first, they focus on the inscription of the simple spatial forms that are the
               foundations of geometry; second, they occur in a state of juvenility, either within
               the life of an individual or the life of a race or civilization; and third, the
               message or content of the inscription is impressed upon the very surface of nature
               itself.</p>
               <p>In Book Six, Wordsworth borrows from the 1764 travel narrative, <title level="m">An
                  Authentic Narrative of Some Remarkable and Interesting Particulars in the life of
                  John Newton</title>, for his description of a ship-wrecked sailor who salvages a
               copy of Euclid’s <title level="m">Elements</title> and whiles away his time on a
               desert island by drawing geometric diagrams in the sand. The description of the
               stranded sailor is presented in the context of Wordsworth’s account of his own
               mathematical study at Cambridge and his “Indian awe and wonder” at the pure and
               crystalline forms of Euclidean geometry (454). In both cases—the shipwrecked sailor
               and the awe-struck undergraduate—geometry transports us to the early stages of the
               mind’s development. The stranded sailor is thrown back into a state of nature; his
               plight places him temporarily on the same scale of civilization that Enlightenment
               anthropologists ascribed to the primitive tribes described in travel narratives such
               as Newton’s. Moreover, the young author’s sense of “Indian awe and wonder” at the
               formal ratios of Euclidean geometry evokes what Alan Bewell has called the
               “anthropological vision” at the heart of Wordsworth’s poetic project (ix). The aim of
               the work was to produce what we can now identify as a <emph>fractal</emph> history of
               the human imagination; that is, a history of the imagination as it passes through the
               same patterns of development both at the level of the individual mind and at the
               level of the human race as a whole. The undergraduate’s “Indian awe and wonder”
               replays at the level of the individual the early history of human civilization, the
               first discovery of geometric reasoning in the ancient world. Rather than occupying
               discrete ontological planes, part and whole, individual and species, past and present
               are inter-fused with one another. Geometry is thus “elementary” not only in that it
               marks the first stages of mankind’s scientific education, but also in that it is
               present as an abiding structure within the development of each individual mind. Like
               the spiral of the shell-poem, it recurs at different levels of scale.</p>
               <p>We see a similar association of geometry and the mind’s juvenility in the closing
               book of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, where Wordsworth describes the
               archaeological remains on Salisbury Plain:</p>

               <p>The “lines, circles, mounts, a mystery of shapes” that Wordsworth sees embedded
               within the landscape do not, in this case, express the mathematized spatial forms of
               Euclidean geometry; rather, they mark an even earlier stirring of the rational sense
               of number and proportion within the mind of pre-literate, Iron Age tribes. The
               “infant science” of Druid astrology recalls the “Indian awe and wonder” that
               Wordsworth experienced as an undergraduate. In each case, the author describes the
               spatial and mathematical elements of human reason as they recur in different stages
               of history.</p>
               <p>These passages share with the allegory of the shell and the stone the minimalist
               impulse to practice a form of mediation that approaches the condition of nature. As
               in Plato’s <title>Meno</title>, the shipwrecked sailor scratches his Euclidean
               diagrams “with a long stick upon the sand” (171). He impresses abstract geometric
               forms into the pliant and amorphous stuff of nature itself. The Sarum druids arrange
               blocks of stone upon a flat plain and carve markings into the ground. Once again, the
               natural world is the medium upon which they impress the abstract forms of their
               “infant science.” We can place the sand-diagram and the Druidic stone-circle
               alongside the shell-poem and the Euclidean stone-circle as further instances of
               Wordsworth’s elementary media aesthetics, which imagine a localized, terrestrial mode
               of inscription that is capable of embodying the formal ratios and patterns that
               govern the cosmos as a whole. Indeed, Wordsworth is at pains throughout the poem to
               differentiate this reverential appreciation of geometric form from that “false
               secondary power” that projects man-made taxonomies onto the external world (398). He
               installs geometry alongside poetry as an essential, indeed, an elementary part of
               human knowledge, an abiding form within the unfolding histories of both individual
               and species.</p>
               <p>I want now to make an abrupt turn to Charles Babbage, mathematician, engineer,
               radical utilitarian, and hence surely one of the least Wordsworthian figures of the
               early nineteenth century. And yet in his <title level="m">Ninth Bridgewater
                  Treatise</title> Babbage engages with the same question of the relationship
               between number, medium and nature that Wordsworth addresses in Book 5 of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>. Where Wordsworth seeks to ground medium in nature,
               however, what emerges from Babbage’s text is a picture of nature itself as a kind of
               medium, not only as suggested by the familiar natural theological trope of the book
               of nature, but in this case as modeled by Babbage’s groundbreaking difference engine,
               an early forebear of the digital computer.</p>
               <p>Babbage wrote his treatise in order to correct what he saw as the unwarranted
               exclusion of mathematics from the field of natural theology. At the heart of
               Babbage’s argument is the proposition that it is mathematically and logically
               possible that all of the vast complexity to be found in the universe could be the
               product of a single law implanted within the fabric of the cosmos by the divine first
               cause. This was important for Babbage as it would perform two related functions
               within debates about natural theology. First, it would establish mathematics as a
               valid source of knowledge about God’s creation. And second, it would obviate the need
               for divine interventions or miracles in order to explain radical ruptures within the
               order of nature, such as the cataclysmic flood that Wordsworth describes in Book Five
               of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>. Instead of the result of miraculous
               intervention or divine tinkering, the irruption of difference within nature could be
               explained as the product of a single mathematical law that contained within itself
               nested layers of emergent complexity. </p>
               <p>And yet we can also read Babbage’s treatise as media-less media theory in the manner
               of Wordsworth’s allegory. Of course, Babbage includes none of the elaborate apparatus
               of frame narrative, reported speech, literary allusions, and allegorical tropes, but
               in the figure of the difference engine he focuses his attention on what we can now
               clearly identify as a new media technology. The elaborate thought experiment through
               which he leads his readers serves the additional purpose of isolating this new medium
               as distinct from, yet intimately connected to, the natural world; indeed, so
               intimately connected that it fosters a speculative, yet rigorous form of mathematical
               knowledge about that world.</p>
               <p>Babbage guides his readers through a series of arithmetical calculations performed by
               the difference engine. First, he prompts us to imagine the machine crunching through
               the natural numbers, from one to two to three to four to five, etc., etc., all the
               way up to 100,000,001 (<title level="m">Bridgewater Treatise</title> 34). Of course,
               we do not need to clearly and distinctly imagine each step of this calculation. Once
               we recognize that the process is orderly and consistent (N + 1), we can leap forward
               in our minds to one hundred million and one. At this point, however, rather than
               following the cogs’ progress according to the same formula, Babbage instructs us that
               the machine now clicks to 100,010,002, then 100,030,003, then 100,060,004, then
               100,100,005, etc. (N + [the triangular numbers {10,000}]). The machine now calculates
               according to what seems to be a new formula, until, after 2,761 further iterations,
               it unexpectedly leaps forward again . . . and again . . . and again (<title level="m">Bridgewater Treatise</title> 36). In short, the machine appears to be both simple
               and complex, mathematically regular yet also productive of sudden leaps of difference
               that create new plateaus of mathematical form.</p>
               <p>Babbage assures us, however, that the machine, both as simulated within the thought
               experiment and as a physical contraption sitting in his Walworth Road workshop,
               calculates according to a single, fixed formula. Each leap in complexity is the
               product of a single algorithm that expresses nested layers of order at extended
               scales of iteration. Having established this as a mathematical and mechanical
               possibility, Babbage extrapolates this logic to the scale of the cosmos as a whole.
               Babbage’s argument hinges on the commensurability of the operational logic of the
               difference engine with the order of nature itself. He is at pains to establish what
               he refers to as the maximum “degree of generality” of the difference engine (<title level="m">Bridgewater Treatise</title> 97). In short, the machine serves as a
               scalable model of the universe, a computational crystal ball in which the
               mathematical patterns that underpin all natural order can be glimpsed in their
               nascent and incomplete forms. Reasoning from medium to nature, Babbage arrives at the
               proposition that all of the complexity to be found in the universe could, as a matter
               of logical possibility, be the product of a single mathematical law implanted within
               the fabric of reality by the divine first cause.</p>
               <p>Unlike <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, with its acute awareness of the
               proliferation of media forms, the <title level="m">Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</title>
               focuses primarily on the difference engine, with only a brief excursus on the role
               played by the invention of printing in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth
               century. If we glance sideways, however, to Babbage’s other great work, <title level="m">The Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</title>, we discover the
               relevance of Bolter and Grusin’s “double logic” to his computational thought
               experiment. <title level="m">The Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</title> is a
               sprawling catalogue of the new manufacturing technologies that were transforming
               Great Britain’s economy and society in the early-nineteenth century. Among the
               descriptions of iron smelting and pin manufactories, Babbage’s catalogue registers
               the proliferation of new media technologies that was part of the industrial
               revolution. The work contains extensive descriptions of the mechanical processes of
               engraving, the optical telegraph, the postal service, the difference engine, various
               forms of printing, and, in the self-reflexive coup de grace, a lengthy description of
               how the very book in the reader’s hands came into being. It is against the background
               of this capacious treatment of new industrial technologies that we should understand
               Babbage’s arguments in <title level="m">The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</title>. This
               account of the difference engine may be directed towards debates within natural
               theology, but it also makes the broader case for the epistemological viability of the
               new media technologies that were the product of Britain’s rapid industrialization
               (Secord 53). Babbage argues, in short, that machines can mediate the natural world in
               such a way as to reveal its foundational logic and structure.</p>
               <p>One of the most interesting features of the <title level="m">Economy of Machinery and
                  Manufactures</title> is the unfamiliarity of the taxonomic categories that Babbage
               uses to sort and sift the heterogeneous products of the industrial revolution. This
               should alert us to the fact that, just as the concept of “medium” was yet to assume
               its characteristically modern form, so too was the concept of “technology” in flux.
               The <title level="m">Oxford English Dictionary</title> dates the modern use of
               “technology” in reference to machinery as an aggregate class to the middle of the
               nineteenth century (<title level="m">OED Online</title>). Before this time,
               technology referred either to a treatise on the practical arts—that is, a book about
               what we would now identify as technology—or, in its earlier usage, the system of
               nomenclature for classifying subjects in the medieval university curriculum.
               Babbage’s treatise thus registers the fluidity of one of the key conceptual elements
               that would form the modern media concept at the end of the century.</p>
               <p> Babbage classifies mechanical processes according to the formal properties of the
               tasks they execute. He includes chapters on accumulating power, regulating power, the
               increase and diminution of velocity, extending the time of action of forces, exerting
               forces too great for human power, registering operations, and copying. After
               explaining the formal properties of each of these processes, he then proceeds to
               catalogue and describe particular instances as he encountered them on his factory
               tours. Thus the section “Of Copying” includes a startling array of manufacturing
               processes, including steel engraving, calico printing, printing from moveable types,
               casting in metal, production of bricks and tiles, glass seals, horn knife and
               umbrella handles, coins and bank notes, stamping buttons and nail heads, French
               cliché, tube drawing, lead pipes, and vermicelli pasta (<title level="m">Economy</title> 69-113). Babbage’s criteria for classifying machines are
               emphatically not our own. Many of the items in the list are what we would now
               understand as media technologies, but at this early stage in the century, Babbage
               lacks the vocabularies of both “media” and “technology” that we would now use to
               separate these items from the baffling array of tools used for copying. We would not,
               I dare say, include vermicelli pasta, the printing press, and lead pipes within the
               same class of technologies.</p>
               <p> If we now turn back to the <title level="m">The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</title>,
               we can see Babbage’s thought experiment as an attempt to demonstrate how the products
               of the industrial revolution could be valid sources of knowledge about the order and
               structure of the natural world. The difference engine does double duty both as a
               specific piece of machinery and as a conceptual vehicle for imagining the fundamental
               structure of the cosmos. It performs an analogous function to that of geometry within
               Wordsworth’s allegory: it distills from the morass of new media technologies their
               most essential and elementary functions. The ratio between the simplicity of the
               difference engine’s operational structure and the complexity of the computations it
               can perform articulates the promise inherent within machinery as such. It is a nice
               irony of history that, due to a combination of bureaucratic entropy and the
               imprecision of contemporary steel milling, the difference engine remained incomplete
               within Babbage’s life time; indeed, it was not until 1991 that Doron Swade and his
               team at the Science Museum in London managed to assemble a working version of the
               machine. The difference engine, like the quality of immediacy towards which it
               strove, remained from Babbage’s perspective, “something evermore about to be.”</p>
               <p>It is striking that the phenomena that Babbage seeks to explain via
               media-mathematical analogy share the same formal structure as Wordsworth’s
               shell-poem. Babbage deploys his thought experiment in order to explain natural
               systems that leap between stable states via passages of seemingly inexplicable
               turbulence. The angular unconformities of geological strata, the phase shift from
               caterpillar to pupa to butterfly, the passage from aquatic to terrestrial habitats,
               the formation and extinction of species (<title level="m">Bridgewater</title> 43-4):
               these are all non-linear processes that express emergent patterns of organization
               within the life-span of a single natural system. Like Wordsworth’s dream vision,
               Babbage’s thought experiment contains at its center an image of fractal organization:
               both the spiral of the shell-poem and the exfoliating algorithm of the difference
               engine repeat the same pattern at different levels of scale and complexity. </p>
               <p>What to make of this formal congruence is hard to determine. In lieu of a systematic
               explanation, I simply want to point out that Wordsworth and Babbage reason in
               different directions to arrive at similar conclusions. Wordsworth reasons from nature
               to medium. He casts his ideal media forms—poetry and geometry—in the allegorical garb
               of the shell and the stone. This serves as a means for Wordsworth to imagine a form
               of mediation that avoids what he sees as the disorder and alienation of commercial
               print culture. Nature is the unity, the one and the infinite, upon which he models
               his ideal mediums. Babbage, by contrast, reasons from medium to nature; he begins in
               his workshop, where he distils and universalizes the computational principles of the
               difference engine, then extrapolates to the structure of the cosmos as a whole.
               Wordsworth constructs medium from nature; Babbage constructs nature from medium. And
               yet in both cases, medium and nature display a foundational isomorphism, a common
               skein of fractal order, which is encoded within the vanishing language of
               mathematics. Poetry for Wordsworth, and computation for Babbage, become universal
               mediums, capable of embodying in the very form of their construction—iambs and
               trochees, on the one hand, cogs, gears, and digital bits, on the other—the elementary
               principles of nature.</p>
               <p>By way of a conclusion, I want to turn to a brief account of contemporary debates
               about media and mediation. Indeed, my interest in the question “how did Romantic-era
               writers think and talk about technological media?” is spurred in large part by the
               assumed relationships between nature and medium that characterize so much media
               discourse of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. I am referring here to the
               model of nature and medium as fundamentally distinct domains that stand over and
               apart from one another. It is this model of dichotomous opposites that gives birth to
               and enables the arguments both for and against technological determinism that have
               been central to media theory throughout its history as a discipline. The late
               Friedrich Kittler stated the techno-determinist position explicitly: media, he
               claimed, “determine our situation” (xxxix). Kittler’s work does not lack for nuance,
               nor was he given to naïve generalizations about a pristine and autonomous Nature that
               suffers at the hands of an equally monolithic Technology. Nevertheless, the point
               that I want to make here is that this style of thought—that technological media can
               determine our situation—rests on historically formed assumptions about the relative
               autonomy of medium and nature. When we turn back to the Romantic period, however,
               those assumptions are yet to be fully formed. The boundaries between nature and
               medium are yet to be fixed. Within this more fluid arrangement, the
               techno-determinist debate is simply moot. It is only when technological media have
               been separated out from the raw materials from which they are composed—when, for
               instance, the digital computer is conceived independently of the silicon chips, logic
               gates, electron pulses, symbolic programming languages, plastic casings, legal
               frameworks, and learned cultural behaviors that are its constituent parts—that a
               given medium can be said to impose its logic upon society and culture. Taken instead
               as an array of component parts, the machine is re-absorbed into the complex ecology
               of interacting agencies and forces that traverse both nature and medium. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Bennett for an extended account of “vibrant
                  matter” and a discussion of how to assign agency and causation within complex
                  techno-social-organic assemblages </note>
               </p>
               <p>What we can glean from our readings of Wordsworth and Babbage, I would suggest, is a
               salutary sense of the fluidity and contingency of the relationship between “nature,”
               on the one hand, and “medium” or “technology,” on the other. Rather than casting
               Wordsworth and Babbage in the familiar guises of the nostalgic organicist and the
               mechanical reductionist, we might instead register the ways in which their media
               theories dispense with the dualistic style of thinking that is the condition of
               possibility for the argument from techno-determinism. Indeed, in their attempts to
               think nature and medium together and apart, Wordsworth and Babbage seem to presage
               some of the most recent trends within contemporary media theory. New work within the
               field signals the emergence of a new way of talking and thinking about media that
               departs from the problematics of dualism and determinism that animated the field for
               so long. Bruno Latour, for instance, uses the term “mediator” in his actor-network
               theory to describe any element within a natural or social system that transmits force
               and thus helps to produce organizational structure (<title level="m">Reassembling the
                  Social</title> 39). Everything, for Latour, mediates. Microbes, natural laws,
               documents, instruments, laboratories, scientific theories, scientists, even the
               cultural abstraction of "Science" itself: these are all mediators that interact with
               one another to form the complex and hybrid systems of modernity. For Latour, the
               concept of the “mediator” helps to un-pick the hoary old binaries of nature-culture,
               subject-object, organic-technological, that have for so long formed the chief
               coordinates on the mental map of modernity. Latour’s work presents us with a newly
               expanded conception of what it means to mediate and what kinds of objects can perform
               this ubiquitous task.</p>
               <p>Latour has recently observed that, “Euclidean space is itself the object of media
               studies” (“Where is Res Extensa?”). Within this “compositionist” philosophy of
               science, geometry remains stubbornly local (“Compositionist Manifesto”). The
               uniformly extended, quantifiable, abstract space projected by Euclidean geometry is
               precisely that, a projection. This space exists only in specific mediums: Euclid’s
               long-lost parchment diagrams, the pages of printed books, chalkboards, notepads,
               digital models, and, we might add, stone-circles, shell-poems, and difference
               engines. Latour insists that it takes work to extend Euclidean space into the world,
               work that is accomplished not only in the minds of geometers but also in the media
               with which they compose the Euclidean universe. Reviel Netz, one of the chief sources
               for Latour’s argument, explains the central function of the diagram within Greek
               deduction: “each geometrical proposition sets up its own universe—which is its
               diagram” (32). Hence, what we see in Wordsworth’s allegory and Babbage’s thought
               experiment is the composition of portable universes. Indeed, both authors derive
               their media theory and their cosmology at the same time. Medium and Nature are
               co-constitutive: the organic form of the shell-poem helps to compose the “one
               Surpassing Life” of the Divine mind; the mechanical structure of the difference
               engine helps to compose the mathematical sublime of the computational universe.
               Babbage states of the difference engine: “my own views respecting the extent of the
               laws of Nature were greatly extended by considering it” (33). He thus acknowledges
               the essential role played by the medium (a role repeated for the reader in the form
               of the thought experiment) as a prosthesis for thought, an instrument that enables
               him to scale up within the structure of the universe. We can thus place the
               shell-poem and the difference engine alongside the Euclidean diagram, the invention
               of “zero”—from the Sanskrit, “sunya,” which denotes not an absence of number but an
               empty space on the counting tablets used in Indian mathematics, which is to say, the
                  <emph>medium</emph> itself—and ultra-modern media such as cellular automata and
               stochastic computer models, as machines for extending and compressing scale. </p>
               <p>Both Latour and Netz insist, however, that the deductive rigor of Euclidean geometry
               is not diminished by the fact of its mediation. Latour’s expansive conception of the
               “mediator” is both more and less powerful than our previous model of the
               technological channel of communication. It is more powerful in the sense media
               technologies become part of a vastly expanded “universe of things,” to quote Shelley
               (120), that mediate. The printing press and electric telegraph, or, to use Wordsworth
               and Babbage’s chosen examples, poetry and the difference engine, sit once again
               alongside gravity, the human eye, mathematics, bridges, roads, and cities—in short,
               “everything that intervenes, enables, supplements, or is simply in between” (Siskin
               and Warner 5). But it is also less powerful in the sense that the technological
               medium ceases to be a uniquely privileged mediator. In contrast to Kittler’s claim
               that media “determine our situation,” within this new model technological media
               become simply part of the situation; they influence and are in turn influenced by the
               teeming range of objects and forces that comprise the complex systems of modernity. </p>

               <p>I was being a little playful with the title of this talk, but not much. “Notes and
               Queries” really is the genre, though for accuracy’s sake I should have reversed the
               order. All I want to do is to raise some questions about a very familiar poem and
               then show you some resources and lines of thought that speak to those questions. This
               research isn’t in aid of devising and defending a new reading of a particular text—in
               this case, Wordsworth’s <title level="m">She dwelt among th’ untrodden ways</title>,
               second in the standard sequencing of the Lucy poems. What excites me is the way that
               this poem’s resistances to reading—obvious and much remarked—open onto analytic
               models that are not often part of our critical repertoire in general (meaning, among
               students of literature), or that are unlikely for readers of Wordsworth. Shifting,
               enlarging, refining our understanding of a single work—if that happens, it would be a
               bonus. The aim, however, is to experiment with new ways of responding to language
               patterns that are important in Wordsworth’s poetry and, by extension, other poetries
               of the modern periods, and to discover new things to do with those patterns. </p>
               <p>My research has pulled me in a few directions; the first, cited in the second half of
               my title (“Names and Numbers”), is toward formal-language theory—sometimes called
               philosophy of reference. I say <emph>pulled</emph> because I certainly didn’t choose
               that path. It’s arid and thorny and makes our formalism look like a walk in the park.
               But there it was, coming out of the process of asking very basic, small-scale, and
               un-coordinated usage questions and following leads that seemed promising for each
               question individually. I’ll retrace the trodden way, leaving in the false starts and
               dead-ends. I do that—and I want you to hear that I’m doing it—for two reasons. One is
               that the sources I’ve been looking at were new to me and I think they might have
               their own independent interest for you. Second, though some of these paths run at a
               tangent to my through-line, I haven’t ruled out their relevance. And I’m hoping that
               when I finish, you can point out things I’ve missed and maybe help me to integrate
               some of the outlying parts. </p>
               <p>Not to make a mystery, I’ve been reading in John Stuart Mill’s <title level="m">System of Logic</title>, 1843, and in Gottlob Frege, both the <title level="m">Foundations of Arithmetic</title> and <title level="m">On Sense and
                  Reference</title>, 1884 and 1892. Both philosophers describe what they take to be
               the logical structure of proper names; they also describe the logical structure of
               numbers. Each writer’s treatment of the two includes rationalist and empiricist
               elements; neither Mill nor Frege reflects on this mixture and I’m not yet able to
               articulate the logical necessity of these cross-currents. The independent interest I
               find in these treatises concerns ways to think about poetry and grammar that seem new
               for Romantic studies. I borrow the phrase <emph>poetry and grammar</emph> from
               Gertrude Stein’s lecture by that title, a work that to my complete surprise emerged
               as one of my principal aids to reflection. I turned to Stein because, strange as it
               sounds, hers was the one corpus showing clear affinities with the usages that
               interested me in Wordsworth. The eureka moment came when I happened on an article by
               Jennifer Ashton, a wonderfully clarifying commentary, which had the added attraction
               of confirming my hunch that ordinary language philosophy could speak to the language
               patterns I’d found in Wordsworth. Without Ashton’s reading of Stein, I wouldn’t have
               known how to use my own readings in reference theory to open up the poetry. So, huge
               thanks to her, and a plug for the book in which that article forms the second
               chapter, <title level="m">From Modernism to Postmodernism: American Poetry and Theory
                  in the Twentieth Century</title>. Let me also give credit to one of my graduate
               students, Rebecca Porte, who put me onto Ashton’s work and is now writing about
               twentieth-century poetry and the genre of thought-experiment in the period’s
               philosophical and scientific discourse. And to Anahid Nersessian, who kindled to my
               interest in analytic philosophy and sent me two wonderful articles as well as her
               thoughts on the topic, yet more thanks. I’m sure you’ve forgotten my aids to
               reflection by now, so here’s the list again. Mill, Frege, and Stein. </p>
               <p>One last preliminary. The Lucy poems have a long and illustrious critical history.
               I’ll honor just one reading in this talk, Frances Ferguson’s “Wordsworth’s Quest for
               a Poetic Object” (1973), because I see it as normative both for <title level="m">She
                  dwelt</title> and for the Lucy poems overall. I mean <emph>normative</emph> in the
               strict sense, i.e., a best-practice standard. Ferguson organizes the poems as “a
               quest in which the adequacy of poetic language depends precisely upon the poet’s
               renunciation of any claims to appropriate the object of his poems” (536). On this
               reading, Lucy is the ever elusive object of desire at once brought into being by
               writing and forever deferred by it (<emph>do</emph> hear the rhyme in
                  <emph>Lucy/elusive</emph>). By tracking the paradoxes of writing and difference,
               Ferguson for the first time in the poems’ critical history explained their mixed
               genre: elegy and blazon, with “the speaker...trying to describe an object of love,
               when that love is compounded of nothing but <emph>absence</emph>” (540, emphasis
               Ferguson’s). My interest in <title level="m">She dwelt</title> comes as an annotation
               to Ferguson’s reading or a burrowing into one corner of it. She takes on “a variety
               of problems about poetic representation and naming” (532-533) whereas I look only at
               number representation and at grammatically specific kinds of naming. The textual
               bridge carrying me from number to name has three planks: 1) what I take to be an
               allusion to Gray’s <title level="m">Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard</title>;
               2) the appositional structure of the first long sentence; and 3) the foregrounding of
               ordinary pronouns, so-called determiner pronouns (like <emph>none</emph> and
                  <emph>few</emph>), and proper names. </p>
               <p>My questions about <title level="m">She dwelt</title> are not new but they work
               differently, I think, in the critical frameworks I propose. First of my queries: the
               obvious logical contradiction lodged in the two <emph>none/few</emph> usages, their
               illogic underscored by the oxymoron of “untrodden ways.” By shifting this illogic
               from grammatology (the domain of desire, <emph>différance</emph>, and discourse) to
               the context of analytic philosophy’s treatments of number and name, we might arrive
               at a new place. Second, the bareness of the poem—borrowing a phrase from the Emily
               Dickinson scholarship, its “inhuman lyricism”—is also in play for me, its ontic
               emphasis marking a sharp difference from Wordsworth’s typically epistemic focus.
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors"> “In the condensed phrase ‘inhuman
                  lyricism’ I mean to recall the nineteenth century’s association of birdsong with a
                  pure expressive capacity the poet cannot own...a song the poet cannot voice”
                  (Jackson 27). See also Milne. </note> Third, I’d remark a certain resemblance to
               the form of the riddle, the sort of thing we find in Stevens’ anecdote poems (i.e.,
               when is a jar not a jar? or, what is round upon the ground?). Or, when is a girl not
               a girl? When she’s Lucy. Riddle-language points to itself even as it points to an
               object, and there’s something about how it does that that seems different from
               garden-variety reflexivity. I won’t get to this in my talk, but I’m wondering if the
               double-pointing of riddles might be illuminated by some basics of set theory. What I
               have in mind is Bertrand Russell’s famous paradox, which builds on set-theory’s
               distinction between normal sets (which do not contain themselves) and abnormal ones,
               which do. Russell puts the question: what about the set of all normal sets? Does it
               or does it not contain itself; in other words, is <emph>it</emph> abnormal or normal?
               The answer is both and neither. A full stop in logic as we know it, and therefore an
               opening onto other systems.</p>
               <p>I anchor the poem’s numbering pattern to the operators <emph>zero</emph> and
                  <emph>one</emph>, figures that govern both its mimetic and diegetic dimensions.
               These numbers yield different poetic values and I don’t yet understand the logic of
               their coexistence in the text (that’s one of those thought-tangents I mentioned).
                  <emph>Zero</emph> comes first, and I mean first in both textual prominence and in
               the Wordsworth scholarship, not the ordinal sequence. The aching last line of <title level="m">She dwelt</title>—“and, oh! / The difference to me”—makes the case for
                  <emph>zero</emph> all by itself. The exclamatory “oh” recalls the apostrophic “o”
               and in the same stroke, empties it out, collapsing apostrophic subject and object
               into a single figure: namely, “the difference.” That word thematizes the subtractive
               procedures that have led to this bare place, to this nothing that is. The leading is
               indirect, however —even, <emph>mis</emph>-leading—in that the central stanza stacks
               simile upon metaphor in what looks like an effort to hang onto the vanishing object,
               to catch it—catch <emph>her</emph>—in a net of names before she vanishes for good.
               Orpheus, calling Eurydice. In other words, the poem’s procedures seem additive until
               we hit the juxtaposition of “difference” (the substantive of absence), and “me.”
               “Me,” the dative pronoun, indirect object, rather than “I”—the nominative of
               agency—which we’ve a right to expect from the only first-person usage in so pure a
               lyric strain. I read this displacement as suggesting an economy of perfect
               subtraction, a zero sum, rather than a productive negation bringing forth the subject
               who speaks. In dramatic terms, it feels like a tragic reversal and recognition scene
               rolled into one. We suddenly feel not only how the loss and the beloved have been
               linked from the start but how utterly figuration has failed. The word is
                  <emph>not</emph> “elegy to what it signifies” (Hass); the loss in this poem
               carries language, carries speaking, carries figuration along with it. </p>
               <p>We get to two places by thinking <emph>zero</emph> rather than loss, renunciation, or
                  <emph>différance</emph> as the poem’s focalizer. I’ll say what they are (in the
               spirit, again, of presenting options), but because they only extend existing readings
               of the poem rather than move us in a different direction, I’ll be brief. One line of
               thought triggered by <emph>zero</emph> opens onto ontology via German idealism, and
               from there through Heidegger and ultimately to Badiou. Listen to this sound bite from
               Lorenz Oken’s <title level="m">Elements of Physiophilosophy</title>, 1847: “The zero
               is an eternal act; numbers are repetitions of this eternal act, or its halting
               points, like steps in progression” (13). (And by the way, the reason this sounds so
               much like Coleridge is that Oken borrowed as heavily from Fichte as Coleridge did.
               The <emph>zero</emph>, however, is Oken’s contribution.) “Out of nothing,” writes
               Oken, “it is possible for something to arise, for mathematics, consisting of
               propositions, is a something in relation to 0” (5). Extrapolating, he avers that “The
               Real and Ideal are one and the same, only under two kinds of form. The latter is the
               same under an indefinite, eternal, single form [zero]; but the Real is . . . under
               the form of quantity...and multiplicity [numbers]” (6-7). Badiou’s discussion of the
                  <emph>void</emph> in his masterwork, <title level="m">Being and Event</title>,
               carries forward this idealist tradition in ways I can’t fathom. Believe me, I’ve
               tried. The reason I’ve tried is that Badiou links the void, his figure for
               “being-qua-being” and for the sheer possibility of presentation, to the name: in his
               words “the pure utterance of the arbitrariness of a proper name” (59). The way that
               he structures the void (as both “pure multiplicity” [passim] and “the multiple of
               nothing”), suggests that he has a really interesting angle on naming and singularity.
               But all I can get from those descriptions is Badiou rejecting traditional constructs
               for origination as proceeding from either <emph>plenum</emph> or withdrawal, creation
               in both those models entailing a negativity—either fracture or contraction. In other
               words, I sympathize with Badiou’s effort to think “beyond essence,” as Levinas put
               it, which is also beyond existence as negation of essence. But as I said, I don’t get
               it. </p>
               <p>Here’s the second place <emph>zero</emph> can lead. Math historians see the invention
               of <emph>zero</emph> as a watershed because it enables “positional notation,” a
               system wherein place comes to stand for value. Without this (or, what is the same
               thing), without a symbol to stand for the <emph>empty</emph> place, numbering can’t
               rise from describing to discovering: or from what is called “hand-work,” by reference
               to the counting-board or abacus, to mind-work. Prior to <emph>zero’s</emph>
               invention, math is arithmetic, the study of quantities; math as we know it studies
               the relations <emph>between</emph> quantities, which are seen strictly as anchors for
               those relations. To see in this way requires that numbers be fully abstracted from
               the things they count. Or, to use our idiom, it requires seeing them as
               nouns—stand-alones, points, symbols in their own right—rather than as adjectives,
               describing a temporary condition of the counting-board. <emph>Zero’s</emph> emergence
               is proof that the shift from an adjectival to a substantive concept of number has
               occurred, for where on the counting board or anywhere else could you find a
               nothing—an empirical datum—which <emph>zero</emph> could modify? </p>
               <p>That’s what <emph>zero</emph> shows. What it <emph>does</emph> is allow for a process
               called “recursive abstraction,” a formalizing mechanism. <emph>zero</emph> marks the
               spot where a network of relations among things (say, things 1-10) gets formalized as
               a sign of those relations—the sign and its value necessarily located outside the
               network that it represents. At that higher level and supported by that value-sign,
               another system of relations comes into being (things 10-20, for instance). And so on
               and so forth (Kaplan, 9, 16, 22, 36, 76, 90, 115). Although this maps generally onto
               our schemas for meta-narrative, meta-poetics, and reflexivity in general, we might
               learn something by exploring the similarities and differences between our own
               critical constructs on the one hand, and the boot-strapping, formalizing processes by
               which math rises from the study of quantities to the study of relations. But I want
               to get to the other and, to me, more interesting figure organizing <title level="m">She dwelt</title>—the number <emph>one</emph>. </p>
               <p> To get a leg up on its workings in this poem, I’ll recap the classic scene of
               instruction in Wordsworth, using <title level="m">Nutting</title> as my example (and
               it may be germane that <title level="m">Nutting</title> dates from the same
               compositional place and time as <title level="m">She dwelt</title>, written in
               Goslar, 1798; in other words, one could imagine Wordsworth conducting two different
               experiments with the singular). Here’s <title level="m">Nutting</title>: “It seems a
               day, / (I speak of one from many singled out).” So opens the poem’s mock-epic
               struggle over signification: <emph>agon</emph> between being and meaning, process and
               event, the <emph>One</emph> as <emph>plenum</emph> and the numerical
               <emph>one</emph>—“from many singled out.” The poem stages the fertile but fatal
               attraction of the singular as the violence and narcissism of desire, troped as sexual
               aggression and moralized through the closing admonition to the maiden. By “violence
               and narcissism,” I mean the deep-structure drive of the poem toward a fusion of ego
               and object into a single speaking, a <emph>one</emph> of poetic power to take the
               place of an original wholeness, abandoned or back-projected in the interest of
               achieving freedom and mastery. Wordsworth’s characteristic recoil from that
               hypostatized <emph>one</emph> and his repertoire of strategies for remedial follow-up
               are by now staples of the criticism. </p>
               <p> I see a different kind of <emph>one</emph> surfacing in <title level="m">She
                  dwelt</title>, and it does so on the back of Gray’s <title level="m">Elegy</title>. The poems are linked through their flower tropes—conventional in
               Gray, intentional, I believe, in Wordsworth. Here’s Gray’s metaphor for the class or
               type of the rustic beauty: “Full many a flower . . . born to blush unseen, / And
               waste its sweetness on the desert air.” In <title level="m">She dwelt</title>, those
               many flowers fine down to <hi rendition="#underline">
                     <emph>a</emph>
                  </hi> flower
               particularized (“hopelessly over-particularized,” writes Ferguson [541]) not just by
               name but circumstantially: “A Violet by a mossy Stone / Half-hidden from the Eye!”
               For me, that excess of detail calls up the <title level="m">Elegy</title>—a mossy
               head-stone, perhaps, in a country church-yard, marking the grave of one Lucy . . .
                  <title level="m">Gray</title>? Read against the high-cultural inter-text of Gray’s
                  <title level="m">Elegy</title> rather than through the ballad tradition, where
               it’s usually situated, <title level="m">She dwelt</title> starts looking like a
               companion piece to the <title level="m">Elegy’s</title> closing epitaph: that one,
               for a melancholy youth, “<emph>to Fortune and to Fame unknown</emph>”—Wordsworth’s,
               for one of Gray’s flower girls. That her sweetness be not entirely wasted, he confers
               “the passing tribute of a sigh”: to wit, “and, oh! / The difference to me.”</p>
               <p>The <title level="m">Elegy </title>doesn’t just deploy general ideas and categorical
               kinds; it raises reference—naming and numbering—to a thematic level. One thinks first
               of the famous conversions of proper names into natural-kind names (“some” Milton,
               Cromwell, village Hampden), but once you start down this path, the workings of the
               nominative jump out at you: collective nouns, general nouns, concept names, count-
               and non-count nouns, definite/indefinite /and quantifier pronouns, emblems,
               personifications, determiners, and deictics—a veritable riot of naming. Moreover, as
               if to do in a dramatic register what happens in the philosophical, line 93 launches
               the <title level="m">Elegy’s</title> notorious narrational pile-up, wherein pronouns
               cut loose from their antecedents, taking on an autonomy that multiplies reference
               rather than anchoring it. I’m referring to the cast of characters who suddenly start
               drifting in and out of each other’s frames of reference: rustic moralist,
               hoary-headed swain, melancholy poet, “thou” who “canst read,” unmarked over-voice,
               etc. </p>
               <p>Putting Wordsworth alongside Gray’s quintessential mid-century elegy highlights the
               singularizing agenda of <title level="m">She dwelt</title> and its late-century shift
               from types to individuals. The shift is from exemplarity—understood as the rationally
               derived <emph>one</emph>—to singularity, which we <emph>could</emph> call a numerical
                  <emph>one</emph> but only under a concept of number that is non-additive and in
               that respect (maybe others too) analogous to the proper name. Both belong to the
               grammatical category of non-count nouns. This is what I’ll try to get at below: the
               structure of a singularity to which Johnson’s famous jibe about the Metaphysical
               poets—that they “number the streaks of the tulip”—would not apply. Also, and in light
               of the fact that the name, <title level="m">Lucy</title>, is itself a “neo-Arcadian
               commonplace, an eighteenth-century elegiac fixture” (as I only recently learned;
               Hartman 141), I think you could make an even stronger claim: namely, that the Lucy
               poems intend this shift from exemplarity to singularity as part of their operating
               program. One might even suggest that this agenda is our best rationale for grouping
               them. </p>
               <p>Another effect of the Gray resonance is to highlight the difference between the
               singularizing action of <title level="m">She dwelt</title> and what happens in <title level="m">Nutting</title>, the spots of time, and other defining Wordsworthian
               moments. Desire powers those struggles between the mind of man and nature, ensuring
               reciprocal individuation of subject and object by poem’s or passage’s end. <title level="m">She dwelt</title>, its erotic dynamics tempered by elegy, suspends that
               shaping spirit. And, while it brings forth a <emph>one</emph> remaindered by the
               labor of <emph>ascesis</emph> (this, on the standard view of the poem), the allusion
               to Gray suggests a <emph>one</emph> arising from a trio of naming functions: namely,
               apposition, pronominal substitution, and the proper name. </p>
               <p>Roger Slakey, in an excellent essay from 1972, unpacks the logic of apposition both
               in general and in <title level="m">She dwelt</title>: “Grammatically, the first two
               lines are a proposition, a simple statement of fact; the next six are three parallel
               phrases, in apposition with the subject ‘She’” (631). With predication, Slakey
               writes, “We seem . . . to have a large frame of reference, other possible
               attributions, and to have chosen this or that through some mental process” (631).
               With appositives, however, we seem to have so “fixed our attention upon the object
               that it has unfolded itself to us and suggested the attribution itself” (631). You
               can see how great a solution apposition might be to what is always for Wordsworth the
               problematically purposeful action of singling out. But I think the appositives do
               even more than that. </p>
               <p>Slakey quotes a grammarian, J. E. Conner: “‘in an appositive construction, the two
               apposed elements are [not additive but] identical in the sense that one is a
               substitute for the other’” (631). <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Slakey
                  includes “fair” in the list of appositives: “‘Fair’ is adjectival in form, yet it
                  has the same function as the words “Maid’ and ‘violet.’ It is an appositive, not a
                  modifier, of “She’” (634). </note> I agree that the elements are not additive, but
               substitution doesn’t seem right either, or not for this poem. That’s because
               substitution seems to privilege one name or phrase—conventionally the first—over the
               others which stand in for it. <title level="m">She dwelt</title> shows no such
               hierarchy. At the same time, however, the “halved” violet and the star’s solitude are
               skewed analogs, not interchangeable epithets. (Logically, it should have been either
               half a star, the other half obscured by cloud or some such thing; or, a lone violet.)
               So, if it’s not 1-<hi rend="bold">plus-</hi>1 (violet+star etc), and not 1-<hi rend="bold">or</hi>-1 (either/or, that is), then maybe Wordsworth’s appositives
               code for 1-<hi rend="bold">and</hi>-1. <emph>She</emph> and <emph>maid</emph> and
                  <emph>violet</emph> and <emph>star</emph> and <emph>Lucy</emph>. If that’s how it
               works, then we have to press on for the kind of identity obtaining among items in an
               appositive construction. Simply put, what does <emph>and</emph> mean if it doesn’t
               mean <emph>plus</emph>? </p>
               <p>The easiest answer is that the elements are identical in the sense that a pronoun is
               identical to the noun it references. I think that’s unlikely, though, not just due to
               the slippage between half a violet and solitary star, but because the in-your-face
               self-contradictory usage of quantifier pronouns in <title level="m">She dwelt</title>
               (none <hi rend="bold">and</hi> few; <hi rend="bold">un</hi>-known/<hi rend="bold">few</hi> could know) complicates what should be a direct mapping of pronoun onto
               noun. Could we say then that both pronouns and appositives have the same kind of
               identity with their object (and the same relation to each other) that we get between
               two proper names for the same referent? Let’s see.</p>
               <p>The textbook example of that is Phosphorus (morning star) and Hesperus (evening
               star), different names for the planet Venus. The example isn’t as random as it
               sounds: “Fair as a star when only one / Is shining in the sky!” Readers often see
               this as alluding to Venus in her two presentations and they use it to explore what
               kind of object Lucy is. I’d like to get at what kind of <emph>name</emph> Lucy is: or
               what it is that this particular poem means (in the sense of <emph>picks out</emph>
                  <hi rend="bold">)</hi> when it says <emph>Lucy</emph>. How does that relate to what’s
               picked out by <emph>she</emph>, <emph>maid</emph>, <emph>violet</emph>, and
                  <emph>star</emph>? And, what light does that throw on the structure and workings
               of singularity in this poem, especially as compared to others by Wordsworth? </p>
               <p>In analytic philosophy, the Hesperus/Phosphorus example is closely linked to Frege’s
               essay <title level="m">On Sense and Reference</title>, which defines each of those
               names as a “mode of presentation,” “definite description,” or “<emph>sense</emph>” of
               a shared referent, the planet, Venus. Each <emph>sense</emph> is said to
                  <emph>express</emph> its object, the expression carrying descriptive value. If
               this were not the case, saying “Hesperus is Venus” would be a meaningless identity
               statement (like, “x is x”). The reason the statement is informative is of course that
               the terms are <hi rend="bold">not</hi> interchangeable. You can’t say, “I saw
               Hesperus this morning”; or you could, but you would be wrong. And the fact that you
               would be wrong means not just that sense is informative but that it’s public and
               shareable, not a subjective idea about which we might disagree. All proper names are
               said to have senses but they need not have referents: <emph>Pegasus</emph> is Frege’s
               example. In such cases, we “stipulate” a referent (e.g., let Pegasus be the winged
               horse) and this becomes the de facto meaning of that presentational mode. We do
               this—stipulate reference—so as to “anchor [reference] amidst the transitory currents
               of sense” (Ashton 82) lest it become indeterminate. And of course, those of us who
               read, write, or write about fictions do this more, and also more self-consciously
               than other people. </p>
               <p>Frege’s descriptivist account tallies with our ordinary language use. Applied to
               Wordsworth’s poem, it smoothes out the attribution difference between violet and
               star. The half-hidden violet is determined by its visual incompleteness, the star by
               its solitude. Frege’s sense/meaning dyad turns this asymmetry into a simple analogy.
               The flower is specified by its spatial partiality, the star by its temporal
               partiality. Both senses reference Lucy, setting a clear agenda for the poetic eye,
               namely, to half-<emph>complete</emph> what it half-perceives, and by that action, to
               realize itself as well as its object. </p>
               <p>And yet, that schema—so satisfying for so many Wordsworth poems—feels stylistically
               off for <title level="m">She dwelt</title>, whose “mysterious object” seems located
               in “the imageless realm of the supra-human” (Ferguson 541), the realm of the
               Dickinson poem. (In this spirit, Slakey titles his essay “At Zero,” referencing the
               famous last line of Dickinson’s <title level="m">A narrow fellow in the
               grass</title>, i.e., “zero at the bone.”) There is that about the naming in <title level="m">She dwelt</title> which seems better served by Mill’s theory of names,
               the model against which Frege pushes. On Mill’s account, proper names are concrete
               but not connotative. “[M]erely distinguishing marks, [they are] given perhaps
               originally for a reason, but, when once given, [are] independent of it” (Stebbing 5).
               Thus conceived, proper names have no descriptive content; their meaning, as it were,
               is exhausted by their referent, just as the meaning of a label is simply the object
               to which it attaches—a case of direct reference, so-called. (Russell’s notion of
               direct reference is so strict that he limits proper names to those where the referent
               is present either through acquaintance [personal experience] or ostention [showing,
               deictic]. In other words, the only two bona fide proper names are <emph>I</emph> and
                  <emph>this</emph>. Everything else is a descriptive phrase in disguise.) Anyway,
               that kind of directness—Mill’s kind, or something like it, wherein the referent is
                  <emph>entailed</emph> by the name, or intrinsic to rather than indexed by or
               related to it—is, I believe, a common experience of this Lucy poem. And arguably the
               others as well; perhaps another reason we call them “the Lucy poems” when there are
               excellent reasons—bibliographic, textual, and biographical—not to. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Jones for this discussion. </note>
               </p>
               <p>Frege’s number theory adds another facet to the thinking of name in <title level="m">She dwelt</title> and to the thinking of <emph>one</emph> or the “singling out”
               process peculiar to this poem and perhaps others in the sequence. Here again, Frege
               pushes against Mill, this time, however, with Frege taking the idealist position
               against Mill’s empiricism. “Each of the numbers...,” writes Mill, “denotes physical
               phenomena, and connotes a physical property of those phenomena. Two, for instance,
               denotes all pairs of things, . . . connoting what makes them pairs.... What, then, is
               that which is connoted by a name of number? Of course some property belonging to the
               agglomeration of things which we call by the name; and that property is, the
               characteristic manner in which the agglomeration is made up of, and may be separated
               into, parts” (<title level="m">System of Logic</title> 164-165). Mill’s
               “characteristic manner” of composition (and thus his empiricist theory of number) is
               easily challenged. Here’s Frege: “Mill is, of course, quite right that two apples are
               physically different from three apples.... But are we to infer from this that their
               twoness or threeness is something physical?” (<title level="m">Foundations</title>
               32-33). He parries Mill by noting, “<emph>one</emph> pair of boots may be the same
               visible and tangible phenomenon as <emph>two</emph> boots” (33). He then tries on
               another theory: if not an abstraction from observed collections, maybe number results
               from the annexing of thing to thing. But how to define <emph>thing</emph> or
                  <emph>unit</emph> in the first place? He ventures another hypothesis: maybe a unit
               is such by virtue of the condition of being “self-contained and incapable of
               dissection” (43). But is there really anything that’s incapable of dissection; aren’t
               all units in theory, anyway, infinitely divisible and/or overlapping? And a more
               cogent objection, I should think, is that if we didn’t already recognize what a unit
               is, how could we tell if it was isolated or undivided—as it were, a star or a violet? </p>
               <p>Frege has us where he wants us, at the weak spot in both descriptive and
               psychological number theories: his last nail in the coffin is that “none of these can
               serve as a criterion for what we express by the word ‘one’” (58); “What will not work
               with 0 and 1 cannot be essential to the concept of number” (57).</p>
               <p>To get at that—the special cases of <emph>zero</emph> and <emph>one</emph>—Frege
               recasts the definitional exercise itself. Instead of asking what kind of thing number
               is, he asks what we mean when we use it. “When we make a statement of number, what is
               that of which we assert something?.... If I say ‘Venus has zero moons,’ there simply
               does not exist any moon or agglomeration of moons for anything to be asserted of; but
               what happens [he says] is that a property is assigned to the <emph>concept</emph>,
               ‘moon of Venus,’ namely that of including nothing under it” (59). How, though, to
               build a set with nothing in it, “<emph>nothing</emph>” being unavailable empirically?
               His answer: we perform a logical operation, a call for the set of all items that are
               not self-identical (in other words, where “<emph>A does-not-equal A”</emph>). Since
               everything is self-identical, there’s only one item in the set “<emph>A
                  does-not-equal-A</emph>.” I repeat: that set contains just <emph>one</emph>
               item—and it is <emph>zero</emph>. In other words, we’re now in possession not just of
                  <emph>zero</emph> but of <emph>one</emph>. We have logically constructed both
               those numbers. Precisely what, then, do we possess in the case of number? Frege
               answers, “number is neither spatial and physical...nor yet subjective, like ideas”
               (38). Like color, he says, number is “independent of our sensation, intuition and
               imagination, and of all construction of mental pictures out of memories of earlier
               sensations” (36). In number, we have an item that is “non-sensible and
               objective...[its] objectivity...based...only, so far as I can see, on reason” (38). I
               quote: “[A] statement of number expresses something factual independent of our way of
               regarding things...” (60). Frege notes that we can actually hear that factual status
               when instead of saying “Saturn has 4 moons,” we say, “the number of moons of Saturn
               is 4.” I think we also hear it when a little girl, asked to count her brothers and
               sisters, says, “We are seven.” </p>
               <p>“In 1,” Frege writes, “we have a proper name, which as such does not admit of a
               plural any more than ‘Frederick the Great’ or ‘the chemical element gold’ (49). “When
               we speak of ‘the number one,’ we indicate by means of the definite article a definite
               and unique object of scientific study. There are not divers number ones” (49). For
               this reason, Frege argues, it is impossible to define number as sets or collections,
               or “as units, or as 1 and 1 and 1”; for “if ‘and’ is used as in ‘Bunsen and
               Kirchhof,’ then 1 and 1 and 1 is not 3 but one, just as gold and gold and gold is
               never anything but gold; the plus symbol...must, therefore, be interpreted
               differently from the ‘and’ which we use in symbolizing a collection or a ‘collective
               idea’” (50). With “the chemical element gold,” Frege invites comparisons between
               numbers and the grammatical form of the non-count noun.</p>
               <p>This takes us back to my earlier question regarding “she and maid and violet and star
               and Lucy”: what does <emph>and</emph> mean if not <emph>plus</emph>? Does each
                  <emph>one</emph> (noun, pronoun, proper name) reference a common object either in
               or outside the text—like cloves stuck in an orange each from a different angle? Does
               the language build or project a composite <emph>one</emph>—what Badiou calls “a
               count-as-one”—from the several instances? I think we can agree that the special
               difficulty of this poem is that it disallows both those accounts—mimetic and
               constructivist—and it also rules out the transactional semiotics which readers of
               Wordsworth have come to expect. This Lucy poem projects an absolute co-incidence of
               word and thing, not a coupling of the two brokered by convention or by a reflective
               consciousness either hovering over the text, weaving its diverse threads into whole
               cloth, or, more frequent in Wordsworth, parachuting into its narrative frame. </p>
               <p>My picture of the relation between <emph>ones</emph> and <emph>one</emph> in <title level="m">She dwelt</title> would look something like Duchamp’s <title level="m">Nude Descending a Staircase #2</title>, a picture that calls up and in the same
               stroke cancels out the analogy to film animation—cancels it out, because contracting
               the recurrent into the continuous and the many into the one is exactly what does
                  <emph>not</emph> happen in the painting. Each riser on the staircase brings forth
               a new mark, a new name, not indexing but <emph>instantiating</emph> the referent
               “nude descending a staircase.” We do not have one continuous meaning dragged along
               from step to step, or projected back before the first step and beyond the last step
               in the series. This nude has no memory. She begins—<emph>is beginning</emph>, more
                  like—<emph>again and again</emph>. Like the x in a mathematical expression, each
               image signifies the formal function of reference itself. (And isn’t it apt,
               gorgeously ironically apt, to use a nude—a nude <emph>woman</emph>—to figure a
               function rather than a content?) What’s crucial to see, however, is that even as each
               image—again, each x in the equation of the picture—signifies the formal function of
               reference (that’s what x’s <hi rend="bold">do</hi>), the value of each and every mark
               is utterly determined (Frege would say, <emph>stipulated</emph>) by its context. For
               instance, in <emph>3x+ 1=7</emph>, x can only be 2. In other words, in some nearly
               imponderable way, we get recurrence of reference <hi rend="bold">and</hi> baptismal
               naming with each mark, each step of Duchamp’s nude, each Lucy noun, pronoun,
               appositive, and name. The reference is in each case intrinsic and inalienable,
               entailed or effected by each mark, not “related” to it in some way that could change.
               Using Frege’s terms, we could say that each mark discovers a new sense of its
               referent: where “sense” is not a point of view, an experience, or an imitation, but
               “an intellectual recreation.” </p>
               <p>I take that phrase from Stein (and also, “beginning again and again” (313), from
               “Composition as Explanation”). I get the analogy to “x in a mathematical
               expression”—a brilliant comparison—from Ashton (<title level="m">Modernism</title>,
               87). <note place="foot" resp="editors"> My entire line of thought here is
                  indebted to Ashton (“Rose is a Rose” and “Gertrude Stein for Anyone”). </note> In
               “Poetry and Grammar,” Stein links naming, nouns, and loving the noun, to poetry. (She
               defines prose in terms of balance at the level of the sentence and paragraph, and
               links it to the verb.) Not all nouns can sponsor poetry, only a noun whose meaning is
               or has become <emph>entailed</emph> by its name, in the way I just described. Most
               nouns have gone over so wholly to their generic object—have become, as Stein says
               “the name of anything,” as in, “any” cat, dog, tree—that they have lost their
               possibility of being something: of being <emph>this</emph> cat, dog, tree. What
               they’ve lost is their active and inalienable attachment to their bearer, and in
               consequence, they have lost their grammatical liveliness and delicacy. Who could love
               such a noun—and in Stein’s view, that’s what poetry <emph>is</emph>, loving a name,
               and because one loves it, “using losing refusing and pleasing and betraying and
               caressing” it (327). </p>
               <p>The reason Stein likes pronouns so much is that they wear their referential function
               on their sleeve, as is proper for lieutenants. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> I owe the activation of “lieutenant”s 
                  etymology to Rebecca Porte (see third
                  paragraph, above). </note> They “stand in,” and they make us see their standing,
               see the place they stand, and see their unique value or identity in that place, every
               time we look at them. (In this, they are not unlike the <emph>zero</emph> which
               enables positional notation.) They “acquire the logical function of the proper name
               each time [they] appear.... The reference is concentrated in each instance of the
               word, rendering it an autonomous, self-same entity” (Ashton, “Rose” 594, 595). </p>
               <p>The appositives, pronouns, determiners, and proper name in <title level="m">She
                  dwelt</title> (and certainly also in <title level="m">A slumber did my spirit
                  seal</title>) do feel like entities, autonomous and selfsame. But so do the proper
               names in very different poems, such as <title level="m">Michael</title>, <title level="m">Simon Lee</title>, and many others. In fact, consider the striking
               number of poems in the corpus that are eponymously titled, either by Wordsworth or by
               scholarly convention: not just <title level="m">Michael</title> and <title level="m">Simon Lee</title>, but <title level="m">Alice Fell</title>, <title level="m">Louisa</title>, the <title level="m">Matthew</title> poems, and others (along
               with such quasi-proper names as <title level="m">The Solitary Reaper</title>, <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title>, <title level="m">The Old Cumberland
                  Beggar</title>, <title level="m">The Discharged Soldier</title>). Moreover, many
               of the common nouns in those poems also feel <emph>entailed</emph>. Think of the
               sheepfold, the tree stump, the cloak, the wooden dipper, the weathercock. You almost
               feel as if you could pick up that dipper or stand beside that sheepfold and each
               would speak its story. But think again. All these objects start out as <emph>a</emph>
               so-and-so, article indefinite. Only by poem’s end has the object acquired the
                  <emph>the</emph>, the definite article. (Borrowing from Stein, only by the end has
               the poem meshed “character and career” [Stein, quoted in Ashton, “Rose” 584]). It is,
               of course, the narrator’s and the poem’s labor of relating the tale that ends up
               relating meaning to each noun and pronoun within it. Much of the force and all of the
               drama of these poems derives from the active encounter between an object and “an
               experiencing subject—any dog will do—to remember and identify [it]” (Ashton, “Rose”
               602). “Beside the brook / Appears a straggling heap of unhewn stone! / And to that
               simple object appertains / A story . . . .” Wordsworth gives no clearer statement of
               his referential practice—his poetics, really. It’s all there in the verb,
                  <emph>appertains</emph>. </p>
               <p>“I am I because my little dog knows me” is how Stein formulates “identity” in <title level="m">The Geographical History of America, or The Relation of Human Nature to
                  the Human Mind</title> and <title level="m">What Are Master-Pieces and Why Are
                  There So Few of Them</title> (355, 402). And that is just how it works in <title level="m">Michael</title>, <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title>, and the
               others I mentioned: Michael, Margaret, the “four naked walls that star[e] upon each
               other”—they are they, discrete entities, because a narrator remembers and identifies
               them. <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <p rend="noCount"> Apropos the other proper name in the poem, springs of Dove,
                     Hartman suggests that the reference is “not [to] the river which divides Derby
                     from Stafford, but the district of Dovedale, Westmorland, below Dove Crag—a
                     region which the poet had explored during his Hawkshead vacation of 1788”
                     (136-137). He quotes from the 1850 <title level="m">Prelude</title>: “That
                     streamlet whose blue current works its way / Between romantic Dovedale’s spiry
                     rocks” (Slakey 137).</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">In a private correspondence, Tim Fulford offered the following:
                     “What I wondered about the other proper name in the poem was that Wordsworth’s
                     phrasing gestures towards/assumes local knowledge—as if he doesn’t need to
                     specify it as the river Dove, because we’d all already know where/what it is.
                     Obviously, he does this a lot in poems with Lake District place names—but this
                     one isn’t very specific (unlike, say, Helvellyn)—and so it tantalises; it seems
                     almost deixical but we can’t point to it—  which Dove, where? There’s one in
                     the Lakes, another in Yorkshire, a famous one in Derbyshire . . .    There are
                     many rivers of that name in England . . . many ‘ones’ as you’d put it . . .  
                     so the name almost seems generic, but can’t quite be that either—unless Lucy is
                     also generic . . .     It’s as if it hovers between deixis and genericism. I
                     feel a little jolt of uncertainty or inadequacy as I read/hear it. How to
                     construe? as if for a flicker the springs of Dove might not be a stream but the
                     flight of a bird . . . ; I suppose on the one hand the ambiguity/unfixability
                     creates the aura of mystery the poem wants . . . but on the other it calls
                     naming and the knowledge naming provides into doubt . . . ” I wonder if Stein’s
                     entity/identity distinction (and Ashton’s distinction between meanings entailed
                     versus indexed or related) helps us structure this “almost deixical”
                     naming.</p>
                  </note> And of course, we are we—becoming fully ourselves, becoming
                  <emph>humanized</emph>—as our reading inscribes us in that dramatic recognizance. </p>
               <p>That’s so much <emph>not</emph> what happens in the Lucy poems, where the name takes
               on the characteristics of <emph>entity</emph>, Stein’s opposite number to
                  <emph>identity</emph>. In the Lucy poems, everything works to abstract the name
               from any kind of lived continuum, any kind of history, any scene of recognition. It’s
               not that those contexts, content, and relationships go missing, rather that they seem
               to get drawn up into the name, like the forest pools in the Robert Frost poem, that
               go wholly into leaf, into the bordering trees. Merely by saying the name—she, violet,
               star, Lucy—one seems to blossom a world. </p>
               <p>The names that we love—that we love to say over and over without getting bored—belong
               to that category; they are <emph>entities</emph>. For Stein, such names are “the
               proper object of poetry.” “Anybody knows how anybody calls out the name of anybody
               one loves” (314, 327, 329). I’ll wind this up with a genre thought, turning to
               Jonathan Culler’s discussion of lyric (he makes <title level="m">Spring Pools</title>
               his example; hence my borrowing, above). Culler ties the special temporality of lyric
               to its “calling,” or as he says, its defining “call to be calling” (“Why Lyric?”
               204), evidenced (or effected) by hyperbole and much more so by apostrophe. Quoting
               from Culler now: “Nothing need happen [in a lyric poem] because the poem itself is to
               be the happening.... The clearest example of this structure is of course the elegy”
               (“Apostrophe,” 149-150). In other words, it is the lyric’s <emph>eventual</emph>
               status, its status as an event of simultaneous cancellation and conjuration, which
               makes its structures, unlike those of narrative, untranslatable. It is, I believe,
               the <emph>entailment</emph> of meaning in name, or noun, or word, or poem, which
               intuitively signals <emph>lyric</emph> to us. What my thoughts here may possibly add
               to that general or ideal(ist) model of lyric (against which historical poetics
               pushes) are angles on the nature of the singularity that is conjured by the form, and
               angles too on the structure of the fantasy behind that singular sense. By
                  <emph>fantasy</emph>, I mean that the proper name—the <emph>one</emph>, the
               singularity—set forth by lyric unleashes a dream of individuation or determination
               without negation: a <emph>something</emph> that is not over against
                  <emph>nothing</emph>, not over against <emph>anything</emph>, and not over against
                  <emph>everything</emph>. A singularity that feels self-grounded, as in,” the
               presentation of presentation itself” (Badiou’s definition of “being qua being”). </p>
               <p>Obviously, it’s not that, not any of those dream things. To read in this way, to feel
               the poem as fully lyric, fully worded, self-same and autonomous, requires the kind of
               formalization I’ve been doing and describing here. I hope to hear from you whether
               and why you might agree or disagree that there are reasons to do this, or do it now,
               just as nearly thirty years ago there were reasons to do the opposite.
                  <emph>Then</emph>, to wrest the word from its abstractions—to single out the
               poetic word—required re-inserting it into a lived continuum: the domain of reference,
               of recognition, of <emph>identity</emph> by Stein’s usage, as distinct from
                  <emph>entity</emph>. “—But there’s a Tree, of many, one, / A single Field which I
               have looked upon, / Both of them speak of something that is gone.” Not
                  “<emph>a</emph>” tree, I proposed, but “<emph>the</emph>” tree, Tree of Liberty,
               planted not in “<emph>a</emph>” field but in “<emph>the</emph>” Field, Champs du
               Mars, circa 1789. The “something” that is gone is, or was, the Revolution in its
               republican phase, and with it, Wordsworth’s joy in that spontaneous overflow of
               powerful feeling, upsurge of collective energy. </p>
               <p>Maybe it’s as simple as the windshield conundrum; you know how it is, how you can
               never see it, see the glass, see the <emph>smudge</emph> on the glass, while you’re
               looking through it at the road. One makes a choice. I want to say that in some cases,
               such as the Lucy poems, the glass itself invites one kind of viewing or it
               discourages the other. But I don’t say this because anyone would have said the same
               thing about the <title level="m">Immortality Ode</title>, or <title level="m">Tintern
                  Abbey</title>, or the many other poems released into time by historicist
               methods—or, put another way, <emph>singled out</emph> by desire, discourse, and
                  <emph>différance</emph>. I suppose what I’ve been about here, in this talk, is a
               sifting and sorting, an effort to get at the different kinds of things we pick out
               when we say or see or construct a <emph>one</emph>. </p>

               <p>When the MLA’s Division on the English Romantic Period called in 2011 for papers on
               Romantic Number(s), we hoped to register and promote several new lines of inquiry in
               romanticism and in the humanities more broadly. We hoped the panel discussion might
               reckon with any or all of the following: older and newer logics of “matching” and
               “counting” and “measuring” (whether statistical, geometric, or otherwise
               un/calculable); what seems to be a broader Spinozan turn (itself indebted partly to
               Gilles Deleuze and Alain Badiou), not least in emergent accounts of “life” and
               “morphology” (see—among many sources—Frances Ferguson’s, Timothy Morton’s, and
               Marjorie Levinson’s recent work); challenges to Euclidean projections of/onto spatial
               order (both in the romantic period and in recent theorization, including Bruno
               Latour’s work); the impulse to rethink such categories as “bodies,” “multitudes,”
               “subjectivity” along different axes. (Here one might invoke—in addition to Deleuze
               and Hardt and Negri—Frances Ferguson’s <emph>Pornography: The Theory</emph> as one
               index of this turn: a rethinking of Benthamite calculuses as mechanisms for making
               subjects newly perceptible, in ways not always registered by Foucauldian analysis.)
               We hoped we might register as well such diverse phenomena as the resurgent interest
               in Malthusian population problematics and the revivified inquiries into metrics,
               prosody, and what Leigh Hunt called “numerous verse.”</p>
               <p>The response to our initial CFP was in fact so overwhelming—in both quantity and
               quality—that we were moved to propose a special second session under the Romantic
               Number(s) rubric. The work in these two "sets" of essays—occasioned by and developed
               since those panels—both answers and productively complicates our initial call for
               reflections on Romantic Number(s). We would not have anticipated, for example, a turn
               to formal-language theory (as witnessed in Levinson’s essay here) nor a turn to
               phrenology (see John Savarese). Certainly many possible lines of inquiry go unpursued
               in what follows here; and sharp-eyed readers will note a lack of
               quantitatively-oriented <emph>method</emph> (if not <emph>discourse</emph>) in what
               follows. So be it. Our panelists offered remarkable presentations at the 2012 MLA and
               they have revised them into the richly textured essays presented here. We offer these
               "sets" as provocations hopefully good to think with, as registrations of some current
               thinking, and as goads for new—and perhaps radically different—work. And we thank as
               well the Divisional Committee on the English Romantic Period for their conceptual and
               institutional élan, Romantic Circles Praxis Series editor Orrin Wang for his
               intellectual camaraderie and his astute shepherding of this volume, and the anonymous
               reader of these galleries for his/her trenchant and timely comments on all essays. We
               are also grateful to Site Manager Dave Rettenmaier and his team at Romantic Circles.
               Such a venture, in its communal and fortifying exchange, has helped dispel (at least
               for this editor/commentator) whatever remains of the romantic ideology of “the one,”
               singular, scholarly isolato.</p>

               <p>I will take as an epigraph and perhaps an epitaph for this "set" of essays a question
               from Frege’s <title level="m">Foundations of Arithmetic</title>, courtesy of Marjorie
               Levinson: “When we make a statement of number, what is that of which we assert
               something?”</p>
               <p>Of romantic number: what is that of which our essayists have asserted something?</p>
               <p> As a preliminary reflection on this first "set" of essays, and as an algorithmic
               operation performed on our essayists’ vocabularies, I offer here <ref target="#wordClouds">three word clouds</ref>, derived from each paper, followed by
               the mega- (or meta-)word cloud, the set of all sets (to invoke Wickman’s and
               Levinson’s turns to set theory, Bertrand Russell in particular): The Panel Word
               Cloud. (See <ref target="#wordClouds">Appendix</ref> for all word clouds.) As these
               word clouds suggest, Wickman, Levinson, and Brooke-Smith highlight some points of
               intersection and divergence in their consideration of romantic number.</p>
               <p>Wickman and Brooke-Smith differently explore in their papers the relations between
               literature and geometry—viz. the status of geometry as a “national language” for the
               Scots (in Wickman), or the way Wordsworth (in Brooke-Smith) offers in his “dream
               vision of the survival of poetry and geometry, as represented by the allegorical
               figures of a shell and a stone” an “allegory of remediation.” So too these papers
               offer striking excavations (archaeologies, we might say) of conceptual preconditions
               and grids—as in the way geometry offers eighteenth-century thinkers a route out of
               the “ontological confusion” produced by “[a]lgebraic innovations,” “compensating
               visually for technical failures of calculation” (in Wickman’s account), or in the
               “media-less media theory” emergent in Brooke-Smith’s Wordsworth and Babbage. Drawing
               on formal language theory, Levinson frames a discussion of “number” (in Wordsworth,
               but by implication, not only) in terms of “name,” via the philosophy of reference.
               This is a new formalism, we might say, wholly other than the new formalism with which
               many romanticists might feel well acquainted. Brooke-Smith gives us a new medialism.
               Set theory makes its appearance in Wickman’s and Levinson’s inquiries—their work
               differently inflected by a genealogy running from Spinoza to the mathematician Georg
               Cantor to Deleuze and Badiou. </p>
               <p>What is the set of romanticism and number? Of romantic numbers?</p>
               <p>The word clouds suggest some provisional answers: the set of romantic number(s)
               includes Scottish geometry; Scott’s Badiou; many kinds of equations, problems, and
               operations; great webs; proper nouns; dream patterns; Wordsworth’s world; proper
               mathematical media. Numbers invoked include Zero, One, Two, a Million. (That these
               are not the same kind of number, that these invoke extremely different frames of
               reference, Levinson makes plain.) We encounter multitudes and singularities. An
               inquiry into romantic number has brought our essayists to consider number, measure,
               name, and medium. And so, in the spirit of their ranging inquiries, I will briefly
               turn to another lesson in number, measure, name and medium: offered by that great
               postromantic cohort, The Jackson Five—whose very name suggests a numbered
               singularity: <hi rendition="#underline">
                     <emph>The</emph>

               <p>I direct you to their 1970 hit, “ABC,” viewable/audible on YouTube in several
               iterations—not least their appearance on <ref target="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho7796-au8U#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho7796-au8U">Dick Clark</ref>. (Or see <ref target="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9hQIrsHaS4#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9hQIrsHaS4">this</ref> for a fuzzier version of the performance, with the words helpfully
               subtitled over the video.)</p>
               <p>Consider the lyrics of the chorus: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>A-B-C . . </l>
                        <l>Easy as 1-2-3</l>
                        <l>Or simple as Do-Re-Mi </l>
                        <l>A-B-C</l>
                        <l>1-2-3</l>
                        <l>Baby you and me, girl!</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> In “ABC,” we encounter number as series—both finite and infinite
               series: ABC pointing to the finite series of the alphabet; 1-2-3 to the infinite set
               of real numbers; Do-Re-Mi to the notionally finite tones of the octave of a diatonic
               major scale. In the 4/4 pop meter of the song, the series become functionally
               equivalent sets: A-B-C = 1-2-3 = Do-Re-Mi = YOU AND ME. Items in a series, these sets
               are nonetheless bound and accounted for by the song’s rhythm, each series grouping
               working with (albeit syncopatedly) a 4/4 pattern, and each set consisting internally
               of three phonemes: <quote>A-B-C = 1-2-3 = Do-Re-Mi = YOU AND ME</quote> These serial
               sets point, we might say, to an erotic and phonemic surplus governed by musical
               measure: Baby you and me, girl!</p>
               <p>In the Jackson Five’s “ABC” we have an infectious pedagogy of accounting—in which
               series is converted to, and comes out of, structure: out of the alphabet, the set of
               real numbers, the <emph>solfège</emph> of the octave. Each series is meant to point
               to a single set, to a conceptual unity: the alphabet, real numbers, the scale, erotic
               union. </p>
               <p>I invoke The Jackson Five’s “ABC” because their song raises and rephrases, in another
               medial key, the questions preoccupying these essays: how to get from series to
               totality? To the One? Is “romantic number” a route to new forms, new questions, new
               horizons? Or a recapitulation of old transcendentalizations?</p>
               <p>Wickman’s Galt’s geometry is a wholly other thing than Brooke-Smith’s Wordsworth’s
               phantasmatic Euclidean geometry, yet “geometry” in both papers raises the question of
               reckoning with wholes and with complexity. In Brooke-Smith’s Wordsworth, for example,
               we find poetry and mathematics proposed as two routes to totality. Are these
               geometries merely figural? Do they perform actually mathematical and philosophical
               work? As Wickman notes, “Romantic-era numbers, even statistics and simple arithmetic,
               were effectively tropological constructs. Two plus two equaled a red, red rose.”</p>
               <p>These papers invite us to reflect: is the turn to number, and to mathematics—both in
               these essays and more broadly in our discipline—a rebuke to recent modes of
               historicism, a triumph of a different kind of formalism, and/or a way of submitting
               the historical to the askesis of a much longer, perhaps species durée? And/or might
               these mathematical turns, both in the romantic period and our own, be themselves
               historicized in productive fashion? </p>
               <p>Wickman directs us through Galt’s <title level="m">Annals</title> and Badiou to the
               problem of the One—“the irreducible complexity of the world, prompting intellectuals
               to seek a new basis on which to order experience.” The collective work of these
               essays suggests to me that romanticists, like many scholars, are increasingly
               interested less in the production of knowledges than in the logic of emergent
               complexity. We see in Levinson’s and Brooke-Smith’s papers sharp meditations on
               measure and number, recurrence relations, the possible scaling up of the world. As
               Brooke-Smith writes, juxtaposing Wordsworth’s and Babbage’s projects, “Like
               Wordsworth’s dream vision, Babbage’s thought experiment contains at its center an
               image of fractal organization: the spiral of the shell-poem and the exfoliating
               algorithm of the difference engine both repeat the same pattern at different levels
               of scale and complexity.”</p>
               <p>An awareness of emergent complexity (what Brooke-Smith calls “emergent patterns of
               organization”) prompts in some thinkers (romantic-era and now) a resistance to
               totalization and even to formalization: this is one way to understand Wickman’s
               productively resistant Galt. Wickman’s essay suggests that while Scott’s prose
               fictions might be converted into (and reliant upon) equations, Galt’s fiction eludes
               such calculability and formalization: “In <title level="m">Waverley</title>, national
               culture is the effect of narrative closure, the product of a classical equation in
               which 1 + 1 = 1: Edward Waverley plus Rose—two characters—equals one estate; England
               plus Scotland—two nations—equals one Britain. Galt, however, complicates this
               equation by adding narrative elements that, in great webs of <emph>narrative</emph>
               reciprocities, never wholly resolve themselves into one.” </p>
               <p>And so we are moved in these essays from Galt’s refusal of “one” (of a premature
               totalization) to Babbage’s difference engine to Levinson’s Gertrude Stein: Stein who
               wrote in <title level="m">Tender Buttons</title>: “The difference is spreading”
               (313). And Oh, the difference engine to me!—and to you: baby you and me, girl.</p>
               <p>Wickman offers us, via Badiou, a vision of Romanticism as the great evental
               subtraction: Scott’s narrators, and by extension lyrically sublime egos, Napoleonic
               colossi, and other romantic phenomena, emerge as the fabulously achieved product of a
               subtracting and abstracting operation. “[O]ne might say that the narrator of <title level="m">Waverley</title> initiates a kind of event by subtracting himself from
               the chaos of experience (and from the ‘great web’ of national and picaresque tales)
               and thus converts a welter of aleatory occurrences and character types into a legible
               ordering of history, a grand narrative of the etiology of modern Britain.” In
               Wickman’s account we get a sense of the latent radical potential in Scott’s
               historical arithmetic—“despite Scott’s reputation for ideological conservatism.” Here
               Wickman’s account of Scott aligns intriguingly with Lukács’s and with more recent
               inquiries into Scott, notably James Chandler’s and Ian Duncan’s. </p>
               <p>Wickman’s excursion into Badiou’s subtracting operations raises a number of
               questions, not least: Are subjects of history sums or remainders? </p>
               <p>Levinson might be seen to answer this question, at least for Wordsworth’s “She Dwelt
               Among The Untrodden Ways.” As she notes in her intricate reading of the poem,
               conventional readings of “She Dwelt” often note how “it brings forth a
                  <emph>one</emph> remaindered by the labor of <emph>ascesis</emph>.” Yet this
                  <emph>one</emph> is also specifically <emph>produced</emph>, in her account:
                  “<emph>one</emph> aris[es] from a trio of naming functions: namely, apposition,
               pronominal substitution, and the proper name.”</p>

               <p>After reading Levinson on <emph>one</emph> as itself perhaps a proper name, we might
               return to Wallace Stevens, with his own caressed and salvaged vocabularies, his
               ceaseless inquiry into “naming functions.” In “The Man on the Dump,” Stevens offers a
               degraded series, emptied postromantic contents: <quote>

               <p>In a well-known passage from the 1822 novel <title level="m">Annals of the
                  Parish</title>, John Galt’s first-person narrator, the Reverend Micah Balwhidder,
               composes a paradoxical sentence in which he describes a world eluding his grasp, and
               thus at some level comprehends a situation he claims not to understand. Rehearsing
               his reflections of the year 1808, he tells us that his fictitious community of
               Dalmailing in rural western Scotland has already felt the steep costs of “the
               American war” as well as “the present just and necessary contest” with France (<title level="m">Annals</title> 179); what is more, with the building of a new
               cotton-mill and the establishment of a new town which houses this mill, he and his
               parishioners have engaged “so much with concerns of trade, that [they have] become a
               part of the <emph>great web</emph> of commercial reciprocities, and [feel] in [their]
               corner and extremity every touch or stir that [is] made on any part of the texture”
               (180). Such webs, of course, are ubiquitous in the modern world; they hypostatize the
               complexity of global systems in which no community is fully autonomous because each
               is part of a vast network, every corner bearing on some other. What is more, the
               pulsations to this network are so numerous and rapid, deriving from so many
               butterflies batting their proverbial wings, that nobody can fully account for it.</p>
               <p>The puzzle emerges when we attempt to reckon with that for which we professedly
               cannot account. Even if it were possible for us to number the filaments of the “great
               web” to which Balwhidder refers, there is, as Arjun Appadurai reminds us, “an
               inherent temporal lag between the processes of [what we call] globalization and our
               efforts to contain them conceptually” (Appadurai 4). Balwhidder’s wisdom here, such
               as it is, consists in knowing that he knows nothing and documenting his own
               comparative blur: “As I come towards the events of these latter days, I am surprised
               to find myself not at all so distinct in my recollection of them, as in those of the
               first of my ministry” (<title level="m">Annals</title> 183). Indeed, his purpose in
               writing is to capture this sense of acceleration: he wishes “to testify to posterity
               anent [or about] the great changes that have happened in [his] day and generation—a
               period which all the best informed writers say, has not had its match in the history
               of the world since the beginning of time” (183). This remark seems to belong to Galt
               as much as to Balwhidder, for it evokes not only a group of influential Scottish
               Enlightenment literati, particularly the stadial theorists descending intellectually
               from Adam Smith (whose work culminates, of course, with the great treatise on
               “commercial reciprocities,” <title level="m">The Wealth of Nations</title>) to Dugald
               Stewart (who coins the phrase “conjectural history”), but also Galt’s contemporary
               Walter Scott, who in his popular historical fiction was attempting to lend these
               changes narrative form. In his famous “Postscript, which should have been a Preface”
               in <title level="m">Waverley</title> (1814), Scott asserts that “[t]here is no
               European nation which, within the course of half a century, or little more, has
               undergone so complete a change as th[e] kingdom of Scotland” (Scott 340) referring
               specifically to the deterioration of the clan system, “the abolition of the heritable
               jurisdictions of the Lowland nobility and barons,” the “total eradication of the
               Jacobite party,” and the “gradual influx of wealth, and extension of commerce,
               [which] have since united to render the present people of Scotland a class of beings
               as different from their grandfathers, as the existing English are from those of Queen
               Elizabeth’s time” (340). Invoking a logic of uneven development, Scott attributes
               more than two centuries of change to a scant two generations—a mere sixty years—in
               Scotland, particularly the Highlands.</p>
               <p>And yet, unlike Balwhidder, Scott purports to be able to grasp these developments in
               their complexity if only because “the change, though steadily and rapidly
               progressive, has, nevertheless, been gradual” (Scott 340). At one level, Balwhidder
               concurs: “The regular course of nature is calm and orderly, and tempests and troubles
               are but lapses from the accustomed sobriety with which Providence works out the
               destined end of all things” (Galt 71), or the narrative closure which <title level="m">Waverley</title>, for example, seems to provide. Hence, while Balwhidder
               registers “the great concern” he and his parish “all began to take in the American
               rebellion” in the year 1775, he also recognizes that “throughout the better half of
               the year” the parish had “but little molestation of any sort” (71). The complexity
               for Balwhidder consists not so much in the rate of change as in the virtually
               incalculable range of factors motivating it. One can document the beginning and end
               of the war, but the qualitative difference in the region’s <emph>genius loci</emph>
               was something else. “[S]aving the building of the cotton-mill and the beginning of
               Cayenneville” around it, “nothing more memorable happened in” the year 1788; “still,
               it was nevertheless a year of a great activity. The minds of men were excited to new
               enterprises; a new genius, as it were, had descended upon the earth, and there was an
               erect and outlooking spirit abroad that was not to be satisfied with the taciturn
               regularity of ancient affairs” (118). Hence, Balwhidder feels he can only relate the
               “consequences” rather than the causes of this brave new world (180).</p>
               <p>This returns us to the puzzle to which we refer above, Balwhidder’s comprehension of
               incomprehension (the fact that he knows nothing, the Socratic basis of wisdom).
               “[T]he best-informed writers” claim that the “great changes that have happened in
               [Balwhidder’s] day and generation . . . ha[ve] not had [their] match in the history
               of the world since the beginning of time” (183). If this is literally true, then no
               account, stadial or otherwise, could fully explain it since such an account would
               speak only to stages of the world in process of perpetual antiquation. But if the
               claim of these “best-informed writers” is an exaggeration, then it simply indicates
               the delusional state of Enlightenment theorists who are unable to explain the world
               of which they are part. In other words, the world is either too complex to lend
               itself to a definitive analysis, or else the world might avail itself to the right
               model but we are simply ill-equipped to formulate it. I know that I know nothing
               either because the world is unknowable or else because I myself happen to be
               incapable of such knowledge.</p>
               <p>Galt’s “great web of commercial reciprocities,” making “felt in [his] corner and
               extremity [of Scotland] every touch or stir that was made on any part of the [global]
               texture” is thus an index of the changes occurring in Balwhidder’s parish and also a
               self-consciously confounding rebus that defies its own solution (180). In
               mathematical terms, it comprises something like the problematic set of all sets made
               famous by Bertrand Russell in 1910—a paradox that undermined an early variant of set
               theory and, with it, certain ideas pertaining to the foundation of mathematics.
               Russell’s paradox presents a set defined as a set of all sets that are not members of
               themselves. If such a set does not contain itself, it contradicts its own definition;
               if it does contain itself, it violates its own condition (see Link 1-6). In like
               measure, Balwhidder’s web “contains” the world, including the Enlightenment theorists
               who supposedly explicate that world to us (inasmuch as they are part of it), without
               containing its own explanation. To that extent, Galt’s “great web,” his set of all
               sets, cannot count itself among its own elements. For that matter, this web does not
               even apply to the bulk of Galt’s narrative, describing merely one annum among others,
               one multiple among others. Most of these individual chapters possess a very different
               tone: “the most memorable thing that befell among my people [in 1763] was the burning
               of the lint-mill” (23); 1777 “may well be called the year of the heavy heart, for we
               had sad tidings of the lads that went away as soldiers to America” (80); 1783 “was
               another Sabbath year of my ministry. It has left me nothing to record, but a silent
               increase of prosperity in the parish. I myself had now in the bank more than a
               thousand pounds, and everything was thriving around” (102). Hence, in Galt’s <title level="m">Annals</title>, the set of all sets is not only illogical in excluding a
               portion of itself but it is also part of a narrative that is larger than itself, and
               thus is something other than what it purports to be. The stickiest web in the <title level="m">Annals</title> is the fact that this web “is” only on condition that it
               also “is not.”</p>
               <p>It was narrative puzzles like these that seemed to Galt to limit the authority of
               Scott’s Waverley novels. I mention Scott here because what Ian Duncan calls Scott’s
               shadow loomed large for Galt (see Duncan 215-20). He even refused to call <title level="m">Annals of the Parish</title> a novel, referring to it instead as a
               “theoretical history,” as “a kind of treatise on the history of society,” and as a
               “fable.” Balwhidder’s fictitious parish of Dalmailing was meant to be metonymic of a
               much larger global sphere—a sphere which it nevertheless could not or would not name,
               not entirely. Galt imagined the <title level="m">Annals</title>, P. H. Scott remarks,
               “not [as the] history of an actual place, but of an imaginary one which could
               nevertheless be taken as typical of a whole society” (P. H. Scott 32). This for Galt
               is what differentiated Balwhidder from many of Scott’s narrators and Dalmailing from,
               say, the Bradwardine estate in <title level="m">Waverley</title>. The latter serves
               as the site of a union between the novel’s English protagonist and a Scottish heiress
               of modest means and thus exemplifies a symbolic merger of nations. In <title level="m">Waverley</title>, national culture is the effect of narrative closure,
               the product of a classical equation in which 1 + 1 = 1: Edward Waverley plus Rose—two
               characters—equals one estate; England plus Scotland—two nations—equals one Britain.
               Galt, however, complicates this equation by adding narrative elements that, in great
               webs of <emph>narrative</emph> reciprocities, never wholly resolve themselves into
               one. For example, Balwhidder marries, but his wife dies; he marries again, and she
               dies again; he marries a third time, but with little thematic consequence. (He fixes
               upon a widow, “the relic of a Professor in the University of Glasgow.” At a table
               where she and Balwhidder are seated together, a friend puts the wing of a hen on both
               their plates and quips that “there have been greater miracles than these two wings
               flying together” [Galt 141-42]. After the marriage, little more is said of her.
               Hence, in the <title level="m">Annals</title>, Balwhidder’s relationships—1 + 1 +
               1—equal some fragmentary and un-<title level="m">Waverley</title>-like multiple.)
               Meanwhile, Balwhidder’s narrative imbricates diverse rhetorical forms (memoir,
               sentimental tableau, theoretical history) without establishing an overarching
               representational logic. This includes the record’s ostensible form of the annal,
               since its serial presentation of time derives from Balwhidder’s <emph>ex post
                  facto</emph> recollections and mostly takes the form of picaresque episodes. (The
               table of contents reveals as much. Between the years of 1772 and 1775, for example,
               we read about “[t]he detection of Mr. Heckletext’s guilt,” and that “Lord Eglesham
               comes down to the castle,” and about “[t]he murder of Jean Glaikit,” and that
               “Captain Macadam provides a house and an annuity for old Mrs. Malcolm” [xxi].)</p>
               <p>What is the sum of all this pointed confusion? Katie Trumpener observes, acutely,
               that the failures of Galt’s texts to resolve their various narrative strands enable
               them “to recapture the thickness and jaggedness of lived history,” imparting a sense
               of progress as uneven and of national culture (or any principle of social cohesion,
               of collective closure, of meaning) as existentially uncertain (Trumpener 152).
               However, and as the problematic set of all sets indicates, precisely because Galt’s
               narratives speak to the complexities of experience, they also negate such experience
               by pulling the rug out from underneath its definition. That is, because “great webs”
               are figures of their own unraveling, “lived history” loses its threads in labyrinths
               of signification, in mazes of figures—or in what readers traditionally identify as
               Galt’s distinctive brand of irony. We have no experience of “commercial reciprocity”
               not only because its reticulum is too sublimely vast to comprehend, but also because
               its very existence is a mirage. What Balwhidder actually sees is not the “web” he
               imagines, but rather a change of ownership in the cotton mill, the formation of a
               Savings Bank, and a financially-motivated depression and murder-suicide of one of the
               mill’s overseers. The “web” is thus a figure that lends meaning to experience without
               consigning itself to that experience, especially not of the “jagged, lived” variety.
               The idea of the web, in fact, delivers us from experience by granting us a virtual
               vantage point outside it. In Galt’s narrative, then, experience, especially of
               prototypical Romantic solitude, involves not the writer’s refuge in nature (in which
               Balwhidder exhibits little interest) but rather the ruination of networks of meaning.
               In the <title level="m">Annals</title>, we, like Balwhidder, experience we know not
               what: webs are sets are metaphors are narratives . . . are nothing.</p>
               <p>Alain Badiou, who has thought rigorously about such paradoxes, explains them
               historically as a product of the confusion inscribed into the concept of number—a
               concept dense with ontological implications. The ancient Greeks identified being with
               whole numbers: anything that could be said to exist was essentially one thing. The
               “collapse of the Greek thinking of number” during the long eighteenth century (or
               longer: from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries) “proceeds from three
               fundamental causes,” Badiou argues (<title level="m">Number</title> 7). I lack the
               space here to provide elaborate contexts for these causes, but we can at least review
               them briefly. The first concerns “the problem of the infinite,” which emerged with
               the invention of the calculus in the late seventeenth century (7). Devised to compute
               rates of change in phenomena ranging from the motion of the planets to the rise and
               fall of markets, the practice of calculus well into the nineteenth century employed
               series of numerical fragments to which one might assign limits (the point at which a
               fraction might be said to become too small to signify) without ever resolving these
               series into anything “whole.” Evocative of Zeno’s paradox of Achilles and the
               tortoise (in which Achilles approaches the tortoise without being able, numerically,
               to overtake it, dividing the distance by a half, then a fourth, then an eighth . . .
               ), fractions grew smaller—and denominators grew larger—without reaching a logical
               end. This raised philosophical questions about the status of infinity and also the
               viability of those calculations blithely ignoring the subversive implications of
               fragmentation or the spectacle of numerical ruin. The second problem concerned not
               the infinite but the inverse “ontological stopping point of number” in the void, or
               zero. The void came to denote both an absence of substantive being but also the means
               by which the former was measured; without designating anything in particular, it
               brought attention (as an empty unit, a pure placeholder) to the system in which
               substantive things acquired quantitative designation. Hence, anything that “was” only
               counted on the basis of things that “were not”—a metaphysical puzzle (7-8). The third
               problem proceeded simply from the erosion of belief in the idea of unified being—the
               growing conviction, from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries, of the
               irreducible complexity of the world, prompting intellectuals to seek a new basis on
               which to order experience. Georg Cantor’s set theory provided just such a basis,
               Badiou says, at the end of the nineteenth century, but this makes the long eighteenth
               century a period of ontological incoherence, of mathematical figures lacking a proper
               conceptual ground. Romantic-era numbers, even statistics and simple arithmetic, were
               effectively tropological constructs. Two plus two equaled a red, red rose.</p>
               <p>Badiou’s solution to this problem involves a process of subtraction: we may ground
               numbers, and thus fashion a coherent concept of modern being and its appearance in
               worlds, on the basis of an ordering principle that is not itself an element of any
               set, or that subtracts itself from a pre-existing arrangement. This action makes up a
               “decision point” that prospectively takes the form of an “event,” representing the
               momentous rearrangement of a set or state of affairs. Badiou draws examples of such
               “points” or “events” from politics, science, art, and love. The individuals under
               Spartacus subtracted themselves from the hierarchy of Roman society and transformed
               the relationship between slaves and society (see <title level="m">Logics</title>
               51-52, 69-70); in Jean-Paul Sartre’s play <title level="m">Les Mains Sales</title>,
               the character Hugo, enjoined by the Communist Party to kill a leader suspected of
               treachery, eventually subtracts himself from the party and assumes responsibility for
               his own actions (404-07). In terms of Romantic literature, and despite Scott’s
               reputation for ideological conservatism, one might say that the narrator of <title level="m">Waverley</title> initiates a kind of event by subtracting himself from
               the chaos of experience (and from the “great web” of national and picaresque tales)
               and thus converts a welter of aleatory occurrences and character types into a legible
               ordering of history, a grand narrative of the etiology of modern Britain. This
               interpretation of Scott’s fiction would see it less as an apology of the status quo
               than as an active ordering principle—a “void,” as it were—availing history (and
               historical fiction) to a more radical set of possibilities (which is precisely how
               Scott was read by revolutionaries across Europe and beyond in the nineteenth and
               early twentieth centuries [see Pittock 187-210]). In this scenario, Scott would be to
               Galt what Cantor was to numbers.</p>
               <p>Of course, this is not the historical narrative of <emph>Scottish</emph> Romanticism.
               Scott did not subtract himself from Galt; Galt, rather, responding to Scott,
               implicated Scott’s reader in webs of uncertainty, in riots of refractory
               mathematics—the erosion of ordering systems. This is the point Trumpener makes about
               Galt’s attention to the jaggedness of lived experience—so jagged, we said, that it
               confounds any unified conception of lived experience as heartily as it does a unitary
               idea of genre. In this respect, the closure Galt perceived in Scott’s Waverley novels
               was less the solution to an existential crisis than the product of an ill-conceived
               equation in which national being, or any existential form, is imagined as the sum of
               its history. For Galt, such sums never fully compute; no set is simply equal to
               itself.</p>
               <p>This is not to say, however, that in undercutting subtraction Galt imagined no
               mathematical alternative—not that Galt, widely read but no mathematician, would have
               labeled it “mathematical.” In a brief 1833 narrative entitled “The Seamstress,” Galt
               presents a sketch of Miss Peggy Pingle, a woman who “had to make the needle her
               bread-winner” and who, after the death of her mother, became most notable for the
               mechanical regularity of her solitary existence (Galt, “Seamstress” 22). “Day after
               day was with Miss Pingle as the to-day is like the yesterday—twins could not more
               resemble each other,” Galt tells us. “The only irregularity in the pure flow and rill
               of her life, was from the lengthening and shortening of the days” (23). A nature unto
               herself, Miss Peggy nevertheless effectively stitched her own existence to that of
               the external world: “She could tell the character of the weather . . . by the dim,
               bright, or blazy aspect of the spark in her grate, that serve[s] to make the cold
               more sensible; and could read the omens which made her penurious candle oracular”
               (26). This capacity to “read” embers and flames also betokened supernatural realms
               beyond: through what the narrator calls her “pyrology,” Miss Peggy “could divine . .
               . that sailor[s’] wives, with close-drawn hoods, would restless walk the shore,” or
               that “cold-rife lovers would cuddle together,” or that “kechling [or cackling]
               gossips were with secret” (26).</p>
               <p>Two items bear noting. First, the stitching in this story differs from the “great
               web” in the <title level="m">Annals</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                  “Stitching” is the term (at least in English translation) Badiou adopts from
                  Jacques Lacan’s metaphor of the “quilting-point”; it designates the reconstitution
                  of an object on the basis of its components. See Badiou, <title level="m">Logics</title> 253.</note> In this later sketch, a smaller world opens onto a
               series of greater ones without entanglements, or at least Galt imagined it that way.
               He conceived of it as an illustration of how Scottish writers, who “possess [. . .]
               the whole range of the English language, as well as their own,” have a wider span of
               words and concepts at their disposal (21). In “The Seamstress” that word is
               “eydency,” a Scots term similar but not equivalent to “industry.” Eydency, he says,
               is “descriptive of . . . constancy and patience, in employments of a feminine and
               sedentary kind”; it represents not only home-spun subsistence, but also a notion of
               “industry free from labour” (21), an idealized sphere of political economics, the
               wealth of the nation conjured by a legion of invisible hands. Peggy “illustrate[s] a
               genuine case” of eydency; the narrator recalls her from “a reminiscence of our youth,
               in itself at once simple, interesting, and pathetic” (21). <note place="foot" resp="editors"> In his <title level="m">Autobiography</title>, Galt recalls
                  from his childhood a kindly old window who has “often since served [him] as a
                  model.... She was very poor, and <emph>spun out</emph> her existence by her rock
                  and tow” (1:10). Galt portrays another old window as a “one of those plausible
                  sybils” (1:11).</note>
               </p>
               <p>If Galt’s “web” expresses what Badiou portrays as the paradox of numbers during the
               Romantic era, namely their status as tropes and hence their dissolution into
               figurality, his portrait of “eydency” spins a web (and builds a figure) of a
               different variety. I am speaking here of the practice of geometry, which retained its
               currency in Scotland as the principal mode of mathematical inquiry even amidst the
               disciplinary drift toward algebra across much of Europe (see Pycior 242-43). “The
               Seamstress” is hardly geometric in any literal sense, no more than <title level="m">Annals of the Parish</title> is arithmetic or set-theoretical. However, the story
               shares with geometry a kind of metaphysical coordination of the rational and the
               sensible, the shapes of (Miss Peggy’s) thought with the structures of reality,
               “eydency” with the external world. In this respect, Galt’s “reminiscence” was broadly
               cultural as well as personal and fictive. John Keill, a Scot who was the first person
               to lecture on Isaac Newton’s work at the University of Oxford early in the eighteenth
               century, explained that the resistance to algebra shared by several of his
               contemporaries was motivated in large part by the conviction that “many Propositions,
               which appear conspicuous in [Euclid, are] knotty . . . and scarcely intelligible to
               Learners by [the] Algebraical Way of Demonstration.” This was because geometry shows
               “Evidence by the Contemplations of Figures,” as opposed to the “Symbols, Notes, or
               obscure Principles” one finds in algebra (Keill, “Preface,” no pagination). Algebraic
               innovations enabled greater dexterity in processing mounds of data, but they also
               exacerbated the ontological confusion to which Badiou refers by employing negative
               and irrational (read: un-whole) numbers. Geometry, meanwhile, partly circumvented
               such conundra by sketching proportional lines in the place of fractions or numbers
               with infinite and non-repeating decimal points, thus compensating visually for
               technical failures either of calculation or philosophy. For the Scottish
               Enlightenment literati to whom Balwhidder appeals, geometry represented the
               reconciliation of the world as we think it with the world as it appears to us. It
               also evoked a longer tradition of Scottish metaphysics as an intellectual inheritance
               predating the 1707 Union, such that geometry, like Scots, was a national language
               (see Davie 127-49). In Galt’s Scotland, geometry thus named the science that stitched
               together present and past, culture and nature; without resolving the quandaries of
               negative, irrational, and complex numbers that purportedly embroiled the Romantic
               period in an ontological muddle, geometry nevertheless lent these creaturely units
               eloquent expression in the form of shapes, figures, “eydent” sketches—a metaphorics
               of the eye.</p>
               <p>The more precise relationships between literature and geometry during this period
               exceed the boundaries of this essay. Still, the divergence of Galt’s portrait of Miss
               Peggy from the ironic jumble of Balwhidder’s narrative indicates how, in the world of
               Scottish Romanticism, 1 and 1 may not always have equaled 1. More broadly, certain
               species of literary representation may not have reduced to any composite of numbers
               or (algebraic) variables; “quantities” and “magnitudes” were measured in more ways
               than <title level="m">Waverley</title> could “count.” If this seems like common
               sense—since when are “rocks and stones and trees” reducible to ones and two and
               threes?—let us nevertheless not be naïve: as William St. Clair has shown in the
               statistics drawn from publishing and as Franco Moretti has sketched by way of graphs,
               maps, and trees, literature and mathematics remain segregated in much literary
               criticism only because of our failures to understand the affinities between those two
               cultures. And yet, in a special issue like this one on the concept of number in the
               Romantic period, Galt’s story prompts us to ask whether the most romantic numbers—the
               “illustrations” and sketches, the visions of “industry free from labour” (with its
               infinite divisions)—were even “numbers” at all, or were coincident with numerical
               logic. Indeed, Galt plays something of a Blake to Badiou’s Newton, reminding us that
               not every “being” that cuts the airy way is closed by the numerical associations of
               ontology.</p>

               <p>Edmund Burke’s brief comment in <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in
                  France</title> about the “swinish multitude” trampling on learning unleashed a
               swarm of cultural responses. In his swinish multitude comment, he makes clear the
               distinction implicit elsewhere in <title level="m">Reflections</title>. Burke
               attempted to keep separate “the deferential subjects, instinctively loyal, and the
               [learned] argumentative citizens”; the later being the “tiny political nation needed
               to—could be permitted to—shoulder the daunting demands of citizenship” (Herzog 511).
               However, his comments created an uproar from the underclass. This essay is concerned
               with the problem of figuring the multitude and how the multitude figures in politics
               during the Romantic period. In particular, it is worth noting how in the age of
               political economy swine and populous masses are subsumed and resist biopolitical
               ends.</p>
               <p>Perhaps most striking among the cultural responses are James Gillray’s 1795
               illustrations: the apocalyptic pigs and the starving swine. In the apocalyptic pigs
               image <ref target="http://bit.ly/YpD22l">
                     <title level="m">Presage of the
                     Millennium</title>
                  </ref>, William Pitt rides a white Hanoverian horse and
               wields famine and destruction on a herd of pigs and politicians, the “souls of
               Multitude.” The textual commentary at the foot of the image is adapted from the Book
               of Revelations: <quote>And e’er the Last days began, I looked &amp; beheld a White
                  Horse, &amp; and his name was Death, &amp; Hell followed after him... And I saw
                  under him the Souls of the Multitude, those who were destroy’d for maintaining the
                  word of Truth, &amp; for the Testimony. (Gillray <title level="m">Presage</title>)</quote> Kissing Pitt’s backside is George, Prince of Wales,
               while emerging from the horse’s tail are horned and winged figures, the Secretary of
               State for War and Edmund Burke. Whig leader Charles Henry Fox, who holds a plea for
               Peace with France, is trampled along with various parliamentary allies and a sea of
               swine (Fitzwilliam). </p>
               <p>Later in the same year, Gillray illustrates the <ref target="http://bit.ly/115zaqr">
                     <title level="m">Substitutes for Bread</title>
                  </ref> which calls attention to
               the poor harvests of 1794 and 1795 and the famine that followed. The laboring poor
               amass in the streets and outside the window of a landowner’s house. They hold signs
               including “Petitions from Starving Swine” and seem poised to rush upon the wealthy
               who inside and in luxurious attire consume roast beef, poultry, and gold coins in the
               shape of fish as their opulent “substitutes” for bread. On the wall of the
               gentleman’s house hangs a notice “Proclamation for a General Fast, in order to avert
               the impending Famine” besides which hangs a separate note of acceptable substitutes
               for bread including venison, roast beef, champaign, etc. (Gillray <title level="m">Substitutes</title>). So, during this grain crisis, the elite turn to a range of
               food which signifies their place apart from the crowd. Pork is not on the list of
               items to be eaten but the swinish masses clearly feel eaten into as they call out to
               be noticed. In Gillray’s illustrations, the swinish multitude works as a figure for
               masses that cannot be contained nor controlled by institutional authority.</p>
               <p>Gillray joins together the human masses as “swinish multitude” with a noted
               characteristic of swine—stubbornness. As the traditional Sussex folk verse of the
               period says:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>And you can pook</l>
                        <l>And you can shove</l>
                        <l>But a Sussex pig</l>
                        <l>He won't be druv.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> The final line appears on Sussex Rye pig mugs of the late 1800s. The head of
               the clay pig comes off and the mug is stood on its tail. The decanter is
               traditionally filled with beer. Around the neck of the clay pig is often embossed “He
               won't be druv” (Legge 9). So accumulates the signification of the masses—a swinish,
               beer drinking, intoxicated, stubborn multitude. The unmovable nature of pigs were
               used in a number of political forums, even prior to Burke. As Dr. Johnson notes (in
               Boswell’s <title level="m">The life of Samuel Johnson</title>): “The peers have but
               to <emph>oppose</emph> a candidate, to ensure him success. It is said, the only way
               to make a pig go forward is to pull him back by the tail. These people must be
               treated like pigs” (cited in Herzog 507).</p>
               <p>One might add to the accumulation several 1790s tracts: the socialist utopics of
               Edmund Spence’s <title level="m">Pig’s Meat</title> and Daniel Issac Eaton’s <title level="m">Politics for the People; or A Salmagundy for Swine</title> (Gallop,
               Gigante 110-111). Likewise, Eaton’s <title level="m">Hog’s Wash</title> is populated
               with swinish contributors such as Brother Grunter, Porkulus, A Liberty Pig, and The
               Learned Pig, among others (Herzog 513). Robert Southey’s political pig of 1799 is
               another example: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Is he [the pig] obstinate?</l>
                        <l>We must not, Jacob, be deceived by words,</l>
                        <l>By sophist sounds. A democratic beast</l>
                        <l>He knows that his unmerciful drivers seek </l>
                        <l>Their profit and not his. (“The Pig: a Colloquial Poem” qtd in Herzog
                        525)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> And if Gillray can invoke the Book of Revelations for his
               apocalyptic pigs, then the other pig of the New Testament worth noting is the herd of
               swine into which Christ cast demons which had possessed a man. From the point of view
               of the wealthy who dine on lavish “Substitutes for Bread,” the swinish multitude of
               mankind indeed seemed possessed with a force beyond their comprehension. These
               cultural and intertextual references for the swinish multitude seem to multiply much
               like the innumerable voices, bodies, and demands they are meant to represent. </p>
               <p>Gillray’s <title level="m">Substitutes for Bread</title> is occasioned by the food
               crisis of 1794 and 1795. In the wake of the crisis, a number of agricultural,
               governmental, and charity institutions developed a new discourse of population for
               describing the disaffected masses. The gambit for these institutions was that by
               understanding population—numbers of people, their distribution, their ages, and their
               occupations—they could create policies to control and appease the crowd of distressed
               poor and working class peoples. As Foucault notes with his term “biopower,” the
               politics of population serves as a narrow space through which the multitude of life
               is contained. The political forces manipulating biopower, forces Foucault terms
               “biopolitics,” did not spring fully formed into being. According to Foucault, this
               ability to regulate life begins in the late eighteenth century. The early years of
               creating a population from the masses saw many complex problems of how to manage
               human and animal bodies. While population provides an ordering of life, the “swinish
               multitude” serves as a figure for life in excess of population. The goal of this
               essay is to sketch some of the lines of biopolitical construction and resistance
               early in the Romantic period by beginning with Foucault’s 1976 lecture on biopower
               and then placing it in relation to a mosaic of period texts.</p>
               <p>Foucault’s March 17, 1976 lecture published in <title level="m">Society Must be
                  Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France 1975-1976</title> provides the
               touchstone for understanding biopower. Biopower is the biological which becomes
               tended and controlled by State (Foucault, <title level="m">Society</title> 240). The
               political rationale and the legal and rhetorical justification for such control are
               termed biopolitics. Foucault explains “Biopolitics deals with the population, with
               the population as political problem, as a problem that is at once scientific and
               political, as a biological problem and as power's problem" (Foucault, <title level="m">Society</title> 245). While regulating the citizens as a mass is a
               general concern of government throughout the ages, Foucault claims that the
               eighteenth century saw a rise in technologies for regulating the life of citizens.
               Such regulation was not the age-old negative modality of regulating death: the right
               of a State to take the life of a citizen who violates its laws and the right of the
               State to send citizens to war. This new power included <quote>mechanisms with a
                  certain number of functions that are very different from the functions of
                  disciplinary mechanisms. The mechanisms introduced by biopolitics include
                  forecasts, statistical estimates, and overall measures. . . . [they] intervene at
                  the level at which these general phenomena are determined, to intervene at the
                  level of their generality. (Foucault, <title level="m">Society</title> 246)
               </quote> At the turn of the nineteenth century a number of mechanical, information,
               and economic technologies align to "maintain an average, establish a sort of
               homeostasis" for the population of bodies (Foucault, <title level="m">Society</title>
               246). The State co-opts and fosters these technologies toward a greater control of
               the population. It is not that the State has control of these technologies. Rather a
               critical number of biopolitical technologies emerge—such as cartography, surveys, and
               statistics. Under the banner of rising nationalism and under fear of the French—from
               French Revolution to Napoleon—the State corrals and co-opts these techniques,
               technologies, rhetorics, and ultimately powers.</p>
               <p>The poor harvest and lack of grain in 1795 figures as an event and rupture that
               reveals the way biopower began to get a hold of bodies in the British Isles. Rather
               than a singular narrative, I’ll provide instances within this event. These instances
               form a mosaic of power relations within Britain and a figure of resistance, what
               Foucault calls “homo oeconomicus.” As Cary Wolfe explains: <quote>In opposition to
                  what Foucault calls <emph>homo juridicus</emph> (or <emph>homo legalis</emph>)—the
                  subject of law, rights, and sovereignty—we find in this new subject, <emph>homo
                     oeconomicus</emph>, “an essentially and unconditionally irreducible element
                  against any possible government,” a “zone that is definitively inaccessible to any
                  government action,” “an atom of freedom in the face of all the conditions,
                  undertakings, legislation, and prohibitions of a possible government.” “The
                  subject of interest,” Foucault writes, thus “constantly overflows the subject of
                  right. He is therefore irreducible to the subject of right. He is not absorbed by
                  him. He overflows him, surrounds him, and is the permanent condition of him
                  functioning.” <emph>Homo oeconomicus</emph> thus founds a new domain of
                  “irrational rationality” that is of a fundamentally different order from
                  sovereignty and the juridical subject. “Economic rationality,” Foucault writes,
                  “is not only surrounded by, but founded on the unknowability of, the totality of
                  the process” and <emph>homo oeconomicus</emph> thus says to the sovereign “you
                  cannot because you do not know, and you do not know because you cannot know.” But
                  such a creature, of course—and for that very reason—poses a threat to power. And
                  this threat is what will in time give rise to the regime of governmentality and
                  its exercise of biopower. <note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1"> Wolfe’s
                     quotations of Foucault are from <title level="m">The Birth of
                        Biopolitics,</title> 271, Ibid., 274, <emph>ibid</emph>., 282, 283. </note>
                  (Cary Wolf <title level="m">Before the Law</title>)</quote> I will briefly trace
               this <emph>homo oeconomicus</emph> as a mass or stubborn bodies against the docility
               of manipulating numbers. In other words, modes of quantification—counting bodies and
               counting them as citizens of the State subject to its control—become the means of
               rhetorical and material control of peoples. In contrast, <emph>homo
                  oeconomicus</emph> uses qualitative differences between peoples as a way of
               evading quantification and counting. <emph>Homo oeconomicus</emph> leverages a
               biopower—the biological capacities and resistances of bodies—as that which has yet to
               be co-opted by the biopolitical. </p>
               <p>Scarcity in 1795 set in motion a number of biopolitical debates as to if and how the
               government should intervene in the problem of hunger. King George’s October 1795
               speech on the high price of goods motivated the November 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>
               parliamentary debate on the laws regarding Assize of Bread and other governmental
               means of conserving grain and curbing costs. Pitt and with him Fox were cautious of
               any intervention in markets; however, they did advocate for the laboring poor who had
               been brought to a degraded state. Samuel Whitbread advanced a bill to set minimum
               wages for the poor but despite repeated attempts, the bill failed. Edmund Burke
               replied to Whitbred first in parliament then in <title level="m">Thoughts and Details
                  on Scarcity</title> published posthumously in 1800. The treatise is a mixture of
               political conservatism and agrarian observations; the political elements are mainly
               at the outset of the book and read like a political treatise while the agricultural
               details are in fragments at the end of the work and read something akin to a report
               to the Board of Agriculture.</p>
               <p>Contrary to Whitbread, Burke does not believe in setting a minimum wage but rather
               believes that the market of supply and demand should set the labor prices. More
               astonishingly and contrary to Adam Smith, Burke believes “in the case of the farmer
               and the labourer, their interests are always the same, and it is absolutely
               impossible that their free contracts can be onerous to either party” (10). While
               Burke doubts that workers are worse off in 1795 than in the past, his remedy for any
               low costs of labor and high prices for food is charity rather than government
               intervention. As David Collings explains: “The duties of public office and of private
               charity that Burke tries to separate had long since been blended in the tradition,
               which regarded the church or the state as the agent of collective charity and which
               therefore build an element of communitas into its public institutions. By attempting
               to strip away this element [the poor laws], Burke violates his cardinal principle,
               the maintenance of long usages” (88). Burke as advocate of custom becomes Burke
               advocate of the free market.</p>
               <p>Yet, oddly, agrarian parts of Burke’s <title level="m">Thoughts and Details Written
                  on Scarcity</title> are not always on the side of the market. He delineates for
               pages the poor quantity of the year’s wheat, oats, barley, beans, clover, rye, hay
               and grasses. He then extrapolates from this to the costs and quality of meat, noting
               “When the food of the animal is scarce, his flesh must be dear” (39). This is in
               contrast to his political claim early in the book that it is in the best interest of
               farmer and worker that “the labourer is well fed, and otherwise found with such
               necessaries of animal life, according to its habitudes, as may keep the body in full
               force, and the mind gay and cheerful” (10). One might combine Burke’s two
               observations: when the food of the human animal is scarce, his flesh must be dear. It
               is the very dearness of their flesh to which the multitude gives voice in pressing
               against hunger. Burke praises the laboring man as an “instrumentum vocale” or full
               throated voice but then seems deft to the cries (10). </p>
               <p>Not long after Burke’s 1795 speech, his health began to fail. Nevertheless Sir John
               Sinclair, President of the Board of Agriculture and author of <title level="m">Statistical Account of Scotland</title>, leaned on Burke to write a chapter on
               wages and food for the report to the Board. Sinclair was rapidly compiling
               agricultural statistics and reports. In his July address to the Board of Agriculture,
               Sinclair announced that every county of Britain had an agricultural survey in print
               or soon to be in print. From these, “the public would see to what a pitch of
               perfection agricultural knowledge was likely to be brought, by the accumulation of so
               many valuable materials” (Annual Register 1795, 97). From surveys the Board hoped
               that methods in “improved” agriculture would spread; indeed “there is no duty more
               incumbent on a board of agriculture than that of recommending such measures as are
               most likely to provide a sufficient quantity of food for the people” (Annual Register
               1795, 98). </p>
               <p>To press Sinclair’s case, the ailing Burke was visited in May of 1796 by the notable
               agricultural improver, Arthur Young, then Secretary of the Board. Young reported back
               that Burke would be unable to fulfill the requested chapter on wages and food: “His
               conversation was remarkably desultory, a broken mixture of agricultural observation,
               French madness, price of provisions, the death of his son, the absurdity of
               regulating labour, the mischief of our Poor-laws, and the difficulty of cottagers
               keeping cows” (Betham-Edwards xlv). Indeed, much of <title level="m">Thoughts and
                  Details Written on Scarcity</title> carries this same “broken mixture.” Yet the
               mixture is revealing. Agriculture does not stand on its own but is part of a larger
               political and labor ecology. How and what people eat is dependent upon a mixture of
               agricultural observation, “French madness,” prices of provisions, labor regulations,
               poor laws, and a cottager’s cows. Burke’s only fault here is not keeping these
               various categories from spilling out one into another and so too haphazardly showing
               the effects of one upon the other. </p>
               <p>Burke’s unwritten chapter—partly visible in <title level="m">Thoughts and Details
                  Written on Scarcity</title>—shows how administrative tools were deployed toward
               developing a biopolitics of Britain. Sinclair’s other administrative works serve as
               good examples. In accord with a number of agricultural treatises and surveys of the
               period, Sinclair created and managed the ambitious twenty-one volume <title level="m">Statistical Account of Scotland</title> (1791-1799). His use of the word
               "statistical" was rather novel at the time and called for his explanation:
                  <quote>Many people were at first surprised at my using the words "statistical" and
                  "statistics", as it was supposed that some in our own language might have
                  expressed the same meaning. But in the course of a very extensive tour through the
                  northern parts of Europe, which I happened to take in 1786, I found that in
                  Germany they were engaged in a species of political enquiry to which they had
                  given the name "statistics," and though I apply a different meaning to that
                  word—for by "statistical" is meant in Germany an inquiry for the purposes of
                  ascertaining the political strength of a country or questions respecting matters
                  of state—whereas the idea I annex to the term is an inquiry into the state of a
                  country, for the purpose of ascertaining the quantum of happiness enjoyed by its
                  inhabitants, and the means of its future improvement; but as I thought that a new
                  word might attract more public attention, I resolved on adopting it, and I hope it
                  is now completely naturalised and incorporated with our language. (Sinclair
                  20:xiii) </quote> Sinclair relied primarily on roughly 900 local parish ministers
               to conduct the survey with some help from hired agents. The survey included 160
               questions covering geography, population, agriculture and industry. While ostensibly
               seeking "the quantum of happiness enjoyed by its inhabitants," the survey actually
               recorded normative behavior of the population and laid the groundwork by which
               Sinclair and others would argue for improvements. Furthermore, it made significant
               inroads in representing Scotland to the rest of Great Britain and through
               quantification categorized and normalized Scottish life. </p>
               <p>While conducting the survey, in 1793 Sinclair was instrumental in establishing The
               Board of Agriculture (officially chartered as the Board or Society for the
               Encouragement of Agriculture and Internal Improvement). With a number of individuals
               and local societies advocating improvement of agriculture and livestock, it was
               simply a matter of time before matters were centralized and nationalized in a Board
               of Agriculture. According to the biography of Sinclair by his son, Rev. John
               Sinclair, the idea of forming a national board first occurred through Sinclair's
               discussion of the Corn Bill in 1791 entitled "An Address to the Landed Interest on
               the Corn Bill." Sinclair had "been deeply impressed by the fact, that while we were
               alleged to be dependent on foreign countries for food, their existed in England alone
               twelve millions of acres almost in a state of nature; and that many statesmen were
               looking helplessly for subsistence to other countries, while they overlooked the
               abundant capabilities of their own” (Rev. Sinclair 2:46). According to the biography,
               Prime Minister Pitt was impressed with this information which would prove "important
               to the safety and independence of the kingdom" (Rev. Sinclair 2:46). From his 1791
               Society for the Improvement of British Wool to the <title level="m">Statistical
                  Account</title> to the Board of Agriculture, Sinclair is fundamentally interested
               in what Michel Foucault would call biopolitics.</p>
               <p>One could add the cartographic survey of the nation and the census to the list of
               biopolitical machinery. Both are underway at the turn of the century, and over the
               coming decades these inscriptions become refined instruments for representing a
               population. It is from such work that later John Snow will be able to create his
               famous epidemiological map of the cholera epidemic and trace a particular outbreak to
               the Broad Street water pump. For agriculture, maps of low laying swamps and bogs
               reveal places that will over the course of the century see drainage and “improvement”
               toward greater enclosure as well as expanded tillage. Additionally, Sinclair’s study
               can be placed in the lineage of what the seventeenth-century author William Petty
               termed “political arithmetic.” Perry is the “progenitor of quantitative study of
               ‘power’” who considered quantitative data as a means of revealing new sets of
               relationships at the national level. Even with the incomplete quantitative studies of
               his period he attempted to estimate the wealth potential of territory and compare
               English wealth potential against that of other nations (Innes 119-20). Closer to
               Sinclair’s own time and region, Andrew Wight published <title level="m">Present State
                  of Husbandry in Scotland</title> in 1778 and James Anderson <title level="m">Account of the Present State of the Hebrides</title> in 1785 (Innes 147-48). More
               ambitious is the Scotsman George Chalmers <title level="m">Estimate of the
                  Comparative Strength of Great Britain, during the present and four preceding
                  reigns</title> which was “the first work successfully to pull together a picture
               of national wealth and power using chiefly central sources” (Innes 149). All of these
               were efforts post 1745 to accord the productivity of Scotland with that of Great
               Britain as a whole and reveal Scotland as a significant contributor to the wealth of
               the nation.</p>
               <p>In cartography and the census everyone counts, which is to say every one is folded
               into quantity indifferent to difference in kind. Every <emph>one</emph> is
               interpellated as citizen within the nation and folded within a common system of
               evaluation. As Althusser lays out in “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses”:
                  “<emph>all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete
                  subjects</emph>” (173). Ideology happens concretely and we are folded into it by
               concrete circumstances, by the accepted practices and rituals of a culture: “you and
               I are <emph>always already</emph> subjects, and as such constantly practice the
               rituals of ideological recognition, which guarantee for us that we are indeed
               concrete, individual, distinguishable and (naturally) irreplaceable subjects” (172).
               Finding oneself on a map or being counted as part of a population of a locale means
               being a subject given over to the representation of the map, survey, or census. As
               Steven Daniels explains, “Maps were not merely illustrations of the changing economic
               and political landscape of Britain; they were instruments of its planning,
               production, and regulation. They helped to coordinate Britain, in people’s minds as
               well as on the ground, as a national network of localities and regions” (61).</p>
               <p>The power of the census and cartography is evident in the Settlement Act and
               subsequent settlement laws. These serve as an example of biopolitics at work. The
               laws prevent moving from one parish to another without gainful employment. The
               settlement laws were passed to prevent vagrants from drawing charity from parishes of
               which they are not native; however, they also had an effect on field workers and day
               laborers. When workers were in demand, authorities overlooked the law so as to bring
               in more hands to tend to the fields and with more workers followed a lowering of
               wages; only when there was little work did the authorities prevent movement into
               their parish. By binding the laboring poor to a particular locale, by preventing
               freedom of movement, the law prevented the laborer from selling on the free market
               his one commodity, himself as labor. In <title level="m">Wealth of Nations</title>
               Adam Smith takes to task this prohibition: <quote>The obstruction which corporation
                  laws give to the free circulation of labour is common, I believe, to every part of
                  Europe. That which is given to it by the poor law is, so far as I know, peculiar
                  to England. It consists in the difficulty which a poor man finds in obtaining a
                  settlement, or even in being allowed to exercise his industry in any parish but
                  that which he belongs. . . . The difficulty of obtaining settlements obstructs
                  even that of common labour. (107) </quote> Parish boundaries, citizenship, and
               economic pricing of labor are accepted practices and rituals in culture. These
               biopolitical apparatus move from textual inscriptions on paper to interpellation of
               bodies in which the laborers are “<emph>always already</emph> subjects.”</p>
               <p>Thomas Malthus’s sheer quantification of bodies in his <title level="m">Essay on the
                  Principle of Population</title> provides an exemplary instance of quantification
               of bodies. Malthus’s fundamental formula raises great anxiety: a human population
               grows exponentially while agriculture grows arithmetically. Such a quantification of
               bodies in dire circumstances serves as a justification for the expansion of
               biopolitics in a range of areas including but not limited to enclosure, agriculture,
               animal husbandry, and the clearances in Scotland (McLane 109-111). In terms of bodies
               made “<emph>always already</emph> subjects,” throughout <title level="m">Principle of
                  Population</title> Malthus makes individuals responsible for their place in
               society. It is only by their industry that they contribute to the body politic. In a
               particularly shocking passage, the orphan without parents to care for him and unable
               to provide for himself “is, comparably speaking, of no value to society, as others
               will immediately supply its place” (Malthus quoted in Collings 169). Note here the
               use of the words “comparably” and “others.” Every person is placed in equal
               quantitative relation to the next and comparable to the next. Each person counts
               equally and must supply his or her “value” to society. </p>
               <p>In <title level="m">Monstrous Society</title>, David Collings points to a curious
               moment in the 1803 edition of Malthus’s essay and not appearing in subsequent
               editions. Here Malthus employs the figure of the harvest table but with an inversion
               of the figure’s normal use. Traditionally, the harvest table—both in custom and in
               texts about the event—is a moment when the cornucopia of earth’s bounty is on
               display. The landowner sits with his laborers to share a feast from the harvest. The
               harvest table is employed in a number of labor class poems and is perhaps best known
               in Robert Bloomfield’s <title level="m">Farmer’s Boy</title>: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Yet Plenty reigns, and from her boundless hoard,</l>
                        <l>Though not one jelly trembles on the board,</l>
                        <l>Supplies the feast with all that sense can crave;</l>
                        <l>With all that made our great forefathers brave (44)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Bloomfield goes on to lament the loss of this custom as landowners
               sit at a separate table and eat “refined” rather than wholesome foods of their
               forefathers.</p>
               <p>Malthus employs the table differently: <quote>A man who is born into a world already
                  possessed, if he cannot get subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just
                  demand, has no claim of <title level="m">right</title> to the smallest portion of
                  food, and in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature’s mighty feast
                  there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly
                  execute her own orders, if he do not work upon the compassion of some of her
                  guests. If these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately
                  appear demanding the same favor. (quoted in Collings 164) </quote> Malthus
               continues by explaining that “harmony” of the feast is placed off balance and
               scarcity ensues. Eventually, “The guests learn too late their error, in counteracting
               those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who,
               wishing that all her guests should have plenty, and knowing that she could not
               provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table
               was already full” (quoted in Collings 164). For Malthus, no longer is the landowner
               and community responsible for who attends the feast; instead, “the great mistress”
               Nature dictates the limit in numbers. Indeed, the table becomes about counting rather
               than surplus, excess, bounty and a joyous mass of humanity. In short Malthus inverts
               the festival of the feast. Now each individual must bring something to the table in
               order to gain admission. Taken alongside other texts laid out above, Malthus
               constructs a biopolitical individual who is responsible to the state but to whom the
               state bears no responsibility should the individual not meet a requisite
               productivity. </p>
               <p>A pause here is in order to consider the implications of these diverse biopolitical
               inscriptions. As already noted, these works are not always a coordinated effort. They
               may draw one from another—as, for example, Malthus in each of his progressively
               copious editions of <title level="m">Principle of Population</title> adds more and
               more data taken from surveys and census reports—but the works are not centralized.
               Nor is the government the sole or even main force initiating the quantification. Over
               the nineteenth century, the government will increasingly take control of methods for
               gathering data as well as providing government imprimatur for published reports. </p>
               <p>The general drift of these works is to place all citizens within a restricted
               economy. The general, or unrestricted economy, of heterogeneous place, personhood,
               and food is narrowed. In a restricted economy all bodies within the cartographic
               borders of the state fall under the rubrics of citizenship and the census. All bodies
               count quantitatively. Later, there is room for some qualitative and quantitative
               differentiation—comparing populations from different regions or by livelihood,
               gender, wealth, ethnicity, etc. However any differentiation is subordinated to or
               falls “below” the categories determined by the matrix of quantification. Quantified
               sets of information determine in advance the status of the bodies. So, one is or is
               not a citizen. From there, one is from a region, of a particular gender, a particular
               trade, a particular race and religion, etc.. There is no room for qualitative
               differentiation, no space by which the matrix allows at the outset for a
               heterogeneity or general economy in which, for example, one is a fieldworker by day,
               a weaver in the evenings and a maker of homemade cheese to be sold at market. In
               other words, identity fits within a matrix of information. </p>
               <p>Food is a way in which that the biopower of the masses, the swinish multitude, resist
               quantification. In food fights, the masses demand a heterogeneity of eating habits
               that does not fit within prescribed homogeneity of citizenship and ideal
               distributions of food. This resistance and demand can be illustrated through the
               substitute for bread debates of which Gillray’s illustration discussed above is one
               example. Potatoes and potato bread are perhaps the most famous substitutes advocated
               by agriculturalists. Catherine Gallahger has provided an exemplary overview of the
               potato versus wheat debates in England. As for potato bread, this too is a complex
               subject. The ratio and contents of bread had undergone a variety of regulation for
               some time as in the Act for the Making of Bread, 1763, in which the size, weight, and
               cost of white and wheat breads are regulated as well as labeled. Introducing potato
               bread complicated the bread category. The wetness of potatoes varied as did the
               texture and cooking rate. </p>
               <p>Shifting to potato bread was not a simple task. “Whimsical Expenses of Economy” in
                  <title level="m">Gentlemen’s Magazine</title> of 1795 parodies the situation. The
               speaker tells a Mr. Urban that he has decided to abide by “the number of substitutes
               for flour which have been suggested by the ingenious Sir John Sinclair, president of
               the board of agriculture” (Cakeling 135). He then relates a long story of purchasing
               potatoes, ordering a home oven, and purchasing fuel for the fire followed by his
               wifes various trial recipes for potato bread with some very soggy, some burnt, others
               half done until “we had reduced 20lbs of potatoes to 2, and had made excellent starch
               of it, though we could not make bread. We had consumed half the stock of potatoes
               that was to serve us all winter, without getting a single loaf that was eatable”
               (137). The narrator tells Mr. Urban “Never did a poor man pay so dear in order to
               save money and it is all owing to the cry that you and others have set up about
               scarcity, that I am fairly driven out of my own house, and am the laughing-stock of
               all my neighbours” (135). While potato bread makes sense economically as a mode of
               distributing food, it meets resistance in practical application—where the materiality
               of the food items meets preparation, tastes, and digestibility. </p>
               <p>Even amid scarcity and a fifty percent increase in wheat prices during the blight of
               the 1795 harvest and 1800, laborers demanded fine wheaten bread. As E. P. Thompson
               explains “laborers accustomed to wheaten bread actually could not work—suffered from
               weakness, indigestion, or nausea—if forced to change to rougher mixtures” (191).
               Thompson uses this among other food riot examples to explain the “delicate tissue of
               social norms which regulate life” which he characterizes as the moral economy of the
               crowd. In an excellent study of shifts from fine wheat bread to coarser cereal
               grains, Roger Wells details resistance from working-class consumers and even the
               millers who knew such shifts in food stuffs would not be palatable and would go
               undersold—indeed at times even risking riots (Wells 202-03, 209). In brief, the
               swinish multitude could demand fine wheaten bread over more course and indigestible
               substitutes because it was perceived as a right or a custom which linked the citizens
               within the community. </p>
               <p>Other food resistances reveal how the restricted economy of a homogeneous diet for
               the nation runs afoul of the heterogeneity of stomachs and kitchens. Consider oats.
               They are an acceptable food in Scotland and a number of writers correlate the
               hardiness of the Scots to their eating oats. More negatively said, the oats
               considered for animals is attributed as digestible to Scots because of their more
               animal constitution. J. L and Barbara Hammond give a more comprehensive overview of
               the ecology and economy of eating oats. They explain that with a diet of bread and
               tea, laborers in Southern England had “too delicate a digestion to assimilate the
               courser cereals, and that there was, apart from climate and tradition, a very
               important difference between the labourer in the north and the labourer in the south”
               (Hammond 122-123). There is a heterogeneity in climate, geography and tradition and
               as the Hammonds note, there is also the problem of access to milk: “Now oatmeal eaten
               with milk is a very different food from oatmeal taken alone, and it is clear from a
               study of the budgets that if oatmeal was to be acclimatized in the south, it was
               essential to increase the consumption of milk. But the great difference in
               consumption represented not a difference of demand, but of supply” (Hammond 123). In
               brief, enclosure had fenced in (or fenced out) commons by which the laborer would be
               able to keep a cow. Large dairies in the south sent much of their supply to Bath and
               London. There are even complaints that the hogs had more access to milk for fattening
               than did the worker. So, just as eating potato breads is not a satisfactory
               equivalent to wheaten breads, eating oats is not equal for all laborers. People
               repeatedly present qualitative differences in that which is digestible. Theirs is a
               protest of culture and of the stomach—a resistance even at the most biological
               levels. </p>
               <p>But eat one must. Just as the worker’s power to sell his labor is restricted by the
               Settlement Act, enclosure restricted food production. Loss of common pasture lands
               means forfeiting a cow which would provide milk, cheese, and butter without a need to
               purchase these goods at market. As the Hammonds explain: <quote>The loss of his cow
                  and his produce and his common and traditional rights was rendered particularly
                  serious to the labourer by the general growth of prices. For enclosure which had
                  produced the agrarian proletariat, had raised the cost of living for him. The
                  accepted opinion that under enclosure England became immensely more productive
                  tends to obscure the truth that the agricultural labourer suffered in his
                  character of consumer, as well as in his character of producer, when the small
                  farms and the commons disappeared. (Hammond 106) </quote> In short: the laborer
               must buy items. He does not possess the work of his brow nor the capacities for
               sustenance that a garden and cow supply. He cannot buy wholesale from a local farmer
               as the increasingly large farms sell only to middlemen. The laborer is forced onto a
               particular capitalist market configured in a restricted way. Roger Wells summarizes
               the dynamics of the “improved agriculture”: <quote>heavy capital investment
                  underpinned marked rises in agricultural productivity while increased market
                  orientation of profit-maximising farmers came to dominate most rural communities
                  economically. . . . Farmers’ demand for labour therefore became paramount and the
                  main source of agrarian labour’s exposure to free-market forces. Workers’
                  dependency on the market for employment was paralleled by their dependency on it
                  as consumers, for food, fuel, clothing and housing. (211) </quote> Such an economy
               restricts what constitutes economic activity as opposed to a general economy by which
               the laborer with cow and commons supplements his livelihood. </p>
               <p>In <title level="m">Annals of Agriculture</title> Arthur Young sympathizes with
               laborers who have been stripped of the commons: “The poor in these parishes may say,
               and with truth, all I know is that I had a cow and the Act of Parliament has taken it
               from me” (Young 42-43). And as with cows so too with a number of cottage industries
               which promote a self-reliance outside the restricted economy of labor exchanged for
               wages. In place of work at home, the laborer must work for another and make wages
               that can then be sold for goods at market. In sum, the laborer is forced into a
               national monetary economy. </p>
               <p>This shift from a general economy to a restricted economy is illustrated by George
               Willis’s report printed in Arthur Young’s <title level="m">Annals of
                  Agriculture</title>: <quote>The cottager who commands milk, has within himself, a
                  daily supply of a nutrition’s aliment for the purpose of his family, while another
                  who has not these advantages out of his poor pittance, purchases at the village
                  shop, <title level="m">this black compound</title> of trash and inequity [tea], at
                  the same time he empties his purse, he brings home to his miserable wife and
                  family, a gradual and corrosive poison. (560)</quote> The role of cows as
               companion species to humans is a long history even to the present. Willis’s report
               illustrates the cow as a biopolitical animal claimed by the laborer on one side and
               the Act of Parliament on the other. At work here is a question of who can make claim
               to the animal’s productivity and how such productivity is to be channeled within a
               cultural (and eventually a monetary) economy. </p>
               <p>With some brevity I will mark out two more examples of production and labor shifting
               from a general economy to a restricted economy: beer and gleaning. While John Barrell
               has commented on the political role of the ale house as depicted in the paintings of
               George Moreland, William Cobbett’s occasional hobbyhorse of beer is also worth
               noting. Cobbett decorates his entries of <title level="m">Rural Rides</title> with a
               report of the size, quantity, and the quality of beer he tastes while working up a
               thirst traveling across the countryside and giving speeches. He gives report of the
               joyous company he meets in ale houses. Most distinctly, he notes when a landowner
               entertains him with beer rather than foreign wine and comments on the loss of making
               beer. Cobbett notes that with the rise in taxes for the wheat and barley, beer making
               is no longer a common cottage industry. The tax money for military barracks, he
               comments, “came out of the people’s labour; and when you hear Mr. Ellman tell the
               Committee of 1821, that forty-five years ago every main in his parish brewed his own
               beer, and that now not one man in that same parish does it. . . [you] might be able
               to estimate the effects of what has produced the barrack ” (Cobbett 161). For
               Cobbett, taxes redistributed productivity to nonworking thieves, naves, and nobles,
               but more to the point here, beer was no longer a local, inexpensive, home skill. It
               was a commodity bought on the market. </p>
               <p>Cobbett also laments the loss of gleaning where workers—often women and
               children—gather or glean wheat that was not bundled in the harvest and so claimed by
               the landowner. Cobbett comments: “I saw several wheat stubbles from 40 rods to 10
               rods. I asked one man how much wheat he had from about 10 rods. He said more than two
               bushels. Here is bread for three weeks or more, perhaps; and a winter’s straw for the
               pig besides” (Cobbett 35). Capel Lofft—known for his patronage of Robert
               Bloomfield—also advocated gleaning as a traditional and common right. Yet as the
               price of grain rose during years of scarcity, the landowners pushed harder against
               the tradition and prosecuted gleaners for the wheat they labored to gather (Hammond
               105, Archer 30). With wheat as with milk and beer, all labor and objects become
               commodities within a restricted economy. The prohibition against laborers and their
               families gleaning from their labors was seen to work against the biblical adage “Thou
               shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn” (Deuteronomy 25:4). As Thompson
               summarizes the dilemma, “The breakthrough of the new political economy of the free
               market was also the breakdown of the old moral economy of provision” (258).</p>
               <p>As I hope these pieces of a mosaic illustrate, bodies resist quantification where
               biopower of the body cannot be subsumed by population, statistics, and homogenization
               of the biopolitical apparatus of capture. Either workers are given wheaten bread or
               they and their stomachs will not work. Either a family has a cow and milk or they
               will not eat oats. Either beer is accessible to laborers or the alehouse becomes a
               meeting ground for political discontent. Either the workers are granted the right to
               glean wheat or their families will be hard pressed to survive the winter. The
               heterogeneous demands of bodies weigh not only by quantification but also by a
               massification—a mass in excess of capture, a mass that pushes, resists and weighs
               (Nancy 198). Like the possessed demon swine of the New Testament, the swinish
               multitude resist control.</p>

               <epigraph>
                  <quote>“Bring out number weight &amp; measure in a year of dearth.” —William
                  Blake</quote>
               </epigraph>
               <p>Mina Loy once appealed to “Imagine a tennis champion who became inspired to write
               poetry . . . . Would not his meter depend on his way of life, would it not form
               itself, without having recourse to traditional, remembered, or excepted forms?”
               (270). Loy’s ideal of poetic form as organically, spontaneously embodying the rhythm
               of lived experience has Wordsworthian echoes. But why is it that an athletic champion
               should epitomize her ideal? The athletic contest’s intense focus on the temporal
               spectacle seems more typical of the “savage torpor” of modern consumerism that
               Wordsworth set out to counteract than the interior rhythms of tranquil recollection
               that he pursued. Moreover Loy’s emphasis upon ranking, the suggestion that the
               champion, precisely by virtue of being champion, would best embody organic poetic
               form seems in jeopardy of giving way to an Ayn Randian or worse aestheticizing of
               market ethics. By contrast, a familiar romantic trope associates mere countability
               with social breakdown, such as the impasse that concludes Wordsworth’s “We are Seven”
               and the mystical clockwork barking of Christabel’s mastiff. In <title level="m">Peter
                  Bell the Third</title> Percy Shelley makes the countability of Peter Bells
               emblematize a radical and pervasive cultural and political bankruptcy. </p>
               <p>But another (and importantly not unrelated) romantic trope emphasizes that what we
               have to fear in modern capitalism’s arbitrarily abstract quantities is not the form
               itself of competitive ranking but the ideological baggage this so often carries,
               baggage that diverts attention from the aesthetic spectacle of competition as what
               Loy terms an on-going “way of life.” Two interrelated, key ideological constructs of
               capitalist culture—the idolization of winners on the one hand, and the presumption to
               know, to have an understanding of the causal mechanism behind what makes winners
               win—constitute two sides of the same literal coin, money or capital itself, whose
               “riddle,” Marx said, is “but the riddle presented by commodities; only it now strikes
               us in its most glaring form” (105f). It is such fetishism that makes horserace
               coverage politics so politically numbing and paralyzing, and why, on the contrary,
               the spectacle of a boxing match, as Hazlitt showed, can make the horserace concern
               for who won and why quite beside the point. </p>
               <p>A if not the seminal motif of Romanticism’s critique of capitalism is sympathy for
               losers. Before Wordsworth gave such sympathy its iconic lyrical expression Adam Smith
               theorized it as a remediating, complementary currency to capital. Smith assumed that
               the two currencies were mutually correcting, that sympathy modulated capitalist
               self-interest to the benefit of all rather than a few. In Smith’s famous example,
               sympathizing with a lunatic in the street is essentially a matter of a viable
               consumer sympathizing with an unviable or failed one: <quote>The anguish which
                  humanity feels . . . at the sight of such an object cannot be the reflection of
                  any sentiment of the sufferer. The compassion of the spectator must arise
                  altogether from the consideration of what he himself would feel if he was reduced
                  to the same unhappy situation, and, what perhaps is impossible, was at the same
                  time able to regard it with his present reason and judgment (8).</quote> The
               consumerist model of individuality isn’t troubled but fortified by this ability to
               rehabilitate what it constitutively excludes, to define itself not just in contrast
               to failed consumers but <emph>as a function of</emph> assimilating those failures. So
               sympathy becomes nothing other than the oppositional positing and then
               reincorporating of non-consumers. Far from a remediating or ameliorating counterpart
               to the logic of commodity fetishism, then, such sympathy represents the latter’s
               insidiously nuanced entrenchment.</p>
               <p>Yet this radical formalization of social experience exclusively in terms of
               iterations of consumption is also eminently unstable. The pathos of one of Keats’s
               best-known letters hinges on this precariousness. Keats does not pretend to renounce
               or escape Smith’s basic formal model and yet nonetheless demolishes any ground for
               optimism about sympathy’s redemptive power. Keats describes the experience of being
               at a party and sympathetically inhabiting other people in a compulsive, serial way,
               moving insatiably from one individual to the next: “the identity of everyone in the
               room begins so to press upon me,” Keats writes, “that I am in a very little time
               annihilated” (To Richard Woodhouse, October 27th, 1818). Keats anticipates
               Baudelaire’s great portraits of the self-dissolving erotic life of urban crowds, and
               in both cases the critique of consumerist imagination is doubled-edged: on the one
               hand the poets deny that the sympathetic imagination stands to repair social disunity
               (on the contrary, the sympathetic imagination that was supposed to connect the poet
               with others ends up alienating him from himself); on the other hand though, Keats and
               Baudelaire alike recognize this defeat as inescapable: it is the structural condition
               upon which their respective poetic efforts build. Individualist consumerism is the
               condition of its own critique. </p>
               <p>Thus there’s a partial truth to Smith’s account that haunts subsequent modernity both
               in spite and in virtue of its partialness. Like his poetic successors Smith has the
               implicit good faith to acknowledge that the commodity form is total and consequently
               that the critique of consumerism must be immanent, must follow a consumerist logic of
               its own. The difficulty of such acknowledgement is that it makes critique difficult
               to distinguish from complacency. Whatever alternative Keatsian and Baudelairian
               sympathy offers to capital, this alternative cannot be simply an alternative but must
               instead somehow constitute a second-order alternative, an alternative to the
               consumerist way of experiencing alternatives. Even stating the problem this way just
               reposes it, since the commodity’s constitutive “magic” is to promise the consumer
               escape from the limitations of actual, consumerist social life. But Keats and
               Baudelaire introduce a formally more intricate arithmetic to this problematic that
               might be termed “romantic ranking.” Rather than either reifying capitalism’s losers,
               or impossibly pretending to escape such reification only in order to reify failure as
               such, such ranking entails a second-order standard of comparison. Beyond the question
               of mere winning or losing it hinges on the subversively distinct question of the
               relative effectiveness of several instances of failure, subversive because this
               latter question stands to crystalize norms of value anchored not in commodities’
               magic itself but its underlying condition of necessary impossibility. Comparative
               ranking stands to make this condition vivid because it is inherently open-ended and
               cannot pretend to capture this condition definitively.</p>
               <p>At the conclusion of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Intimations Ode</title>, for
               instance, the image of the sunset does pretend to capture the same
               self-deconstructing imagination that had alienated the poet from nature, and this
               image thereby promises a kind of transcendence over such alienation. But the poet
               pointedly undermines this promise by calling it “another palm” in “another race.”
               With the formal insistence of a stutter the compound redundancy of these terms undoes
               the symbolic reintegration from within, staging a breakdown of the act of romantic
               lyric subjectivity. But this display of defeat doesn’t disown the pursuit of such
               subjectivity; instead this pursuit is re-cast as an ongoing race of days after an
               ever-elusive palm. Readers are thus enjoined to make rehearsal of the inevitable
               failure of this pursuit a new more modest kind of aesthetic aim, an aim that while
               implicitly masochistic is less violent than just suffering or suppressing such
               failure or, alternately, making the kind of mystified claim to transcending it that
               Jerome McGann called the Romantic Ideology. This is not to make failure the basis of
               just another disciplinary norm, but to wager a new more formally complex, tenuous and
               nonviolent mode of sustaining social normativity, weave enactments of failure as such
               into the texture of a new Wittgensteinian or Loy-ian “way of life”: one that
               supplants the ideology of romantic lyric selfhood by restaging its defunct vestiges
               in ways that elicit analogously theatrical responses. </p>
               <p>Lyric that communicates by way of reiterating more or less referentially opaque
               formal patterns stands vividly to model the kind of extreme egalitarianism theorized
               by many contemporary political theorists of radical democracy. Jacques Ranciere for
               instance characterizes the latter as “a new stage of equality”—the pun on stage
               significantly deflecting the <emph>norm</emph> of progressive development to the
                  <emph>form</emph> of theatricality—a stage where the “different kinds of
               performances would be translated into one another . . . linking what one knows with
               what one does not know, of being at the same time performers who display their
               competences and visitors or spectators who are looking for what those competences may
               produce in a new context” (22). Frances Ferguson’s <title level="m">Pornography, The
                  Theory</title> builds upon this leveling effect of aesthetic comparison to propose
               a revolutionary upending of Foucault’s still widely influential, disciplinary reading
               of Benthamite social structures. Ferguson suggests that such structures, compelling
               perpetual comparison and ranking of individual performances, doesn’t subjugate the
               particular to abstract knowledge, but on the contrary “capture actions and give them
               extreme perceptibility” (xiv). She writes that “The action that a sports team
               performs in winning a game is not a matter of their spirit or heart, because attitude
               disappears in the score, which makes their victory as much a matter of their
               opponents as themselves” (xiv). Ferguson’s Benthamite model doesn’t promise complete
               release from compulsory disciplinary exercise of sublime subjectivity, but it
               suggests a way of accepting the inescapability of modernity’s disciplinary regime
               while nonetheless managing to exercise the relative autonomy, and to access the
               modicum of pleasure, afforded by aesthetic judgment. Despite its apparent
               de-individuation, such ranking enables especially intense attention to the particular
               in a way that liberates normativity from abstraction, allowing value to be recognized
               in radically concrete terms. At the conclusion of the contest, socially normative
               value assumes eminently material and mortal form in a fleeting ranking of various
               human bodies’ relative success at some vicissitude of corporeal being. Because this
               model defines such being exclusively in terms of social comparison, the “extreme
               perceptibility” Ferguson evokes does not fetishize individual bodily wholeness but
               underscores its inherent elusiveness, its fantastic or ideological status. Hence the
               body’s pornographically heightened perceptibility prepares images of socially
               normative value that do not foster but undermine the ideology of possessive
               individualism. </p>
               <p>For instance, if Wordsworth’s Ode insists on the material provisionality of its own
               attempt to figure immortality by casting it as “another palm” in “another race,” his
               ballad “Simon Lee” does not directly praise the athletic heroics of the old
               huntsman’s past so much as posit the present inaccessibility of that past grandeur as
               a new normative poetic challenge. Rather than an elegy for the loss of the feudal
               cultural integrity emblematized by the young Simon’s athletic triumphs, Wordsworth
               casts his ballad as formally continuous with those old ritual contests. Thus the very
               act of mourning the loss of those contests is made into the basis for renewing them,
               although now on admittedly much more complex, tenuous terms, since competition now is
               less a matter of relative physical and aesthetic power than a matter of paradoxically
               acknowledging that modern skepticism can no longer abide the ideologically normative
               conceptualizations of such power.</p>
               <p>Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title>, which marshals a faculty
               psychology contrasting the functions of reason and imagination to defend poetry as a
               means of correcting the “inability to imagine what we know.” But as Shelley’s
               repudiation—in both this essay and in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>—of
               the atomic egoism and calculation typified by Milton’s Satan, attests, the
               individualistic model of selfhood that faculty psychology presupposes is itself a
               symptom of runaway rationalization, or, as Robert Kaufman has trenchantly emphasized,
               “calculation.” In a newly enlightened and ever more calculated and calculating age of
               industrial and consumer capitalism, the appeal to imagine symptomizes the same
               problem it laments in its inability to figure imagination otherwise than in terms of
               what Kant termed “the conflict of faculties.” For the common agency underlying
               Shelley conflicted faculties is one for whom the world has been reified and reduced
               to so much data and numbers to be processed and, especially, <emph>crunched</emph>.
               Hence Shelley’s emphasis on the metaphor of eating, lamenting that “we have eaten
               more than we can digest” as if the revolutionary imagination were but a supplement to
               reason, and salvation but a matter of activating a higher order organ in the
               consumerist GI system. But, the promise that consumerist frustrations can be resolved
               precisely by consuming <emph>more</emph> is <emph>the</emph> signature conceit of
               commodity fetishism’s topsy turvy world. </p>
               <p>This is to suggest that Shelley’s defense of poetry hinges crucially on a defense of
               the imaginative capacity specifically for <emph>irony</emph>, a defense he fittingly
               advances through performative demonstration (rather than rational justification or
               empirical corroboration) of this capacity. The former method is fitting not only
               because it better accommodates irony’s multiple layers of signification. As Shelley
               (again ironically deploying Lockean empiricist terminology) says of a joyous child’s
               spontaneous exclamation, poetry “administers to the cause by acting upon the effect.”
               If, as Shelley suggests, the specific “cause” of imagination particular to his time
               is that of dissolving the boundaries that confine “Satanic” individualism and the
               empiricist observer of cause and effect, then this is a cause that cannot be directly
               but only indirectly espoused (or “administered to”) by “acting upon the effect” of
               such dissolution. But if what is thereby dissolved is the model of calculating
               subjectivity that underpins the discourse of cause and effect, then effecting such
               dissolution is tantamount to <emph>a</emph>ffecting it: this dissolution is not
               represented as such but negatively evoked by ironizing the discourse that would
               represent it. Instead of pretending voluntarily to relinquish calculating
               subjectivity only thereby implicitly to affirm it on a deeper level, Shelley turns
               its very inescapability against it, evoking a non-calculating and incalculable
               subjectivity not as a determinate cause unto itself but as an emphatically absent
               cause, an irreducibly indeterminate “shadow of futurity” obscuring present
               calculations, making effects seem to blur into affects, without revealing any new
               word or measure to lead out of the darkness. </p>
               <p>Devotion to such an uncompromising irony, that allows resolution to figure only as a
               dim shadow of an unconceivable future, anticipates the rigorously negative aesthetics
               of art that, in Adorno’s words, “renounces happiness for the sake of happiness, thus
               enabling desire to survive in art” (15). It arguably also motivates Samuel Beckett’s
               famous directive, “Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.” Beckett’s injunction is
               instructive because it underscores that failure and hierarchical normativity are not
               mutually exclusive. Indeed, Keats suggests that they are even mutually
               implicating—that the force of failure cannot be registered unless situated in
               framework of normative comparison—in his rehearsals of the mortal poet’s impossible
               desire to seduce gods. The infinite coldness and impassivity of the urn and of
               Autumn, whose perpetual resistance of determinate meaning and purpose allows the poet
               to explore infinite performative variations on his inevitable failure.  Likewise both
                  <title level="m">Lamia</title> and the <title level="m">Eve of St. Agnes</title>
               emphasize that love is both incompatible with and <emph>requires</emph> time, that it
               is only from within a time-bound perspective that the erotic dream of timelessness
               can appear as such.  As <title level="m">Lamia</title> particularly emphasizes, gods
               fall in love with mortals who strive to be god-like, which is what gods cannot do: 
               there’s something wonderful about Lycius at the races appearing “like Jove” which
               Jove himself could never manifest. Lycius evokes temporal transcendence, just as
               Wordsworth had, by way of the trope of <emph>racing</emph>, as eminently human and
               temporal activity as there is.  Like <title level="m">Simon Lee</title>, <title level="m">Lamia</title> and the <title level="m">Eve of St. Agnes</title> rehearse
               the formal incapacity of narrative to contain its own story in ways that cannot be
               final and thus communicate only by eliciting contenting iterations of the same
               exercise. Thus the trajectory of <title level="m">Lamia</title>’s narrative follows a
               series of rival picturings of Lamia, from Lycius’s initial bejeweled fantasy of her,
               to his revised vision of her as the snake struck down by Apollo, to the communal
               fantasy of her that intoxicates the banquet, to Apollonius’s final determination of
               her as the merely animal snake. Indeed the whole series of Keats odes is profitably
               read as a rival reiterations of the act of submission before infinitely remote and
               cold goddesses. </p>
               <p>This series hangs together as such by virtue of turning failure into a kind of norm
               without thereby mitigating the specificity of particular instances of failure, each
               of Keats’s distinct poetic enactments of insufficient submission. Deleuze has
               emphasized a subversive potential in masochistic aesthetics that hinges upon a
               repetition of punishment by implied contract. The masochistic contract transforms
               punishment from an always somewhat contingent consequence of transgression that is to
               be <emph>awaited</emph> into a fantasy so zealously <emph>anticipated</emph> that it
               becomes integral to the transgression itself, transforming the latter into a kind of
               expression that thereby becomes plausibly, if paradoxically, a <emph>norm for
                  transmission as such</emph>. This plausibility is due to the willingness of the
               parties contracted to give up supposed subjective interiority in exchange for an
               enhancement in the aesthetic tangibility and richness of the normative, communicative
               bonds than bind—and indeed constitute—them as discursive and social agents.</p>
               <p>Perhaps Keats’s most vivid exploration of masochistic erotics is the following
               passage from the romance <title level="m">Lamia</title> in which Lamia rapturously
               describes her lover Lyscius: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>His passion, cruel grown, took on a hue</l>
                        <l>Fierce and sanguineous as ‘twas possible </l>
                        <l>In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.</l>
                        <l>Fine was the mitigated fury, like </l>
                        <l>Apollo’s presence when in act to strike </l>
                        <l>The serpent—Ha, the serpent! Certes, she</l>
                        <l>Was none. She burnt, she loved the tyranny (II, ll. 75-81)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Lamia is enraptured by Lyscius’s finely mitigated fury, his lack of
               swelling veins and so on, and she elaborates this rapture by drawing the comparison
               to Apollo in act to strike the serpent. The eroticism of the scene depends utterly
               upon the actor’s double consciousness, a consciousness that reaps pleasure from
               torment <emph>only to the extent that</emph> it can also simultaneously imagine being
                  <emph>merely</emph> tormented: Lamia may burn with a pleasure that attests to
                  <emph>not</emph> being a snake only, and precisely to the extent that, she also
               simultaneously sees herself as merely a snake. Lamia imaginatively plays out the
               scene of Apollo striking down the serpent as one of mechanical violence against a
               dumb beast in order to relish all the more acutely the incongruity of her burning
               passion. Lamia’s fantasy articulates her pleasure here in a way that implicitly
               functions to usurp Lyscius’s Apollonian power, making it a vehicle of her pleasure.
               If she, on the one hand, imagines Lyscius’s domination of her as a finely mitigated
               fury, a mechanical violence against a thing-like beast which she, on the other hand,
               knows she is not, then Lamia is the author and hence owner of his power. In short,
               this seems an importantly subversive but underappreciated way of exercising a kind of
               relative autonomy within hierarchical power structures, such as the cultural
               marketplace in which Keats participated and those “races” that seduced Lamia.</p>
               <p>The “Ode on Melancholy” effects an analogous inversion of what it means to vanquish
               rivals and win the “trophy” without pretending to dispense with structural hierarchy.
               The poem issues an argument that relishing despair is the condition of relishing joy,
               but the poem ultimately enacts despair by way of its very failure to contain despair
               in such an argument. The poem concludes: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Ay, in the very temple of Delight  </l>

                        <l>Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue  </l>
                        <l>Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;    </l>
                        <l>His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,      </l>
                        <l>And be among her cloudy trophies hung. (ll. 25-30)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> The overt message here is that an economic exchange is to be struck:
               that one may purchase bursting-rights to joy’s grape only by giving one’s soul as a
               trophy to melancholy. But such an exchange is implicitly shown to be frustrated by
               the fact that the two sides of the equation here are dialectically inextricable: just
               as Lamia’s burning passion depends upon her fantasy of Apollo in act to strike the
               serpent, the Sovran shrine is not sovereignty itself but a fantasy of sovereignty’s
               cold cruelty. Like Lyscius’s bloodless mitigated fury, Moneta’s blank face and the
               cold pastoral, the shrine is pallid in its emphatic idealization: its trophies are
               cloudy and, tellingly, its might has taste only for the soul. All this Apollonian
               abstraction serves to throw into relief the sensuousness of the tongue’s strenuous
               effort to burst the grape. But it also serves to explode the poem’s whole ostensible
               argument that sacrifice can be economized: that I could sacrifice myself to beauty
               and still retain the form of an autonomous, rationally choosing, individual
               consumer.</p>
               <p>This reading applies especially well to the image of the tongue strenuously working
               to burst the grape, since that image, as evocative as it is, can be difficult to
               conjure since a grape might seem too dense and rubbery to easily imagine bursting,
               whereas, although the tongue is powerfully muscular, its power is diffuse rather than
               penetrating. A remarkable thing about the image of the tongue however is that in
               addition to being the emblem of receptive taste on the one hand and poetic voice on
               the other, the tongue is also a preeminent image of corporal compulsion: its muscle
               is naked and free-floating, unhinged from the skeletal mechanism. The tongue
               represents aesthetic purposiveness without purpose in terms both of aesthetic
               receptivity and of autonomous poetic agency, but also precisely the opposite of this;
               i.e., insatiable exertion, wild convulsions in the void, a terrifying rather than
               edifying, monstrous rather than beautiful, disconnection from use, purpose or effect.
               What the two aspects of Keats’s image finally do then is point out the dialectical
               inextricability of beauty and monstrosity. Keats’s images of the tongue's unhinged
               muscle and of the snake's mere animality revel in a kind of phallic humiliation,
               flaunt it like a trophy. </p>
               <p>Reading the image this way also makes it, as an image, <emph>self</emph>-frustrating,
               since the image does something at odds with what it’s supposedly saying. Thus this
               masochistic aesthetic is not just communicated by the poem’s rhetoric, but is
               integral to the operation of that rhetoric as such, a contract to which we as readers
               might or might not choose to make ourselves parties. To choose to do so is to
               anticipate one’s own personal frustration but it is also thereby to cast that
               frustration not as idiosyncratically one’s own but as a moment in a social series. As
               Leo Bersani has compellingly suggested, the subversive potential of subaltern
               sexuality stems not from divestment but investment in <emph>norms</emph> of
               sociability, specifically what he terms “impersonal intimacy” (69).</p>
               <p>Democracy’s historical symbiosis with capitalism makes it easy to underappreciate its
               revolutionary normative investment in failure: in defeat, not as something coercively
               compelled but freely conceded, the willingness of leaders voluntarily to cede power
               in consequence of popular opinion. Blake’s “The Lamb” evokes this by casting
               democratic equality as the shadow of authoritarian hierarchy. Its counterpart song,
               "The Tyger," is an iconically romantic example of form assimilating content as the
               poem’s compulsive rhythm provides an answer of sorts to its queries about the origin
               of power. But this answer works as a answer only by virtue of to some degree
               deflecting these queries; Blake evokes sublimity by demonstrating a failure to
               representationally contain it, inviting readers to give up the attempt to transmit a
               certain knowledge or meaningful content in favor of perpetuating a certain formal
               pattern. But it seems crucial that this pattern does not altogether displace the
               concern for representational content; rather it is a pattern precisely
                  <emph>of</emph> displacements of the concern for such content; likewise Ranciere’s
               new stage of equality remains dialectically dependent upon the mystifications of
               power and knowledge that they would dispel. The promised autonomy is always only
               relative. Such equivocation is engaged by the form of "The Lamb" to a degree that
               that of "The Tyger" doesn’t allow. For instance, where the latter only poses
               questions, and thereby upholds the conceit of sublimely unequivocal answers, "The
               Lamb" also wagers answers that it can’t deny remain rhetorical. Such equivocation
               bespeaks less than complete enthrallment to sublime power, and allows a more nuanced
               kind of rhythm to emerge, a rhythm <emph>of</emph> such equivocation itself. Yet the
               lamb is a nonetheless radical critique of hierarchical power, which is most trenchant
               in its parody of catechism as an exercise in grammatical declension, mocking the
               pretense to divine instruction as a exercise in distinguishing among first, second
               and third person just as Blake’s plate for the “The Fly” evoked the game of badminton
               to mock Cartesian dualism.</p>
               <p>It’s tempting to view the Lamb as a relatively facile, utopian dissolution of
               hierarchy; not just the pedagogical hierarchy separating teacher and pupil, adult and
               child, but also those distinguishing between human and animal and god and human. But
               hierarchy is unequivocally affirmed in the form of an abstracted, impersonal
               imperative—“little lamb, god bless thee”—a command that is addressed to neither a
               first personal <emph>I</emph> or second personal <emph>you</emph> but a third person
               of a higher order, god. The reader is invited to read this third person as simply the
               outcome of the leveling of the hierarchically divided first and second person; yet
               this ostensible dissolution of hierarchy conceals its implicit reinstatement in the
               form of a subject who is, so to speak, more equal than the others by virtue of its
               prerogative to speak to and for god. Thus Blake undermines his own poem’s promise to
               absolve the concretely, even violently differentiating grammar of language and of
               hierarchical social power. Instead he demonstrates how our very intimation of divine
               meekness and disenfranchisement dialectically depends upon unjustifiable claims to
               commanding power. Like Ranciere, Blake doesn’t abolish hierarchy in the classroom but
               virtualizes it: theatricalizes it to the point that my authority to catechize you
               ultimately derives from nowhere but my capacity to emulate your teachability. This is
               not to dissolve hierarchy so much as to effect a shift in its ontological status:
               hierarchy is no longer a worldly reality but a theatrical fantasy that, itself
               unreal, necessarily frames any presently conceivable reality. If drawing this
               distinction doesn’t <emph>realize</emph> utopian egalitarianism, it enables an at
               least relatively autonomous play of aesthetic spectatorship that is empowered if not
               to <emph>level</emph> arbitrary authorities then at least to expose their
               arbitrariness: to draw analogies between ostensibly real forms of ecclesiastic
               authority and apparently contingent forms of grammar. Dissolving ourselves
               collectively into these quantities of first, second, and third persons finally
               mobilizes such contingency as what Ferguson characterized as an aesthetic residue of
               heightened perceptibility, a rhythmic pattern whose sheer aesthetic there-ness opens
               readers up to a perspective that is beyond the will to know and command but also
               short of Dionysian or divine ecstasy; a non-domineering attentiveness, a curiosity to
               explore the world structured around these hierarchies of power if not escape it; to
               discover and learn in more promiscuous and variegated ways than those hierarchies
               have time for. Thus the pornographic image engages what Ferguson construes as
               romantic formalism’s “sense of form per se, the ability to continue a series or a
               pattern, in a way that ceases to rely altogether on the existence of any object.“
               According to Ferguson, where modern criticism tends to see a sublime “gap” [between
               subject and object, norm and fact, self and other, etc.], Romantic formalism “sees an
               interval . . . . The interval represents the formalist discovery of the patterning of
               language as at least as important as its ostensible referents.” Romantic formalism
               makes communication just as much a matter of reference as “the spirit animating
               paraphrase, an exchange of what you mean for what I would say, and in which the
               coordination of meaning counts neither as oppression nor as formal accident” (<title level="m">Solitude and the Sublime</title> 169). </p>
               <p>In conclusion it seems worth noting that ranking is arguably the characteristic bane
               of the contemporary humanities academy. On the one hand, to the extent that one is at
               all beholden to a Marxian framework of analysis, one is committed to rooting out
               homogenization of value. On the other hand however, due to increasing
               commercialization of the academy and more broad-scale socioeconomic pressures, actual
               academic praxis is ever more implicated in just such homogenization, whether in the
               form of grading coursework, making admissions and hiring decisions, appraising the
               teaching and research of subordinates and peers, and evaluating grant proposals,
               departments and institutions, not to mention being on the receiving end of evaluation
               by peers, superiors and, now more insistently and consequentially than ever,
               students.</p>
               <p>But the lesson of the above, and of so much humanistic critique, is one that bears
               repeating: the only way out is deeper in. To return to “The Fly:” if Cartesian
               conceptualism reduces life to a game of badminton, then the lesson is not to replace
               this violence with equally conceptual espousal of nonviolence. The lesson is instead
               to try to tarry with the negative side of Blake’s analogy, to accept as such the game
               we’ve been unwittingly playing all along, to inhabit its rhythms and form, and
               thereby—“spontaneously” as it were—find ourselves embodying a less violent, more
               lyrical “way of life.”</p>

               Galperin, Jonathan Kramnick, Ann Jurecic, and Sean Barry for many helpful
               conversations, and for their comments to earlier versions of this essay.</p>
               <p>Coleridge’s most orthodox concerns sometimes led him to unorthodox conclusions. In
                  <title level="m">Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit</title>, for instance, his
               defense of human autonomy and agency caused him to identify the Bible as a human
               document rather than a divinely dictated set of revelations. Coleridge was deeply
               invested in the Biblical writers’ status as full human agents, not mere vessels for
               the inspired word. In <title level="m">Confessions</title> he makes this argument
               most forcefully as a claim about poetry, specifically about the Biblical poet King
               David: <quote>[L]et me once be persuaded that all these heart-awakening Utterances of
                     <emph>human</emph> hearts—Men of like faculties and passions with my own [...]
                  are but as a “Comedia Divina” of a superhuman—O bear with me, if I say,
                  Ventriloquist—that the Royal Harper, to whom I have so often submitted myself as a
                  “many-stringed instrument” [...] was as mere an instrument as his Harp, an
                     <emph>automaton</emph> Poet, Mourner, &amp; Supplicant—all is gone! all
                  sympathy, at least, all <emph>example</emph>! (<title level="m">Shorter
                     Works</title> II:1136)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On
                     the <title level="m">Confessions</title> see especially Balfour and Harding. On
                     the “automaton Poet” passage’s relation to inspiration and literary agency, see
                     Schaffer (especially 77-8) and Barr.</note>
                  </quote> Coleridge—or his persona—will submit himself to the poet, a mere
               “instrument” to be played, such that “every several nerve of emotion, passion,
               thought, that thrids the <emph>flesh-and-blood</emph> of our common Humanity responds
               to the Touch” (1136). But the poet himself must be no such passive thing.
               Importantly, Coleridge pursues this argument about the integrity of human action not
               by appealing to scriptural authority, but instead to a more self-evident fact about
               reading: that readers have bodies, and those bodies feel. Poetry is an example—in
               fact, <emph>the</emph> example—of free human action, and that freedom is crucial both
               for the historical efficacy of writing and the experience of reading. The issue at
               stake is not the authority of scripture, but the value of poetry. Historical actors
               cannot be made into automata, especially if they are poets.</p>
               <p>This essay is about the privilege poetry enjoyed as a marker for a particular
               Romantic-era argument about the mind’s internal structure. Coleridge’s repudiation of
               the “automaton poet” is but one example of the overdetermined status of poetry in
               Romantic-era philosophy of mind. His most frequent target was the materialist claim,
               launched from various angles throughout the period, that if the mind was identical
               with its physical substrate (the pineal gland, the vital spirits, the nerves, or the
               brain), then it could be divided into, or reduced to, its component parts. Poetry, on
               the other hand—as Coleridge famously puts it—“brings the whole soul of man into
               activity” (<title level="m">Biographia</title> II:13). The first part of this essay
               shows how, on this argument, poetry modeled cognition as at once an embodied process,
               and one that could not be divided into its component parts. I then turn to an
               alternative formulation in <title level="m">Waverley</title>, where Walter Scott
               embraces "automatic" <emph>poiesis</emph>, or something like it, in the character of
               Davie Gellatley, the cognitively disabled minstrel of Tully-Veolan. With Davie, Scott
               toys with the notion of reducing lyric expressivity to the brute elements of
               memorization and counting time. He thus raises the specter of the “automaton poet”
               that Coleridge had sought to exorcise. I conclude with a look at the broader turn
               Scott signals toward this competing account of the poetic mind, which gained
               particular traction in late Romantic Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>Coleridge had already invoked the “automaton poet” in <title level="m">Biographia
                  Literaria</title>, in order to accuse David Hartley’s associationist system of
               being deterministic. According to Hartley, Coleridge alleges: <quote>The inventor of
                  the watch did not in reality invent it; he only looked on, while the blind causes,
                  the only true artists, were unfolding themselves. [ . . . ] So must it have been
                  with Mr. SOUTHEY and LORD BYRON, when the one <emph>fancied</emph> himself
                  composing “RODERICK,” and the other his “CHILDE HAROLD.” (119-20) </quote>
               Hartley, in other words, implies an insult to the dignity of poetic activity much
               like the insult Coleridge takes in the <title level="m">Confessions</title>, on
               behalf of the Davidic psalms. The writing processes of Southey and Byron are sacred
               enough to be juxtaposed with the image of the watch and watchmaker, an analogy of
               mechanical operation with strong echoes of natural theology. The so-called “blind
               causes” would assail divine creativity, but also willful human action, for which
               poetry is the metonym of choice: it proves that we are not mechanical beings.</p>
               <p> While this argument culminates in Coleridge’s allusion to the imagination as a
               transcendental faculty, it begins with a claim about how the mind is organized. The
                  <title level="m">Biographia</title>’s most sustained objection to association
               theory is that it makes people into automata because of its impoverished model of the
               sensorium. Because in Hartley’s system impressions were tied to particular physical
               locations, Coleridge argues, they could only influence one another by “proximity in
               place,” and the whole of mental life would reduce to a set of determined interactions
               between them. “[I]nstead of being the determining causes of association,” then, “the
               will, the reason, the judgement, and the understanding [...] must needs be
               represented as its <emph>creatures</emph>, and among its mechanical effects” (I:110).
               Setting aside the question of whether Coleridge was taking aim at a straw man here,
               the result was an insistence that mental functioning hinged on central
                  processing.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For the argument
                  that Coleridge chose Hartley as an easy, “dated” target by comparison with more
                  contemporaneous biologies of mind, see Richardson 9ff.</note> Mindedness may
               involve many different abilities, but its core is one centralized power that can take
               hold of the “immense” and “unwieldy spectacle” presented by sensation. Poetry offered
               a model of such central processing. Increasingly aligned with “feeling” (at once a
               term for embodied response and inward, subjective experience), poetry offered to
               demonstrate most robustly that the mind was one single, indivisible entity, which had
               access to the full storehouse of signifiers to use according to its will or whim. If
               people have diverse faculties, poetry “brings the whole soul of man into activity,
               with the subordination of its faculties to each other, according to their relative
               worth and dignity” (II:15-16). The poet, whether Southey, Byron, or King David,
               imaged a mental life that coordinated the sum total of experience to the purposes of
               free human action.</p>
               <p>Entangling his claim about mental processing with a claim about poetry was a risk,
               since Coleridge’s model of <emph>poeisis</emph> was hardly the only one in
               circulation at the time. Walter Scott’s <title level="m">Waverley</title>, for
               example, invokes quite a different model of poetic production. Scott’s most striking
               figure of the poetic process is another David: not the Biblical psalmist, but the
               minstrel figure Davie Gellatley, the Baron of Bradwardine’s cognitively-disabled
               attendant, who first enters <title level="m">Waverley</title>’s pages singing “with
               great earnestness, and not without some taste, a fragment of an old Scotch ditty”
               (41). Davie has a penchant for memorizing scraps of traditional songs, and he sings
               apparently by rote, taking advantage of what the novel calls his “prodigious memory"
               (58). It is an openly pondered question—by the narrator, and by local gossips—whether
               he knows more than he lets on, or simply repeats without understanding the songs he
               learned in childhood. When he first approaches Waverley, Davie is totally engrossed
               in his minstrelsy, to the point that he fails to notice Waverley and almost runs into
               him. When Waverley asks him (“though with little hope of receiving answer to any
               constant question”) if Baron Bradwardine is at home, Davie “replied, and, like the
               witch of Thalaba, ‘still his speech was song’”: <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> “This,” the narrator archly explains, “conveyed no information”
               (41).</p>
               <p>Presumably sticking close to Waverley’s point of view, the narrator here suggests
               that Davie’s recitation is a kind of automatically-prompted tune. The comedy of the
               scene derives from Davie’s response to a serious question with an apparently
               whimsical association: a reflex-like turn to his mental storehouse of verse, whether
               memorized by rote or “remixed” from multiple balladic sources. The song draws its
               proper names and its keywords from traditional ballads, notably “Burd Ellen and the
               Young Tamlane.” Burd Ellen is a disaffected mother who, when the young Tamlane asks
               her to rock their child, replies bitterly, before Tamlane goes to sea. The first line
               of the ballad locates her sitting “in her bower window” (Child I:256). So, although
               Scott’s footnote asserts that the song is “original,” the model of authorship
               actually at work draws on existing sources, takes meanings out of context, and
               splices them into the word-game or children’s rhyme that appears in the text.</p>
               <p>I am thinking here of Alan Richardson’s reading of Davie as a figure marking a
               historical shift in the way cognition was understood: rather than a general slowness
               of thought, Davie’s disability is characterized by a selective
                  <emph>overdevelopment</emph> of one particular aptitude—the lyrical—at the expense
               of others. Richardson links selective overdevelopment to the nascent “biological
               psychology” that would culminate in phrenology, and which generates a small
               repertoire of “‘partial’ idiots” in Romantic literature (164). It is telling, though,
               that Davie’s selective ability is for poetry, rather than some other task. He is not
               an “automaton poet,” but his poetic practice seems associative or automatically
               prompted, a poetics of the "fancy" that runs afoul of Coleridge’s association of
               poetry with rationality and freedom. </p>
               <p>This rote poetics would have invoked a long history of identifying the prodigious
               with the mechanical, or indeed with the “automatic.” It was Descartes’ description of
               selective overdevelopments, after all, that underwrote the eighteenth-century
               discourse of automation, as well as arguments about the relation between humans and
               nonhuman animals. For Descartes, mind and body were two separate substances, and
               while he argued that the mind was immaterial, unitary, and free, he did so by
               painting a thoroughly mechanistic picture of both the human body and of animals
               (which he conceived as mindless bodies). Unlike humans, animals simply acted
               according to the disposition of their various organs, and even their greatest
               abilities could be regarded as symptoms of mindlessness. When animals outdo humans,
               Descartes writes: <quote>the fact that they do better than we do, does not prove that
                  they are endowed with mind, for in this case they would have more reason than any
                  of us, and would surpass us in all other things. It rather shows that they have no
                  reason at all, and that it is nature which acts in them according to the
                  disposition of their organs, just as a clock, which is only composed of wheels and
                  weights is able to tell the hours and measure the time more correctly than we can
                  do with all our wisdom. (1:117)</quote> Since animals are essentially machines on
               this argument, they can dramatically outperform humans at particular, highly
               selective tasks, but cannot display the general “dexterity” that characterizes the
               human. Descartes’ favorite metaphor for such automatic, mechanical tasks—and one
               still at work when Coleridge repudiates “blind causes”—was the clock, which counts
               time with great precision because of its underlying mechanism. Birds may sing
               adeptly, and parrots or magpies may be skilled at retaining words, but those remain
               isolated, context-specific skills, the product not of mental states, but of “wheels
               and weights.”</p>
               <p>One of the most direct retorts to that Cartesian position was Locke’s insistence that
               birdsong itself could not be an automatic activity. While <emph>hearing</emph> a tune
               could “mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal Spirits” in a bird’s brain,
               which would “contin[ue] on to the Muscles of the Wings,” Locke attributes this to the
               role song could play in warning a bird of danger and “tend[ing] to the Birds
               Preservation.” But Locke can find no such explanatory basis for automation in
                  <emph>singing</emph>, “which imitation can be of no use to the Bird’s
               Preservation” (154-5). Not even poetry, but the birdsong to which it is compared in
               caricatures of Romantic poetics, was too willful an activity to be considered
               automatic. For Locke, song breaks free from the explanatory power of material
               psychology.</p>
               <p>Figures like Davie Gellatley—those dexterous at keeping time, memorizing tunes, or
               playing with phonemic and prosodic patterns—would have challenged that equation of
               song with undetermined action, and would have recalled instead the time-keeping of
               the Cartesian clock. If Davie is, as Alan Richardson suggests, a figure for an
               increasingly material, differentiated model of the mind-brain that was emerging in
               the first decades of the nineteenth century, then his variety of popular song
               additionally offers an alternative to the rational, imaginative, or “organic” models
               of cognitive functioning that appear as recognizable commonplaces in Romantic
               discourse. This ground is increasingly being explored by scholars working on the
               ballad, the “lesser lyric,” and Romantic poetry’s origins in popular narrative and
               communal song—a body of traditional literature that proceeds collectively, by drawing
               together disparately memorized materials, and without necessarily having recourse to
               the expressive or sentimental protocols typically ascribed to the construction of the
               lyric in the period.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the
                  Romantic lyric’s entanglements with an earlier, balladic history see especially
                  Newman and McLane.</note> Scott’s deployment of the “automaton poet” figure
               signals a different Romantic model of poetry, as well as a different sense of what
               poetic activity illuminates about human mental life.</p>
               <p>At around the same time that Scott was beginning his series of <title level="m">Waverley</title> novels, a new generation of materialists found in poetry
               evidence of the sub-rational, quasi-automatic basis of the mind. George Combe, the
               Edinburgh-based phrenologist, proselytized his new science with case studies that
               resonate strongly with Davie. In the <title level="m">Transactions of the
                  Phrenological Society</title>, for instance, he notes as particularly illustrative
               those “cretins,” who, though “endowed with weak minds, are born with a partic[ul]ar
               talent,” such as “for copying paintings, for rhyming, or for music” (32). Combe’s
               paradigmatic example is the latter: the local, Scottish example of the “tuneful
               idiot.” He writes, “In Edinburgh, an idiot is seen upon the streets who whistles
               correctly several tunes, but cannot connect three abstract ideas; while we all know
               men of powerful intellects, who cannot perform three notes of the gamut” (30).
               Examples of such selective abilities, which Combe presents as if they would be
               familiar to anyone, serve as a kind of common sense evidence for a (supposedly
               intuitive) materialist account of the mind. Combe concludes, in fact, that “When
               these facts are seen and considered by men of plain sense they are impressed with the
               conviction that the human mind is endowed with a variety of powers,” and that those
               powers are equivalent to particular organs in the brain (30). This “conviction” is
               actually something that Combe, alluding to the firm foothold phrenology found north
               of the Tweed, calls a bit of Scottish “common sense,” as opposed to an ostensibly
               English prejudice in favor of the mind’s unity.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Combe 29ff, especially his discussion of Thomas Reid’s
                  reception in England.</note> Scots are predisposed, in other words, to the
               material hypothesis. And, tellingly, they are so predisposed because of examples like
               Davie Gellatley.</p>
               <p>Poetry here serves as a window into cognitive functioning for very different reasons
               than it does in Coleridge’s writing. Yet even in this more materialist climate, the
               lure of poetry as a quintessentially human activity—as an act of the whole mind—does
               not go away quite so easily. One anecdote about Robert Burns, with which I will
               conclude, demonstrates the legacy of the centralized, holistic model of lyrical
               cognition in late Romantic Edinburgh’s phrenological circles. On March 31, 1834
               Burns’s body was exhumed from its grave, in order (as one commentator put it), to
               “suppl[y] what had so long been desiderated by phrenologists—a correct model of our
               immortal poet’s head.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

               launched what remained a major source of interest in Scottish phrenological

               Combe’s birth, in fact, one of the keynote addresses was a lay sermon that in place
               of theology, used phrenological theory; and in place of scripture offered a reading
               of the song “A Man’s a Man.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

               One of the more interesting documents in what we might call this phrenological Burns
               canon is Robert Cox’s discussion of the 1834 cranial measurements, his <title level="m">Essay on the Character and Cerebral Development of Robert Burns</title>.
               The <title level="m">Essay</title>, which first appeared in the <title level="j">Phrenological Journal</title> that same year, and was reprinted by Alexander
               Stewart (the curator of the Edinburgh Phrenological Museum) for a “centenary
               celebration” of the poet’s birth, is a medically-based character study (18).
               Medicalized diagnosis was already an important part of the tradition of Burns
               biography, as Nigel Leask has recently demonstrated.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Leask reads Currie’s <title level="m">Life of Burns</title>
                  as a “psychopathology of genius” (283).</note> Where texts like James Currie’s
                  <title level="m">Life of Burns</title> (1800) grounded their analysis in a
               philosophy of the will, though, Cox reads Burns’s character by correlating his poetry
               with his cranial measurements, and cataloguing the various organs those measurements
               supposedly represented. The <title level="m">Essay</title> catalogues the lot of
               them: the “organ of Tune,” the organ of “Adhesiveness” or sociability, the organ of
               secretiveness, and so on. Those which appeared slightly larger or more
               developed—especially the organs of “amativeness” and “love of approbation”—would,
               according to phrenology’s main tenet, help confirm or explain Burns’s notorious
               proclivities and failings.</p>
               <p>It is surprising, then, that after detailing such particularly developed areas, Cox
               concludes that those differences were minor: “none of the regions of Burns’s brain
               was, relatively to the others, deficient; its total size, we have also seen, was
               great, and its activity was uncommon” (9). Though all of Burns’s organs were
               exceptionally large, in other words, they were all of more or less the same size: he
               was a rare specimen of an exceptional, well-rounded brain. Cox perhaps owed this
               concession to literary-critical precedent. He immediately cites Dugald Stewart’s
               “well-known” pronouncement that “all the faculties of Burns’s mind were, as far as I
               could judge, equally vigorous; and his predilection for poetry was rather the result
               of his enthusiastic and impassioned temper, than of a genius exclusively adapted to
               that species of composition” (10). He no doubt also owed a great deal to Burns’s
               status as a national hero, someone who ought to be carefully distanced from the image
               of the rural, “tuneful Idiot,” gifted at numerous verse, but “deficient” in other
               matters.</p>
               <p>In Cox’s <title level="m">Essay</title>, then, poetry becomes a general or
               undifferentiated ability once again, but only because it is the sum of many smaller,
               discrete abilities, which happen to have developed equally. Cox’s praise of Burns’s
               poetic abilities thus cites many individual strengths—like “philoprogenitiveness,” a
               “sympathy for weak and helpless objects in general” that could have attuned Burns to
               the plight of a field-mouse—but culminates in generalities like his “force of
               character,” the “respect which men instinctively paid him,” and the “native dignity”
               he evinced when among great literary minds (9). By backing away from phrenology’s
               emphasis on local, discrete cognitive powers toward this picture of general
               well-being, balance, and health (a brain in which “none of the regions [...] was,
               relatively to the others, deficient"), Cox accommodates the divided mind to the idea
               of poetry as a unified or coordinated act. The model of poetic production invoked
               here owes a debt to the longstanding, Coleridgean emphasis on “the whole soul of
               man”—but reconstitutes it in the new language of the material, divisible mind.
               Coleridge and Cox agree, in other words, that poetry deserving of the name is the
               product of the whole person. What makes a poet is not the honing of one specialized
               faculty, such as a prodigious memory, but an engagement with the full domain of human
                  experience.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On poetry’s
                  claim to a general sphere of knowledge in the context of Romantic-era disciplinary
                  formation, see Valenza 139ff.</note> Cox’s <title level="m">Essay</title> suggests
               that one might agree about what poetry must do—bring faculties into a unified
               harmony, and speak to “the whole soul of man”—but disagree radically about the
               cognitive architecture underlying the act. Rather than invoking a centralized power,
               Cox’s model of the great poet simply implies disparate faculties, possessed in equal
               measures. A great poet might need to operate <emph>as if</emph> his mind were whole
               and unified.</p>
               <p>The “as if” at work in Cox’s rhetoric—the approximation of poetic activity as a mere
               semblance of a unified mental power—is a formulation that continues to bear on the
               ways that “the literary” appears in more recent approaches to “the literary
                  mind.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For “the literary
                  mind” in the context of interdisciplinary literary studies, see Turner.</note> One
               tendency in such studies is to attempt to explain literary production as the success
               of particular, domain-specific skills, whether those skills are attributed to
               discrete, encapsulated “modules” in the brain, to neurological zones that light up on
               an fMRI, or simply to evolutionary adaptations. Thus, on one popular evolutionary
               account of what literature does, fiction “constitutes an adaptation in its own right”
               because it “exercis[es] our capacities for handling social information.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Brian Boyd’s is one of the
                  best-known versions of this particular use of evolutionary theory (<title level="m">On the Origin of Stories </title>189, 190). For a critique of the
                  impulse to explain literature as an adaptation, see Kramnick.</note> The same
               author describes the lyric in similar terms, but as a manifestation of a different
               basic drive, “the human disposition to play with pattern.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an application of evolutionary theory to
                  the lyric, see Boyd, <title level="m">Why Lyrics Last</title>.</note> In terms of
               literary form, those descriptions may ring vaguely true. The latter description of
               lyric, for instance, is strongly reminiscent of Davie Gellatley’s penchant for tunes
               and for wordplay, a selective ability that the generation after Scott frequently
               associated with impoverishment in other realms.</p>
               <p>There are other ways to approach literature from the sciences, however. Some seek
               more broadly to understand embodied experience and its relation to literary practice.
               In her essay “Making Quite Anew: Brain Modularity and Creativity,” Ellen Spolsky
               defines artistic creativity in terms of the modular mind (a more recent model of the
               mind as consisting of many distinct, encapsulated processes, rather than a central,
               undifferentiated process).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                  Like the disagreement represented in this essay by Coleridge and Cox, the more
                  recent philosophical debate around modularity centers on the question of central
                  processing: how much mental functioning can be attributed to innate, functionally
                  specific, encapsulated mechanisms, and how much remains the domain of centralized
                  functions like reasoning and decision-making. For the classic starting point of
                  these discussions, see Fodor. For the “massive modularity” argument, which reduces
                  central processing to a minimum, see Cosmides and Tooby. For a more recent
                  overview of the debate, see Barrett and Kurzban. </note> On her argument, because
               people’s cognitive categories emerge as the result of different, often competing
               modular systems, on occasion “[s]ignificant and stubbornly resistant conflicts may
               emerge.” It is at such moments, Spolsky argues, that “we might observe the work of
               particularly imaginative artists feeding a community facing a particularly hungry
               cognitive problem by re-representing the situation in a different modality” (94). In
               Spolsky’s example of Raphael’s <title level="m">Transfiguration</title>, the
               cognitive systems deployed by (Biblical) textual information needed to be transposed
               onto those used to process visual information (85). As with Coleridge’s definition of
               poetry, a quintessentially human ability—here “creativity”—acquires its rhetorical
               force by emphasizing an ability to cross between encapsulated realms of experience.
               Of course, Spolsky’s argument also resembles Robert Cox’s reformulation of that
               Coleridgean argument, in his picture of Burns as a gifted individual (like Spolsky’s
               Raphael) who is able to compensate for the constraints ordinarily imposed by the
               mind’s dividedness.</p>
               <p>Spolsky’s argument joins an increasingly audible refrain in empirical approaches to
               literature, one that emphasizes “culture” and “literariness” as qualities worth
               pursuing on their own terms. That impulse—to show that “the literary” mirrors
               something about human cognitive architecture—has a long, Romantic history. Sometimes,
               “literature” names one faculty out of many that seems particularly “human”:
               narrative, social cognition, play with pattern, and so on. On this account, “the
               literary” continues to name those acts that are quintessentially human. But this
               version of “literature” is now defined according to many discrete abilities rather
               than Coleridge’s synthetic power. In other cases, the impulse is still to describe
               “literature” (or “creativity”) as a triumph of the whole mind over its parts, of
               central processing over modularity. There are several ways to read that impulse. One
               would be to see it as an endeavor in the spirit of Coleridge, where an emerging
               interdisciplinary language offers critics a new purchase on humanistic concepts.
               Another, somewhat less utopian, would be to compare it to Robert Cox’s dilemma: he
               needed, on the one hand, to gesture toward domain-general creativity or literariness,
               because they are the literary critic’s stock in trade; but he also needed to
               redescribe those concepts in terms of the new and largely antithetical methodology of
               phrenology, with its enumeration of the mind’s distinct and domain-specific organs.
               On this latter construal, invoking “the literary” is a simple matter of staking out
               disciplinary territory by scholars who in fact consider it an outmoded term—like
               Cox’s approximation of the unified poetic mind within a paradigm that had little
               room—or need—for it.</p>

               <p>Each of the papers in this second "set" traverses, we might say, a calculus and a
               discourse (lyric in Savarese and Earle, population theory in Broglio). They offer
               extremely different, yet complementary, routes into the terrain of “Romantic
               Number(s)”; they also resonate with some of the concerns of the first "set" of
               essays. Among the operations we encounter here: ranking, assembling, operating,
               making, surveying, enclosing, forecasting, measuring. One notes in this work an
               oscillation between quantitative and qualitative accountings—between the uncountable
               “mass” in Broglio and “mere countability” (to quote Earle) in Earle and Savarese.
               Here Hegel’s reflections in the <title level="m">Logic</title> might help clarify
               what is at stake: “<emph>Measure</emph> is a <emph>relation</emph>, but not relation
               in general, for it is the specific relation between <emph>quality</emph> and
                  <emph>quantity</emph>” (Volume One, Book One, General Division of Being, “Being,”
               §128). And: “Measure is the qualitative quantum, in the first place as immediate—a
               quantum, to which a determinate being or a quality is attached.<anchor xml:id="id_SL107n"/> Measure, where quality and quantity are in one, is thus the
               completion of Being” (“Measure,” §107).</p>
               <p>Whether the “cranial measurements” of Robert Burns’s skull (introduced as a case for
               reflection in Savarese) align with a Hegelian discourse of measure is doubtful:
               though certainly such excursions attest to the longstanding fantasy of generating
               “quality” (of mind, of genius, what have you) undialectically out of “quantity.” One
               finds in this longing for the materialization of mind—whether evidenced in
               phrenological or more current neuro-imaging technologies—a profound and in some ways
               disquieting continuity between the romantic period and our own, as Savarese makes
               clear. (On romanticism as a kind of cognitive science <emph>avant la lettre</emph>,
               see, for example, Alan Richardson. On the pleasures and dangers of the new “science”
               for literary study, see, e.g., Jonathan Kramnick, “Against Literary Darwinism,” and
               the array of responses in the Winter 2012 issue of <title level="j">Critical
                  Inquiry</title>; see too Saverese’s and Jager’s acute review essay on recent work
               in cognitive science and romanticism.) If faculty psychology would seem to be
               obsolete, contemporary theories of “the modular mind” (see Savarese) have re-opened
               the historical question of what precisely romantic poetry was supposed to do (as it
               were) for faculty psychology. “Being, as we first apprehend it, is something utterly
               abstract and characterless; but it is the very essence of Being to characterise
               itself, and its complete characterisation is reached in Measure,” writes Hegel.
               “Measure . . . may serve as a definition of the Absolute” (§107); measure also, in
               another key, manifests itself in historically inflected forms of techne and praxis,
               as these essays all demonstrate.</p>
               <p>Earle and Savarese are preoccupied by the question of poetry: for each, poetry has a
               special status in theories of mind, yet is also specifically embodied—whether in
               Savarese’s diagnostically “idiot minstrel,” Scott’s Davie Gellatley (“the cognitively
               disabled minstrel of Tully-Veolan” in <title level="m">Waverley</title>), or in the
               notional poet-athlete proposed by Mina Loy and amplified in Earle’s meditation. Earle
               explores a Benthamite refunctioning of romantic lyric, that notorious mode of
               defining and communicating individuality. Like Broglio, Earle reactivates a
               calculating discourse (here Benthamite “ranking” as opposed to the “counting” of
               population) to show how romantic lyric ceaselessly “stag[es] a breakdown of the act
               of romantic lyric subjectivity,” yet also invites us “to make rehearsal of the
               inevitable failure of this pursuit a new more modest kind of aesthetic aim.” He
               continues: <quote>This is not to make failure the basis of just another disciplinary
                  norm, but to wager a new more formally complex, tenuous and nonviolent mode of
                  sustaining social normativity, weave enactments of failure as such into the
                  texture of a new Wittgensteinian or Loy-ian “way of life.” </quote> Earle’s essay
               takes up Ferguson’s work such that romantic lyric emerges as a peculiarly triumphant
               way of reckoning with and dissolving “calculating subjectivity”—Earle’s Shelley, for
               example, “evoking a non-calculating and incalculable subjectivity not as a
               determinate cause unto itself but as an emphatically absent cause,” opening the space
               for an unforeseen future, anticipating “the rigorously negative aesthetics of
               art.”</p>
               <p>Earle’s essay explores a poetry which renounces knowledge transmission in favor of
               perpetuating a certain formal pattern. Savarese’s Scott also explores this
               possibility: “With Davie, Scott toys with the notion of reducing lyric expressivity
               to the brute elements of memorization and counting time. He thus raises the specter
               of the ‘automaton poet’ that Coleridge had sought to exorcise.” Building on previous
               scholars’ reckonings with Davie Gellatley, Savarese takes up the figure of automata
               haunting Scott, Coleridge, and romantic philosophy and <emph>poiesis</emph> more
               broadly. Hartleian mechanism here gets its due and its come-uppance, as Savarese
               incisively explores Scott’s minstrel’s materialist yet non-mechanistic
               time-keeping.</p>
               <p>Both Earle and Broglio speak to the socio-political implications of numbering and
               ranking operations: one might think of Earle’s essay as a Rancièreian meditation on
               the use and abuse of hierarchy for democracy, the problem of “staging” equality first
               emergent around 1800 and still very much with us. Broglio proposes an “ordering of
               life” which resists organization into “population”: surveying not only Malthus but
               other visual and textual representations of “the swinish multitude,” Broglio explores
               how “bodies resist quantification where biopower of the body cannot be subsumed by
               population, statistics, and homogenization of the biopolitical apparatus of capture.”
               Food—people’s preferences, aversions, local foodways—becomes in his account a crucial
               “way in which that the biopower of the masses, the swinish multitude, resist
               quantification.” Broglio astutely proposes “<emph>homo oeconomicus</emph>,” that bane
               of Horkheimer and Adorno (among others), as a peculiar opportunity emergent in the
               romantic period: with Foucault’s analytic of biopower in mind, Broglio observes that
                  <emph>homo oeconomicus</emph> is resistant to certain constructions of <emph>homo
                  legalis</emph> or <emph>homo juridicus</emph>. He further suggests (following
               Foucault) that the subject of interest (as the State conceives <emph>homo
                  oeconomicus</emph>) might escape the strictures of the subject of right (as the
               State previously construed <emph>homo juridicus</emph>); that the emergence of
               calculating, economic man (so passionately decried by Wordsworth and in Shelley’s
                  <title level="m">Defence</title>) offered in fact a moment of contingent freedom
               before regimens of governmentality were fully established and legitimized: <quote>In
                  other words, modes of quantification—counting bodies and counting them as citizens
                  of the State subject to its control—become the means of rhetorical and material
                  control of peoples. In contrast, <emph>homo oeconomicus</emph> uses qualitative
                  differences between peoples as a way of evading quantification and counting.
                     <emph>Homo oeconomicus</emph> leverages a biopower—the biological capacities
                  and resistances of bodies—as that which has yet to be co-opted by the
                  biopolitical.</quote>
                  <emph>Homo oeconomicus</emph>, on this account, can exploit qualitative differences
               (and here we might recall Earle’s discourse on ranking), however much he might also
               be counted by the census or massified into population tables or mustered into armies.
               There are many ways of being interpellated, these essays point out, incommensurate
               modes of becoming-a-(perceivable)-subject. </p>
               <p>If Earle proposes a kind of Beckettian “Fail Better” as an optimistic slogan we might
               embrace in a universe of ranked yet, because ranked, perceivable subjects, Broglio
               tells a story—despite flashes of chances for freedom—about the growth of a restricted
               economy and the loss of commons. Here we might think of other contemporary (re)turns
               to the commons, including Peter Linebaugh’s suggestion that we would do well to think
               of “the commons” as a verb, not a noun: “to common” (279): “[i]t might be better to
               keep the word as a verb, an activity, rather than as a noun.” Drawing on Linebaugh,
               Lauren Berlant writes in “Austerity, Precarity, Awkwardness”: <quote>It’s not “the
                  people,” but the common. Not “citizenship” or social membership or “belonging” but
                  “being with.” Not suffering or precarity, but awkwardness and a world-building
                  endurance. </quote> Berlant’s embrace of “awkwardness and a world-building
               endurance” chimes with Earle’s optimism-via-failure—a call for a deeper playing of
               the ranked game, a persistence and inclination toward other palms and other races we
               in common might yet run. Taken together, these essays offer a preliminary sketch of a
               political economy of Romantic perceptibility—whereby such formulations as “We are the
               99%” (say) become not the rallying cry of a swinish multitude nor the idiot-savant
               automatized chant of the lower ranks but the calling out of an emergent collectivity,
               uncapturable because nondenumerable by the State. This work helps us to think, both
               for the romantic period and our own, what we needs must feel.</p>
