            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Let me say one more thing about what women desire. It depends on the genre of course,
               if you go to the Gothic novel, you know, they are actually desiring the mad, bad dangerous
               to know man. And there is this whole issue of female sexual desire. <span style="font-weight:bold">[RE: . . . </span>[desire] for the father?<span style="font-weight:bold">]</span> Yes, female sexual desire getting mapped onto existing hierarchical relations. Or,
               and I’m really thinking now about <span class="italic">Zofloya</span>, getting mapped onto the totally inaccessible exotic other, whether he is Moor or
               Satan, as the novel finally wants you to think. I actually think he is the Moor, and
               then just because she is trying to impose a good conventional Christian ending, making
               it acceptable to her readers, so she turns him into Satan. But she is really desiring
               the racial other, the cultural other, the one that is really not available.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I just taught <span class="italic">The Italian</span> and what struck me there were the scenes of yearning for something else that isn’t
               contained by any of the figures in the text. All of those scenes of the sublime! Whatever
               is outside the window is really what is desired and it is nebulous.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Right, Vivaldi certainly doesn’t live up to it, or Valencourt.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I think Godolphin is an interesting object of desire in Charlotte Smith’s <span class="italic">Emmeline</span>, where we have a double hero. The unattractive hero fortunately dies midway through
               and then we have Godolphin associated with the sublime landscape, and his own kind
               of solitude, which seems a [better] possibility.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> What these women writers realize, starting with Wollstonecraft, and all the way through,
               it that there is a real crisis of masculinity in the Romantic era. On the one hand,
               you have the libertine rake, leftover from the eighteenth century, and the aristocratic
               Byronic figure, who is attractive but totally unsatisfying as husband material. Then
               you have the man of sensibility, who is weeping all of the time, ineffective and impotent
               in lots of ways, and so that’s not going to work, and they are really trying to imagine
               something else . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: . . . or the tyrant . . . and they often morph into each other over the course of
               a three-volume novel . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> They are really trying to define a new type of man. What Wollstonecraft defines as
               the modest man, the middle-class bourgeois professional, robust, benevolent figure,
               but they come across as kind of stick figures because [the writers] don’t have a lot
               of experience of such people. I’m thinking of Maria Edgworth’s <span class="italic">Belinda.</span> Mr. Percival is clearly the ideal man, but there aren’t a lot of him around and her
               heroine doesn’t get one. She gets a reformed rake in a way. Clarence Hervey, nice
               guy, but not very responsible or reliable and prone to make terrible mistakes. Mr.
               Knightley is sort of in that category, but he is a little too overbearing, and he
               lectures and hectors [Emma]. Wentworth is clearly Jane Austen’s attempt to define
               that new professional self-made man, but he also is capable of pride and jealousy
               and vindictiveness.</p>
