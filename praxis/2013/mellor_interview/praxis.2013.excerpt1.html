            <div>Recorded March 12, 2012 </div>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Do you feel that your work comes out of the classroom or do you see it more of as
               an organic process between research and teaching?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Interesting, whether it is organic. I mean, if you go right back to the beginning
               it came out of passions. You know, that I loved art history as much as I liked literature
               so I was looking around for something—a dissertation topic that would allow me to
               do visual culture as well as verbal culture. And that’s what led me to Blake, that
               and the fact that I had taken a fabulous graduate course when I was an undergraduate
               at Brown with S. Foster Damon, who was the great man who brought Blake into the canon.
               And then I was an undergraduate philosophy major, as well as English major, and so
               I had always been interested in philosophical questions, so that took me to the next
               project on Romantic Irony, which was really about a philosophical system, [and] what
               happens if you think of the universe as not having any order, as being profoundly
               chaotic.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: I was looking at <span class="italic">Romantic Irony </span>and I noticed that even there, your interest in visual culture is highlighted by the
               inclusion of a print at the opening <span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Yes, right, right!]</span> and you actually talk about the significance of that image . . <span class="italic">. </span></p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Yes, it is that great Thomas Bewick, little landscape, little man riding horseback
               through the landscape, and then his thumb print over it. Right, so, it exists but
               it doesn’t exist, and it exists as an authorial creation but it’s also a de-creation
               because he is erasing it. Yes, I was so happy [<span class="italic">Laughing</span>] when I found that little image, because it summed it all up.</p>
            <p class="noCount">And then it was—well, by then I was teaching at Stanford—it was the early 1980s. All
               through the Vietnam War I had been very caught up in anti-war efforts at Stanford
               and actually led the faculty move to get rid of ROTC on the Stanford campus, which
               they brought back last year [by the way]. And so time passes. [Anyway] out of that—out
               of all those liberation movements, you know, civil rights and the woman’s movement,
               and so on—in 1980 I made a professional oath, a political and personal oath to only
               work on women, because I hadn’t done much work on women, no one had in Romanticism.
               So that is when I started looking around for who were the under discussed and undervalued
               women in the period. Jane Austen of course, but there had been work on Austen. She
               wasn’t actually regarded as a Romantic but nonetheless there had been good solid scholarly
               work on her. </p>
            <p class="noCount">[So] I looked around and the next [author] was Mary Shelley and no one had actually
               spent much serious time thinking about <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span> because they had been dismissing it as a children’s book or science fiction, and
               therefore outside of the canon of Romanticism. And all the time I was in graduate
               school, I don’t think that I ever read anything by Mary Shelley except her notes on
               Percy Shelley’s poems. [<span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: <span class="italic">I’m quite sure that when I was an undergraduate I read absolutely nothing by any woman
                  writer of the period</span>].</p>
            <p class="noCount">Right. And the notion that <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span> [was ignored] in all of these courses on Romantic poetry as mythmaking [is amazing];
               [and] I was teaching them myself . None of [us] thought about <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span> as the greatest enduring myth from the Romantic period. It is the only one that is
               really still with us every day.</p>
