            <div>Recorded March 12, 2012 </div>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: Let’s conclude by thinking about where you see the field going. Where do you see
               the most promising work in the field of women writers? One thing that struck me was
               just how important the work in critical theory was during the 1990s when I was at
               UCLA with you. <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender</span> comes out of Anglo-American and French feminism, but also deconstruction and post-structuralism.
               Do you think we have a period like that now? Do you see one coming? Where is the promising
               work?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> I don’t know. I’ve been a little frustrated actually. I had thought by now there
               would be more systematic work on the women writers, the single-author, really in-depth
               researched projects ongoing and appearing and not as many have come along. We’ve gotten
               some good biographies of Hannah More, like Anne Stott’s biography of Hannah More.
               A lot of work on Mary Robinson because you can market that to a more commercial audience.
               But there are so many women writers in the period that don’t have this work. We don’t
               even have a really good single-author book detailing the entire career of Maria Edgeworth.
               Which is really amazing, if you think about it, since she was right up there with
               Jane Austen then, and even now widely read but not widely studied. Partly because
               she has been confined to Irish Studies and read from a particularly negative view.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> [She is there in] histories of education . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> …with her children’s writing. But not the major novels, for the most part. So, I
               think there is an enormous amount of work still to be done. Joanna Baillie? We don’t
               have a really good overview of her entire career. There is a biography now but not
               [enough] critical work. Catherine Burroughs’s book is excellent but it only goes so
               far. Women playwrights, women poets. We don’t have a really good book yet on Felicia
               Hemans, I mean an overview book. We have good editions of her poems, of <span class="italic">The Siege of Valencia, </span>but not a biography. Charlotte Smith! We still need a really good interpretive study
               [of her work].</p>
