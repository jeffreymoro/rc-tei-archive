            <p class="noCount">But I now realize that the reason I fell in love with those poems was because I fell
               in love with my teacher of those poems, D.J. Hughes, and those were his two favorite
               poems. He taught them with so much energy and enthusiasm and insight that I just became
               fascinated by Percy Shelley’s—way before the moment we had the language for it—deconstructive
               concept of language: how language creates the universe and creates its own next sentence:
               the infinite deferral of language. So, that’s what made me into a philosophy major.
               I got into thinking about all sorts of epistemological and ontological issues through
               Percy Shelley. So I actually owe my career to Percy Shelley.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: And I wonder too, from my perspective of you, [that] you are a political idealist
               in a lot of ways, <span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Oh yeah.]</span> and that’s clear from reading what you’ve written over the years. There is an aspect
               of [Shelley’s] <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> in your writing—it is so utopian—the difference is that you aren’t content with a
               retreat to the cave in the end.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> No, and I’m also not content with the unborn soul and the return to the originary
               chaos of Act IV of <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span>. I want to see actual social improvement on the ground in the world in which we actually
               live, not withdrawing into a cave either. And also, the more I worked on Mary Shelley,
               the more critical I became of Percy Shelley’s concept of gender and sexual relations,
               as well as of his personal biographical behavior to his wife and children.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: How were you taught <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span>? You taught me the poem.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: I was passing on the way I had been taught. D. J. Hughes was a poet himself [and]
               completely identified with Percy Shelley, so he read it as a great celebration of
               the power of metaphor. He has a wonderful article on coherence and collapse in “Epipsychidion”
               and so it was always how a metaphor generates another metaphor. Metaphor is never
               adequate unto itself. It really led me to the whole concept of Romantic Irony, which
               I got through Frederick Schlegel as well, but when I started thinking about it in
               relation to <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span>, that there is no stability in language finally but it is just the poet who creates
               the world, but then also undercuts it by creating another metaphor. So, that was the
               way I was originally reading <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span> and <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> and finally Romantic Irony as such.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Going back to <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span>, its that sister-spouse incest metaphor that <span class="italic">now</span> fascinates me because I think one of the things that’s going on there, is, if you
               think about incest as a primary Romantic trope, and think of it as the trope that
               is the dark underbelly of the overt political utopian thinking. When you have a celebration
               of hierarchy and patriarchy then the dark underside of that, of course, is father/daughter
               incest and Mary Shelley explores that and Percy Shelley explores that in <span class="italic">The Cenci</span>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But if you move to democracy as your alternative to patriarchy [and] to monarchy then
               the dark underside becomes—if everyone is created equal, if brothers and sisters are
               equal, we’re having liberty, equality, fraternity—then the dark underside becomes
               brother-sister incest; that the brother can only love Mary, the woman who is just
               like him. This is Manfred [too], the narcissist projection of the self as the one
               who completes the self. And this is also Percy Shelley in the essay on love: the prototype
               finding its antitype. And this is where <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span> ends, [with the] sister-spouse. So finally, all of those metaphorical accumulations
               come back to this narcissistic projection of the primary self.</p>
