            <p class="noCount">But a lot more work to be done in Romanticism particularly around religion. Because
               one of the things I’ve come recently to appreciate is how strongly different religious
               alliances impacted on women writers, more so than on male writers. Again, it is a
               sense of being involved in a community. But if you start out in the Unitarian community,
               as Anna Barbauld, Lucy Aikin, and Amelia Opie did, you end up in a very different
               place than when you start out say in Scotch Presbyterianism, which had an enormous
               impact—and we haven’t really understood this—on Joanna Baillie, on Elizabeth Hamilton,
               Susan Ferrier, partially because Scotch Presbyterianism was quite egalitarian. There
               were female presbyters in the eighteenth century. A very different sort of way of
               modeling human relationships and sex relationships comes out of the Church of England,
               [which is] a much more hierarchical and oppressive model to follow. So we need to
               think through that—and missionary work in relation to religion. So that is a big area
               that I think people will spend more time on in the future.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Science. Women and Science. Women’s active engagement and knowledge of science. The
               way scientific metaphors impact on all of Romantic writing. There is a lot more work
               to be done on that. I actually have a graduate student right now, Fusan Wang, who
               is doing really interesting work on inoculation and vaccination and how that . . .

            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: . . . which has a fascinating relationship to gender in England . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Well, because it starts with Mary Wortley Montagu and smallpox vaccination and then
               goes to Thomas Jenner. But once it gets to Thomas Jenner and cowpox being the vaccination
               for smallpox, you get this human/animal divide. A binary being broken down and all
               the complex and anxious responses to that notion of introducing the animal into—<span class="italic">an animal poison</span>—into the human system is really an interesting problematic for the period.</p>
