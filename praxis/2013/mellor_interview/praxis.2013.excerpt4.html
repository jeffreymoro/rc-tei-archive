            <div>Recorded March 12, 2012 </div>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AME:</span> I got interested in feminist science fiction back in the early 80s when it was modeling
               all sorts of alternative utopian possibilities for gender relations, [and] for sex
               identity. And it really got me thinking about what sex-based characteristics are really
               located in biology and which ones are social constructions. And that was when I was
               very much caught up with feminist theory and founded the Feminist Studies program
               at Stanford University. I had a reading group where we were—Nan Kahane was in it,
               I remember, and Shelley Rosaldo—where we were really actively interrogating all sorts
               of classical assumptions about sex differences. And I was reading Wollstonecraft at
               the same time –I was working on Mary Shelley but obviously reading a lot of Wollstonecraft
               in preparation for that—and Wollstonecraft herself is constantly interrogating the
               differences and the fact that there are really no significant differences between
               males and females. In fact I used Wollstonecraft in that article on Ursula LeGuin
               because I was really thinking about how you represent political utopias—sexual-gender
               utopias.</p>
            <p class="noCount">So, Ursula LeGuin’s <span class="italic">The Left Hand of Darkness</span>: what fascinated me was that a person goes into a kenning house—a mating house—and
               becomes male or female depending on the person they happen to be sitting next to.
               One time you can be male, one time you can be female. And I thought that was really
               revelatory of the fact that we play different roles in relationships. Nothing is fixed
               [or] static through one’s whole lifetime. So that really helped me to then later think
               through the issues that I wanted to raise in <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender</span> and also <span class="italic">Romanticism and Feminism.</span></p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> . . . and really to think of it as a “gendering,” so the ability of Keats to occupy
               the position of feminine romanticism.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Right, that femininity is a social construction, it’s not based on biology and the
               same with masculinity and that they change over time, and of course different cultures
               have different concepts of what is masculine and feminine. Now, of course, even at
               the level of biological sexuality, we now know about intersex in a way we didn’t years
               ago. So, all along, I’ve been thinking these are not things that are fixed in time
               or the body, although the body enacts them, performs them, as Judith Butler has taught
               us.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> The other thing that I read from early on, was an article from 1989 “The Politics
               of Literary Study” and I was fascinated to learn that—<span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Now you’ll have to remind me about what that one was about.]</span>—well what you said was that your next book would be called “The Two Romanticisms,”
               and so that got me thinking: Did you mean <span class="italic">Romanticism and Feminism</span> or <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender?</span> but also what was at stake in changing your title . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Well, the two Romanticisms were going to be masculine romanticism and feminine romanticism—it
               was <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender</span>. Because how I was thinking through it—I mean—what I was struck by, of course, coming
               back to the whole canon of romanticism from a feminist perspective was a) the absence
               of women writers most strikingly and b) the absence of any discussion about what difference
               sex [and] sexual identity—the fact that these were all male writers—made to their
               writing.</p>
            <p class="noCount">So, the project of <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender</span> was really twofold. It was to unpack what difference gender made to the writing of
               male Romantic writers, how they tended to promote—in very subtle ways—a masculinization
               of the universe. I mean, most tellingly perhaps in Wordsworth’s <span class="italic">Prelude</span>. In the final book of the <span class="italic">Prelude</span>, where nature has been female all the way along and been something that resists the
               male poet, and then suddenly becomes the brother of the male poet, the moment at which
               he, in effect, whatever word you want to use, colonizes, cannibalizes or at least
               authorizes himself to speak <span class="italic">for</span> Nature.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Incorporates . . .?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Yes, although at the very end of the book, Nature returns as the female—something
               that cannot be entirely incorporated comfortably. But I was interested in exploring
               <span class="italic">that</span>, the whole ideology of masculinity, which not only represented nature as female and
               appropriate-able, but also took the heroic masculine quest narrative as central. Privileged
               the individual encountering the sublime, something eternal, infinite, outside himself
               and his own relationship to it. Privileged the imagination as that which could, in
               a sense, create a world unto itself. Privileged political revolutions as acts of individuals
               overthrowing any kind of oppression, restraint.</p>
            <p class="noCount">And then when I started reading the women writers of the period realized that these
               were not their values at all. And that’s when I started thinking about the existence
               of a second—a feminine romanticism—one that was much more based on the individual
               in relation to other individuals, on families, on communities. Not political revolution,
               because it caused too much damage to families and children and mothers, but gradual
               evolution. And a notion of nature as—because nature was female—someone—a mother—but
               also someone with whom one collaborated, cooperated, rather than fought against or
               tried to take over. An ethic of care as opposed to an ethic of justice, and a whole
               different way of seeing the world.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Now one could argue, and I did subsequently argue, that feminine romanticism actually
               was very similar to eighteenth-century enlightenment values, the privileging of reason
               over the imagination, and of course led directly, almost seamlessly into what we think
               of as Victorian literary culture. Hannah More being central to this project. So feminine
               romanticism doesn’t stand out uniquely from what went before or what comes after.</p>
