            <div>Recorded March 12, 2012 </div>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> So here we are in Anne’s living room, and I just wanted to open by saying how happy
               I am to be here, where I’ve had so many wonderful experiences with the UCLA Romantic
               Study Group. I thought that we would start with you talking a little bit about that
               group, how it came into being, how long you’ve been doing it, and which were the most
               notable talks you remember.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Oh interesting. It started when I first came to UCLA, which would be 1985 or 1986.
               And actually I had been down here—my husband had been teaching here for 10 years before
               that—and I had come down and there had been a single such meeting (I think that it
               was at Reg Foakes’s house) and when I came back I expected this to be an ongoing thing,
               and no, it had dropped out, nobody had done it since. And so, I decided, <span class="italic">oh</span>, it was so great, let’s start it again. It has actually gone on now since 1986. We
               meet three times a year, in this living room; you were here many times. It is mainly
               for faculty and graduate students at all the related institutions, so people come
               from Santa Barbara, Irvine, Caltech, Pepperdine, and USC, of course. It is usually
               around 20 or 25 people. Someone comes and gives a talk and then there is wine and
               cheese and discussion before and after. Graduate students really like it because they
               get to meet the faculty at other institutions, and the graduate students at other
               institutions get to meet other graduate students, since there aren’t that many at
               other institutions.</p>
            <p class="noCount">So, best talks over the years, there have been so many good ones . . . </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I remember that one that Alan Liu gave about installation art in England and Wordsworth.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Andy Goldsworthy’s work, yeah. <span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: Yes! I loved that talk.]</span> I mean there have been so many good ones, I don’t think that I could possibly choose.
               Jonathan Sachs just gave a really good one on different modes of time in Romantic
               writing. I remember Nancy Armstrong gave one when she was out here, it was really
               good.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I think that you’re right. [The Romantic Study Group] gave me the opportunity as
               a grad student to meet faculty. I remember that I met Kevin Gilmartin here years ago
               for the first time. In fact, it was through him that I met Orrin Wang, who came up
               with the idea for this interview.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Kevin has given several talks here; the last one was on his work on Hazlitt. He also
               did one on conservative print culture, and way back when, on radical print culture.
               Meg Russett—I mean there are certain local faculty whose careers the group has actually
               tracked—Meg just did one on teaching Romanticism in Turkey, which was fascinating,
               [it was] on the defamiliarization of texts in a foreign language that I’m hoping that
               she’ll publish. Julie Carlson has given several talks . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Giving talks here has always helped me develop material into something that I wanted
               to take further. We’re doing a group at UGA now. <span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Oh good!]</span> Chloe Wigston Smith started the 18<sup>th</sup>- and 19<sup>th</sup>-Century Colloquium in British Literature. Paul Hunter just gave a great talk on poetry
               and Paula Feldman is coming to talk on the Mary Tighe biography. Chloe asked me to
               help co-direct it and I did so in part because of my memories of the UCLA Romantic
               Study Group. It is a great thing.</p>
            <p class="noCount">So who is going to keep it going after you retire? <span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: It’s a question. It’s a question.]</span> You could [still] do it Anne…</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Well, I said that I would continue to volunteer the space. I was just talking to
               my colleague Saree Makdisi to see about carrying it on, and asked him to help me locate
               speakers, since I won’t be traveling as much to conferences. Because we can’t pay
               anybody, it’s really people doing it out of the generosity of their hearts. So we
               really have to rely on people coming through Los Angeles anyway, typically to the
               Huntington. [Additional banter on the Huntington excised from transcript]</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I thought that we could turn to some of your recent work. The whole notion of you
               retiring or semi-retiring seems unbelievable to me and most other people.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Well, it will sort of be a phased retirement. I am now scheduled to retire at the
               end of this year, June 2013, but I’ll go on teaching half-time after that for at least
               three years and more if the department needs me.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Do you feel that your work comes out of the classroom or do you see it more of as
               an organic process between research and teaching?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Interesting, whether it is organic. I mean, if you go right back to the beginning
               it came out of passions. You know, that I loved art history as much as I liked literature
               so I was looking around for something—a dissertation topic that would allow me to
               do visual culture as well as verbal culture. And that’s what led me to Blake, that
               and the fact that I had taken a fabulous graduate course when I was an undergraduate
               at Brown with S. Foster Damon, who was the great man who brought Blake into the canon.
               And then I was an undergraduate philosophy major, as well as English major, and so
               I had always been interested in philosophical questions, so that took me to the next
               project on Romantic Irony, which was really about a philosophical system, [and] what
               happens if you think of the universe as not having any order, as being profoundly
               chaotic.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: I was looking at <span class="italic">Romantic Irony </span>and I noticed that even there, your interest in visual culture is highlighted by the
               inclusion of a print at the opening <span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Yes, right, right!]</span> and you actually talk about the significance of that image . . <span class="italic">. </span></p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Yes, it is that great Thomas Bewick, little landscape, little man riding horseback
               through the landscape, and then his thumb print over it. Right, so, it exists but
               it doesn’t exist, and it exists as an authorial creation but it’s also a de-creation
               because he is erasing it. Yes, I was so happy [<span class="italic">Laughing</span>] when I found that little image, because it summed it all up.</p>
            <p class="noCount">And then it was—well, by then I was teaching at Stanford—it was the early 1980s. All
               through the Vietnam War I had been very caught up in anti-war efforts at Stanford
               and actually led the faculty move to get rid of ROTC on the Stanford campus, which
               they brought back last year [by the way]. And so time passes. [Anyway] out of that—out
               of all those liberation movements, you know, civil rights and the woman’s movement,
               and so on—in 1980 I made a professional oath, a political and personal oath to only
               work on women, because I hadn’t done much work on women, no one had in Romanticism.
               So that is when I started looking around for who were the under discussed and undervalued
               women in the period. Jane Austen of course, but there had been work on Austen. She
               wasn’t actually regarded as a Romantic but nonetheless there had been good solid scholarly
               work on her. </p>
            <p class="noCount">[So] I looked around and the next [author] was Mary Shelley and no one had actually
               spent much serious time thinking about <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span> because they had been dismissing it as a children’s book or science fiction, and
               therefore outside of the canon of Romanticism. And all the time I was in graduate
               school, I don’t think that I ever read anything by Mary Shelley except her notes on
               Percy Shelley’s poems. [<span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: <span class="italic">I’m quite sure that when I was an undergraduate I read absolutely nothing by any woman
                  writer of the period</span>].</p>
            <p class="noCount">Right. And the notion that <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span> [was ignored] in all of these courses on Romantic poetry as mythmaking [is amazing];
               [and] I was teaching them myself . None of [us] thought about <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span> as the greatest enduring myth from the Romantic period. It is the only one that is
               really still with us every day.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: I just taught <span class="italic">Frankenstein </span>in a novel course, and my students couldn’t believe how deeply embedded their ideas
               about <span class="italic">Frankenstein </span>were. It is the one text that you come to in the Romantic period—maybe the other one
               is “I wandered lonely as a cloud”—where the students have really strong opinions <span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Without ever having read the text.]</span> Exactly. And in both cases, they have such a different sense of it once they finish
               reading. They are very interesting works to teach because you see the students’ perceptions
               changing as you talk about them.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Yes, well just having the narrator and having the Creature speak—because they have
               all seen the [James] Whale movie where he never speaks and all the parodies of that,
               and just hearing the story from his point of view is an entirely different experience.
               And there is now the fabulous—<span class="italic">have you seen it?</span>—[Danny Boyle’s] National Theatre production of <span class="italic">Frankenstein. </span>It is absolutely brilliant. It was in London in the National Theatre and then it was
               one of their high-definition in movie theater telecasts, and I think that it will
               come back that way.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Benedict [Cumberbatch] playing the creature is just unforgettable. And you have to
               see it. It is just . . . It starts off from a big red bubble and then the Creature
               emerges from that covered in blood like a newborn baby but full-size of course.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Do you see the effect of literary criticism on that production?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Oh yeah, first of all that it is insisting on the Creature as the protagonist, and
               not Victor Frankenstein. And it clearly makes the issue of parenting and the failure
               of parenting central to the play. So Victor Frankenstein comes in, takes one look
               at this newborn baby, and says “Damn” and runs out again, and you don’t see him again
               until the second act. [<span class="italic">Laughing]</span></p>
            <p class="noCount">So that emphasis on the Creature as human and struggling for human connection, I think
               that is the result of the feminist project. </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> In looking over your bibliography—and I was very overwhelmed and immediately felt
               like I should sit down and write many, many articles—I was struck by the way that
               your interdisciplinary interests can be seen throughout your whole career, with visual
               arts and Blake, and now the recent work with Mary Robinson and portraiture, or your
               enduring interest in science, with Mary Shelley [and continuing with] your consideration
               of Gilbert Wakefield and Charlotte Smith.</p>
            <p class="noCount">[I was] struck by your real interest in what I think of as productively resonant binaries.
               Did that lead you to Blake first? Or did your interest in binaries grow out of your
               study of Blake? </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> When I was an undergraduate I was taking courses in lots of different things, and
               I was interested in lots of different things and I didn’t see any reason to try to
               focus on just one, as long as I could sustain doing serious work in different fields.
               I said that I was a philosophy major—they <span class="italic">really</span> wanted me to go to graduate school in philosophy, the philosophers did at Brown—and
               it was a very strong philosophy department. But I realized talking to them that everything
               was at this level of abstraction and that they had eliminated all of the concrete,
               messy details that I really was interested in. If I’d not done a Ph.D. in literature
               it would have been in Art History. I just found so much pleasure in looking at works
               of art and still do. In fact, the last piece that I was working on—this one I haven’t
               published yet because it is getting harder and harder to publish anything with visual
               images because of copyright—but it is on Turner as a Romantic Ironist and re-reading
               all of his images of Venice.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I saw you give a talk on that at NASSR a couple of years ago.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Yes, I still have it back there [<span class="italic">gesturing to her office] </span>waiting to be finely shaped into something I could publish. But, as I say, as I get
               <span class="italic">really</span> old, I <span class="italic">really</span> lose interest in footnotes and permissions, and all that gritty stuff. I just want
               to go and look at the paintings and read the poems.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> And write something more impressionistic?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Pleasurable. Just pleasurable—as opposed to having to document every assertion—but
               that is the indulgence of old age. So if I write anything—and I don’t know that I’ll
               actually publish anything more.</p>
            <p class="noCount">You asked me what I’m working on now. I’m doing [a course] for the first time this
               spring [and] I’m a little anxious about it actually. It is a lecture course just on
               Jane Austen. And we’re going to read all her six novels as well as juvenilia. And
               I’m going to read her—this is <span class="italic">me</span>, this is <span class="italic">my</span> Jane Austen—through Wollstonecraft. Implicitly arguing that—well, explicitly arguing
               but the documentation just isn’t there—that Jane Austen read Wollstonecraft, absorbed
               her deeply, and thought through all of Wollstonecraft’s major issues in her novels.
               And I’m coming to this conclusion—partially because I’ve worked so much on Wollstonecraft—[because]
               I just keep hearing quotations [<span class="italic">in Austen’s novels</span>], never with quotation marks but the words are word for word from <span class="italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman </span>and scholars have just ignored all this because there’s no evidence in her letters
               or anywhere else. Although Cassandra burned 80% of her letters we think. Maybe they
               were the ones that were Jane Austen being militantly feminist, who knows.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> The letters are so domestic, it seems as though since what is left has a particular
               narrative, it makes sense that what was taken out also had its own narrative.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> I’m sure that Cassandra took out all of the nasty bits every time Jane Austen was
               being—<span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> There are some nasty bits remaining]</span>—there are some left, right, but I think that there were probably a lot more caustic
               comments on the people around them. But, you know, maybe some of her political or
               religious views that were more liberal than her family endorsed or thought was appropriate
               for the Victorian spinster-saint they were trying to promote.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: Do you see yourself taking this further than something like Claudia Johnson’s Jane
               Austen book?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Well, I think I would be more aggressive even than Claudia on the sort of radical
               politics that are embedded in Austen’s fiction. But I love Claudia’s book. I mean,
               I think that was the one that—<span class="italic">for me—</span>put Austen back on the map, and brought her into a canon I could teach.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> [Recently] you mentioned [to me] that you were thinking about <span class="italic">Mansfield Park</span>. So how do you see that novel? It is, I think, the thorniest novel for feminist scholars.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> The way I’m reading it—[and] I agree [that] you can read Fanny Price as an evangelical
               Christian heroine, or a patriot, or [as] Saree Makdisi wants to read her as a self-regulated
               heroine who promotes this heteronormative self-regulation—[but] I’m reading her through
               two texts really. Through Wollstonecraft’s <span class="italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman </span>where Wollstonecraft talks about the slavery of parent-child relations producing the
               slavery of marriage and producing a personality—a female personality—that Wollstonecraft
               finally defines as abject.</p>
            <p class="noCount">So I want to read Fanny as abject and also as the grateful negro, reading her through
               Maria Edgeworth’s novella “The Grateful Negro.” And I want to make the argument that
               Jane Austen is fully aware of the fact that Fanny Price is a damaged personality.
               That the last line is an ultimate example of Jane Austen’s irony. We are meant to
               read that recognizing that this is through Fanny’s eyes. That <span class="italic">she</span> is telling us that everything is perfect within the patronage of Sir Thomas [but
               Jane Austen isn’t].</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> So you’re reading [that last line] as free indirect discourse?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Yeah, right. And I have a student who made the brilliant suggestion—we’re actually
               trying to write this up together -- that we should think about Fanny as suffering
               from what we’d call the Stockholm Syndrome.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> So where does Mary Crawford fit into this argument?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Well, Mary Crawford is—she’s Elizabeth Bennet. And from that point of view of the
               abject and the regulated personality, she has to be eliminated. She is exorcised from
               Mansfield Park, but that doesn’t mean she’s not going to have a very happy life in
               London, which is where she has returned to with her wit, and her irony, and her cynicism.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: And her sufficient independence. She possesses that independence of mind and financial
               power that Fanny doesn’t have.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> But I’m coming to appreciate more fully with Jane Austen there’s a real difference
               between the first three novels—which are the 1790s novels—and the last three which
               are really Regency period novels. And that Jane Austen is coming to recognize that
               her ideal heroine (<span class="italic">who is Anne Elliot finally</span>) is going to have to be able to mediate, control, manage in a way that we never see
               Elizabeth Bennett doing. Elizabeth Bennett is the feisty, Jacobin liberated heroine
               up to a point, although she feels enormous amounts of gratitude to Darcy always. But
               she is being inserted finally into an existing structure, she’s not going to change
               the running of Pemberley. Anne Elliot is going to create a new model of household
               management, not one that exists, although the model is Sophia Croft and Admiral Croft.
               But they don’t have children and they don’t really have a home, and that is what Anne
               Elliot is going to do in the future. That was my argument in <span class="italic">Mothers of the Nation</span>.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> And so, it sounds like your reading would harmonize nicely with William Deresiewicz’s
               argument about Austen and the Romantic poets. He has a great argument about Austen’s
               first three novels being written prior to Austen’s reading of Romantic poets.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> The book that I just read—Anthony Mandal—which is one of these histories of the book,
               documents that Jane Austen is responding very specifically to clusters of novels.
               In the first three novels [she responds] to the 1790s novels, those concerned with
               sensibility of course, and feeling, as in <span class="italic">Sense and Sensibility. </span> Then to the gothic novel in <span class="italic">Northanger Abbey</span>, and then Jacobin writing (I think) in <span class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</span>.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> And we know that she read periodicals, and periodicals would always have at least
               a précis of various novels and other prose works. Periodical culture is another way
               to make that argument about Austen, and what influenced her, because we know that
               she read those.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> And then when she comes to the next group, she is responding to the development of
               evangelical novels, Hannah More’s <span class="italic">Coelebs in Search of a Wife, </span>and then also the novels that are really trying to deal with who is going to rule
               England in the future after the Napoleonic Campaigns are finished and not being terribly
               impressed with the options.</p>

            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> So I’ve been reading a lot of your early writing. I really loved an article that
               you wrote about Ursula LeGuin in 1983. [In that article] you conclude by talking about
               <span class="italic">The Left Hand of Darkness</span> as an ideal text—LeGuin’s ideal text but—<span class="italic">I think</span>—also yours. [Particularly] in its representation of what you call biological androgynes.
               You made your commitment to writing about women writers right after that article appeared.
               How does [your interest in biological androgynes] resonate with that distinction you
               make in <em>Romanticism and Feminism</em> and <em>Romanticism and Gender</em> between masculine and feminine romanticism?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AME:</span> I got interested in feminist science fiction back in the early 80s when it was modeling
               all sorts of alternative utopian possibilities for gender relations, [and] for sex
               identity. And it really got me thinking about what sex-based characteristics are really
               located in biology and which ones are social constructions. And that was when I was
               very much caught up with feminist theory and founded the Feminist Studies program
               at Stanford University. I had a reading group where we were—Nan Kahane was in it,
               I remember, and Shelley Rosaldo—where we were really actively interrogating all sorts
               of classical assumptions about sex differences. And I was reading Wollstonecraft at
               the same time –I was working on Mary Shelley but obviously reading a lot of Wollstonecraft
               in preparation for that—and Wollstonecraft herself is constantly interrogating the
               differences and the fact that there are really no significant differences between
               males and females. In fact I used Wollstonecraft in that article on Ursula LeGuin
               because I was really thinking about how you represent political utopias—sexual-gender
               utopias.</p>
            <p class="noCount">So, Ursula LeGuin’s <span class="italic">The Left Hand of Darkness</span>: what fascinated me was that a person goes into a kenning house—a mating house—and
               becomes male or female depending on the person they happen to be sitting next to.
               One time you can be male, one time you can be female. And I thought that was really
               revelatory of the fact that we play different roles in relationships. Nothing is fixed
               [or] static through one’s whole lifetime. So that really helped me to then later think
               through the issues that I wanted to raise in <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender</span> and also <span class="italic">Romanticism and Feminism.</span></p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> . . . and really to think of it as a “gendering,” so the ability of Keats to occupy
               the position of feminine romanticism.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Right, that femininity is a social construction, it’s not based on biology and the
               same with masculinity and that they change over time, and of course different cultures
               have different concepts of what is masculine and feminine. Now, of course, even at
               the level of biological sexuality, we now know about intersex in a way we didn’t years
               ago. So, all along, I’ve been thinking these are not things that are fixed in time
               or the body, although the body enacts them, performs them, as Judith Butler has taught
               us.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> The other thing that I read from early on, was an article from 1989 “The Politics
               of Literary Study” and I was fascinated to learn that—<span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Now you’ll have to remind me about what that one was about.]</span>—well what you said was that your next book would be called “The Two Romanticisms,”
               and so that got me thinking: Did you mean <span class="italic">Romanticism and Feminism</span> or <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender?</span> but also what was at stake in changing your title . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Well, the two Romanticisms were going to be masculine romanticism and feminine romanticism—it
               was <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender</span>. Because how I was thinking through it—I mean—what I was struck by, of course, coming
               back to the whole canon of romanticism from a feminist perspective was a) the absence
               of women writers most strikingly and b) the absence of any discussion about what difference
               sex [and] sexual identity—the fact that these were all male writers—made to their
               writing.</p>
            <p class="noCount">So, the project of <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender</span> was really twofold. It was to unpack what difference gender made to the writing of
               male Romantic writers, how they tended to promote—in very subtle ways—a masculinization
               of the universe. I mean, most tellingly perhaps in Wordsworth’s <span class="italic">Prelude</span>. In the final book of the <span class="italic">Prelude</span>, where nature has been female all the way along and been something that resists the
               male poet, and then suddenly becomes the brother of the male poet, the moment at which
               he, in effect, whatever word you want to use, colonizes, cannibalizes or at least
               authorizes himself to speak <span class="italic">for</span> Nature.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Incorporates . . .?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Yes, although at the very end of the book, Nature returns as the female—something
               that cannot be entirely incorporated comfortably. But I was interested in exploring
               <span class="italic">that</span>, the whole ideology of masculinity, which not only represented nature as female and
               appropriate-able, but also took the heroic masculine quest narrative as central. Privileged
               the individual encountering the sublime, something eternal, infinite, outside himself
               and his own relationship to it. Privileged the imagination as that which could, in
               a sense, create a world unto itself. Privileged political revolutions as acts of individuals
               overthrowing any kind of oppression, restraint.</p>
            <p class="noCount">And then when I started reading the women writers of the period realized that these
               were not their values at all. And that’s when I started thinking about the existence
               of a second—a feminine romanticism—one that was much more based on the individual
               in relation to other individuals, on families, on communities. Not political revolution,
               because it caused too much damage to families and children and mothers, but gradual
               evolution. And a notion of nature as—because nature was female—someone—a mother—but
               also someone with whom one collaborated, cooperated, rather than fought against or
               tried to take over. An ethic of care as opposed to an ethic of justice, and a whole
               different way of seeing the world.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Now one could argue, and I did subsequently argue, that feminine romanticism actually
               was very similar to eighteenth-century enlightenment values, the privileging of reason
               over the imagination, and of course led directly, almost seamlessly into what we think
               of as Victorian literary culture. Hannah More being central to this project. So feminine
               romanticism doesn’t stand out uniquely from what went before or what comes after.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Correct me if I’m wrong but it seems to me that you’ve argued elsewhere that we need
               to continue this research and not arbitrarily or precipitately stop working [on women
               writers].</p>
            <p class="noCount">The more you read Hannah More, the closer you came to <span class="italic">Mothers of the Nation</span> from <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender. </span>So, in effect, proving the point that you’ve been making about the need to keep developing
               our ideas about the period rather than standing still. And that is something you first
               invited us to do in <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender. </span>You said there that what you were doing was setting up a binary—you called it an “initial
               mapping”—an invitation to get other people into the conversation, and to challenge
               that binary as well. I know that [your construction of that binary] was one of the
               things that attracted more attention than you expected. Did you expect it to be as
               controversial as it has been?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> No. It always seemed so obvious to me. Obviously there were some males who shared
               these feminine ideological values; Keats most notably. I had done less work or was
               less successful in finding the writings of women at that point who promoted the masculine
               romantic ideology, but I now think that Charlotte Dacre Byrne would be a good example
               of that, and some of the [other] female Gothic writers.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Do you think Anne Bannerman?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Anne Bannerman, quite possibly. Right. No, I had to go to Emily Bronte, who was late
               for the argument at the time. But I think, now, one could find many more writers.
               Adriana Craciun’s <span class="italic">The Fatal Women of Romanticism</span> is a very good place to start. Some of the really Jacobin writings of Mary Robinson
               or Mary Hays would promote a masculine romanticism.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE: </span>The Plumptre sisters . . . but it is [still] hard to get [to the materials]. The importance
               of doing archival research is so clear.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM: </span>There are huge archives there that no one has really put the time in to look at. You
               think of these really major writers of the time, acknowledged at the time to be powerful
               literary presences that we still don’t know very much about. Well, you’re doing the
               much-needed biography of Amelia Opie. But there are lots of other women that we don’t
               have either biographies—or—what I really want are good single author studies, which
               we used to get. When I went to graduate school that was what you were supposed to
               do. You were supposed to pick one writer, and master that writer’s work from beginning
               to end and you had to know the biography as well as the trajectory.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE: </span>Grad students are now discouraged to do single author studies.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM: </span>And it is such a shame because we all then started out on single authors. I started
               out on Blake, and then there was a circle of Blakeists and we all knew each other
               and argued back and forth but really felt that we were competent to discuss this writer’s
               work in great detail. But now students—because we force them to work on three or four
               writers simultaneously—they come out with rather superficial knowledge of each of
               those writers. And it doesn’t give them expertise.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE: </span>Time to degree has been shrunk as well.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM: </span>Well, yes and no. I mean our students still take six or seven years. I did mine in

            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM: </span>Yes, and I had started some work on that even as an undergraduate so, I went [to graduate

            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AME:</span> There was a lot of Blake to read and a lot of visual images to look at. Blake was
               more challenging than many another would have been. But Carl Woodring—who was my dissertation

               or four others, but it was dominated by men, obviously. And the real resistance I
               had from the Blake community was once I raised the issue of Blake’s sexism. They really—<span class="italic">to this day</span>—do not want to acknowledge it.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: Blake and free love, which is one of the mythos around Blake.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: I mean they just want to read it as part of his revolutionary resistance to any
               kind of constraint. But why is it that all the female characters in all his poems
               end up playing these maternal, subservient, secondary roles to the originary imaginative
               creative male poet?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: I just taught <span class="italic">America</span> to undergrads and they were fascinated by the representation of gender and [violent]
               passion in Blake.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Well, he is all for free love, but its free love for men, and women servicing them.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: Well, this brings up a question. In looking over your bibliography, I noticed that
               you’ve worked extensively on all of the [Romantic] writers. One writer that you haven’t
               written an individual essay on, although you’ve talked about him a great deal, is
               Percy Bysshe Shelley. Do you want to talk about your relationship with Percy Bysshe
               Shelley?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: <span class="italic">[Laughs]</span> The irony of it all is that Percy Bysshe Shelley is the poet I fell in love with
               as a freshman at Brown University, and persuaded me to become a romanticist.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> What was it?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: It was <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> and it was <span class="italic">Epipsychidion. </span></p>
            <p class="noCount">But I now realize that the reason I fell in love with those poems was because I fell
               in love with my teacher of those poems, D.J. Hughes, and those were his two favorite
               poems. He taught them with so much energy and enthusiasm and insight that I just became
               fascinated by Percy Shelley’s—way before the moment we had the language for it—deconstructive
               concept of language: how language creates the universe and creates its own next sentence:
               the infinite deferral of language. So, that’s what made me into a philosophy major.
               I got into thinking about all sorts of epistemological and ontological issues through
               Percy Shelley. So I actually owe my career to Percy Shelley.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: And I wonder too, from my perspective of you, [that] you are a political idealist
               in a lot of ways, <span class="italic">[<span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Oh yeah.]</span> and that’s clear from reading what you’ve written over the years. There is an aspect
               of [Shelley’s] <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> in your writing—it is so utopian—the difference is that you aren’t content with a
               retreat to the cave in the end.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> No, and I’m also not content with the unborn soul and the return to the originary
               chaos of Act IV of <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span>. I want to see actual social improvement on the ground in the world in which we actually
               live, not withdrawing into a cave either. And also, the more I worked on Mary Shelley,
               the more critical I became of Percy Shelley’s concept of gender and sexual relations,
               as well as of his personal biographical behavior to his wife and children.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: How were you taught <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span>? You taught me the poem.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: I was passing on the way I had been taught. D. J. Hughes was a poet himself [and]
               completely identified with Percy Shelley, so he read it as a great celebration of
               the power of metaphor. He has a wonderful article on coherence and collapse in “Epipsychidion”
               and so it was always how a metaphor generates another metaphor. Metaphor is never
               adequate unto itself. It really led me to the whole concept of Romantic Irony, which
               I got through Frederick Schlegel as well, but when I started thinking about it in
               relation to <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span>, that there is no stability in language finally but it is just the poet who creates
               the world, but then also undercuts it by creating another metaphor. So, that was the
               way I was originally reading <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span> and <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> and finally Romantic Irony as such.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Going back to <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span>, its that sister-spouse incest metaphor that <span class="italic">now</span> fascinates me because I think one of the things that’s going on there, is, if you
               think about incest as a primary Romantic trope, and think of it as the trope that
               is the dark underbelly of the overt political utopian thinking. When you have a celebration
               of hierarchy and patriarchy then the dark underside of that, of course, is father/daughter
               incest and Mary Shelley explores that and Percy Shelley explores that in <span class="italic">The Cenci</span>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But if you move to democracy as your alternative to patriarchy [and] to monarchy then
               the dark underside becomes—if everyone is created equal, if brothers and sisters are
               equal, we’re having liberty, equality, fraternity—then the dark underside becomes
               brother-sister incest; that the brother can only love Mary, the woman who is just
               like him. This is Manfred [too], the narcissist projection of the self as the one
               who completes the self. And this is also Percy Shelley in the essay on love: the prototype
               finding its antitype. And this is where <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span> ends, [with the] sister-spouse. So finally, all of those metaphorical accumulations
               come back to this narcissistic projection of the primary self.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Who is the object of desire for the feminine romantic writer?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Well, one of the things that always strikes you when you read a lot of women’s writing
               in this period, is how many of the protagonists—well, first of all, the authors are
               either unhappily married or never married—the protagonists are all in courtship novels.
               And then you have to look at exactly what kind of men they end up married to but often
               the marriages seem, at least from a modern feminist perspective, as somewhat ….</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> . . . unsatisfying?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: <span class="italic">[Laughs]</span> Well, not egalitarian anyway, not quite companionate marriages that we hope for now.
               So I keep going back to that wonderful Wollstonecraft image in <span class="italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</span> where the ideal woman is finally the widow, with her children, who has gotten rid
               of the husband and carried on quite successfully without him.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The object of desire is always the idealized partner, the male who is going to be
               the perfect partner who is going to consult you, and respect you, and give you equal
               authority in the household, but even beyond the household. The novels are all sort
               of moving towards that but never quite confident that they’ve gotten there, so they
               never quite represent those marriages in any kind of long term way.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: And the novels that do represent marriage tend to represent failed marriages or
               marriages of confusion or . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: . . . or abusive marriages one way or another.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: It seems that Gaskell’s <span class="italic">North and South</span> has an attractive hero in a way that is so rare to find. But that is a novel that
               ends again without the marriage being represented</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Right, and all the Jane Austen ones where you don’t get the marriage represented.
               [Additional banter on Austen excised from transcript]</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Let me say one more thing about what women desire. It depends on the genre of course,
               if you go to the Gothic novel, you know, they are actually desiring the mad, bad dangerous
               to know man. And there is this whole issue of female sexual desire. <span style="font-weight:bold">[RE: . . . </span>[desire] for the father?<span style="font-weight:bold">]</span> Yes, female sexual desire getting mapped onto existing hierarchical relations. Or,
               and I’m really thinking now about <span class="italic">Zofloya</span>, getting mapped onto the totally inaccessible exotic other, whether he is Moor or
               Satan, as the novel finally wants you to think. I actually think he is the Moor, and
               then just because she is trying to impose a good conventional Christian ending, making
               it acceptable to her readers, so she turns him into Satan. But she is really desiring
               the racial other, the cultural other, the one that is really not available.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I just taught <span class="italic">The Italian</span> and what struck me there were the scenes of yearning for something else that isn’t
               contained by any of the figures in the text. All of those scenes of the sublime! Whatever
               is outside the window is really what is desired and it is nebulous.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Right, Vivaldi certainly doesn’t live up to it, or Valencourt.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I think Godolphin is an interesting object of desire in Charlotte Smith’s <span class="italic">Emmeline</span>, where we have a double hero. The unattractive hero fortunately dies midway through
               and then we have Godolphin associated with the sublime landscape, and his own kind
               of solitude, which seems a [better] possibility.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> What these women writers realize, starting with Wollstonecraft, and all the way through,
               it that there is a real crisis of masculinity in the Romantic era. On the one hand,
               you have the libertine rake, leftover from the eighteenth century, and the aristocratic
               Byronic figure, who is attractive but totally unsatisfying as husband material. Then
               you have the man of sensibility, who is weeping all of the time, ineffective and impotent
               in lots of ways, and so that’s not going to work, and they are really trying to imagine
               something else . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: . . . or the tyrant . . . and they often morph into each other over the course of
               a three-volume novel . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> They are really trying to define a new type of man. What Wollstonecraft defines as
               the modest man, the middle-class bourgeois professional, robust, benevolent figure,
               but they come across as kind of stick figures because [the writers] don’t have a lot
               of experience of such people. I’m thinking of Maria Edgworth’s <span class="italic">Belinda.</span> Mr. Percival is clearly the ideal man, but there aren’t a lot of him around and her
               heroine doesn’t get one. She gets a reformed rake in a way. Clarence Hervey, nice
               guy, but not very responsible or reliable and prone to make terrible mistakes. Mr.
               Knightley is sort of in that category, but he is a little too overbearing, and he
               lectures and hectors [Emma]. Wentworth is clearly Jane Austen’s attempt to define
               that new professional self-made man, but he also is capable of pride and jealousy
               and vindictiveness.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: He isn’t quite ready to forgive at the end of the novel.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Well, almost but not entirely.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: So Austen’s attempt to mediate between that man of sensibility and the rake [since]
               Wentworth is so associated with potential rakishness and piracy.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Piracy in his professional life and then rakishness in his private life, with Louisa.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: Let’s conclude by thinking about where you see the field going. Where do you see
               the most promising work in the field of women writers? One thing that struck me was
               just how important the work in critical theory was during the 1990s when I was at
               UCLA with you. <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender</span> comes out of Anglo-American and French feminism, but also deconstruction and post-structuralism.
               Do you think we have a period like that now? Do you see one coming? Where is the promising
               work?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> I don’t know. I’ve been a little frustrated actually. I had thought by now there
               would be more systematic work on the women writers, the single-author, really in-depth
               researched projects ongoing and appearing and not as many have come along. We’ve gotten
               some good biographies of Hannah More, like Anne Stott’s biography of Hannah More.
               A lot of work on Mary Robinson because you can market that to a more commercial audience.
               But there are so many women writers in the period that don’t have this work. We don’t
               even have a really good single-author book detailing the entire career of Maria Edgeworth.
               Which is really amazing, if you think about it, since she was right up there with
               Jane Austen then, and even now widely read but not widely studied. Partly because
               she has been confined to Irish Studies and read from a particularly negative view.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> [She is there in] histories of education . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> …with her children’s writing. But not the major novels, for the most part. So, I
               think there is an enormous amount of work still to be done. Joanna Baillie? We don’t
               have a really good overview of her entire career. There is a biography now but not
               [enough] critical work. Catherine Burroughs’s book is excellent but it only goes so
               far. Women playwrights, women poets. We don’t have a really good book yet on Felicia
               Hemans, I mean an overview book. We have good editions of her poems, of <span class="italic">The Siege of Valencia, </span>but not a biography. Charlotte Smith! We still need a really good interpretive study
               [of her work].</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Why do you think that is? Is there a bias against writing about a domestic life?
               Biographies of male authors focus on the career. Is it because we would end up having
               to write about the domestic? [<span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Well, you’d write about the domestic, but you’d also write about their career . .
               .] Is the biography of a woman different from that of a man?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Well, I think that has been the assumption, except that we have biographies of Queen
               Catherine of Russia and Cleopatra. The interest in women writers has been in the exceptional
               women and the political leaders of one kind or another. I don’t know…</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I’m grappling with this in the Opie biography. She is always part of the public landscape
               but her biography also has to take into account her care for her father, and care
               of her aunt. There is a lot of quotidian management of other people that is outside
               of her writing life, always part of that life, but perceived as being separate from
               her writing life.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Well, I think that means that when you do a biography of a woman, you have to take
               very seriously Nancy Chodorow’s argument in <span class="italic">The Reproduction of Women</span> that women have a relational self rather than an autonomous self, and that is the
               theoretical interest of such biographies, that they actually map how relationships
               actually are created and sustained and finally end over a lifetime, and make the argument
               that it is human relationships that matter rather than individual acts.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I’ve found that the recent work in sociability studies has really assisted me in
               thinking about this.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Yes, yes, and I think that is a really interesting move, both in Romantic writing
               but elsewhere, to think about writers as embedded in larger communities. And I think
               that will go on; a lot of the race theory and postcolonial theory insists on the priority
               of the community and how writers serve it.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> [Do you see] Transnational Romanticism [as part of that theoretical trend]?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Yes, though that seems to be more a product of an interest in book history. It has
               really been about the circulation of texts across the Atlantic or ideas as embodied
               in texts. And there is a lot of new work being done on publishing firms and publishing
               practices. And that actually will be very important to studies of women writers. Because
               how did their books get published? And did they hold copyrights? Did they publish
               on commission? How much did they actually earn from their writing? What sort of trends
               were they responding to? What literary fashions were they responding to? We have a
               lot more evidence now, ever since William St. Clair’s <span class="italic">The Reading Nation</span>, as to how to think through a lot of those issues. So I think that is a field that
               is going to go on.</p>
            <p class="noCount">I just hope that feminist theory, per se, doesn’t get shunted aside as old-fashioned.
               You know, oh we have done all that already, because I don’t think that we have.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: And that’s a pretty dangerous precedent as any feminist knows, then you just end
               up recreating . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: . . . male hierarchies. And unfortunately, I think that is what is happening in
               a lot of women’s studies departments. Ours just changed its name from Women’s Studies
               to Gender Studies, and you understand why that is happening because it is an inclusive
               move, but it then focuses as much attention on gay males as on females, and heightens
               discussions of intersex, which moves away from that huge category of women.</p>
            <p class="noCount">.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: Which seems to be of political importance right now, given the recent return in
               rhetoric at least to a fifties ideal.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: . . . of domesticity and of … oh god, do we need to go into Rick Santorum?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: That would be so wrong. We certainly don’t want to end there.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: No, but the threat is there.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: [<span class="italic">Sighing and rubbing her hands together]. </span>Work to be done: editions, biographies, single author studies of women writers certainly.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But a lot more work to be done in Romanticism particularly around religion. Because
               one of the things I’ve come recently to appreciate is how strongly different religious
               alliances impacted on women writers, more so than on male writers. Again, it is a
               sense of being involved in a community. But if you start out in the Unitarian community,
               as Anna Barbauld, Lucy Aikin, and Amelia Opie did, you end up in a very different
               place than when you start out say in Scotch Presbyterianism, which had an enormous
               impact—and we haven’t really understood this—on Joanna Baillie, on Elizabeth Hamilton,
               Susan Ferrier, partially because Scotch Presbyterianism was quite egalitarian. There
               were female presbyters in the eighteenth century. A very different sort of way of
               modeling human relationships and sex relationships comes out of the Church of England,
               [which is] a much more hierarchical and oppressive model to follow. So we need to
               think through that—and missionary work in relation to religion. So that is a big area
               that I think people will spend more time on in the future.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Science. Women and Science. Women’s active engagement and knowledge of science. The
               way scientific metaphors impact on all of Romantic writing. There is a lot more work
               to be done on that. I actually have a graduate student right now, Fusan Wang, who
               is doing really interesting work on inoculation and vaccination and how that . . .
               </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: . . . which has a fascinating relationship to gender in England . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Well, because it starts with Mary Wortley Montagu and smallpox vaccination and then
               goes to Thomas Jenner. But once it gets to Thomas Jenner and cowpox being the vaccination
               for smallpox, you get this human/animal divide. A binary being broken down and all
               the complex and anxious responses to that notion of introducing the animal into—<span class="italic">an animal poison</span>—into the human system is really an interesting problematic for the period.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: And it opens up potential ways of thinking about Romantic representations of nature
               and animal life more generally. Which makes me think of John Clare, a fascinating
               addition to the Romantic canon . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: . . . just for that obsession with nature . . .</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: So what do you see yourself doing post-retirement?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: When I retire, can I stop writing books? Could I stop writing at all?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: Can you, Anne Mellor? Actually, I have that question. Can you? That would be a question
               for you. I guess the question is <span class="italic">will</span> you stop?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: I think I will. [<span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: <span class="italic">Will you stop writing articles?</span>] Well, I’m committed to write at least two more, so I guess I’ll write those. And
               then I don’t know. I really don’t know. I’ve always wanted to paint, so I think about
               retirement as a time when I could maybe dismantle my study and turn it into a studio.

               paint.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Maybe a painting studio outside…</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> A painting studio outside, maybe. I don’t know, my husband thinks this is total fantasyland,
               and it may be. I’ll go on teaching for sure. I don’t know. The writing part is less
               interesting, partially because of the lag time. You know, you write something, and
               by the time it gets in print, and by the time someone actually responds to it, it
               is a long way away. So for me, the interim has always been teaching the material and
               then going to conferences, but my conference going energy is declining. So I don’t
               know. I’ll fade away into the sunset here on the west coast.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> Well, it is a nice place to fade into the sunset. I predict that it will be harder
               for you to give up writing than you think it will.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: We’ll see, we’ll see.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>. Maybe it will be a different kind of writing.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: Maybe, maybe. Saree Makdisi was just asking me if I would write a memoir. And I
               said no, this interview plus what will appear in NASSR around the seminar on romanticism
               and gender. And whatever happens at the Clark [conference in Anne's honor in October,
               2012] although I don’t have to speak, I just have to attend.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: It will be the twentieth anniversary of the appearance of <span class="italic">Romanticism and Gender, </span>won’t it? 1993?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM</span>: It will! I hadn’t connected that.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE</span>: So, it is a nice way to sum up.</p>
