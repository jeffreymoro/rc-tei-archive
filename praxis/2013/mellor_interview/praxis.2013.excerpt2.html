            <div>Mandeville Canyon, Los Angeles, California </div>
            <div>Recorded March 12, 2012 </div>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> When I was an undergraduate I was taking courses in lots of different things, and
               I was interested in lots of different things and I didn’t see any reason to try to
               focus on just one, as long as I could sustain doing serious work in different fields.
               I said that I was a philosophy major—they <span class="italic">really</span> wanted me to go to graduate school in philosophy, the philosophers did at Brown—and
               it was a very strong philosophy department. But I realized talking to them that everything
               was at this level of abstraction and that they had eliminated all of the concrete,
               messy details that I really was interested in. If I’d not done a Ph.D. in literature
               it would have been in Art History. I just found so much pleasure in looking at works
               of art and still do. In fact, the last piece that I was working on—this one I haven’t
               published yet because it is getting harder and harder to publish anything with visual
               images because of copyright—but it is on Turner as a Romantic Ironist and re-reading
               all of his images of Venice.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> I saw you give a talk on that at NASSR a couple of years ago.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Yes, I still have it back there [<span class="italic">gesturing to her office] </span>waiting to be finely shaped into something I could publish. But, as I say, as I get
               <span class="italic">really</span> old, I <span class="italic">really</span> lose interest in footnotes and permissions, and all that gritty stuff. I just want
               to go and look at the paintings and read the poems.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">RE:</span> And write something more impressionistic?</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">AM:</span> Pleasurable. Just pleasurable—as opposed to having to document every assertion—but
               that is the indulgence of old age. So if I write anything—and I don’t know that I’ll
               actually publish anything more.</p>
            <p class="noCount">You asked me what I’m working on now. I’m doing [a course] for the first time this
               spring [and] I’m a little anxious about it actually. It is a lecture course just on
               Jane Austen. And we’re going to read all her six novels as well as juvenilia. And
               I’m going to read her—this is <span class="italic">me</span>, this is <span class="italic">my</span> Jane Austen—through Wollstonecraft. Implicitly arguing that—well, explicitly arguing
               but the documentation just isn’t there—that Jane Austen read Wollstonecraft, absorbed
               her deeply, and thought through all of Wollstonecraft’s major issues in her novels.
               And I’m coming to this conclusion—partially because I’ve worked so much on Wollstonecraft—[because]
               I just keep hearing quotations [<span class="italic">in Austen’s novels</span>], never with quotation marks but the words are word for word from <span class="italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman </span>and scholars have just ignored all this because there’s no evidence in her letters
               or anywhere else. Although Cassandra burned 80% of her letters we think. Maybe they
               were the ones that were Jane Austen being militantly feminist, who knows.</p>
