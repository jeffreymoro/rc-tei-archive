               Romantic Circles Gallery, including two developed by Lucy Kimiko Hawkinson Traverse
               and Matthew Rarey, whose essays also appear in this volume, recognize what we have
               come to understand as the wide cultural reach of Romantic visualities, as manifold
               and often divergent impulses that join the cultural moment of Romanticism to our own.
               This <em>Praxis</em> volume and the new Gallery exhibits together convey how we have begun to understand
               Romanticism’s visual cultures, and gesture toward work that awaits future contributors
               who seek to understand how visuality conducts its operations across Romantic culture.</p>

                  <p>Visuality, we might say, is not merely a feature of the contemporary, nor does it
                     reduce to the visible or the social facts of the visible. As Nicholas Mirzoeff elaborates
                     in <em>The Right to Look: A Counterhistory of Visuality</em> (2011), the descriptive force of the very term emerges importantly not just with contemporary
                     critical theory (xiii-xvi; 1-34). Its history stretches back before its key turning
                     point use, in Hal Foster’s edited collection <em>Vision and Visuality</em> (1988), to insist on the constitutive interlining of vision by the changing “social
                     fact” of visuality—that is, to understand vision as riven by differences.

                     </div> This volume participates in the excavation of the Romantic genealogies of visuality
                     and its contestations in practice while also attending to other imminent possibilities
                     within a reconfigured field of Romanticism, one opened and stretched geographically,
                     temporally, and beyond the bounds of the disciplinary division of objects. That is,
                     besides the important claiming of the right to look, this volume also considers counterpoints
                     that texture and complicate the story of visuality’s emergence. Such a reconfiguration
                     brings newly into view not merely a different array of “objects” of and for Romanticism
                     but also reposes the question of their ethical, political, and aesthetic stakes in
                     the past as well as for our present.</p>

                  <p>Two decades ago it was still possible to suppose that Romanticism referred wholly
                     to visionary experience and poetics, and that its locus was squarely in the European
                     metropole. The point of William Galperin’s <em>The Return of the Visible in British Romanticism </em>(1988) was not to suggest that the visible had ever left town (and here he means London),
                     but that its presence in Romantic culture had hardly been noticed. As Galperin did
                     note, however, it was precisely because the aesthetic representation of the visible
                     took so many forms and commanded so much public attention that Coleridge felt he had
                     to warn against the “despotism of the eye” and Wordsworth had to insist that he had
                     never been “infected” by the rage for the picturesque.

                     modalities of Romantic visuality and its critique of what has more recently been called
                     “ocularcentrism.”

               <p>The essays in this volume approach the question of visuality’s Romantic genealogies
                  by addressing an arresting affiliation between interiority and invisibility and the
                  highly visual, spectacular Romanticism that we now recognize as a persistent element
                  in Romantic culture. The thread that binds and weaves between these Romanticisms is
                  a shadowed recognition of an “other” that visuality seeks to control, but which may
                  also be implicit or occulted. What makes Romantic visuality compelling is, we contend,
                  not a sudden departure from a line of objectivist thinking about vision, but the continuing
                  modern exploration of the suppositionality of vision, combined with deepening recognition
                  of the difficulty of conveying the remarkable and remarkably resistant character of
                  the physical world and the precarious desire of the European observer who seeks to
                  manage that world as though separated from it. In Romantic visuality what is spectral
                  or invisible, half seen at the edges of vision and understanding, presses on both
                  the technologies of the visible and the global encounters with others that “shadow
                  so much of Romantic culture” (Casid 1-34). </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The spectral otherness of Romantic visuality is difficult to put aside precisely because
                     it operates so close to the bone of scientific visuality and a metropolitan European
                     culture keen for news and images from the global wars that the English and their European
                     counterparts waged.

                     </div> Romantic visuality’s odd and estranged relation to what is hidden or desired lurks
                     at the edges of the visual frame. The complex refracted relation between the visible
                     and its others sets the stage, at once philosophical and cultural, for a surprising
                     but compelling affiliation between this visibility and the Romantic critique of ocularcentrism.
                     If the geneaology of the critique of embodiment and vision begins millenia earlier
                     in the debate about seeing and the imagination that Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine
                     begin and Locke extends, its Romantic instantiation includes Hegel’s critique of sense
                     certainty, especially vision—a critique complexly entwined with his use of visual
                     metaphor to characterize the liabilities of phenomenal vision understood as the ground
                     of knowledge. Hegel’s critique specifically registers the problem of the “other” for
                     the metropolitan European Enlightenment subject.

                     important, botanical illustrators toggled between their putative object of study,
                     the specimen, and the work of other illustrators. This odd arrangement was in part
                     motivated by the taxonomic inquiry that such images were supposed to illustrate: the
                     plant depicted had to convey the taxonomic traits or “character” of its species (Nickelson
                     188-215). Artists copied other artists to get as close as possible to a full and accurate
                     species image, but perhaps also to save time as they competed in a hotly competitive
                     market for botanical illustration. Fidelity to the established system for identifying
                     and naming the species in question set its own formal terms: artists who drew or engraved
                     plants for Linnaean botanists were expected to depict its floral parts in detail,
                     typically in separate, schematic drawings on the same sheet or plate.</p>

                     and James Sowerby, one of the principal artists and engravers of works on natural
                     history. The two corresponded regularly about drawings and descriptions for the thirty-six
                     volumes of <em>English Botany</em>, which appeared serially over a twenty-five year period. To indicate a set of distinctions
                     between two closely related species that an initial drawing failed to offer, Smith
                     explained to Sowerby what the leaves of the species under consideration looked like
                     under magnification so that the drawing might be altered to reflect this information;
                     he also directed Sowerby’s application of color, noting in some cases that holding
                     up a plant to the light or even adding water to the specimen to make it look bigger
                     will show its “true color.” If magnification by microscope or adding water does not
                     quite approach the scalar excess of the huge flowers depicted in Robert Thornton’s <em>The Temple of Flora</em> (1799-1807), neither is it a straightforward brief for copying the plant specimen
                     at hand. Instead, magnification and other alterations with light and water functioned
                     as techniques for making specimens yield up the effects of the “true” unavailable
                     to naked observation from the “life” and yet claimed to be merely inherent (Kelley
                     72-73).

                              was the fact that while specimens might well convey parts more clearly (and were chosen

               <p>We might say that technologies of vision for the production of “objectivity” were
                  internally given the slip by the very devices of scalar alteration on which they depended.
                  Technologies devised to assist the creation of accurate, putatively objective records
                  become inevitably entwined with the reversibility of their operations of attentive
                  particular focus (a kind of miniaturization) and magnification. The use of microscopes
                  to magnify plant cells, as Franz Bauer did at Kew from 1800 on, suggest one side of
                  the scalar extremes that bind diverse forms of Romantic visibility, from miniature
                  images and writing, to scalar exaggerations and tricks used in the eidofusikon and
                  the panoramas. Such devices slide easily between what might be called a recognizably
                  human scale and its various others: forms so small or so obscure they cannot be seen
                  (or imagined) without visual amplification (or suggestion). Wordsworth’s presentation
                  of London shop signs in the <em>Prelude, </em>Book 7, insist both that the slippage at issue is between the human and something
                  extra-human and that this slippage is pitched toward the consuming subject: </p>

               <p>Sophie Thomas’s essay in this volume, “Representing Paris: History and Actuality at
                  the London Panoramas,” considers the Romantic panorama, perhaps the most extravagant
                  of Romanticism’s visual spectacles, by emphasizing its claims to represent reality
                  in an all encompassing visual form—albeit one we now experience via textual remainders
                  such as maps and descriptions—that appears to have found its <span class="foreign">métier</span> in the presentation of wartime episodes. Not incidentally, as Thomas makes clear,
                  the goal of representing history—particularly recent history—as fact was crosscut
                  by two counter-impulses: the need to adapt facts to national and propagandistic protocols,
                  and the use of illusion and disorienting complexity to insist on the thick actuality
                  of the spectacle. Whether it was London and the English as seen in Parisian panoramas,
                  or Paris and the French as seen in London panoramas, war and specific battle scenes
                  were popular, and for that reason, repeatedly made into panoramas that staged what
                  Mary Favret has called “war at a distance,” to characterize how most Romantic audiences
                  experienced the ongoingness of war in their time and as such gesture toward our modern
                  experience of war as news and propaganda. Premier among those staged spectacles in
                  its use of effects to promote the illusion of its factuality, the panorama works in
                  part by confusing its viewers with details, prompting both euphoria and a disorienting
                  view of its staged reality. The double project of the panorama is arresting: designed
                  to give viewers a sense of observational control and sovereignty over a huge city
                  that, were the viewer down below, would be a place in which to get lost, or a battle
                  scene in which being there might well mean ending up being dead, the complexity of
                  visual, even geometric, tactics used to persuade the viewer of the panorama as a multifaceted
                  reality might also be profoundly disorienting. Writ large and small (this perspectival
                  extreme being the stock and trade of a panoramic prospect), the panorama might take
                  away whatever powers it promised to give.</p>
               <p>The reversibility of the techniques of objectivity and the degree to which metropolitan
                  European Romantic and imperial visuality was internally challenged by its own techniques
                  of panoramic all-seeing, assemblage, and atomizing classification help to specify
                  location and origin of Romantic visuality as less exclusively a European phenomenon
                  than one shadowed by its putative “others” and, as such, an unstable site where unruly
                  and global force challenge British and European metropoles. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">III. Indigenous or Transplanted Fruits: Visuality’s Genealogies </span></h2>
               <p>Visuality, we might say, not only has a Romantic genealogy but a one. In <em>Imperial Eyes</em>, Mary Louise Pratt suggests how we might recast Romantic ways of seeing as an accidental
                  and infectious byproduct of colonial contacts. Gesturing briefly to Venezuelan writer
                  Teresa de la Parra’s autobiographical novel <em>Memories of White Mother </em>(1929), Pratt gives us a glimpse via Parra of an alternative historical itinerary
                  for Romanticism and its celebrated lyric “I,” an eye that tracks what Hegel insisted
                  the ego-subject always misses about its interpellation with the world and its putative
                  “others”: <span class="quote">‘I believe that like tobacco, pineapple, and sugar cane, Romanticism was an indigenous
                     [American] fruit that grew up sweet, spontaneous and hidden among colonial langours
                     and tropical indolence until the end of the eighteenth century. Around that time,
                     Josefina Tascher, unsuspectingly, as if she were an ideal microbe, carried it off
                     tangled up in the lace of one of her headdresses, gave the germ to Napoleon in that
                     acute form which we all know, and little by little, the troops of the first Empire,
                     assisted by Chateaubriand, spread the epidemic everywhere (138).’</span> Situated in a garden beside tobacco and pineapple and, most notably, with the sugar
                  cane—that exotic transplant of colonial landscaping or the plantation machine—Romanticism
                  becomes, like the introduced and capitalized sugar cane plant, an “indigenous fruit”
                  of the Americas. <em>Memories of White Mother</em> figures Romanticism in the formal and yet also material terms of one of its preoccupations:
                  fusions with the environment and its extension in the anthropomorphization of plants.
                  An acclimitizable and yet transculturating fruit, Romanticism becomes, like the changes
                  wrought by the sugar-cane plantation, an outbreak that, in its attempted conversion
                  of slave labor and colonial commerce into the comestible sweets of sugar, fruit, the
                  aesthetic, or transformative empathy, also sends infectious counter-influence across
                  the Atlantic from the Americas to Europe. This characterization of Romanticism as
                  an unsuspected and seductively transforming germination without an original seeing/knowing
                  agent is further mobilized by Pratt to suggest that <span class="quote">‘If one unhooks [Alexander von] Humboldt from Schiller and locates him in another
                     “romantic” line—George Forster and Bernardin de Saint Pierre (two of Humboldt’s personal
                     idols), Volney, Chateaubriand, Stedman, Buffon, Le Vaillant, Captain Hook, and the
                     Diderot of the “Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville”—one might be tempted to
                     argue that romanticism originated in the contact zones of America, North America,
                     and the South Seas. (138)’</span></p>
               <p>This change of direction is not without consequence. The cultivation of the eye as
                  a means of developing sensibility becomes embedded with material forms of “cultivation.”
                  But, further, the cultivation of an empathic visual imagination becomes part and parcel
                  with the actual and imaginative appropriation of “domestic” and “foreign” lands: practices
                  so often translated as arts not of conquest but of “cultivation.” The essays in this
                  collection variously resituate European and especially British works of the late eighteenth
                  to mid-nineteenth century as troubled and troubling contact zones of encounters in
                  various registers that put aside the inflated heroic sublime to consider the curious,
                  the wandering, the grotesque, the ridiculous, and the bitingly satirical—all of which
                  are shaped by and give form to the mixed and heterogeneous intra- and extra-national,
                  imperial, and continental arenas we now call “Britain,” “British Empire,” the “Americas,”
                  and “Europe.” In doing so, these essays contribute to an scholarly inquiry that seeks
                  to reread the graphic, literary, scientific, and philosophical developments of European
                  omanticism along the trade routes, exploratory paths, detours, and wanderlust of global
                  trade and colonization. </p>
               <p>Marcus Wood’s “Brazilian Romantic Satire on the Peripheries of Photo-Realism: the
                  Case of Angelo Agostini” takes up the abolitionist satires of Angelo Agostini (the
                  Italian artist who was working in Rio from the early 1860s until the end of the 1880s).
                  Although Wood shows that Brazilian abolitionist satires were in important dialogue
                  with English and American Romantic literatures and images, the Brazilian side of this
                  dialogue was particularly and brazenly insistent on deploying the same figures (the
                  crocodile, for example) to insist on readings antithetical to those offered in American
                  and European accounts. Agostini worked with stone lithography mainly for mainstream
                  illustrated periodicals, producing social and political satiric art across a wide
                  range of issues (concentrating more heavily on slavery in the 1870s and 80s) in the
                  metropolitan center of Rio de Janeiro, a of industrialized capital in which slave
                  labor existed hand in hand with the development of new technologies including gas
                  light and steam power. The essay’s detailed examination of some of Agostini’s especially
                  ambitious prints opens up a space in which to initiate understanding of the specific
                  qualities which define Brazilian Romantic graphic art. As Wood demonstrates through
                  close reading, these distinctive qualities are tied inextricably to the graphic exploration
                  of the visuality of a slave system that even when it transitions to abolition conveys
                  what happens when a repressed power that is only manifest as literal physical bondage
                  is redeployed as the terror of enforced restraint. The crocodile that marks the Brazilian
                  specificity of these satires is also the thought-image for the violent extremities
                  of a post-Emancipation world. But this is not an argument for Brazil’s modern nature
                  to Europe’s culture of modernity. Rather, turning to Agostini’s political lithographs
                  produced for <em>O Mequetrefe</em>, Wood argues for the appropriation or translation of an unsettling “realism,” a kind
                  of effect of “objective visual energy” that could be harnessed for disruptive satiric
                  ends. Photography meets lithography in Post-Emancipation Brazil and the graphic effects
                  unleash possibilities for a counter-visuality of Romanticism that is bitingly real.</p>
               <p>Matthew Rarey’s essay “Romantic Visualities, Technologies, and Travelers in Mexico,
                  1804–1844” extends Romanticism’s genealogies to explore the potentials of a Romantic
                  Atlantic. Rarey’s particular assemblage of case studies of work by explorers and travelers
                  whose images of Mexico circulated on both sides of the Atlantic presents the views
                  articulated in antiquarian Mexican travel narratives in the first half of the nineteenth
                  century as navigations of a fine line between the demands of an objective scientific
                  rationality and those of picturesque scene-making that demonstrate the shaping role
                  of nascent visual technologies – the camera lucida, the panorama, and the daguerreotype.
                  This geographic and cultural reframing to consider representations of Mexico thus
                  cuts across segregated media histories, allowing us to see a network which includes
                  the views produced by Pedro José Márquez, a Mexican Jesuit priest working in Rome
                  in 1804, their publication by the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt in Paris
                  in 1816, and the views of Mexico in the camera lucida as they emerged in the hands
                  of Scottish artist and architect Frederick Catherwood in the Mediterranean and Mexico
                  (with the support of English entrepreneur Robert Burford). As Rarey demonstrates,
                  this network of image-making connects Burford’s panoramas (discussed by Sophie Thomas
                  as major attractions in London), which relied on Catherwood’s camera lucida-aided
                  drawings as prototypes for panoramic images, to the resistant difficulties of using
                  the camera lucida and the new daguerreotype technology in explorations of the Yucatán.
                  While the technologies of the camera lucida and the daguerreotype promised to render
                  an objective visual account of Mexican antiquities and landscape, they emerge as stubborn,
                  defiant apparati and powerful agents in complex and often surprising circuits of intellectual,
                  artistic, and technological exchanges, forming and transforming the Romantic Atlantic
                  and the Mediterranean. </p>

               <p>If the ground of the plantation is entangled with the picturesque garden, the locodescriptive
                  poem and the optical devices for picturesque tourism that focused and enframed the
                  vistas of the so-called , and Romanticism is a germination of transplanted seeds,
                  visuality as visibility’s imbrication with formations of social power may also be
                  said to emerge with the modernity of colonial technologies of subject formation: the
                  panopticon, gas light, stereotypy (and printing of many kinds), and the beginnings
                  of photography. Visuality is never simply the body (whether plant, animal, human,
                  or its crossings) visualized. Despite the dream of truth’s emergence as total optical
                  clarity, what may be propped along the sight lines of the panopticon, illuminated
                  by gaslight, enframed by the modern Romantic resuscitations of easel painting, and
                  registered by the aid of the camera (and the camera lucida) always has its haunting
                  remainders. </p>
               <p>In “Turner’s <em>Slavers</em>, Race, and the Ridiculous Human Fragment,” Dian Kriz exposes a telling rift between
                  the aesthetic and the visual politics of race in her trenchant reading of J. M. W.
                  Turner’s 1840 painting, <em>The Slave Ship</em> <em>Slavers Throwing overboard the Dead and Dying—Typhon coming on</em>. As other recent analyses do not, Kriz questions the effort to assign the visual
                  rhetoric of this painting to the Romantic sublime, arguing instead that, as its early
                  commentators repeatedly noted, Turner’s canvas belongs to another register in which
                  exaggeration operates—the grotesque and ridiculous. What early reviews identified—the
                  wildly flailing arms and hands of the drowning slaves and the huge mouths of fishes
                  ready to consume them—signals a Romantic theorizing of race and blackness as ridiculous,
                  excessive, a domain in which disembodied hands and feet constitute the fragmented
                  non-being of the slave body. Kriz argues here for understanding the racism in Romantic
                  aesthetics by reading the visual representations of race frontally, rather than allowing
                  the sentimentality on offer in some Romantic depictions of slave bodies to encourage
                  turning away from the fragmented, abused body of Romantic-era slavery. What Turner
                  stages, Kriz argues, is a profoundly disturbing representation of race and slavery
                  from the vantage point of its European Romantic “others.”</p>

                  Hawkinson Traverse traces the doubled figure of the vagrant, a figure of fugitive
                  movement that is at once the rogue body at the edges of the law, the paradigm of Romantic
                  movement and thought, and the ideal representative of the liberal metropolitan subject.
                  Attending closely to a representative array of British Romantic prints bound in a
                  range of books published in London in the first two decades of the nineteenth century
                  (between 1800-1820), Traverse sketches the strategies of containment, appropriation,
                  and erasure used to capture the vagrant body in print, teasing out the tensions and
                  slippages between the text as material object and the roaming body it seeks to arrest.
                  As Traverse demonstrates through this paradoxical and precarious figure, while wandering
                  may be integral to Romantic thought and action, so too is the desire to capture, record,
                  and classify. The Romantic obsession with the vagrant produces prints of wandering
                  types that not only hover between mobility and stasis, but also present the very figures
                  of highly prized movement immobilized. Indeed, the figure of unsanctioned wandering
                  is also a paradigm of the collection organized around a verb which its strategies
                  cannot capture without converting into its opposite. Here the objective vision that
                  classifies relies on alterations in scale (miniaturization) and minimization that
                  result in a decontextualization, a poaching of the ground on which to move. But, as
                  Traverse also shows, these strategies are precarious at best in that the bodies they
                  attempt to still also subtly critique the texts they occupy—at times leaking out and
                  exceeding their print confines. There are larger issues at stake, not least being
                  the question of the relation between a liberalism that represents itself through movement
                  and the techniques of the panoptic encyclopedic project with its archiving and encyclopedic
                  assemblage of types that endeavor to contain—and yet also strive to mimic—the movements
                  of their subjects. </p>
               <p>Unsanctioned wandering—in and out of dominant panoptic visuality—may give us a metaphor
                  for the practice of tracing alternative genealogies of visuality and doing so critically.
                  Read together, the essays in this volume give us a different account of modernity,
                  its languages, and its technologies. In Mirzoeff’s “Ghostwriting: Working out Visual
                  Culture,” 1822 is the turning point. For in that year, when the Arcades of Paris were
                  illuminated by gaslight, they created a vivid, critical figure or thought-image for
                  the condition of being a subject in colonial modernity, illuminated not merely by
                  a camera flash but by being located within an emerging disciplinary society of luminous
                  consumption. “Here is a critical mix indeed,” Mirzoeff writes, “the panoptic institution
                  illuminated by new visual technologies of gas and electricity, yet haunted by spirits
                  and [. . .] ghosts” (240). Even as gaslight once illuminated the shops of Rio as well
                  as the arcades of Paris, the wake of global slavery and capitalism continues to cast
                  its shadows. Such shadows, ghosts, and excesses are, in important part, the animating
                  “subjects” of the essays in this volume. But we would insist that attention to the
                  fossil impressions and fugitive traces in and of the images in existing archives,
                  together with what is not pictured or represented, are both objects of our inquiry
                  and, at least as critically, a necessary part of the method implied by attending to
                  and thinking “visuality” and its genealogies. </p>
               <p>As the new Romantic Circles Gallery reminds us, visuality is more than a set of images,
                  an iconography, a topic, or a theme. At its most critical and prescient moments, visuality
                  allows us to revisit and rethink the history of the regimes within which we live and
                  the questions and problems posed by the legacy of efforts to work out power, pleasure,
                  and knowledge through the register of the visible—both its failures and remainders.
                  The essays in this volume, together with the exhibits already part of the new Gallery
                  and future exhibits, will assist our effort to know how it is that Romantics saw and
                  embodied what they saw or imagined, and how we in turn understand the knowledge power
                  performed or undermined by Romantic visuality. </p>

               of visuality has been used in the development of the transdisciplinary field of visual
               culture but also historically, see Nicholas Mirzoeff, “On Visuality,” <em>Journal of Visual Culture</em> 5.1 (April 2006): 53–80.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               warfare as practiced and theorized by Karl von Clausewitz. See <em>The Right to Look</em>, 3.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               visuality” comes to us from critique within modernity and its grappling with the legacies
               of early modern metaphysics, that is, from James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>. See Mirzoeff, xiii.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">The phrase “the right to look” comes from Jacques Derrida’s coinage of the phrase
               “droit de regards” to account for the exchange of the mutually genitive and yet gaming
               exchange of glancing looks between women lovers in Marie-Françoise Plissart’s book-length
               photo-essay to which Derrida wrote a “following” lecture. Given the oscillation of
               “<span class="foreign">droit</span>” between law and right and the question of the plural “<em>regards</em>” which would most readily translate as “looks” but is also an important play on “<span class="foreign">au regard de la loi</span>” (or “in the eyes of the law”), there remains appropriately a remainder, an irreducible
               problem of translation. “<span class="foreign">Droit de regards</span>” is translated in the English version of the text by David Wills as “right of inspection.”
               Deploying “the right to look” as a claim for autonomy, political subjectivity and
               collectivity without the demand for sameness, Mirzoeff insists, instead, on the “right
               to look” as a way to keep open the gap between law and right which might seem closed
               by the term “inspection.” See Plissart; translated as Derrida’s <em>Right of Inspection</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               by those who claimed that such illustration should faithfully record the specimen
               at hand. What obviously troubled this protocol, and thus prompted the contradiction,
               was the fact that while specimens might well convey parts more clearly (and were chosen
               because they did so), they quickly became a “hortus siccus,” to use Mrs. Delany’s
               acute phrase, with little resemblance to the vital plant. The instance we refer to
