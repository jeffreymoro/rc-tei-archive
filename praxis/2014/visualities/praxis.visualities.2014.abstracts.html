               <p class="noCount">This introduction assesses the impact of visuality on Romantic literature and culture
                  and its genealogies in the ongoing modern recognition of visuality as a cultural enterprise.
                  The Romantic genealogies on display in this introduction include: visual representations
                  of slavery, visual representations of slavery in Brazil, J. M. W. Turner’s painting
                  <em>The Slave Ship (Or Slavers Throwing Dying Slaves Overboard)</em>, Romantic panoramas as history painting, camera lucida, the solitary wandering artist
                  and vagrancy in Romantic print culture, and Romantic technologies of perception, display,
                  and exposure.</p>

                     “Representing Paris: History and Actuality at the London Panoramas”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This paper explores questions related to the representation of history and actuality,
                  in all its possible senses, at the popular panoramas of the early nineteenth century.
                  Using London and Paris as central examples (both were key cities for the development
                  of the panorama), it considers the importance of the panorama as a medium for conveying
                  certain kinds of visual knowledge—amenable to new regimes of description—and as a
                  form closely linked to the self-representation of the urban metropolis. Focusing also
                  on the relationship between image and text, between the panoramic images and the pamphlets
                  that accompanied them, it addresses the problematic status of the popular appeal of
                  historical and contemporary events as subjects for the panorama—subjects that engaged
                  both a powerful desire to see and know things as they are (or were) and an equally
                  powerful element of delusory (or illusory) representation.</p>

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">The following analysis considers four abolitionist satires produced by Agostini, a
                  satiric lithographer of genius who worked in Rio de Janeiro in the second half of
                  the nineteenth century. Agostini is shown to have evolved a unique graphic language
                  in order to describe the co-existence of modern urban capitalism with ancient social
                  abuses. Agostini emerges as having fused new ways of looking which came out of photography
                  with the older symbolic and emblematic languages of European print satire. </p>

                     “Camera Lucida Mexicana: Travel, Visual Technologies, and Contested Objectivities”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay discusses three nascent visual technologies—the camera lucida, the panorama,
                  and the daguerreotype—as often stubborn and defiant agents in quests for both scientific
                  rationality and picturesque image-making in the first four decades of the nineteenth
                  century. Through a series of case studies, it also details how the agency of such
                  technologies emerged in the complex circuits of transatlantic intellectual and artistic
                  exchange formed in order to represent, and thus claim access to or ownership of, Mexican
                  history and archaeology across Europe and the Americas. This suggests the possibility
                  of recasting the genesis of these technologies not as a fixed point, but as a process
                  of transatlantic exchange oriented toward the New World and the south, in this case,
                  Mexico.</p>

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">J. M. W. Turner’s <em>Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying</em> (“The Slave Ship”) has been thoroughly analyzed as a Romantic and sublime meditation
                  on the evils of the slave trade, which was still ongoing when the picture was exhibited
                  at London’s Royal Academy in 1840. This essay goes beyond the question of slavery
                  to take up the inter-related issue of race, situating the slavers’ depictions of the
                  fragmented bodies of black slaves within a larger network of representations of the
                  “negro” that were produced over the previous sixty years. This network includes an
                  emergent anthropological discourse on human variety and a visual form that rose to
                  commercial prominence at the same time—the art of caricature. Some contemporary reviewers
                  responded to <em>Slavers</em> as though it were ridiculous or funny, and it is argued here that we have much to
                  learn about Turner’s picture and about the construction of racial difference by taking
                  seriously the comic as a register that naturalizes racial hierarchies.</p>

                     “Unsanctioned Wanderings: Capturing the Vagrant in Romantic Prints”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">The gentlemanly or artistic wanderer is integral to the Romantic imagination, yet
                  the ideal of the peripatetic existed against a backdrop of less desirable forms of
                  vagrancy and nomadism. Through changing Poor Laws and Vagrancy Acts, as well as the
                  enclosure of lands, these forms of unsanctioned wandering became increasingly criminalized
                  and unsustainable, even as the endorsed amblings of the inquisitive artist-gentlemen
                  were celebrated. This essay looks at depictions of unauthorized wandering in early-nineteenth-century
                  British prints in order to explore Romantic constructions of vagrancy in relationship
                  to the artist’s construction of self. More specifically, this project examines visual
                  strategies that contradict or resist the implicit project of containment, arrest,
                  and classification, and which complicate the supposed stasis of the print, the stability
                  of language, and the book as commodity.</p>
