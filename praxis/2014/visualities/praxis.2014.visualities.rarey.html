               <p>In tracing the transatlantic roots of historical authority and epistemology in his <em>How to Write the History of the New World</em>, Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra argues “the tradition that locates the ‘West’ somewhere
                  adjacent to the North Atlantic is amusingly pompous” (10). Following his provocation,
                  this essay traces the contested genealogies and hybrid origins of the panorama, the
                  camera lucida, and the daguerreotype: a set of Romantic-era visual technologies frequently
                  discussed as originating in European metropoles. “Camera Lucida Mexicana,” then, recasts
                  the geneses and genealogies of these technologies as a process of transatlantic exchange
                  oriented toward the New World and the south, in this case, Mexico.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Throughout this essay I use the terms “Mexico” and “Mexican” as many foreign travelers
                           in the nineteenth century used the umbrella term “Mexico”—to refer to the entire region
                           south of the United States as far south as Costa Rica. All sites I discuss were either
                           inside the borders of New Spain or part of a territory (the Federal Republic of Central
                           America) whose political existence was generally deemed too unstable to warrant a
                           different name.</span></div>
                  </div> In locating the history of Romantic technologies and visuality in the New World, and
                  in the global south, I argue that this re-orientation undermines claims to them as
                  agents of imperial dominance. Instead, I show how these technologies emerge as contested,
                  ambiguous, and frequently defiant obstacles against the desires of their operators
                  in an attempted visual conquest of Mexico in the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
            </div>
            <p>My interest in visual technology’s destabilization of objectivity is indebted to the
               work of Lorraine J. Daston and Peter Galison, who argue that, in the second half of
               the nineteenth century, scientific discourse posited objectivity as dependent on mechanical
               technology. Daston and Galison find in the pursuit of “mechanical objectivity” an
               “insistent drive to repress the willful intervention of the artist-author, and to
               put in its stead a set of procedures that would, as it were, move nature to the page
               through a strict protocol, if not automatically” (121). Here, the modifier “mechanical”
               works to re-structure objectivity through changing conceptions of the interdependence
               of technology and operator, while emphasizing the role of optical devices in the quest
               for “images, machines, and illustrators [that] would not budge even to obey the scientist’s
               own misdirected will” (124).</p>
            <p>I draw Daston and Galison’s argument backward to the end of the long eighteenth century,
               and from the desires of scientists to those of the explorers of the New World. Perhaps
               it is no accident that when Thomas Carlyle first publishes the term “visuality” in
               1841, he does so the same year the daguerreotype makes landfall in Mexico, in the
               hands of explorers wishing to literally own Mexican history by photographically reproducing
               it. Writing that Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em> presents a narrative where “every compartment of it is worked out, with intense earnestness,
               into truth, into clear visuality” (149), Carlyle equates truth with the uninhibited
               gaze by compartmentalizing Dante’s poem. At the same time, in Mexico daguerreotypists
               seek to tame the unwieldy compartments of Daguerre’s bulky box in order to clearly
               and truthfully replicate the landscape and the constitution of the what Nicholas Mirzoeff
               defines as the “visual subject in colonial modernity” (“Ghostwriting” 241). Thus when
               Hal Foster first defines visuality as “sight as a social fact” (ix), this definition
               is in many ways indebted to the contested definitions of visuality in early nineteenth-century
               Mexico, where explorers’ desire for mechanical objectivity battled against the very
               devices wielded in its pursuit.</p>
            <p>My goal, then, is to argue first that discussions of visual technologies should occupy
               primary importance in the history of the interrelationship between visuality and travel
               in the Romantic period. This argument necessitates locating the emergence of Romantic
               visualities in the global south. The case studies I present show how the desire for
               objectivity was articulated and contested through antiquarian Mexican travel narratives
               in the first half of the nineteenth century. I pay special attention to the roles
               of nascent visual technologies—the camera lucida, the panorama, and the daguerreotype—in
               the creation of those images. Specifically, I argue that while such technologies were
               deployed in pursuit of mechanical objectivity, they continually emerged as powerful
               agents with the ability to grapple with and defy the wishes those using them.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Prevailing scholarship on the place of aesthetic ideals in Romantic travel has tended
                  to focus on shifting conceptions of objectivity and subjectivity in tandem with shifting
                  ideals of the place of the viewer, and the visual subject.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For example, Benjamin Colbert argues that the creation of the subjective being necessitated
                           a shift away from Enlightenment notions of human vision as pure and unmediated (8).
                           In Voyage into Substance, Barbara Maria Stafford takes this a step further, displacing
                           subjective Romantic vision onto other sense modes entirely, arguing that the Romantic
                           traveler “felt the landscape without seeing it” (443). Nigel Leask counters both positions,
                           showing that travelers always grappled with the complex relationships between subjective
                           aesthetics and the continued goal to present objective knowledge (167-…</span></div>
                  </div> While this remains my goal here, I place visual technologies at the center of this
                  shift. Ron Broglio shares my focus in this regard: in his <em>Technologies of the Picturesque</em>, Broglio argues that Romantic-era visual technologies dramatically changed the cultural
                  relationship to visuality without being noticed. While I also place technologies at
                  the center of this moment, the technologies I reference here did the opposite: they
                  were noticed, lauded, and grappled with precisely because they did <em>not</em>, as Broglio argues, “help us master the landscape” and “further a sense of individual
                  power over nature” (26).</p>
            </div>
            <p>In addition, scholarship on the importance of visual technologies generally focuses
               on its relation to the rise of photography, rather than an explicit engagement with
               their role in practices of travel and exploration. For example, Geoffrey Batchen and
               Jonathan Crary both cite the importance of the camera obscura leading up to the advent
               of the daguerreotype in the late 1830s (Batchen; Crary 78). My account of Romantic
               travel also gives a privileged position to the daguerreotype, but in relation to the
               camera lucida, a device not discussed by Batchen, Crary, or Stafford, and one that
               even in nineteenth-century use figured as a decidedly domestic and amateur apparatus
               rather than a device used by professional artists in the context of exploration in
               foreign lands (Hammond and Austin 54; Lee 63). I present the daguerreotype as a major
               point of conflict and contrast to the camera lucida, even as travelers desired that
               the production of objective images would be facilitated by both apparatuses.</p>
            <p>As explorers and travelers produce images of Mexico that circulate on both sides of
               the Atlantic in the early nineteenth century, they continue to walk the fine line
               between the desired mechanical objectivity of the nineteenth century and picturesque
               vision that dominates discourses of the late eighteenth. I begin with the cases of
               Pedro José Márquez (1741-1820), a Mexican Jesuit priest working in Rome in 1804, and
               German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859), who publishes his views of Mexico
               in Paris in 1816. I move on to the way the camera lucida emerges (in the hands of
               Scottish artist and architect Frederick Catherwood [1799-1854] in the Mediterranean
               and Mexico, with the support of English entrepreneur Robert Burford [1791-1861]) as
               an important instrument through which to join the ideals of the Romantic landscape
               with the desire for objective scientific accuracy achieved by the use of visual technologies.
               Burford’s panoramas, then major attractions in London, rely directly on Catherwood’s
               camera lucida-aided drawings as prototypes for panoramic images. Yet Catherwood’s
               relationship to the camera lucida is in doubt, as its supposed ability to re-create
               the objective world is disrupted during his work with John Lloyd Stephens (1805-1852)
               in the Yucatán between 1839 and 1841. This tension leads directly to the pair’s use
               of the daguerreotype on their second trip to Mexico. Originally viewed by Stephens
               and Catherwood as a tool to expedite their goal of presenting an objective visual
               account of Mexican antiquities and landscape, the daguerreotype emerges as a stubborn,
               defiant apparatus in contrast to its desired results. I conclude with a consideration
               of the daguerreotype’s new roles in Mexico, and how Stephens and Catherwood’s initial
               uses of the daguerreotype further complicate its relationship to the camera lucida
               and to later photographic practices in the Americas.</p>
            <p>In the first decades of the nineteenth century, <em>criollos</em> (creoles) in the Viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru begin to assert their autonomy
               in opposition to the Spanish crown, giving birth to independence movements throughout
               the Americas that, by the 1820s, leave Spain almost devoid of American territory.
               Spain’s isolationist colonial policies—a major cause of the nascent independence movements—also
               mean a restriction on foreign travelers in the Americas. As such, almost no drawn-from-life
               images of American natural history or archaeology are produced prior to the 1820s,
               with two notable exceptions: Pedro José Márquez and Alexander von Humboldt. Márquez
               publishes <em>Due antichi monumenti di architectura messicana</em> (“Two Ancient Monuments of Mexican Architecture”), in Rome in 1804. <em>Due antichi</em> marks the first time Mexican archaeological images are produced in Europe, and even
               more significantly, they are images Márquezadapts from the work of José Antonio Alzate
               y Ramírez (1737-1799), a Mexican polymath and prolific author. Thus, Ramírez’s groundbreaking
               research on Mexican archaeology is first seen by a European audience as a result of
               Márquez’s work. Márquez’s presence in Rome is the ironic result of a July 1773 decree
               by Pope Clement XIV suppressing the Jesuit order, an order applied unevenly around
               the Catholic world but harshly in New Spain (Roehner 167). That year, Márquez is forced
               to leave Mexico and enter into a city with a long antiquarian tradition as well as,
               in his opinion, a long history of misrepresentations of Mexico (Cañizares-Esguerra
               254-255). <em>Due antichi</em> responds to both of these problems. In the text, Márquez makes a passionate argument
               for the cultural advancement and complexity of the civilizations of Pre-Columbian
               Mesoamerica, implicitly tying them to the civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Rome, and
               Babylon which function as the basis of antiquarian travel images. Márquez’s illustrations
               reinforce this point. In the untitled first plate from <em>Due antichi</em>, an engraving of the Pyramid of El Tajín (in modern-day Veracruz state) shows a highly
               schematized, geometric structure absent of any background context (<a class="link_ref" href="#fig1" title="1">Figure 1</a>). What would have been a foliage-covered and largely unexcavated pyramid in 1804,
               Márquez renders as a flawless work of architectural precision. The pyramid’s six levels,
               each with identical rows of window openings and level roofs, mimic each other in proportional
               size and shape. The pyramid inhabits a nearly two-dimensional landscape where spatial
               depth is shown only through incised lines and the hint of a shadow at the pyramid’s
               right side. This rendering of the pyramid’s sharp angles, the precision of the stairway,
               windows, and level steps are deliberate attempts by Márquez to connote a degree of
               Mexican technological advancement tied to ancient Greek or Egyptian monumental structures.
               In short, in removing the structure from Mexico, Márquez seeks to place the pyramid
               in the most familiar context: the cultural sophistication of the ancient Mediterranean.</p>
            <p>When contrasted with Márquez’s work in Rome, Humboldt’s contemporary images of Mexico
               open up a space to theorize the relationships between picturesque vision, subjective
               experience, and the desire for scientific objectivity. Humboldt spends the year of
               1803-1804 conducting archival research in Mexico City, at the tail end of his now-famous
               exploration of the Americas between 1799 and 1804. On one of his few excursions outside
               the city, Humboldt journeys to what is now Puebla state and produces one of his final
               images in the Americas, <em>Pyramide de Cholula</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="#fig2" title="2">Figure 2</a>). In Humboldt’s rendering, the massive four-stepped pyramid, topped by a small chapel,
               rises gently from the valley floor, dwarfed by the mountains in the background. The
               mountains’ jagged edges and shallow slopes serve as a point of contrast and comparison
               to the pyramid, simultaneously positioning it as united with the picturesque landscape
               as it maintains evidence of human artifice. In the foreground, two men clad in matching
               hats and topcoats converse, while a shirtless figure sits on the path next to them,
               staring into the ground. The figures’ proximity to Humboldt’s careful rendering of
               native Mexican trees makes apparent the image’s dual concerns of Enlightenment traditions
               of encyclopedic representation, visual legibility, and visualities during the Romantic
               period, particularly that of the picturesque landscape. This tension is especially
               apparent in Mexico, since Humboldt’s illustration of the Pyramid of Cholula represents
               such a marked contrast with Márquez’s contemporary work.</p>
            <p>When Humboldt returns to Europe and publishes <em>Pyramide de Cholula</em> in his <em>Vues des Cordillères</em> (1816), it marks the moment for the genesis of an emerging visual dialogue in the
               Atlantic world <span class="foreign">vis-à-vis</span> Mexico between the production of faithful representations of Mexican archaeology
               and geography, and the visual production of Romantic aesthetics in tandem with nascent
               visual technologies. This distinction and flux follows Nigel Leask’s elaborated tension
               between “subjectivist and objectivist strategies of representation” (167), which emerge
               as continually in flux and counterbalance in Humboldt’s work. In this way, Humboldt’s
               objective-subjective tension espouses a worldview where “the <em>way we feel</em> about the external world is as much a part of its meaning as what we can measure
               or know about it” (Leask 166). <em>Cholula</em> is an excellent example: Humboldt’s concern with presenting an encyclopedic inventory
               of the flora and geological landscape surrounding the pyramid speak to his desire
               to present the “beauty of the landscape” as a direct aspect of its scientific recording,
               both of which could be seen as mutually reinforcing in a “human-scale” (Godlewska
               247) landscape view. Humboldt’s and Márquez’s work emphasizes the centrality of the
               Mexican imaginary in the construction of Romantic Atlantic visual genealogies. Their
               images are, especially in Márquez’s case, an encounter between Mexican visual concerns
               and the visual iconography of Mediterranean archaeological illustrations. Thus, their
               work sows the seeds for further contested visualities in Mexico following independence,
               as European and American travelers use, adapt, and grapple with Romantic-era visual
               technologies (the camera lucida, the panorama, and the daguerreotype) in relation
               to the aforementioned discourse exemplified by Márquez and Humboldt.</p>
            <p>When New Spain gains its independence and splits into Mexico and the Federal Republic
               of Central America in 1823, suddenly Europeans and Americans are free to explore the
               region. Mexico occupies an unstable position in a post-independence world. Released
               from the Spanish crown, Mexico remains outside the linear historical narrative of
               the North Atlantic West. Its pre-conquest civilizations are an “historical tabula
               rasa” (Evans 2), ready to be mapped onto a larger transatlantic cultural geography.
               In this context, the Mexican landscape works to construct the illusion of totalizing,
               panoramic experiences for the citizens of the European metropole—in this case, London.
               Panoramas of Mexico originate from the interactions of two British citizens: William
               Bullock (c. 1773–1849), an English explorer and naturalist, and Robert Burford, owner
               and proprietor of the most popular panoramas in London. In 1822, Bullock travels to
               Mexico for six months, moving through Veracruz, Xalapa, Pulque, Puebla, Cholula, and
               Mexico City. Bullock uses his journey to write observations for his <em>Six Months Residence and Travel in Mexico</em> (1825), and to collect artifacts, documents, and illustrations for use in his exhibition
               <em>Modern Mexico</em> (1824), shown at the Egyptian Hall in London. Fittingly, the frontispiece to <em>Six Months Residence </em>is a panoramic landscape vista entitled <em>View of the City and the Valley of Mexico, from Tacubaya</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="#fig3" title="3">Figure 3</a>). The print, displaying a rolling central valley floor, distant cragged mountains,
               and encyclopedic representation of Mexican flora, presents many of the same interests
               as Humboldt’s <em>Pyramide de Cholula</em>. But Bullock expands what was previously a squared-off view into one that encircles
               the viewer’s visual field, tying the spectator into the panoramic vista. The dramatic
               effect delimits the space available to exploration as it opens the boundaries of that
               exploration to the edges of the mountains, a possibility that was limited through
               Humboldt’s illustration.</p>
            <p>When Burford receives Bullock’s print, he immediately makes plans to convert the image
               into a large-scale panoramic painting and exhibit it in the Leicester Square Panorama
               in London (Burford and Bullock). By 1820, as European audiences’ desire for more exotic
               spectacles grows stronger, and Burford begins incorporating the works of other artists
               from more distant locales. This is by no means unique to Burford: panorama owners
               frequently declare panoramic exhibitions as a safe and inexpensive alternative to
               international travel (Thomas 17). Bullock’s Mexico City panorama is one of many Burford
               exhibits during the early 1820s, from places as distant as New Zealand, India, the
               Arctic, and the Levant (Hyde). James Chandler and Kevin Gilmartin discuss the genesis
               and role of the panorama (both as a public exhibition and a visual system) originating
               from London and exported, in tandem with the conception of the modern metropolis,
               to other cities (7-10). At the same time, exotic locales in general, and Mexico in
               particular, are central to the formation of the panorama, and thus also to the cosmopolitan
               Londoner whose subjectivity was implicated in the panoramic view. As the origin of
               the panoramic view, London adapts and exports Mexico as a panoramic landscape, and
               thus as a visual mode to be applied to other locales (Chandler and Gilmartin 7). As
               the panoramic view is exported from London, it is adapted in two ways: first, to the
               aforementioned relations between objectivist and subjectivist modes of vision during
               the Romantic period, but second, it is problematized and disrupted in tandem with
               other visual technologies of exploration—most specifically, the camera lucida.</p>
            <p>Daston and Galison note that the camera lucida was one of the primary devices used
               in pursuit of mechanical objectivity (119). An artist’s drawing tool consisting of
               a bent lens attached to a metal pole, the device had been theorized in scientific
               texts as early as 1611, but was only re-invented and manufactured on a large scale
               beginning in the early nineteenth century. The camera lucida’s bifocal prism allowed
               the artist to look through the glass and see an external image reflected on drawing
               paper. The camera lucida’s association with scientific mechanical objectivity belies
               its original target audience: amateur artists and domestic users who could take advantage
               of the device’s low cost and supposed ease of use. As a result, the camera lucida
               gains wide popularity after its invention in 1807, but strangely, it occupies a marginalized
               position in the history of nineteenth-century visual practice. Jonathan Crary’s foundational
               <em>Techniques of the Observer</em>, for example, never mentions the camera lucida. Celia Lury notes this gap in Crary’s
               account, suggesting that the camera lucida is an equal participant in the new mode
               of visual primacy, but only as an “archaic artisanal practice” (Lury 158). Yet in
               his seminal treatise on photography, <em>Camera Lucida</em>, Roland Barthes declares it “a mistake to associate photography, by means of its
               technical origins, with the [. . .] <em>camera obscura</em>. It is the <em>camera lucida</em> [. . .]” (106). Barthes’ idea will emerge as central to my argument later; for now,
               note the privileged position of the camera obscura in the contemporary history of
               nineteenth-century visual practice, particularly in relation to photography. Most
               discussions of the camera lucida situate it as an antecedent to early photographic
               practices (as opposed to a distinct visual system that impacts photography on multiple
               levels) and/or as a domestic visual tool for aspiring artists or scientists. But these
               two conclusions greatly underestimate the tool’s use and importance in Romantic travel
               and archaeology.</p>
            <p>The work of Frederick Catherwood provides the best case study for the importance of
               the camera lucida. It is in his hands in Mexico that the camera lucida emerges, like
               the panorama and the daguerreotype, as an at once faithful tool and disobedient employee.
               Catherwood’s use of the camera lucida upends the established chronology of camera
               lucida to photography while illustrating the device’s contested genealogies and associations
               with purely scientific or domestic use in the European metropole. In 1836, Catherwood
               returns home to Britain after an eight-year stay in Egypt and the Levant, and he quickly
               gains a reputation as one of the finest archaeological travel artists in Europe. Catherwood
               is one of the first professionals to use the camera lucida in his work, some thirty
               years after the device’s invention (Hammond and Austin 3). The images produced on
               his travels, which include large-scale drawings and true-to-life schematics of archaeological
               sites through the Near East, are all rendered with the aid of a camera lucida. In
               fact, Catherwood’s fame rests partly on his ability to produce accurate recordings,
               an ability accentuated by the assistance of the camera lucida in his work (Bourbon
               26).</p>
            <p>The amount of experience and personal skill required to master the device undermines
               potential claims to the camera lucida as either a domestic or amateur instrument.
               An 1809 editorial by R.B. Bate, published in the London-based <em>Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts</em>, speaks to the camera lucida’s usefulness for more advanced artists like Catherwood.
               After a six page delineation of the difficulty of working with the camera lucida,
               including discussing the proper placement of the prism, proper posture to allow for
               effective transverse eye movement, and the correct angle at which to tighten the drawing
               paper, Bate notes how the camera lucida will benefit advanced artists as they will
               <span class="quote">‘Find a great economy of time, upon extensive and complicated subjects in particular,
                  by using the instrument in determining the situation of so many points as he may deem
                  important; and which the camera lucida is allowed to give ‘with perfect truth and
                  correctness of perspective.’ [. . .] [T]he truth of the reflected image in every circumstance
                  give the camera lucida a decided superiority over all other known contrivances for
                  the same purpose. (Bate 149-150)’</span> This bears repeating: “with perfect truth and correctness of perspective.” Anticipating
               Carlyle’s declaration of “truth and clarity,” Bate espouses the camera lucida as an
               effective weapon in the pursuit of mechanical objectivity. The camera lucida’s ability
               to re-create the world-as-image today marks the political stakes of contemporary visuality:
               defined as the system through which, as Nicholas Mirzoeff describes, visual subjects
               and representations are made to seem natural and ordered (<em>The Right to Look</em> 3).</p>
            <p>While in London in 1836, Burford invites Catherwood to construct a panorama of the
               city of Jerusalem, entitled <em>View of the City of Jerusalem</em>, based on Catherwood’s camera lucida drawings of the city. Catherwood himself paints
               the details of the image (Bourbon 31). John Lloyd Stephens, in London at the time,
               is immediately taken with Catherwood’s panorama (Bourbon 37). Burford sets up a meeting
               between Catherwood and Stephens, which would be the beginning of a lifelong friendship
               eventually resulting in the first scientific explorations of Central America. For
               Robert Burford, the meeting has a more practical entrepreneurial aspect: Burford encourages
               Catherwood (an architect by trade) to go with Stephens back to New York and open up
               his own panorama that can be used to exhibit Catherwood’s and Burford’s drawings (Comment
               56). In 1838, Catherwood travels to New York with Stephens and opens the Catherwood
               Panorama at the corner of Prince and Mercer Streets in Manhattan. That panorama’s
               founding comes about as a result of personal exchanges from men on both sides of the
               ocean. Its global variation of exhibited scenes are intended as substitutes for world
               travel for an emerging American metropolitan population; in turn, those images are
               the result of transatlantic movements of visual technologies. Here, the visual discourses
               that define their formal elements remain part of an ongoing negotiation of visual
               concerns set in motion by Márquez thirty-four years before in Mexico. At this point,
               then, discourses of Romantic visuality articulated through visual technologies remain
               unstable in both form and content, while oriented both transatlantically and toward
               the south.</p>
            <p>The grand opening of the panorama with <em>View of Jerusalem</em> is a great success. Catherwood’s 1838 advertisement provides a glimpse: “Splendid
               Panorama of Jerusalem, a painting of the largest class, 10,000 square feet, from drawings
               of Mr. Catherwood, brilliantly illuminated every evening by upwards of 200 gas-lights,
               admission 25 cents.” On June 23, <em>The New Yorker</em> publishes a rave review of the painting: <span class="quote">‘The most splendid panorama ever exhibited in this country [. . .] the painting of
                  <em>Jerusalem</em> is a masterly production and conveys as perfect an idea of that memorable city as
                  could be acquired by looking upon the real scene[. . .] After gazing for a few moments
                  the illusion becomes complete, and you imagine yourself perched upon the governor’s
                  terrace and looking down upon the narrow streets and massive walls beneath[. . .]
                  [This] reflects great credit upon the taste and enterprise of Mr. Catherwood the proprietor.
                  (“The New Panorama”)’</span> Here, what appears as a seamless marriage between the camera lucida and the panorama
               constitutes the eager American crowds as participants in the visual conquest of Jerusalem:
               travel is now unnecessary since the “ideal” Jerusalem already exists in New York.
               For such an experience, the crowds poured in. Later Catherwood and Stephens show three
               more of Burford’s canvases: <em>Niagara Falls</em>; <em>Lima</em>; and most notably <em>View of the Great Temple of Karnak, and the surrounding city of Thebes</em>, based on Catherwood’s own drawings from Egypt. No panorama canvases survive to the
               present day, but one can reconstruct some of this massive painting’s visual impact
               by examining the illustration in its accompanying guidebook (<a class="link_ref" href="#fig4" title="4">Figure 4</a>). It is clear that during his time in Egypt, Catherwood has no intention of creating
               panoramas for large-scale exhibition. In <em>Karnak</em>, Catherwood’s attention for detail rendering the Karnak temple’s architectural features
               merges with views of the receding Sahara desert, here populated with scores of travelers
               and local Egyptians re-created from Catherwood’s drawings. Thus, the tension between
               panorama and camera lucida, born from competing visual concerns among artists, archaeologists,
               and entrepreneurs in Europe and the Near East now appears in the emerging international
               metropolis of New York. But the next year, Catherwood’s unique perspectives would
               grapple with yet another new context: Mexico. There, with Stephens, Catherwood’s artistic
               production in pursuit of mechanical objectivity invites another device, one that generates
               an uneasy relationship with his camera lucida: the daguerreotype.</p>
            <p>When Stephens is appointed Special Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Central America
               in 1839, he uses the opportunity to conduct the first systematic exploration of Maya
               archaeological sites, with Catherwood as his chief artist. Mexico remains an historical
               tabula rasa for Stephens, and one he wants to inscribe with the United States’ national
               and historical imaginary. Stephens supposes that modern Mexicans are incapable of
               preserving Mexican archaeological sites, and remain disconnected from the cultures
               that produced them. He consistently refers to the areas south of the United States
               as “American” and “our country;” terms which serve to bring the Mexican material past
               into United States custodianship (Evans 58). As such, Stephens’ goal, with Catherwood
               at his side, is to utilize objective recording of the landscape to produce as many
               true-to-life visual representations of Mexican sites as possible, and in so doing
               claim them for the United States’ national consciousness. Stephens’ and Catherwood’s
               ability to reproduce that which they saw functioned as a visual conquest to bring
               the pieces to the United States, if only through the politics of display. For Stephens,
               as for the panorama’s visitors, there is no distinction between accurate representation
               and ownership. While utilizing Catherwood’s skill to reproduce Maya sites, Stephens
               plans to purchase and transport the entire Maya city of Copán to a “great museum of
               national museum of American antiquities” (<em>Incidents of Travel in Central America </em>1: 115) as a permanent exhibit. The extent to which Stephens would ultimately pursue
               this goal—giving up only in light of massive transportation costs and impractical
               logistics—speaks directly to the correlation between accurate, reproducible visual
               representation and physical ownerships of the objects Stephens and Catherwood seek
               to represent (Patterson 25).</p>
            <p>Together, Stephens and Catherwood conduct two different expeditions to Mexico, resulting
               in the publication of <em>Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan </em>(1841) and <em>Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</em> (1843). In addition to being travel narratives, both books recount how the camera
               lucida and the daguerreotype repeatedly rebel against the desires of their operator,
               thus ironically rendering visible the unavoidable presence of the artist in pursuit
               of the mechanically-reproduced view. In Mexico, Catherwood’s use of the camera lucida
               begins to frustrate him as he finds Maya iconographic designs more complex than what
               he was accustomed to on his previous travels, and so too complex for the naked eye.
               Catherwood produces a number of iconographic studies of Maya works, particularly of
               memorial stelae (<a class="link_ref" href="#fig5" title="5">Figure 5</a>), and the intricate iconographic programs that accompany them. In <em>Incidents of Travel in Central America</em>, Stephens notes <span class="quote">‘[T]he designs were so intricate and complicated, the subjects so entirely new and
                  unintelligible, that [Mr. Catherwood] had great difficulty in drawing [. . .] He had
                  made several attempts, both with the camera lucida and without, but failed to satisfy
                  himself or even me [. . .] The “idol” seemed to defy his art (1: 120).’</span> Thus, at the moment when Stephens and Catherwood have gained international recognition
               for their ability to transport viewers through perfectly reproduced images, here both
               the instrument of mechanical objectivity—the camera lucida—and the landscape itself
               defy their pursuits and render visible their own presence and the failed promises
               of their pursuit. For Catherwood, the Maya world requires extended meditation on his
               place as an artist, whereas previously it was his ability to render his own presence
               invisible in his work that gained him such fame. The instrument that had previously
               been his trustworthy partner now abandons him. Following the publication of <em>Incidents of Travel in Central America</em>, Catherwood and Stephens return to Mexico in 1841 armed with what they hope is a
               device to again render the landscape perfectly, what Stephens refers to as “the daguerreotype
               apparatus.”</p>
            <p>Daguerre’s invention, formally announced by the French government in January 1839,
               leads to other inventors claiming similar devices, which only serves to further fuel
               the invention’s popularity (Batchen 34). News and use of the device spreads so quickly
               that in their first expedition of October 1839, Stephens states his regret at neglecting
               to secure a daguerreotype apparatus for their journey, particularly since he had sponsored
               the first open public demonstration of the instrument in New York (Newhall 73). Only
               eighteen months later, Stephens and Catherwood are packing up the boxy instrument
               and transporting it to the Yucatán peninsula for their second Maya expedition. Just
               as prevailing historiographies of photography posit an evolution from the camera obscura
               and camera lucida to photography, Catherwood too hoped Daguerre’s machine would solve
               the problems they encountered with the camera lucida. Yet in continued defiance, Stephens
               and Catherwood encounter myriad difficulties with their new instrument. <em>Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</em> is filled with frustrated descriptions of the device’s bulkiness, failures, and finicky
               nature. Their first time using the device, Stephens relates how <span class="quote">‘[. . .] [T]he process was so complicated, and its success depended upon such a variety
                  of minute circumstances, it seemed really wonderful that it ever turned out well.
                  The plate might not be good, or not well cleaned; or the chemicals might not be of
                  the best; or the plate might be left too long in the iodine box, or taken out too
                  soon; or left too long in the bromine box, or taken out too soon; or a ray of light
                  might strike it on putting it into the camera or taking it out; or it might be left
                  too long in the camera or taken out too soon; and even though all these processes
                  were right and regular, there might be some other fault or omission which we were
                  not aware of; besides which, climate and atmosphere had great influence, and might
                  render all to no avail (1: 103-104).’</span> Here, even acknowledging the extent to which its success depended on a variety of
               technological and personal factors, it is Stephens’ bafflement at the “climate and
               atmosphere” of Central America that stand out. Though Stephens and Catherwood are
               armed with a supposedly objective, rationalizing, scientific instrument, it is the
               landscape itself that rebels against their efforts at visual conquest. As Stephens’
               attempted conquest depends on the production of a clear, mechanically-objective view,
               the daguerreotype fails to deliver: even when the image came out correctly, the detail
               was nowhere near what could be captured with a camera lucida. In short, the daguerreotype’s
               immediate fame and supposed technological advancement over earlier techniques matters
               little in this new context. The final straw for the daguerreotype’s use among the
               Maya ruins comes when Stephens and Catherwood are finally able to finish the daguerreotype
               process successfully. Even if everything goes well during the production of the image,
               the quality is such to dissatisfy Catherwood and Stephens. During the recording of
               buildings at Uxmal, <span class="quote">‘Mr. Catherwood began taking views; but the results were not sufficiently perfect
                  to suit his ideas [. . .] They gave a general idea of the character of the buildings,
                  but would not do to put into the hands of the engraver without copying the views on
                  paper, which would require more labor than that of making at once complete original
                  drawings. He therefore completed everything with his pencil and camera lucida (1:
                  175).’</span> Catherwood’s images of the buildings at Uxmal (<a class="link_ref" href="#fig6" title="6">Figure 6</a>), while showing their “character” through the daguerreotype, cannot be accurately
               rendered to Catherwood’s preference. This is an unstable and crucial moment in the
               history of objectivity and the modern visual subject. Less than two years after its
               invention, in Mexico the daguerreotype emerges as an ambivalent and defiant instrument,
               and occupying an ambiguous position in relation to the camera lucida. When fine detail
               cannot be reproduced in a daguerreotype, Catherwood substitutes it for his own camera
               lucida; a device which, less than two years prior, he found similarly insufficient
               for producing records of Maya imagery. Here, Catherwood’s preference for the camera
               lucida is evidence for the destabilization of the camera lucida / photography progression,
               at least in the early years of the apparatus. At the same time, both devices function
               as mutually reinforcing and interchangeable, each one used in different contexts for
               different reasons. Only a short time into their trip, the pragmatic pair cease with
               the daguerreotype for archaeological illustrations altogether, using only the camera
               lucida. But they do not abandon the device: the pair set up a makeshift studio in
               Mérida, which is quickly converted into a local portrait studio once word of the machine
               spreads through the city. Suddenly, the daguerreotype—so inappropriate and ill-fitted
               to the scientific recording of archaeological sites—is perfectly suited to producing
               images of people.</p>
            <p>It is in this small studio in 1841 that the visual interests of Stephens’ and Catherwood’s
               exhibition takes a sharp turn away from a pursuit of objective scientific accuracy,
               as they begin a short career as “ladies' Daguerreotype portrait takers” (<em>Incidents of Travel in Yucatan </em> 1: 100). The first daguerreotypes produced in the Americas specifically for exhibition
               (Stephens will display many of the images from his studio at the Catherwood Panorama
               in New York) present both subjects and ideologies completely removed from Stephens’
               original motivation for the trip. This moment in the visual history of the Americas,
               caught amidst Stephen’s imperial project and the daguerreotype-mania that will spread
               across the continent in less than a decade, marks the emergence of a long nineteenth-century
               history of the use of photography in the formulation of personal subjectivities, identities,
               and discourses of (scientific) racism. In <em>Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</em>, Stephens takes great care to recount in detail some of the first people to sit for
               daguerreotype portraits, all of them women: <span class="quote">‘The young ladies were dressed in their prettiest costume, with earrings and chains,
                  and their hair adorned with flowers. All were pretty, and one was much more pretty;
                  not in the style of the Spanish beauty, with dark eyes and hair, but a delicate and
                  dangerous blonde, simple, natural and unaffected, beautiful without knowing it, and
                  really because she could not help it. Her name, too, was poetry itself (1: 101).’</span> Stephens never reveals the name of the “delicate and dangerous” woman, choosing only
               describe her as she sits for her portrait. It is telling and fortuitous that Stephens
               chooses to describe her in such detail. In <em>Camera Lucida</em>, Roland Barthes notices the tendency to transform oneself in front of the camera,
               remarking how he would “make another body for myself, I transform myself in advance
               into an image” (10). Stephens describes this process in terms of the daguerreotype
               making the woman into an image of her bodily arrangement and costuming. He goes on
               to relay the difficulties encountered in this process: <span class="quote">‘Our first subject was the lady of the poetical name. It was necessary to hold a consultation
                  upon her costume, whether the colors were pretty and such as would be brought out
                  well or not; whether a scarf around the neck was advisable; whether the hair was well
                  arranged, the rose becoming, and in the best position; then to change it, and consider
                  the effect of the change, and to say and do many other things which may suggest themselves
                  in the reader’s imagination, and all of which gave rise to many profound remarks in
                  regard to artistical effect, and occupied much time [. . .] (1: 102-103).’</span> In detailing the woman’s appearance, ethnicity and her concern with the presentation
               of her own costume, Stephens alludes to what will emerge in the mid-nineteenth century
               as a prevailing discourse in daguerreotypy: the invention of personal subjectivities
               as a byproduct of photographic practice. Only two decades after Stephens and Catherwood’s
               trip to Mexico, Francis Galton (1822-1911), a British naturalist and polymath, uses
               composite fabrication of portrait photographs to create a series of racialized types
               in one of the first photographic attempts at visual eugenics (Sekula). In 1850, Louis
               Agassiz (1807-1873), doing for the United States what Galton did for Victorian audiences,
               produces a series of daguerreotypes of enslaved persons in Columbia, South Carolina,
               aimed at proving innate racial differences to support his theory of humanity’s polygenesis
               (Wallis). And in the 1860s, Agassiz produces a series of photographs of racial hybrids
               as undeveloped, tropical, degenerate bodies during a research expedition to Brazil,
               with the explicitly anti-Darwinian goal of proving racial differences as static, fixed,
               and climatically variable in line with his polygenetic theory (Stepan 85). Thus, the
               discourse of mechanical objectivity that here acts to accurately reproduce the individual
               subject is soon after taken up by scientists to mask their own presence in pursuit
               of an “objective” hierarchy of mankind.</p>
            <p>While I argue that Stephens’ studio acts as a potential genesis for this discourse,
               there is no evidence that Stephens’ goal was to produce a classification or record
               of racial difference in the Yucatán. His intricate description of the dress of “the
               lady of the poetical name,” and the care with which her portrait was arranged, bears
               little evidence that a racial typology or desire to record was implicit in Stephens’
               thinking. Moreover, it was Stephens himself who found the need to differentiate between
               an accurate, encyclopedic visual record of the archaeological sites he discovered
               in order to situate them inside American national consciousness; versus the people
               now living around them whom he characterized as less than able custodians. For whatever
               reason, Stephens did not emphasize this point by presenting visual evidence of U.S.
               and Mexican racial difference along which to construct a cultural hierarchy, much
               as Galton and Agassiz would do only a few decades later.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to say more regarding Stephens and Catherwood’s photographs of the
               women of Mérida because the daguerreotypes no longer exist. When the pair returns
               from the Yucatán in 1842, they immediately set up an exhibition of their collected
               (or conquered) Maya artifacts, as well as their daguerreotypes, in the Catherwood
               Panorama. Catherwood’s rotunda, like most others at the time, was constructed of wood
               and met its end in an accidental fire on the night of July 31, 1842 (Barger and White
               77). Upon seeing the ruins on the morning of August 1, Stephens writes in <em>Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</em> only that he “had the melancholy satisfaction of seeing their ashes exactly as the
               fire had left them” (1: 103). The loss is devastating on both sides of the Atlantic:
               Catherwood had neglected to take out insurance on his building, and Stephens on the
               artifacts inside, so both lose a great deal. Back in London, Burford—still hoping
               to create an international network for his panorama business—is forced to abandon
               his plans. And the modern record of the first daguerreotypes and camera lucida drawings
               produced in the Yucatán, as well as Catherwood’s panoramas, is destroyed.</p>
            <p>Yet this loss may also provide insight into Stephens’ emotional infatuation with both
               his daguerreotype and the unnamed woman who sat for it. In <em>Camera Lucida</em>, Barthes describes in detail a photograph of his mother as a young woman, an image
               he refers to as the “Winter Garden Photograph.” He uses the image to posit the existence
               of two separate qualities inherent in every photograph: the “<span class="foreign">studium</span>,” the photograph’s objective contents; and the “<span class="foreign">punctum</span>,” that part of the photograph which impacts the viewer most forcefully, creating
               a subjective experience between viewer and image. Barthes recognizes the <span class="foreign">punctum</span> of his mother’s presence for his own experience, and by extension the impossibility
               of a similar experience for any other viewer, so Barthes chooses not to reproduce
               the image: <span class="quote">‘I cannot reproduce for you the Winter Garden Photograph. It exists only for me. For
                  you, it would be nothing but an indifferent picture, one of the thousand manifestations
                  of the “ordinary”; it cannot in any way constitute the visible object of a science;
                  it cannot establish an objectivity, in the positive sense of the term; at most it
                  would interest your <em>studium</em>: period, clothes, photogeny; but in it, for you, no wound (73).’</span> It begs the question, given Stephens’ account of his visual and emotional infatuation
               with the daguerreotype of the unnamed woman, whether this image can “establish an
               objectivity.” Just like the “Winter Garden Photograph,” Stephens’ intimate experience
               with that image would have been accessible only to him, and hint as he may at his
               emotions, it is fitting that the photograph no longer exists. The image’s inaccessibility
               to, in Barthes’ terms, “science” and “objectivity” is insightful given Stephens’ presumed
               motivation for his and Catherwood’s mission to Mexico: the scientific, objective recording
               of Maya archaeological sites through the utilization of visual technologies created
               for the purpose. While, as mentioned previously, daguerreotypes would later be intertwined
               in a history of supposedly scientific, objective human typologizing, they function
               here as the final piece in a long line of foils to Stephens’ and Catherwood’s own
               insistence on the ability of the daguerreotype and the camera lucida to objectively
               record the art and archaeology of the Yucatán.</p>
            <p>While daguerreotypes would later be intertwined in a history of human typologizing,
               they function here as the final piece in a long line of foils to Stephens’ own insistence
               on the ability to accurately record the world. As I have argued, the quest to accurately
               represent Mexican archaeological sites was a complex, multidirectional, and often
               highly contentious process whereby the definition of “accuracy” constantly adapted
               to new frameworks, locations, and visual technologies. While Márquez and Humboldt
               in many ways started this dialogue, Catherwood and Stephens brought it to its height
               with their use of the panorama, camera lucida, and daguerreotype in service of their
               goal of objectivity. Yet far from being their loyal servants, in the context of the
               Yucatán these technologies forced the pair to acknowledge the highly subjective nature
               of their task. The camera lucida continually fought with Catherwood in the Yucatán,
               forcing him to move to the daguerreotype, which in its own defiance moved Stephens
               toward an experience of total subjective personal infatuation in contrast to his own
               stated mission. And when this image is displayed, the wooden panorama gives way. Every
               device Stephens and Catherwood sought to use, from the camera lucida to the daguerreotype
               to the panorama, abandoned them. In the end, presented with the pile of ashes of all
               they had created, Stephens’ words take his concern with objectivity and hold on to
               it, but inside, without image or referent beyond emotional reaction: “I had the melancholy
               satisfaction of seeing their ashes exactly as the fire had left them.”</p>
            <p>In presenting this series of contested technological genealogies and travel accounts,
               my goal has been twofold: to argue that visual technologies, long marginalized in
               discussions of Romantic travel, should occupy primary importance in that discourse;
               and second, that these technologies and their role in the evolving discourse of visuality
               emerges principally in areas located outside the historical West. The evidence for
               this was multifaceted. First, I showed that visual technologies act as mediators between
               desires to convey subjective experience versus objective knowledge and their presentation
               in visual media—an assertion that disrupts characterizations of linear evolutionary
               development in visual technologies during this period. For Catherwood, the use of
               the camera lucida is the culmination of a burgeoning intellectual exchange system
               that values scientifically accurate representation in tandem with Romantic picturesque
               aesthetics, both of which come together in Burford’s panoramas. And the daguerreotype,
               alternately viewed by Batchen and Crary as a descendant of the camera obscura or a
               device to supplant the camera lucida, here functions simultaneously as inadequate
               for mechanical objectivity and valuable enough to produce images of subjective emotional
               power. But the meditative power given to these technologies led to my second point,
               that these technologies are powerful agents that render visible the artifice of both
               mechanical objectivity and visuality. Catherwood’s frustrations with the camera lucida
               in Mexico, Stephens’ characterizations of the perils of daguerreotypy, and the pair’s
               adaptation of the daguerreotype to a new context all speak to this. Finally, I sought
               to illustrate the inability of a center/periphery model of cultural and intellectual
               diffusion to account for the proliferation of images of Mexican history and archaeology
               in the Atlantic world during the early nineteenth century. Though all these technologies
               were “invented” in Europe, this fixation on geographic origin belies a transatlantic
               and southern-oriented genesis for the constitution and construction of visual technologies,
               Romantic visualities, objectivity, and the rise of the visual subject.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Throughout this essay I use the terms “Mexico” and “Mexican” as many foreign travelers
               in the nineteenth century used the umbrella term “Mexico”—to refer to the entire region
               south of the United States as far south as Costa Rica. All sites I discuss were either
               inside the borders of New Spain or part of a territory (the Federal Republic of Central
               America) whose political existence was generally deemed too unstable to warrant a
               different name.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">For example, Benjamin Colbert argues that the creation of the subjective being necessitated
               a shift away from Enlightenment notions of human vision as pure and unmediated (8).
               In <em>Voyage into Substance</em>, Barbara Maria Stafford takes this a step further, displacing subjective Romantic
               vision onto other sense modes entirely, arguing that the Romantic traveler “felt the
               landscape without seeing it” (443). Nigel Leask counters both positions, showing that
               travelers always grappled with the complex relationships between subjective aesthetics
               and the continued goal to present objective knowledge (167-168).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
