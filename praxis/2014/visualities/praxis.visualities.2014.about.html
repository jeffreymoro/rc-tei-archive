            </header>
            <p class="noCount">This volume of <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</em> includes an editor's introduction by <a class="link_ref" href="#KelleyAbout" title="">Theresa M. Kelley</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="#CasidAbout" title="">Jill H. Casid</a>, with essays by <a class="link_ref" href="#ThomasAbout" title="">Sophie Thomas</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="#WoodAbout" title="">Marcus Wood</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="#RareyAbout" title="">Matthew Francis Rarey</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="#KrizAbout" title="">Kay Dian Kriz</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="#TraverseAbout" title="">Lucy Kamiko Hawkinson Traverse</a>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">This volume is dedicated to both excavating the Romantic genealogies of visuality
               and charting directions for the ways in which the study of Romantic visual culture
               may redraw the geographic, temporal, and disciplinary bounds of Romanticism, bringing
               diverse, and in some instances new, objects and their ethical, political, and aesthetic
               stakes into view. The essays investigate three broad inquiries: 1) technologies of
               vision and objectivity’s slippages; 2) the indigenous or transplanted fruits of visuality’s
               New World Genealogies and 3) the role of proto-photography, panopticism, and slavery
               in the spectral formation of Romantic visuality. Emphasizing the ways we interpret
               visuality in romantic culture, the volume invites reconsideration of media, practices,
               and discourses that would seem to belong to earlier and later periods—from the artifacts
               and modes of viewing attached to curiosity and to technologies and ways of imaging
               and imagining that have become aligned with photography and the digital. </p>

               <p class="noCount">This volume was designed at the University of Maryland by David Rettenmaier, Site
                  Manager at <em>Romantic Circles</em>. The main banner image on the table of contents uses as its background <em>Section of the Rotunda, Leicester Square, in which is Exhibited the Panorama</em>, 1801 (aquatint) by Robert Mitchell (fl. 1782-1835). Private Collection/ The Bridgeman

The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</a> tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style applied by
                  David Rettenmaier. TEI renders text in archival quality for better preservation and
                  future access. Laura Mandell developed the modified versions of the XSLT transforms

               <p class="noCount">The <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</em> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation
                  of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation
                  of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <em>RCPS</em> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand,
                  dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other,
                  retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions
                  of today. <em>RCPS</em> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and most exciting critical
                  writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>

                  the Department of Art History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She is a broad
                  modernist interested in the transatlantic visual culture of the long nineteenth century,
                  the history and theory of photography, the gendering and imaging of psychosomatic
                  eccentricity, and visual experiences of the urban. Her dissertation, “Ectoplasmic
                  Modernities: Materialization Photography at the Turn of the Century,” explores the
                  transatlantic interest in psychical research at the fin de siècle, arguing that the
                  “ectoplasmic” forces us to rethink modernism’s visual and conceptual relationship
                  to the occult, and photography’s relationship to the history of science. This project
                  has been supported by Chancellor’s Fellowships and a CLIR/Mellon Fellowship for Dissertation
                  Research in Original Sources. Work from her dissertation research will appear in the
                  forthcoming anthology <em>Photography in Doubt</em> (Routledge, 2015).</p>
