               <h1><span class="head">Turner’s <em>Slavers</em>, Race, and the Ridiculous Human Fragment</span></h1>
            </header><br/><div class="epigraph"><span class="quote">‘Is the picture sublime or ridiculous? Indeed I don’t know which. 
                  <div class="indent4">William Makepeace Thackeray</div>’</span></div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Writing in <em>Fraser’s Magazine</em>, William Makepeace Thackeray broached the question of the sublime and the ridiculous
                  in his review of J. M. W. Turner’s <em>Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying: Typhon Coming On</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="#slavers" title="1">figure 1</a>), which was on display in the annual exhibition of the Royal Academy in 1840 (731).
                  Thackeray’s ambiguous answer is somewhat disingenuous, judging from the exuberantly
                  sarcastic tenor of his review. In this famous passage, filled with mock horror, for
                  example, he comically rejects the possibility that the painting offers any kind of
                  convincing illusion of the tragic scene suggested by its title: <span class="quote">‘Rocks of gamboges [strong yellow] are marked down on the canvas, flakes of white laid
                     on with a trowel; bladders of vermilion madly spirited here and there. Yonder is the
                     slaver rocking in the midst of a flashing foam of white-lead. The sun glares down
                     upon a horrible sea of emerald and purple, into which chocolate-coloured slaves are
                     plunged, and chains that will not sink; and round these are floundering such a race
                     of fishes as never was seen since the <span class="foreign">saeculum Pyrrhae</span>, gasping dolphins redder than the reddest herrings; horrid spreading polypi, like
                     huge slimy poached eggs, in which hapless niggers plunge and disappear. Ye gods, what
                     a ‘middle passage’! (731)’</span> Unlike Thackeray, most scholars writing about the <em>Slavers</em> over the past century have opted for the sublime, despite the fact that they invariably
                  cite Thackeray’s review as well as equally hostile ones by his contemporaries.

                           Royal Academy,” in Athenaeum; and “Exhibition of the Royal Academy,” in Times (London).</span></div>
                  </div> In the essay that follows I want to consider the case for the ridiculous, and to suggest
                  that by so doing Turner’s painting can be productively situated with the contemporary
                  Anglo-European discourse on racial difference. In 1990 Paul Gilroy argued that Turner’s <em>Slavers</em> “offers one opportunity to appreciate that English art and aesthetics are not simply
                  in place alongside English thinking about race;” rather, they are “an integral means
                  with which England was able to make sense of itself and its destiny” (51). In the
                  two decades since this statement, many thoughtful accounts of the <em>Slavers</em> have been published, but they have largely ignored issues of race in their eagerness
                  to analyze the painting within the context of the Atlantic slave trade.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>There is a large body of scholarship on this picture. Some of the major publications
                           from the last twenty years include Boime, McCoubrey, Wood's Blind Memory, Baucom,
                           Castello, and Marsh.</span></div>
                  </div> Questions of race are deeply intertwined with the institution of slavery in the early
                  modern period. And yet, when considering cultural representations of Atlantic slavery,
                  it is unwise to conflate slavery with race, especially in dealing with visual representation,
                  since aesthetics and visuality have been central to the construction of racial difference
                  from the late eighteenth century forward. Before turning to the “ridiculous,” and
                  racialization, I want to briefly consider how modern scholarship came to assess Turner’s <em>Slavers</em> as a sublimely Romantic masterpiece.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Foundational to this characterization of the <em>Slavers</em> is John Ruskin’s impassioned account from <em>Modern Painters</em>, published three years after its first exhibition (3: 571-3). Relegating to a footnote
                  the subject—the jettisoning of enslaved Africans from a slave ship tossing in a storm-swept
                  sea—Ruskin brings the painting to life. Unlike Thackeray, he makes no references to
                  paint, brushwork, and composition in this passage, only to sublime natural effects
                  such as the “glorious light [. . .] which burns like gold, and bathes like blood,”
                  and “the mist of night [. . .] advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty
                  ship [. . .] its thin masts written upon the sky in lines of blood, girded with condemnation
                  in that fearful hue which signs the sky with horror” (3: 572). Through Turner’s genius,
                  nature and the slave ship (but not the fish and fragmented human bodies) become the
                  embodiments of horror and beauty, capable of moving the viewer to aesthetic admiration
                  and moral outrage. In producing a work of art capable of eliciting this sort of moral
                  and aesthetic response, the Romantic genius becomes a sort of a superconductor who
                  feels more deeply than ordinary individuals and can brilliantly and beautifully convey
                  those feelings to the less sensitive via his art (Kriz, <em>Idea</em> 87). Ruskin writes in <em>Modern Painters</em> about the special character of the landscape painter who <span class="quote">‘makes him [the spectator] a sharer in his own strong feelings and quick thoughts;
                     hurries him away in his own enthusiasm; guides him to all that is beautiful; snatches
                     him from all that is base; and leaves him more than delighted,—ennobled and instructed,
                     under the sense of having not only beheld a new scene, but of having held communion
                     with a new mind, and having been endowed for a time with the keen perception and the
                     impetuous emotions of a nobler and more penetrating intelligence. (3: 134) ’</span> This form of shared viewing through the mind of the artist would also seem to involve
                  the spectator with yet another mediator: the Romantic critic. Certainly Ruskin’s fervent
                  prose is every bit as much a performance of the deeply sensitive self as Turner’s
                  painting.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This point has been made by McCoubrey (349-50) and Marsh (51); they note that some
                           Americans, who encountered Turner’s painting only through Ruskin’s description, were
                           keenly disappointed when they viewed it after it came to Boston. </span></div>
                  </div>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This cultural formation, which insistently values artistic sensibility, also produces
                  “Romantic scholarship”—that is, scholarship driven by the belief that analyzing great
                  art depends on discerning the artistic genius’s feelings and motives so viewers may
                  channel “the keen perception and the impetuous emotions of a nobler and more penetrating
                  intelligence.” Even though much of the recent scholarship on the <em>Slavers</em> has been extremely “contextual,” engaging with the complex histories of Anglo-European
                  colonization and the Atlantic slave system, by and large the scholarship has maintained
                  a Romantic fixation on finding “meaning” in the painting by focusing on Turner. Scholars
                  have considered in detail his intentions, his visual and textual sources, his attitude
                  towards history in general and the slave trade in particular, and more recently his
                  investments—I refer here to Sam Smiles’ recent discovery that in 1805 the artist had
                  invested in a Jamaican venture dependent on slave labor (47).

                           a cattle pen (ranch) in Jamaica. Wood (Blind Memory 41-68) and McCoubrey offer the
                           most thorough analysis of Turner’s visual and literary sources.</span></div>

               <p>If we turn our attention away from the artist and toward his contemporary critics,
                  we are immediately confronted with the issue of the ridiculous. Turner’s use of intense,
                  highly-keyed green and purple (lost over time), and the still-brilliant red, orange,
                  white, and yellow in the sky and water attracted bemused criticism (McCoubry 336-7).
                  But even more sport was made of the human fragments (hands and a leg), floating chains,
                  and strange-looking fish located in the foreground ([Thackeray] 731, Eagles 380, "Fine
                  Arts," "Exhibition").
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In Reinventing Allegory, Theresa Kelley argues that Turner moved the Slavers away
                           from the illusionism of the real and into the realm of the allegorical through the
                           use of forms and figures that tend toward the excessive—such as the oddly floating
                           chains, which dramatically index the submerged bodies connected to them (177-78).
                           Kelley astutely shows how the allegorical and the satiric mode share a visual vocabulary
                           that depends on the grotesque and the theatrical—an insight that is suggestive for
                           new lines of study.</span></div>
                  </div> Now, as a glance at nineteenth-century Royal Academy reviews confirms, it was not
                  unusual for a painting—especially a painting by Turner—to provide critics with an
                  occasion to display their talent for withering satire. During the fifty years that
                  Turner had been exhibiting at the Royal Academy, his paintings provoked satiric comments
                  about his paint handling, figures, composition, and color.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                           (6)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Butlin and Joll, vol. 1 for excerpts of Turner criticism. </span></div>
                  </div> But the critics in 1840 did not shrink from making jokes that, while aimed at Turner,
                  also seemed to be at the expense of those fragmented bodies of African slaves who
                  had been cruelly thrown overboard by the slavers and left to drown or be eaten by
                  the fish.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Recall that Thackeray described the “horrible sea of emerald and purple into which
               chocolate-coloured slaves are plunged, and chains that will not sink ” before turning
               to the sea life: the “gasping dolphins redder than the reddest herrings; horrid spreading
               polypi, like huge slimly poached eggs, in which hapless niggers plunge and disappear.”
               From this almost cannibalistic description of slaves that are chocolate colored—a
               reference that threatens to turn the slaves into one of the edible New World commodities
               they produce—one might imagine that their bodies would be clearly visible. But in
               fact, the slaves are denoted by fragments, primarily hands, which seem at points to
               be indistinguishable from the dark fish tails silhouetted in the blood-red sun and
               from the wings of birds flying low over the water (<a class="link_ref" href="#slavers_detail1" title="2">figure 2</a>). Even the largest identifiably human body part in the painting, the dusky-colored
               leg in the lower right corner (<a class="link_ref" href="#slavers_detail2" title="3">figure 3</a>), is framed between the bodies and tails of two large fish, whose tailfins rhyme
               with the spread toes and loose chain attached to the foot. This leg drew the attention
               of the critic for the <em>Times</em>: “the leg of a negro [. . .] is about to afford a nibble to a John Dory, a pair of
               soles, and a shoal of whitebait”(6). The same leg provided one of Turner’s most consistently
               hostile critics, the conservative Reverend John Eagles, with the occasion to attempt
               a pun: in his review for <em>Blackwood’s Magazine</em> he remarked that the “fish claiming their leg-acy is very funny” (380). Marcus Wood
               has appropriately asked “if indeed this is funny, why is it funny?” He concludes that
               the bottom-right corner of Turner’s painting centered on the leg is a “tragic-comic
               lament on the slave trade,” and that the “diving leg implores us to try to understand
               mass murder by picking up the pieces” (<em>Blind Memory</em> 49, 50). This is a fine piece of impassioned Romantic criticism, undergirded by thorough
               scholarship and an appropriate application of trauma theory. It constitutes Turner
               as the Romantic subject and “us” as the privileged viewer. My interest, conversely,
               is “them”—those contemporary critics who seem to have recognized the comedy, but somehow
               missed the point.</p>
            <p>First, it is worth noting that while Turner often produced figures that were shapeless,
               ambiguous, or vague, he usually did not emphasize the fragmented body in other scenes
               of human disaster. Even in the strange and disturbing <em>Field of Waterloo</em> (1818, <a class="link_ref" href="#waterloo" title="4">figure 4</a>), where the dead are rendered as a molten mass, they appear as notionally complete
               bodies. We cannot know why Turner chose to represent the dead and dying African slaves
               as fragments in his <em>Slavers</em>, but we can be certain that there was plenty of cultural precedent for doing so.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As Roxann Wheeler has shown, for most of the eighteenth century, human difference
                  was predicated on a range of factors, including religion, clothing, social organization,
                  and language. Skin color and other aspects of physical appearance were registered
                  as differences (often attributed to differences in climate), but they were not foundational
                  to the formation of human categories, which were more often described in terms of
                  “variety,” rather than race (31). By the third quarter of the eighteenth century,
                  however, human difference increasingly became subject to categorization based on physical
                  traits, although socio-cultural differences never lost their power to describe variations
                  in the civility and rudeness of a people. There is no simple explanation for this
                  shift. Contributing factors included the enhanced scientific authority of natural
                  history, now extended to the study of humans (in widely influential writings by Linnaeus
                  and Buffon, for example). The expansion of European exploration and colonization was
                  also a crucial factor, along with the explosion in print culture that brought natural
                  and civil histories of European and non-European peoples to a widening readership.
                  There was also an acceleration of popular interest in the pseudo-science of physiognomy,
                  which claimed that character could be read through an analysis of the shape of the
                  skull and facial features. And, significantly, there was the development of a body
                  of writing on aesthetics, which, like scientific writings, could not avoid taking
                  up the issue of human difference, increasingly posed in racialized terms.

                  physiognomist Johann Caspar Lavater (1741-1801), and the influential author of books
                  on antique art and aesthetics, Johann Winckelmann (1717-1768), acknowledged the diversity
                  of human groups spread across the globe; however, the “negro”—a term that I use throughout
                  this essay to indicate a socially constructed racial category associated with sub-Saharan
                  African peoples—was frequently positioned as anatomically most distant from the European.

                  pose of the <em>Apollo</em> by Pompeo Batoni (<a class="link_ref" href="#portrait" title="5">figure 5</a>). The fact that this ideal body was conjured up from a fragmented copy of a lost

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My research indicates that within the intertwined discourses of race and aesthetics
                  there was no viable “negro” counterpart to the <em>Apollo</em>; the black body always failed to measure up to this white ideal, and never could
                  aspire to its perfection (Kriz, <em>Slavery</em> 71ff). The alternative idea of the negro is in fact the bestial body, given over to
                  the base appetites and physical senses, rather than reason, judgment, and (good) taste
                  (Virey 2: 41-2). The most well-known scientific representations of this idea come
                  from a highly influential treatise on skull shape, physiognomy, and human difference
                  by the Dutch anatomist Petrus Camper, first published in 1786. He developed a scale
                  for differentiating between the skulls of certain mammals and various types of humans
                  based on the slant of a straight line drawn from the lip, to the tip of the nose,
                  to the top of the forehead. This “facial line” not only served to distinguish various
                  animal and human types, but also to order them aesthetically: according to Camper,
                  the more vertical the facial line, the more beautiful (100).

                  skull (!!) of the <em>Apollo</em> at the “high” (most beautiful) end of the scale, Camper disrupts the very system of
                  scientific evaluation he sets up, which was based on serial assessments of difference
                  and similitude.

            <p>Camper disparages the idea that cranial similarity between apes and Africans (positioned
               at the “low” end of the diagram) was a sign of the latter’s bestiality (32). But placing
               like-shaped objects next to each other within the same field had for centuries been
               a way of inviting an exploration of their similarities, based on long-standing notions
               of resemblance and contiguity. The naturalization of the link between the African
               and the slave—forged over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—further
               promoted the association of the African with the bestial. Long before Africans were
               enslaved and forcibly transported to the New World, the idea of the slave as beast
               of burden was a commonplace in writings on slavery. And in the eighteenth century,
               even the prominent abolitionist Thomas Clarkson agreed with his anti-abolitionist
               opponents that African slaves had a brutish appearance and diminished mental capacities.
               In a passage from his <em>Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species</em>, published in 1786, he insisted that these are the effects of slavery, not essential
               qualities (21). Whatever the cause, however, Africans were triply susceptible to charges
               of animality: because of the alleged similarity of their skulls to apes; their origin
               in a mysterious continent filled with strange creatures; and their enslavement by
               Europeans, which was bound to turn humans into beasts.</p>

               <p>In art, the racialist (and racist) idea of the negro finds its fullest expression

                  of the grotesque, the fragmentary, and the excessive, often in conjunction with the
                  animalization of the human. Drawing on visual traditions going back several centuries,
                  many of the British caricatures that were commercially marketed from the eighteenth
                  century onward gleefully used animal imagery to satirize public figures, as well as
                  social and national types.

                           and human physiognomies. His work was influential in the development of natural history
                           and caricature. Zoomorphism persisted throughout the nineteenth century and beyond

                  writings on New World slavery, and the emerging scientific discourse on human variety,

               <p>One of the most potent caricatures to capitalize on the idea of the fragmented and

                  not—namely, that the fragmentation of the negro as a racial type thematizes the high
                  level of violence enacted on the black body under Atlantic slavery. According to the
                  inscription on the print, the image is based on a report read before Parliament in
                  1791 claiming that an English slave driver had punished a slave who insisted he was
                  too sick to work by immersing him in a vat of boiling sugar.

                  gesturing limbs of the victim rhyming with the black human arm and ear that appear
                  alongside the vermin nailed to the back wall—calls into question the political motivation
                  of the print (Paulson 204). And it may well be that this is not an atrocity print
                  designed to convince viewers of the horrors of West Indian slavery, but rather a parody
                  of abolitionist accounts that reveals how ridiculous such claims of suffering really
                  were.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In either case, the excessiveness of the image reinforces the reputation of the West
               Indian colonies as a space of excess and extremes—of climate, profit taking, and behavior.
               Through the hyperbolic language of caricature, the artist vividly suggests that everyone
               who comes in contact with the West Indies is debased—the English driver becomes a
               monstrous cannibal (a type associated both with the indigenous peoples of West Africa
               and the West Indies), and the slaves are reduced to body parts that will be eaten
               or displayed as vermin. And yet, the caricatured English slave driver still represents
               a deviation from some kind of ideal, virtuous, white body. The black body fragments
               do not. There is no coherent alternative or ideal that secures the representation
               of the African slave in caricature as a deviation. Rather these bestial bits are what
               figure the negro. This trope only gained strength between the publication of Gillray’s
               print in 1791 and the exhibition of Turner’s <em>Slavers</em> in 1840, with its fragmented bodies that eerily conjure up the boiled, drowning slave
               in <em>Barbarities</em>.</p>

                  idea by reducing the black figures to a series of ridiculous and disarticulated parts:
                  bulbous noses, pop-eyes, and lumpish hairdos. The garish, unmodulated coloring of
                  black skin set against light fabric, such as the face and frilly white cap of the

                  about black contamination of white society through ingestion (Gillray), or social
                  invasion (Tregear). We’ve seen that Turner’s <em>Slavers </em> generated a similarly mixed response in 1840, directly put by Thackeray: “Is the painting
                  sublime or ridiculous. I don’t know which.” Andrew Wilton has noted that the fine
                  line separating the sublime from the ridiculous was acknowledged by Turner himself.
                  In one of his sketchbooks, the artist comments that Tom Paine “says that the sublime
                  and the ridiculous are often so nearly related that it is difficult to class them
                  separately. One step above the sublime becomes ridiculous and one step above the ridiculous
                  makes the sublime again” (cited in Wilton 356). In the case of Turner’s <em>Slavers</em>, this fragile line between the sublime and the ridiculous threatens to dissolve,
                  conveying the horrors of slavery via black bodies that are fragmented and degraded
                  to the level of the bestial. The hands are so abstractly rendered that they appear
                  more like glyphs than illusionistic representations, offering the minimal amount of
                  visual information necessary to identify them <em>as</em> hands (Bryson 48-52). Some of them are formally indistinguishable from the wings of
                  birds and the tailfins of the fish hovering around them. It is hard, therefore, to
                  imagine these bits, then, attached to wrists, arms, and bodies. Likewise the leg is
                  so oddly formed and disposed that it is nearly impossible to imagine the body to which
                  it belongs. (McCoubrey 338).

                           above the picture frame, but he admits that he cannot make sense of the leg’s relationship
                           to the rest of this body (338). No contemporary critic claimed to see bodies and breasts
                           in the water or indeed attempted to assign a gender to any of the depicted human fragments.

                  </div> These ill-formed and disconnected extremities have a cartoonish air about them, bringing
                  the ridiculous into direct and dissonant confrontation with the sublimely-marked sea
                  and sky. In this way the painting serves as a visual demonstration of the unstable
                  line between the sublime and ridiculous that Turner referenced in his sketchbook.</p>

               <p>If, for a viewer like Ruskin, the horror of the event is brilliantly connoted by the
                  slashing brushwork and clashing colors of sky and sea, the hands and leg would seem
                  to impede viewers from imagining the dead and dying victims lying beneath the waves.
                  These parts seem more like incongruous bits of flotsam, rather than tragic fragments
                  that index a human wholeness. And, as British writers on humor repeatedly insisted,
                  incongruity forms the basis for laughter (Kriz, <em>Slavery</em> 74). James Beattie, for example, wrote in 1764 that “laughter arises from the view
                  of two or more inconsistent, unsuitable, or incongruous parts or circumstances, considered
                  as united in one complex object or assemblage” (602).

                  </div> Whatever Turner’s motives, then, his painting’s reliance on the device of fragmentation
                  offered his contemporary critics the occasion to treat it like a sublime caricature
                  that did not so much subvert as reinforce the fragmentary image of “the negro” in
                  scientific discourse, civil and natural histories, pro-abolitionist tracts, and caricatures.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Appearing in the same exhibition as Turner’s painting was another on the subject of
               the slave trade that seemed to offer wholeness in place of fragmentation, and to solicit
               a sigh of empathy rather than the awful laughter and bafflement generated by the <em>Slavers</em>. François-Auguste Biard’s <em>Bartering for Slaves on the Guinea Coast</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="bartering">figure 10</a>) offers viewers the titillating spectacle of newly captured slaves being whipped
               (upper left), branded (center left), inspected (center), and led away in coffles (left
               and right middle ground) as two slave traders, an exotically dressed black and a languorous
               white, sit and watch (foreground right). This aesthetically conservative display of
               academic exoticism has been vehemently disparaged by modern scholars. Albert Boime
               and Marcus Wood have (rightly, I think) attacked Biard for his flagrant sentimentalism
               and for the sadistic thrills he affords viewers, who are invited to disapprove of
               and, at the same time, take perverse pleasure in violence, humiliation, and torture
               so illusionistically presented (Boime 138, Wood, <em>Blind Memory</em>, 44). The work appears to have been a popular favorite at the Exhibition, however;
               it was taken off the walls of the Academy and presented to Thomas Fowell Buxton, the
               organizer of the Society for the Extinction of the Slave Trade and for the Civilization
               of Africa, which was meeting in London in the first week of June 1840 (Boime 37).
               Decorated with whips and chains, the picture was hung in Exeter Hall for the World
               Anti-Slavery Convention, which followed directly on the Society’s meeting.</p>

               <p>Thackeray raved about <em>Bartering for Slaves</em>, perhaps, as John McCoubrey has suggested, to demonstrate his support for abolition
                  in the face of his savage treatment of the <em>Slavers</em> (345-6): <span class="quote">‘Yonder is a poor woman kneeling before a Frenchman, her shoulder is fizzing under
                     the hot iron with which he brands her, she is looking up shuddering and wild yet quite
                     mild and patient: it breaks your heart to look at her. I never saw anything so exquisitely
                     pathetic as that face. ([Thackeray] 731) ’</span> John Eagles followed suit: his review of Biard’s picture, was, if anything more enthusiastic
                  than Thackerary’s. Declaring <em>Bartering for Slaves</em> to be “perhaps in reality the most powerful picture in the exhibition,” he concluded
                  that “[w]e have seen representations of horror, of plague, pestilence, and famine—but
                  we never saw a piece of more real deep pathos” (384). For decades abolitionists deployed
                  this kind of sentimental rhetoric in texts and images of suffering slaves in an effort
                  to stir the feelings of white Britons. But, as Saidiya Hartman and Marcus Wood each
                  have shown, these kind of empathic representations involve an act of displacement.
                  In attempting to feel for the slave, the reader/viewer imaginatively (and here, sadistically)
                  takes possession of the slave’s body (Wood, <em>Slavery, Empathy</em>, 16-7; Hartman 18-19). As a result, the spectator ends up feeling “for himself rather
                  than for those whom this exercise in imagination presumably is designed to reach;”
                  in the process the sentimental object is obliterated (Hartman 19).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note21" id="Note21_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Hartman is referring here to a specific instance of this kind of sentimental projection—a
                           letter written by John Rankin that was published in 1837—but her analysis can be applied
                           to images and other texts. </span></div>
                  </div> In Thackeray’s case the spectacle of the suffering slave woman prompts a performance
                  of suffering by both the critic and the viewer (“it breaks your heart to look at her”).
                  This process of displacement and display is flexible and can accommodate a variety
                  of sentimental objects. But, as Hartman notes, the problem of sentimental obliteration
                  is particularly acute in the case of African slaves, since one of the ways the system
                  of plantation slavery rendered black people as “thingly bodies” was to disavow their
                  capacity to feel the physical pain of hard labor and to experience the trauma of separation
                  from homeland and family (18-23).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For all their important aesthetic and ideological differences, then, there is a way
                  that Turner’s <em>Slavers</em> and Biard’s <em>Bartering for Slaves</em> reinforce each other by soliciting similar responses to the suffering black body:
                  they keep the feeling, sentient black body at a distance, threatening it with obliteration
                  or dehumanization. Turner represents slave victims as glyphs that comically mimic
                  fish and birds, and displaces “feeling” from bodies onto the sublime natural elements
                  of sky and sea. Ian Baucom has suggested that this distancing effect in the <em>Slavers</em> is enhanced by the artist’s use of smeared Romantic brushstrokes throughout the composition
                  (275). These blurry strokes serve to abstract what they seem to represent: they show
                  us what we cannot see. In contrast, Biard offers a high degree of figural illusionism
                  in the form of whole black bodies that are reduced to the level of suffering beasts
                  in their “wildness” and passivity, a point that both Thackeray and Eagles emphasize
                  in their reviews.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note22" id="Note22_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Eagles, for example, reverts to the language of the savage and the bestial when he
                           describes some of the agitated slaves “tossing their arms about in despair—not as
                           any other of the human race would throw their limbs; but with the peculiar action
                           of savage life” (384).</span></div>
                  </div> This double move, promoting sympathy for African slaves and political redress for
                  their plight while maintaining their inferior, savage status, is what allowed slavery
                  to be abolished, but racism directed against black people in Africa and the Atlantic
                  Diaspora to persist and even increase in the nineteenth century.</p>
            </div>
            <p>I want to be clear that I am not saying that Turner’s <em>Slavers</em> is as banal and aesthetically impoverished as Biard’s picture. Rather, I am claiming
               that at the historical moment in which it was exhibited, the affective viewing relationships
               the <em>Slavers</em> constitutes between the African body and the white viewer are compatible with that
               produced by a sentimental mode of representation and also by caricature. One can laugh
               at, be horrified by, and take empathetic possession of this kind of body—but not imagine
               an equal power relationship with it. That breakdown of imagination is in part due
               to the way aesthetics came to occupy the heart of scientific racism. It is all to
               easy to assume that politically liberal or radical artists who produced aesthetically
               progressive or modern or difficult works of art in the nineteenth century rendered
               these works immune to ideological appropriation by conservative interests. But even
               when—or, <em>especially</em> when—an aesthetically innovative work of art is greeted by confusion, contempt, and
               laughter among a group of conservative critics and an uncomprehending art public,
               it can still be actively involved in the production of a regressive “commonsense”
               notion of racial difference. I am suggesting that one way (among many) to move beyond
               a Romantic art history is to pay serious attention to the dismissive laughter of seemingly
               uncomprehending viewers. In the case of the <em>Slavers</em>, that laughter suggests some degree of complicity with, not simply contempt for,
               an artist who employed tropes and devices that confirm widely-held myths about the
               partiality and animality of the black body.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">This point has been made by McCoubrey (349-50) and Marsh (51); they note that some
               Americans, who encountered Turner’s painting only through Ruskin’s description, were
               keenly disappointed when they viewed it after it came to Boston. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Sam Smiles discovered evidence that in 1805 Turner was an investor in scheme to finance
               a cattle pen (ranch) in Jamaica. Wood (<em>Blind Memory</em> 41-68) and McCoubrey offer the most thorough analysis of Turner’s visual and literary
               sources.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">In <em>Reinventing Allegory</em>, Theresa Kelley argues that Turner moved the <em>Slavers</em> away from the illusionism of the real and into the realm of the allegorical through
               the use of forms and figures that tend toward the excessive—such as the oddly floating
               chains, which dramatically index the submerged bodies connected to them (177-78).
               Kelley astutely shows how the allegorical and the satiric mode share a visual vocabulary
               that depends on the grotesque and the theatrical—an insight that is suggestive for
               new lines of study.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">There is a rapidly expanding body of literature devoted to the study of the rise of
               natural history, racial “science” and aesthetics in the eighteenth century. Bindman
               provides a succinct and lucid account of the major philosophers, natural scientists
               and aestheticians who contributed to the formation of a “scientific” discourse of
               racialized difference in <em>Ape to Apollo</em>. Wheeler’s <em>Complexion of Race</em> is essential reading for the eighteenth century pre-history and development of this
               discourse. Londa Schiebinger’s <em>Nature’s Body</em> provides an important analysis of the role of gender in the formation of this scientific
               discourse. My <em>Slavery, Sugar and the Culture of Refinement</em> (chapter three) takes up many of the issues around race science, aesthetics and caricature
               discussed here.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               racial difference in this discourse, although the female body certainly did figure
               in many accounts, and was seen as crucial to shaping the racial character. The white
               female counterpart to the <em>Apollo</em> in this discourse was usually the <em>Medici Venus</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               were severed and disavowed over the course of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
               This publication stimulated wide-ranging and heated debates about the “whitening”
               of Greek history and culture, and its consequences for our current understanding of
               the history racism (including anti-Semitism).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               and human physiognomies. His work was influential in the development of natural history
               and caricature. Zoomorphism persisted throughout the nineteenth century and beyond

               to the rest of this body (338). No contemporary critic claimed to see bodies and breasts
               in the water or indeed attempted to assign a gender to any of the depicted human fragments.
