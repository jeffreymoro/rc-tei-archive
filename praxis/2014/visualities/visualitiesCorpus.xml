               <p>The five essays gathered in this Praxis volume, together with exhibits in the new
               Romantic Circles Gallery, including two developed by Lucy Kimiko Hawkinson Traverse
               and Matthew Rarey, whose essays also appear in this volume, recognize what we have
               come to understand as the wide cultural reach of Romantic visualities, as manifold
               and often divergent impulses that join the cultural moment of Romanticism to our own.
               This <title level="s">Praxis</title> volume and the new Gallery exhibits together
               convey how we have begun to understand Romanticism’s visual cultures, and gesture
               toward work that awaits future contributors who seek to understand how visuality
               conducts its operations across Romantic culture. </p>

                  <head>I. Romanticism’s Emergent Counter-Visualities</head>
                  <p>Visuality, we might say, is not merely a feature of the contemporary, nor does it
                  reduce to the visible or the social facts of the visible. As Nicholas Mirzoeff
                  elaborates in <title level="m">The Right to Look: A Counterhistory of
                     Visuality</title> (2011), the descriptive force of the very term emerges
                  importantly not just with contemporary critical theory (xiii-xvi; 1-34). Its
                  history stretches back before its key turning point use, in Hal Foster’s edited
                  collection <title level="m">Vision and Visuality</title> (1988), to insist on the
                  constitutive interlining of vision by the changing “social fact” of visuality—that
                  is, to understand vision as riven by differences.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hal Foster, “Preface,” <title level="m">Vision and Visuality</title>
                     (Seattle: Bay Press, 1988), ix-xiv. For analysis of the ways in which Foster’s
                     formulation of visuality has been used in the development of the
                     transdisciplinary field of visual culture but also historically, see Nicholas
                     Mirzoeff, “On Visuality,” <title level="j">Journal of Visual Culture</title>
                     5.1 (April 2006): 53–80. </note> This apparently modish critical neologism that
                  initiated a reckoning with vision as historically and culturally embedded has its
                  own histories and counter-histories.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See <title level="m">The Right to Look</title>, xiii-xvi and “On Visuality,” 53-80.
                  </note> It enters official English in the writings of historian Thomas Carlyle
                  (1795-1881) to characterize a tradition of heroic leadership and its claimed
                  capacities for visualization from the literal battlefield to the terrain of
                  history writing, from the political to the aesthetic.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Mirzoeff relates Carlyle’s construction of the “living light”
                     of the near mystical figure of the statesman-poet drawn in <title>On
                        Heroes</title> (and the aesthetic translation of authority as “light”) to

                     ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality” comes to us from critique
                     within modernity and its grappling with the legacies of early modern
                     metaphysics, that is, from James Joyce’s <title level="m">Ulysses</title>. See
                     Mirzoeff, xiii. </note> In his homage to the “Hero,” Carlyle’s prime example of
                  the political capacity of “clear visuality” to render an authoritarian, great-man
                  version of history with gripping and yet naturalizing intensity is Dante’s <title level="m">Divine Comedy</title> in which: “every compartment of it is worked
                  out, with intense earnestness, into truth, into clear visuality” (Carlyle 79). </p>
                  <p>To mark this late Romantic site as the first modern use of the term “visuality” is
                  not merely to argue that visuality as a modality of power (from the oversight of
                  the slave plantation complex through imperialism and its division of the sensible
                  to the sense of visuality as war) has a history. It is also to find a pivot point
                  around which to re-narrate the emergence of counter-visualities, important
                  historical instances of the contestatory claim to the “right to look” (beginning,
                  one may argue, with slave revolts in the Caribbean that led to the Haitian
                  revolution and extending, one might imply, to there being something “queer”—a term
                  for the off-center with its own nineteenth-century etymologies—about the
                  appropriation of rights and rites of inspection by those who are held to be its
                  discriminated objects).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The phrase “the right to
                     look” comes from Jacques Derrida’s coinage of the phrase “droit de regards” to
                     account for the exchange of the mutually genitive and yet gaming exchange of
                     glancing looks between women lovers in Marie-Françoise Plissart’s book-length
                     photo-essay to which Derrida wrote a “following” lecture. Given the oscillation
                     of “<foreign>droit</foreign>” between law and right and the question of the
                     plural “<emph>regards</emph>” which would most readily translate as “looks” but
                     is also an important play on “<foreign>au regard de la loi</foreign>” (or “in
                     the eyes of the law”), there remains appropriately a remainder, an irreducible
                     problem of translation. “<foreign>Droit de regards</foreign>” is translated in
                     the English version of the text by David Wills as “right of inspection.”
                     Deploying “the right to look” as a claim for autonomy, political subjectivity
                     and collectivity without the demand for sameness, Mirzoeff insists, instead, on
                     the “right to look” as a way to keep open the gap between law and right which
                     might seem closed by the term “inspection.” See Plissart; translated as
                     Derrida’s <title level="m">Right of Inspection</title>. </note> This volume
                  participates in the excavation of the Romantic genealogies of visuality and its
                  contestations in practice while also attending to other imminent possibilities
                  within a reconfigured field of Romanticism, one opened and stretched
                  geographically, temporally, and beyond the bounds of the disciplinary division of
                  objects. That is, besides the important claiming of the right to look, this volume
                  also considers counterpoints that texture and complicate the story of visuality’s
                  emergence. Such a reconfiguration brings newly into view not merely a different
                  array of “objects” of and for Romanticism but also reposes the question of their
                  ethical, political, and aesthetic stakes in the past as well as for our present. </p>
                  <p>Two decades ago it was still possible to suppose that Romanticism referred wholly
                  to visionary experience and poetics, and that its locus was squarely in the
                  European metropole. The point of William Galperin’s <title level="m">The Return of
                     the Visible in British Romanticism </title>(1988) was not to suggest that the
                  visible had ever left town (and here he means London), but that its presence in
                  Romantic culture had hardly been noticed. As Galperin did note, however, it was
                  precisely because the aesthetic representation of the visible took so many forms
                  and commanded so much public attention that Coleridge felt he had to warn against
                  the “despotism of the eye” and Wordsworth had to insist that he had never been
                  “infected” by the rage for the picturesque.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  gestures we now recognize as defensive maneuvers against a complex global Romantic
                  culture that was at once very visual, spectacularly so, and very public. That is,
                  we can understand these gestures as part of the internal roilings within dominant
                  modalities of Romantic visuality and its critique of what has more recently been
                  called “ocularcentrism.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, in particular,

                  <p>The essays in this volume approach the question of visuality’s Romantic
                  genealogies by addressing an arresting affiliation between interiority and
                  invisibility and the highly visual, spectacular Romanticism that we now recognize
                  as a persistent element in Romantic culture. The thread that binds and weaves
                  between these Romanticisms is a shadowed recognition of an “other” that visuality
                  seeks to control, but which may also be implicit or occulted. What makes Romantic
                  visuality compelling is, we contend, not a sudden departure from a line of
                  objectivist thinking about vision, but the continuing modern exploration of the
                  suppositionality of vision, combined with deepening recognition of the difficulty
                  of conveying the remarkable and remarkably resistant character of the physical
                  world and the precarious desire of the European observer who seeks to manage that
                  world as though separated from it. In Romantic visuality what is spectral or
                  invisible, half seen at the edges of vision and understanding, presses on both the
                  technologies of the visible and the global encounters with others that “shadow so
                  much of Romantic culture” (Casid 1-34). </p>
                  <p>The spectral otherness of Romantic visuality is difficult to put aside precisely
                  because it operates so close to the bone of scientific visuality and a
                  metropolitan European culture keen for news and images from the global wars that
                  the English and their European counterparts waged.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Mary A. Favret, <title level="m">War at a Distance: Romanticism

                     </note> Romantic visuality’s odd and estranged relation to what is hidden or
                  desired lurks at the edges of the visual frame. The complex refracted relation
                  between the visible and its others sets the stage, at once philosophical and
                  cultural, for a surprising but compelling affiliation between this visibility and
                  the Romantic critique of ocularcentrism. If the geneaology of the critique of
                  embodiment and vision begins millenia earlier in the debate about seeing and the
                  imagination that Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine begin and Locke extends, its
                  Romantic instantiation includes Hegel’s critique of sense certainty, especially
                  vision—a critique complexly entwined with his use of visual metaphor to
                  characterize the liabilities of phenomenal vision understood as the ground of
                  knowledge. Hegel’s critique specifically registers the problem of the “other” for
                  the metropolitan European Enlightenment subject.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     See, in particular, Stephen Houlgate.</note> For Hegel, visionary
                  possibilities, even if we reject them, train the mind to look beyond empirical
                  sight in much the way that, we suggest, Romantic experiments with the “otherness”
                  of visibility invited seeing otherwise. The wider Romantic address to the “other”
                  involves Hegel’s dance with spectral “phenomena,” and much more: new techniques
                  for manipulating the real and the appearance of the real; and many reasons for
                  hiding or obscuring what might be seen—among them that indicated by the dark side

                  <p>If scientists and their illustrators imagined objectivity as an empirical and
                  verifiable standard of representation, achieving objectivity was also a difficult
                  project in practice.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Lorraine Daston and Peter
                     Galison, <title level="m">Objectivity</title> (New York: Zone Books, 2007).
                  </note> Among those for whom emerging standards of scientific and ocular
                  objectivity were important, botanical illustrators toggled between their putative
                  object of study, the specimen, and the work of other illustrators. This odd
                  arrangement was in part motivated by the taxonomic inquiry that such images were
                  supposed to illustrate: the plant depicted had to convey the taxonomic traits or
                  “character” of its species (Nickelson 188-215). Artists copied other artists to
                  get as close as possible to a full and accurate species image, but perhaps also to
                  save time as they competed in a hotly competitive market for botanical
                  illustration. Fidelity to the established system for identifying and naming the
                  species in question set its own formal terms: artists who drew or engraved plants
                  for Linnaean botanists were expected to depict its floral parts in detail,
                  typically in separate, schematic drawings on the same sheet or plate. </p>
                  <p>The force of formal constraint as its own technique for attaining the appearance
                  of “scientific” objectivity may be traced in the collaboration on the publication
                  of <title level="m">English Botany</title> (1790-1813) between Sir J. E. Smith,
                  first president of the Linnean Society of London, and James Sowerby, one of the
                  principal artists and engravers of works on natural history. The two corresponded
                  regularly about drawings and descriptions for the thirty-six volumes of <title level="m">English Botany</title>, which appeared serially over a twenty-five
                  year period. To indicate a set of distinctions between two closely related species
                  that an initial drawing failed to offer, Smith explained to Sowerby what the
                  leaves of the species under consideration looked like under magnification so that
                  the drawing might be altered to reflect this information; he also directed
                  Sowerby’s application of color, noting in some cases that holding up a plant to
                  the light or even adding water to the specimen to make it look bigger will show
                  its “true color.” If magnification by microscope or adding water does not quite
                  approach the scalar excess of the huge flowers depicted in Robert Thornton’s
                     <title level="m">The Temple of Flora</title> (1799-1807), neither is it a
                  straightforward brief for copying the plant specimen at hand. Instead,
                  magnification and other alterations with light and water functioned as techniques
                  for making specimens yield up the effects of the “true” unavailable to naked
                  observation from the “life” and yet claimed to be merely inherent (Kelley
                     72-73).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The practice of augmenting specimens
                     prior to sketching them was widely asserted even by those who claimed that such
                     illustration should faithfully record the specimen at hand. What obviously
                     troubled this protocol, and thus prompted the contradiction, was the fact that
                     while specimens might well convey parts more clearly (and were chosen because
                     they did so), they quickly became a “hortus siccus,” to use Mrs. Delany’s acute
                     phrase, with little resemblance to the vital plant. The instance we refer to
                     here occurs in J. E. Smith to James Sowerby, Sowerby Correspondence, Boxes 19
                     and 20, A56 through A59, written between 1799 and 1810, BMNH, London. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We might say that technologies of vision for the production of “objectivity” were
                  internally given the slip by the very devices of scalar alteration on which they
                  depended. Technologies devised to assist the creation of accurate, putatively
                  objective records become inevitably entwined with the reversibility of their
                  operations of attentive particular focus (a kind of miniaturization) and
                  magnification. The use of microscopes to magnify plant cells, as Franz Bauer did
                  at Kew from 1800 on, suggest one side of the scalar extremes that bind diverse
                  forms of Romantic visibility, from miniature images and writing, to scalar
                  exaggerations and tricks used in the eidofusikon and the
                  panoramas.
                  Such devices slide easily between what might be called a recognizably human scale
                  and its various others: forms so small or so obscure they cannot be seen (or
                  imagined) without visual amplification (or suggestion). Wordsworth’s presentation
                  of London shop signs in the <title level="m">Prelude, </title>Book 7, insist both
                  that the slippage at issue is between the human and something extra-human and that
                  this slippage is pitched toward the consuming subject: <quote>

                  <p>Sophie Thomas’s essay in this volume, “Representing Paris: History and Actuality
                  at the London Panoramas,” considers the Romantic panorama, perhaps the most
                  extravagant of Romanticism’s visual spectacles, by emphasizing its claims to
                  represent reality in an all encompassing visual form—albeit one we now experience
                  via textual remainders such as maps and descriptions—that appears to have found
                  its <foreign>métier</foreign> in the presentation of wartime episodes. Not
                  incidentally, as Thomas makes clear, the goal of representing history—particularly
                  recent history—as fact was crosscut by two counter-impulses: the need to adapt
                  facts to national and propagandistic protocols, and the use of illusion and
                  disorienting complexity to insist on the thick actuality of the spectacle. Whether
                  it was London and the English as seen in Parisian panoramas, or Paris and the
                  French as seen in London panoramas, war and specific battle scenes were popular,
                  and for that reason, repeatedly made into panoramas that staged what Mary Favret
                  has called “war at a distance,” to characterize how most Romantic audiences
                  experienced the ongoingness of war in their time and as such gesture toward our
                  modern experience of war as news and propaganda. Premier among those staged
                  spectacles in its use of effects to promote the illusion of its factuality, the
                  panorama works in part by confusing its viewers with details, prompting both
                  euphoria and a disorienting view of its staged reality. The double project of the
                  panorama is arresting: designed to give viewers a sense of observational control
                  and sovereignty over a huge city that, were the viewer down below, would be a
                  place in which to get lost, or a battle scene in which being there might well mean
                  ending up being dead, the complexity of visual, even geometric, tactics used to
                  persuade the viewer of the panorama as a multifaceted reality might also be
                  profoundly disorienting. Writ large and small (this perspectival extreme being the
                  stock and trade of a panoramic prospect), the panorama might take away whatever
                  powers it promised to give.</p>
                  <p>The reversibility of the techniques of objectivity and the degree to which
                  metropolitan European Romantic and imperial visuality was internally challenged by
                  its own techniques of panoramic all-seeing, assemblage, and atomizing
                  classification help to specify location and origin of Romantic visuality as less
                  exclusively a European phenomenon than one shadowed by its putative “others” and,
                  as such, an unstable site where unruly and global force challenge British and
                  European metropoles. </p>

                  contacts. Gesturing briefly to Venezuelan writer Teresa de la Parra’s
                  autobiographical novel <title level="m">Memories of White Mother </title>(1929),
                  Pratt gives us a glimpse via Parra of an alternative historical itinerary for
                  Romanticism and its celebrated lyric “I,” an eye that tracks what Hegel insisted
                  the ego-subject always misses about its interpellation with the world and its
                  putative “others”: <quote>I believe that like tobacco, pineapple, and sugar cane,
                     Romanticism was an indigenous [American] fruit that grew up sweet, spontaneous
                     and hidden among colonial langours and tropical indolence until the end of the
                     eighteenth century. Around that time, Josefina Tascher, unsuspectingly, as if
                     she were an ideal microbe, carried it off tangled up in the lace of one of her
                     headdresses, gave the germ to Napoleon in that acute form which we all know,
                     and little by little, the troops of the first Empire, assisted by
                     Chateaubriand, spread the epidemic everywhere (138).</quote> Situated in a
                  garden beside tobacco and pineapple and, most notably, with the sugar cane—that
                  exotic transplant of colonial landscaping or the plantation machine—Romanticism
                  becomes, like the introduced and capitalized sugar cane plant, an “indigenous
                  fruit” of the Americas. <title level="m">Memories of White Mother</title> figures
                  Romanticism in the formal and yet also material terms of one of its
                  preoccupations: fusions with the environment and its extension in the
                  anthropomorphization of plants. An acclimitizable and yet transculturating fruit,
                  Romanticism becomes, like the changes wrought by the sugar-cane plantation, an
                  outbreak that, in its attempted conversion of slave labor and colonial commerce
                  into the comestible sweets of sugar, fruit, the aesthetic, or transformative
                  empathy, also sends infectious counter-influence across the Atlantic from the
                  Americas to Europe. This characterization of Romanticism as an unsuspected and
                  seductively transforming germination without an original seeing/knowing agent is
                  further mobilized by Pratt to suggest that <quote>If one unhooks [Alexander von]
                     Humboldt from Schiller and locates him in another “romantic” line—George
                     Forster and Bernardin de Saint Pierre (two of Humboldt’s personal idols),
                     Volney, Chateaubriand, Stedman, Buffon, Le Vaillant, Captain Hook, and the
                     Diderot of the “Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville”—one might be tempted
                     to argue that romanticism originated in the contact zones of America, North
                     America, and the South Seas. (138)</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>This change of direction is not without consequence. The cultivation of the eye as
                  a means of developing sensibility becomes embedded with material forms of
                  “cultivation.” But, further, the cultivation of an empathic visual imagination
                  becomes part and parcel with the actual and imaginative appropriation of
                  “domestic” and “foreign” lands: practices so often translated as arts not of
                  conquest but of “cultivation.” The essays in this collection variously resituate
                  European and especially British works of the late eighteenth to mid-nineteenth
                  century as troubled and troubling contact zones of encounters in various registers
                  that put aside the inflated heroic sublime to consider the curious, the wandering,
                  the grotesque, the ridiculous, and the bitingly satirical—all of which are shaped
                  by and give form to the mixed and heterogeneous intra- and extra-national,
                  imperial, and continental arenas we now call “Britain,” “British Empire,” the
                  “Americas,” and “Europe.” In doing so, these essays contribute to an scholarly
                  inquiry that seeks to reread the graphic, literary, scientific, and philosophical
                  developments of European omanticism along the trade routes, exploratory paths,
                  detours, and wanderlust of global trade and colonization. </p>
                  <p>Marcus Wood’s “Brazilian Romantic Satire on the Peripheries of Photo-Realism: the
                  Case of Angelo Agostini” takes up the abolitionist satires of Angelo Agostini (the
                  Italian artist who was working in Rio from the early 1860s until the end of the
                  1880s). Although Wood shows that Brazilian abolitionist satires were in important
                  dialogue with English and American Romantic literatures and images, the Brazilian
                  side of this dialogue was particularly and brazenly insistent on deploying the
                  same figures (the crocodile, for example) to insist on readings antithetical to
                  those offered in American and European accounts. Agostini worked with stone
                  lithography mainly for mainstream illustrated periodicals, producing social and
                  political satiric art across a wide range of issues (concentrating more heavily on
                  slavery in the 1870s and 80s) in the metropolitan center of Rio de Janeiro, a of
                  industrialized capital in which slave labor existed hand in hand with the
                  development of new technologies including gas light and steam power. The essay’s
                  detailed examination of some of Agostini’s especially ambitious prints opens up a
                  space in which to initiate understanding of the specific qualities which define
                  Brazilian Romantic graphic art. As Wood demonstrates through close reading, these
                  distinctive qualities are tied inextricably to the graphic exploration of the
                  visuality of a slave system that even when it transitions to abolition conveys
                  what happens when a repressed power that is only manifest as literal physical
                  bondage is redeployed as the terror of enforced restraint. The crocodile that
                  marks the Brazilian specificity of these satires is also the thought-image for the
                  violent extremities of a post-Emancipation world. But this is not an argument for
                  Brazil’s modern nature to Europe’s culture of modernity. Rather, turning to
                  Agostini’s political lithographs produced for <title level="m">O
                     Mequetrefe</title>, Wood argues for the appropriation or translation of an
                  unsettling “realism,” a kind of effect of “objective visual energy” that could be
                  harnessed for disruptive satiric ends. Photography meets lithography in
                  Post-Emancipation Brazil and the graphic effects unleash possibilities for a
                  counter-visuality of Romanticism that is bitingly real. </p>
                  <p>Matthew Rarey’s essay “Romantic Visualities, Technologies, and Travelers in
                  Mexico, 1804–1844” extends Romanticism’s genealogies to explore the potentials of
                  a Romantic Atlantic. Rarey’s particular assemblage of case studies of work by
                  explorers and travelers whose images of Mexico circulated on both sides of the
                  Atlantic presents the views articulated in antiquarian Mexican travel narratives
                  in the first half of the nineteenth century as navigations of a fine line between
                  the demands of an objective scientific rationality and those of picturesque
                  scene-making that demonstrate the shaping role of nascent visual technologies –
                  the camera lucida, the panorama, and the daguerreotype. This geographic and
                  cultural reframing to consider representations of Mexico thus cuts across
                  segregated media histories, allowing us to see a network which includes the views
                  produced by Pedro José Márquez, a Mexican Jesuit priest working in Rome in 1804,
                  their publication by the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt in Paris in
                  1816, and the views of Mexico in the camera lucida as they emerged in the hands of
                  Scottish artist and architect Frederick Catherwood in the Mediterranean and Mexico
                  (with the support of English entrepreneur Robert Burford). As Rarey demonstrates,
                  this network of image-making connects Burford’s panoramas (discussed by Sophie
                  Thomas as major attractions in London), which relied on Catherwood’s camera
                  lucida-aided drawings as prototypes for panoramic images, to the resistant
                  difficulties of using the camera lucida and the new daguerreotype technology in
                  explorations of the Yucatán. While the technologies of the camera lucida and the
                  daguerreotype promised to render an objective visual account of Mexican
                  antiquities and landscape, they emerge as stubborn, defiant apparati and powerful
                  agents in complex and often surprising circuits of intellectual, artistic, and
                  technological exchanges, forming and transforming the Romantic Atlantic and the
                  Mediterranean. </p>

                  <head>IV. Proto-Photography, Panopticism, Slavery: Visuality’s Romantic Beginnings
                  and its Ghosts</head>
                  <p>If the ground of the plantation is entangled with the picturesque garden, the
                  locodescriptive poem and the optical devices for picturesque tourism that focused
                  and enframed the vistas of the so-called , and Romanticism is a germination of
                  transplanted seeds, visuality as visibility’s imbrication with formations of
                  social power may also be said to emerge with the modernity of colonial
                  technologies of subject formation: the panopticon, gas light, stereotypy (and
                  printing of many kinds), and the beginnings of photography. Visuality is never
                  simply the body (whether plant, animal, human, or its crossings) visualized.
                  Despite the dream of truth’s emergence as total optical clarity, what may be
                  propped along the sight lines of the panopticon, illuminated by gaslight, enframed
                  by the modern Romantic resuscitations of easel painting, and registered by the aid
                  of the camera (and the camera lucida) always has its haunting remainders. </p>
                  <p>In “Turner’s <title level="m">Slavers</title>, Race, and the Ridiculous Human
                  Fragment,” Dian Kriz exposes a telling rift between the aesthetic and the visual
                  politics of race in her trenchant reading of J. M. W. Turner’s 1840 painting,
                     <title level="m">The Slave Ship</title>
                     <title level="m">Slavers Throwing overboard the Dead and Dying—Typhon coming
                     on</title>. As other recent analyses do not, Kriz questions the effort to
                  assign the visual rhetoric of this painting to the Romantic sublime, arguing
                  instead that, as its early commentators repeatedly noted, Turner’s canvas belongs
                  to another register in which exaggeration operates—the grotesque and ridiculous.
                  What early reviews identified—the wildly flailing arms and hands of the drowning
                  slaves and the huge mouths of fishes ready to consume them—signals a Romantic
                  theorizing of race and blackness as ridiculous, excessive, a domain in which
                  disembodied hands and feet constitute the fragmented non-being of the slave body.
                  Kriz argues here for understanding the racism in Romantic aesthetics by reading
                  the visual representations of race frontally, rather than allowing the
                  sentimentality on offer in some Romantic depictions of slave bodies to encourage
                  turning away from the fragmented, abused body of Romantic-era slavery. What Turner
                  stages, Kriz argues, is a profoundly disturbing representation of race and slavery
                  from the vantage point of its European Romantic “others.”</p>
                  <p>In “Unsanctioned Wandering: Capturing the Vagrant in Romantic Prints,” Lucy Kimiko
                  Hawkinson Traverse traces the doubled figure of the vagrant, a figure of fugitive
                  movement that is at once the rogue body at the edges of the law, the paradigm of
                  Romantic movement and thought, and the ideal representative of the liberal
                  metropolitan subject. Attending closely to a representative array of British
                  Romantic prints bound in a range of books published in London in the first two
                  decades of the nineteenth century (between 1800-1820), Traverse sketches the
                  strategies of containment, appropriation, and erasure used to capture the vagrant
                  body in print, teasing out the tensions and slippages between the text as material
                  object and the roaming body it seeks to arrest. As Traverse demonstrates through
                  this paradoxical and precarious figure, while wandering may be integral to
                  Romantic thought and action, so too is the desire to capture, record, and
                  classify. The Romantic obsession with the vagrant produces prints of wandering
                  types that not only hover between mobility and stasis, but also present the very
                  figures of highly prized movement immobilized. Indeed, the figure of unsanctioned
                  wandering is also a paradigm of the collection organized around a verb which its
                  strategies cannot capture without converting into its opposite. Here the objective
                  vision that classifies relies on alterations in scale (miniaturization) and
                  minimization that result in a decontextualization, a poaching of the ground on
                  which to move. But, as Traverse also shows, these strategies are precarious at
                  best in that the bodies they attempt to still also subtly critique the texts they
                  occupy—at times leaking out and exceeding their print confines. There are larger
                  issues at stake, not least being the question of the relation between a liberalism
                  that represents itself through movement and the techniques of the panoptic
                  encyclopedic project with its archiving and encyclopedic assemblage of types that
                  endeavor to contain—and yet also strive to mimic—the movements of their subjects. </p>
                  <p>Unsanctioned wandering—in and out of dominant panoptic visuality—may give us a
                  metaphor for the practice of tracing alternative genealogies of visuality and
                  doing so critically. Read together, the essays in this volume give us a different
                  account of modernity, its languages, and its technologies. In Mirzoeff’s
                  “Ghostwriting: Working out Visual Culture,” 1822 is the turning point. For in that
                  year, when the Arcades of Paris were illuminated by gaslight, they created a
                  vivid, critical figure or thought-image for the condition of being a subject in
                  colonial modernity, illuminated not merely by a camera flash but by being located
                  within an emerging disciplinary society of luminous consumption. “Here is a
                  critical mix indeed,” Mirzoeff writes, “the panoptic institution illuminated by
                  new visual technologies of gas and electricity, yet haunted by spirits and [. . .]
                  ghosts” (240). Even as gaslight once illuminated the shops of Rio as well as the
                  arcades of Paris, the wake of global slavery and capitalism continues to cast its
                  shadows. Such shadows, ghosts, and excesses are, in important part, the animating
                  “subjects” of the essays in this volume. But we would insist that attention to the
                  fossil impressions and fugitive traces in and of the images in existing archives,
                  together with what is not pictured or represented, are both objects of our inquiry
                  and, at least as critically, a necessary part of the method implied by attending
                  to and thinking “visuality” and its genealogies. </p>
                  <p>As the new Romantic Circles Gallery reminds us, visuality is more than a set of
                  images, an iconography, a topic, or a theme. At its most critical and prescient
                  moments, visuality allows us to revisit and rethink the history of the regimes
                  within which we live and the questions and problems posed by the legacy of efforts
                  to work out power, pleasure, and knowledge through the register of the
                  visible—both its failures and remainders. The essays in this volume, together with
                  the exhibits already part of the new Gallery and future exhibits, will assist our
                  effort to know how it is that Romantics saw and embodied what they saw or
                  imagined, and how we in turn understand the knowledge power performed or
                  undermined by Romantic visuality. </p>

                  </quote>
               </epigraph>
               <p>Writing in <title level="m">Fraser’s Magazine</title>, William Makepeace Thackeray
               broached the question of the sublime and the ridiculous in his review of J. M. W.
               Turner’s <title level="m"> Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying: Typhon
                  Coming On</title> (<ref target="#slavers">figure 1</ref>), which was on display in
               the annual exhibition of the Royal Academy in 1840 (731). Thackeray’s ambiguous
               answer is somewhat disingenuous, judging from the exuberantly sarcastic tenor of his
               review. In this famous passage, filled with mock horror, for example, he comically
               rejects the possibility that the painting offers any kind of convincing illusion of
               the tragic scene suggested by its title: <quote>Rocks of gamboges [strong yellow] are
                  marked down on the canvas, flakes of white laid on with a trowel; bladders of
                  vermilion madly spirited here and there. Yonder is the slaver rocking in the midst

                  emerald and purple, into which chocolate-coloured slaves are plunged, and chains
                  that will not sink; and round these are floundering such a race of fishes as never

                  than the reddest herrings; horrid spreading polypi, like huge slimy poached eggs,

               his contemporaries.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Negative

               the case for the ridiculous, and to suggest that by so doing Turner’s painting can be
               productively situated with the contemporary Anglo-European discourse on racial
               difference. In 1990 Paul Gilroy argued that Turner’s <title level="m">Slavers</title>
               “offers one opportunity to appreciate that English art and aesthetics are not simply
               in place alongside English thinking about race;” rather, they are “an integral means
               with which England was able to make sense of itself and its destiny” (51). In the two
               decades since this statement, many thoughtful accounts of the <title level="m">Slavers</title> have been published, but they have largely ignored issues of race
               in their eagerness to analyze the painting within the context of the Atlantic slave
                  trade.<note place="foot" resp="editors">There is a large body
                  of scholarship on this picture. Some of the major publications from the last
                  twenty years include Boime, McCoubrey, Wood's <title level="m">Blind
                     Memory</title>, Baucom, Castello, and Marsh. </note> Questions of race are
               deeply intertwined with the institution of slavery in the early modern period. And
               yet, when considering cultural representations of Atlantic slavery, it is unwise to
               conflate slavery with race, especially in dealing with visual representation, since
               aesthetics and visuality have been central to the construction of racial difference
               from the late eighteenth century forward. Before turning to the “ridiculous,” and
               racialization, I want to briefly consider how modern scholarship came to assess
               Turner’s <title level="m">Slavers</title> as a sublimely Romantic masterpiece. </p>
               <p>Foundational to this characterization of the <title level="m">Slavers</title> is John
               Ruskin’s impassioned account from <title level="m">Modern Painters</title>, published
               three years after its first exhibition (3: 571-3). Relegating to a footnote the
               subject—the jettisoning of enslaved Africans from a slave ship tossing in a
               storm-swept sea—Ruskin brings the painting to life. Unlike Thackeray, he makes no
               references to paint, brushwork, and composition in this passage, only to sublime
               natural effects such as the “glorious light [. . .] which burns like gold, and bathes
               like blood,” and “the mist of night [. . .] advancing like the shadow of death upon
               the guilty ship [. . .] its thin masts written upon the sky in lines of blood, girded
               with condemnation in that fearful hue which signs the sky with horror” (3: 572).
               Through Turner’s genius, nature and the slave ship (but not the fish and fragmented
               human bodies) become the embodiments of horror and beauty, capable of moving the
               viewer to aesthetic admiration and moral outrage. In producing a work of art capable
               of eliciting this sort of moral and aesthetic response, the Romantic genius becomes a
               sort of a superconductor who feels more deeply than ordinary individuals and can
               brilliantly and beautifully convey those feelings to the less sensitive via his art
               (Kriz, <title level="m">Idea</title> 87). Ruskin writes in <title level="m">Modern
                  Painters</title> about the special character of the landscape painter who
                  <quote>makes him [the spectator] a sharer in his own strong feelings and quick
                  thoughts; hurries him away in his own enthusiasm; guides him to all that is
                  beautiful; snatches him from all that is base; and leaves him more than
                  delighted,—ennobled and instructed, under the sense of having not only beheld a
                  new scene, but of having held communion with a new mind, and having been endowed
                  for a time with the keen perception and the impetuous emotions of a nobler and
                  more penetrating intelligence. (3: 134) </quote> This form of shared viewing
               through the mind of the artist would also seem to involve the spectator with yet
               another mediator: the Romantic critic. Certainly Ruskin’s fervent prose is every bit
               as much a performance of the deeply sensitive self as Turner’s painting.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This point has been made by
                  McCoubrey (349-50) and Marsh (51); they note that some Americans, who encountered
                  Turner’s painting only through Ruskin’s description, were keenly disappointed when
                  they viewed it after it came to Boston. </note>
               </p>
               <p>This cultural formation, which insistently values artistic sensibility, also produces
               “Romantic scholarship”—that is, scholarship driven by the belief that analyzing great
               art depends on discerning the artistic genius’s feelings and motives so viewers may
               channel “the keen perception and the impetuous emotions of a nobler and more
               penetrating intelligence.” Even though much of the recent scholarship on the <title level="m">Slavers</title> has been extremely “contextual,” engaging with the
               complex histories of Anglo-European colonization and the Atlantic slave system, by
               and large the scholarship has maintained a Romantic fixation on finding “meaning” in
               the painting by focusing on Turner. Scholars have considered in detail his
               intentions, his visual and textual sources, his attitude towards history in general
               and the slave trade in particular, and more recently his investments—I refer here to
               Sam Smiles’ recent discovery that in 1805 the artist had invested in a Jamaican
               venture dependent on slave labor (47).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Sam Smiles discovered evidence that in 1805 Turner was an investor in scheme
                  to finance a cattle pen (ranch) in Jamaica. Wood (<title level="m">Blind
                     Memory</title> 41-68) and McCoubrey offer the most thorough analysis of
                  Turner’s visual and literary sources. </note>
               </p>
               <p>If we turn our attention away from the artist and toward his contemporary critics, we
               are immediately confronted with the issue of the ridiculous. Turner’s use of intense,
               highly-keyed green and purple (lost over time), and the still-brilliant red, orange,
               white, and yellow in the sky and water attracted bemused criticism (McCoubry 336-7).
               But even more sport was made of the human fragments (hands and a leg), floating
               chains, and strange-looking fish located in the foreground ([Thackeray] 731, Eagles
               380, "Fine Arts," "Exhibition").<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">Reinventing Allegory</title>, Theresa Kelley argues that
                  Turner moved the <title level="m">Slavers</title> away from the illusionism of the
                  real and into the realm of the allegorical through the use of forms and figures
                  that tend toward the excessive—such as the oddly floating chains, which
                  dramatically index the submerged bodies connected to them (177-78). Kelley
                  astutely shows how the allegorical and the satiric mode share a visual vocabulary
                  that depends on the grotesque and the theatrical—an insight that is suggestive for
                  new lines of study. </note> Now, as a glance at nineteenth-century Royal Academy
               reviews confirms, it was not unusual for a painting—especially a painting by
               Turner—to provide critics with an occasion to display their talent for withering
               satire. During the fifty years that Turner had been exhibiting at the Royal Academy,
               his paintings provoked satiric comments about his paint handling, figures,
               composition, and color.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See
                  Butlin and Joll, vol. 1 for excerpts of Turner criticism. </note> But the critics
               in 1840 did not shrink from making jokes that, while aimed at Turner, also seemed to
               be at the expense of those fragmented bodies of African slaves who had been cruelly
               thrown overboard by the slavers and left to drown or be eaten by the fish. </p>
               <p>Recall that Thackeray described the “horrible sea of emerald and purple into which
               chocolate-coloured slaves are plunged, and chains that will not sink ” before turning
               to the sea life: the “gasping dolphins redder than the reddest herrings; horrid
               spreading polypi, like huge slimly poached eggs, in which hapless niggers plunge and
               disappear.” From this almost cannibalistic description of slaves that are chocolate
               colored—a reference that threatens to turn the slaves into one of the edible New
               World commodities they produce—one might imagine that their bodies would be clearly
               visible. But in fact, the slaves are denoted by fragments, primarily hands, which
               seem at points to be indistinguishable from the dark fish tails silhouetted in the
               blood-red sun and from the wings of birds flying low over the water (<ref target="#slavers_detail1">figure 2</ref>). Even the largest identifiably human
               body part in the painting, the dusky-colored leg in the lower right corner (<ref target="#slavers_detail2">figure 3</ref>), is framed between the bodies and tails
               of two large fish, whose tailfins rhyme with the spread toes and loose chain attached
               to the foot. This leg drew the attention of the critic for the <title level="j">Times</title>: “the leg of a negro [. . .] is about to afford a nibble to a John
               Dory, a pair of soles, and a shoal of whitebait”(6). The same leg provided one of
               Turner’s most consistently hostile critics, the conservative Reverend John Eagles,
               with the occasion to attempt a pun: in his review for <title level="j">Blackwood’s
                  Magazine</title> he remarked that the “fish claiming their leg-acy is very funny”
               (380). Marcus Wood has appropriately asked “if indeed this is funny, why is it
               funny?” He concludes that the bottom-right corner of Turner’s painting centered on
               the leg is a “tragic-comic lament on the slave trade,” and that the “diving leg
               implores us to try to understand mass murder by picking up the pieces” (<title level="m">Blind Memory</title> 49, 50). This is a fine piece of impassioned
               Romantic criticism, undergirded by thorough scholarship and an appropriate
               application of trauma theory. It constitutes Turner as the Romantic subject and “us”
               as the privileged viewer. My interest, conversely, is “them”—those contemporary
               critics who seem to have recognized the comedy, but somehow missed the point. </p>
               <p>First, it is worth noting that while Turner often produced figures that were
               shapeless, ambiguous, or vague, he usually did not emphasize the fragmented body in
               other scenes of human disaster. Even in the strange and disturbing <title level="m">Field of Waterloo</title> (1818, <ref target="#waterloo">figure 4</ref>), where
               the dead are rendered as a molten mass, they appear as notionally complete bodies. We
               cannot know why Turner chose to represent the dead and dying African slaves as
               fragments in his <title level="m">Slavers</title>, but we can be certain that there
               was plenty of cultural precedent for doing so.</p>
               <p>As Roxann Wheeler has shown, for most of the eighteenth century, human difference was
               predicated on a range of factors, including religion, clothing, social organization,
               and language. Skin color and other aspects of physical appearance were registered as
               differences (often attributed to differences in climate), but they were not
               foundational to the formation of human categories, which were more often described in
               terms of “variety,” rather than race (31). By the third quarter of the eighteenth
               century, however, human difference increasingly became subject to categorization
               based on physical traits, although socio-cultural differences never lost their power
               to describe variations in the civility and rudeness of a people. There is no simple
               explanation for this shift. Contributing factors included the enhanced scientific
               authority of natural history, now extended to the study of humans (in widely
               influential writings by Linnaeus and Buffon, for example). The expansion of European
               exploration and colonization was also a crucial factor, along with the explosion in
               print culture that brought natural and civil histories of European and non-European
               peoples to a widening readership. There was also an acceleration of popular interest
               in the pseudo-science of physiognomy, which claimed that character could be read
               through an analysis of the shape of the skull and facial features. And,
               significantly, there was the development of a body of writing on aesthetics, which,
               like scientific writings, could not avoid taking up the issue of human difference,
               increasingly posed in racialized terms.<note place="foot" resp="editors">There is a rapidly expanding body of literature devoted to
                  the study of the rise of natural history, racial “science” and aesthetics in the
                  eighteenth century. Bindman provides a succinct and lucid account of the major
                  philosophers, natural scientists and aestheticians who contributed to the
                  formation of a “scientific” discourse of racialized difference in <title level="m">Ape to Apollo</title>. Wheeler’s <title level="m">Complexion of Race</title>
                  is essential reading for the eighteenth century pre-history and development of
                  this discourse. Londa Schiebinger’s <title level="m">Nature’s Body</title>
                  provides an important analysis of the role of gender in the formation of this
                  scientific discourse. My <title level="m">Slavery, Sugar and the Culture of
                     Refinement</title> (chapter three) takes up many of the issues around race
                  science, aesthetics and caricature discussed here. </note>
               </p>
               <p>Publications in all these various fields of activity routinely registered human
               difference through a listing and picturing of physical characteristics such as skin
               color and the color and texture of the hair, and also the shape of the skull, nose,
               lips, and skeletal frame. The comparative anatomist Petrus Camper (1722-1789), the
               widely-read physiognomist Johann Caspar Lavater (1741-1801), and the influential
               author of books on antique art and aesthetics, Johann Winckelmann (1717-1768),
               acknowledged the diversity of human groups spread across the globe; however, the
               “negro”—a term that I use throughout this essay to indicate a socially constructed
               racial category associated with sub-Saharan African peoples—was frequently positioned
               as anatomically most distant from the European.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For some of the most pertinent publications by these three

               described via lists of facial features and body parts. Crucially, however, they were
               normalized in writings on natural history, racial science, and aesthetics through
               reference to a sculptural ideal based not on the fragment, but rather on a body that
               was smooth, closed, and complete, and that was most often exemplified by the <title level="m">Apollo Belvedere</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The male body, as Schiebinger has shown (143-83), was the most common
                  exemplar of racial difference in this discourse, although the female body
                  certainly did figure in many accounts, and was seen as crucial to shaping the
                  racial character. The white female counterpart to the <title level="m">Apollo</title> in this discourse was usually the <title level="m">Medici
                     Venus</title>. </note> There is, of course a huge irony that that extant
               version of the statue fueling such admiration in the eighteenth and nineteenth
               centuries was a fragmented Roman copy after a lost Greek original (the left forearm
               and fingers of the right hand were restored in the sixteenth century).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a brief account of the
                     <title level="m">Apollo Belvedere</title> from its discovery in the late

               the restored marble that British travelers encountered when they visited Rome during
               this time period, and that was reproduced in the many copies that graced British
               collections. And it was this fantasy of the ideal Apollonian body that grand tourists
               like Sir Wyndham Knatchbull-Wyndham emulated when he had his portrait painted in the
               pose of the <title level="m">Apollo</title> by Pompeo Batoni (<ref target="#portrait">figure 5</ref>). The fact that this ideal body was conjured up from a fragmented
               copy of a lost original of an imaginary being suggests just how fantastic and
               precarious the edifice of whiteness was (and still is).</p>
               <p>My research indicates that within the intertwined discourses of race and aesthetics
               there was no viable “negro” counterpart to the <title level="m">Apollo</title>; the
               black body always failed to measure up to this white ideal, and never could aspire to
               its perfection (Kriz, <title level="m">Slavery</title> 71ff). The alternative idea of
               the negro is in fact the bestial body, given over to the base appetites and physical
               senses, rather than reason, judgment, and (good) taste (Virey 2: 41-2). The most
               well-known scientific representations of this idea come from a highly influential
               treatise on skull shape, physiognomy, and human difference by the Dutch anatomist
               Petrus Camper, first published in 1786. He developed a scale for differentiating
               between the skulls of certain mammals and various types of humans based on the slant
               of a straight line drawn from the lip, to the tip of the nose, to the top of the
               forehead. This “facial line” not only served to distinguish various animal and human
               types, but also to order them aesthetically: according to Camper, the more vertical
               the facial line, the more beautiful (100).<note xml:id="ftn11" place="foot" resp="editors" n="11">All references to Camper’s treatise are to the 1821 English

               including the head and skull (!!) of the <title level="m">Apollo</title> at the
               “high” (most beautiful) end of the scale, Camper disrupts the very system of
               scientific evaluation he sets up, which was based on serial assessments of difference
               and similitude.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On the use of

               The relationship between the European skull and the <title level="m">Apollo</title>
               is one based on notion of artistic imitation, not on the principles of comparative
               anatomy. Whether writers on aesthetics argued for a universal ideal of beauty (such
               as Johann Winckelmann) or multiple body types that varied by racialized group (such
               as Joshua Reynolds), only the white European male was considered to have an imitative
               relationship to the <title level="m">Apollo</title> (Kriz, <title level="m">Slavery</title> 75-6, 86). This relationship was guaranteed by a cultural
               genealogy that traces a line from the art of the Greeks to the Romans and forward to
               other European nations. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Martin Bernal’s <title level="m">Black Athena</title> offers a well-known account
                  of how the African roots of ancient Greek civilization were severed and disavowed
                  over the course of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This publication
                  stimulated wide-ranging and heated debates about the “whitening” of Greek history
                  and culture, and its consequences for our current understanding of the history
                  racism (including anti-Semitism). </note>

               <p>Camper disparages the idea that cranial similarity between apes and Africans
               (positioned at the “low” end of the diagram) was a sign of the latter’s bestiality
               (32). But placing like-shaped objects next to each other within the same field had
               for centuries been a way of inviting an exploration of their similarities, based on
               long-standing notions of resemblance and contiguity. The naturalization of the link
               between the African and the slave—forged over the course of the seventeenth and
               eighteenth centuries—further promoted the association of the African with the
               bestial. Long before Africans were enslaved and forcibly transported to the New
               World, the idea of the slave as beast of burden was a commonplace in writings on
               slavery. And in the eighteenth century, even the prominent abolitionist Thomas
               Clarkson agreed with his anti-abolitionist opponents that African slaves had a
               brutish appearance and diminished mental capacities. In a passage from his <title level="m">Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species</title>,
               published in 1786, he insisted that these are the effects of slavery, not essential
               qualities (21). Whatever the cause, however, Africans were triply susceptible to
               charges of animality: because of the alleged similarity of their skulls to apes;
               their origin in a mysterious continent filled with strange creatures; and their
               enslavement by Europeans, which was bound to turn humans into beasts. </p>
               <p>In art, the racialist (and racist) idea of the negro finds its fullest expression not
               in antique sculpture, but in caricature, which historically had deployed the rhetoric
               of the grotesque, the fragmentary, and the excessive, often in conjunction with the
               animalization of the human. Drawing on visual traditions going back several
               centuries, many of the British caricatures that were commercially marketed from the
               eighteenth century onward gleefully used animal imagery to satirize public figures,
               as well as social and national types.<note place="foot" resp="editors">A key work in this long tradition was Giambattista della Porta’s <title level="m">De Humana Physiognomonia</title> (1586), which analyzes human
                  character by exploring the similarities between animal and human physiognomies.
                  His work was influential in the development of natural history and caricature.
                  Zoomorphism persisted throughout the nineteenth century and beyond (see Donald
                  44-57). </note> In these cases, the subject’s character was impugned, but not his
               or her humanity. But the strong and repeated connection of the negro with the animal
               in aesthetics, writings on New World slavery, and the emerging scientific discourse
               on human variety, gave a powerful, legitimating force to caricatures that represented
               black people as creatures who tested the limits of the human.</p>
               <p>One of the most potent caricatures to capitalize on the idea of the fragmented and
               animalized negro slave was James Gillray’s print from 1791, <title level="m">Barbarities in the West Indias</title> [sic] (<ref target="#barbarities">figure
                  7</ref>). This caricature makes evident what the “scientific” discourse on the
               “negro” does not—namely, that the fragmentation of the negro as a racial type
               thematizes the high level of violence enacted on the black body under Atlantic
               slavery. According to the inscription on the print, the image is based on a report
               read before Parliament in 1791 claiming that an English slave driver had punished a
               slave who insisted he was too sick to work by immersing him in a vat of boiling
               sugar. <note place="foot" resp="editors">According to the
                  caption, this incident was reported by abolitionist Philip Francis in
                  Parliamentary testimony. </note> Ronald Paulson has suggested that the sheer
               excessiveness of the imagery—the wildly gesturing limbs of the victim rhyming with
               the black human arm and ear that appear alongside the vermin nailed to the back
               wall—calls into question the political motivation of the print (Paulson 204). And it
               may well be that this is not an atrocity print designed to convince viewers of the
               horrors of West Indian slavery, but rather a parody of abolitionist accounts that
               reveals how ridiculous such claims of suffering really were.</p>
               <p>In either case, the excessiveness of the image reinforces the reputation of the West
               Indian colonies as a space of excess and extremes—of climate, profit taking, and
               behavior. Through the hyperbolic language of caricature, the artist vividly suggests
               that everyone who comes in contact with the West Indies is debased—the English driver
               becomes a monstrous cannibal (a type associated both with the indigenous peoples of
               West Africa and the West Indies), and the slaves are reduced to body parts that will
               be eaten or displayed as vermin. And yet, the caricatured English slave driver still
               represents a deviation from some kind of ideal, virtuous, white body. The black body
               fragments do not. There is no coherent alternative or ideal that secures the
               representation of the African slave in caricature as a deviation. Rather these
               bestial bits are what figure the negro. This trope only gained strength between the
               publication of Gillray’s print in 1791 and the exhibition of Turner’s <title level="m">Slavers</title> in 1840, with its fragmented bodies that eerily conjure
               up the boiled, drowning slave in <title level="m">Barbarities</title>. </p>
               <p>In 1821, for example, George Cruikshank produced a parody on Camper (<ref target="#ferocity">figure 8</ref>) in which caricature and comparative anatomy
               join forces to reinforce the negro-ape connection.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Cruikshank’s print was a mock advertisement that appeared in
                  William Hone’s satirical broadside, <title level="m">A Slap at Slop and the Bridge
                     Street Gang</title> (London, 1821). At several points this broadside promotes
                  the cause of English laborers by suggesting that they are more poorly treated and
                  politically devalued than black slaves in the West Indies. </note> This is a
               quickly executed print that attempts to solicit a cheap laugh from its viewers. But
               that unguarded laughter acknowledges an acceptance of assumptions about racialized
               difference that might be deemed unacceptable in other circumstances. Cruikshank’s
               wood engraving invites its viewers—even those who oppose slavery and the slave trade
               on humanitarian grounds—to laugh, and thereby confirm as common sense, the bestiality
               of the African. </p>
               <p>The trope of “the negro-as-fragment” was advanced even in caricatures that
               represented notionally complete bodies.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See <ref target="praxis.visualities.2014.wood.html">Marcus

               stuffed into hunting garb, taking leave of his tearful and overdressed wife.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This was one in a series of

                     Laughable Caricatures on the March of Manners amongst Blacks</title>. </note>
               This is one in a series of prints published by Gabriel Tregear that mocked the
               alleged attempts of black people to enter refined British society through the
               performance of its rituals. These black interlopers would likely be identified as
               immigrants from the West Indies, since Parliament passed the bill abolishing slavery
               in the British islands two years before this print was published. The caricature’s
               ironic title affirms the conceptual impossibility of a black Venus or Adonis and the
               image reinforces this idea by reducing the black figures to a series of ridiculous
               and disarticulated parts: bulbous noses, pop-eyes, and lumpish hairdos. The garish,
               unmodulated coloring of black skin set against light fabric, such as the face and
               frilly white cap of the standing servant on the right, also advances the idea of the
               black body as a series of ill-formed and disconnected parts.</p>
               <p>Laughter and varying degrees of alarm or horror seem to go together in these prints,
               which attempt to maintain the fiction of racial difference (Cruikshank), or to
               fantasize about black contamination of white society through ingestion (Gillray), or
               social invasion (Tregear). We’ve seen that Turner’s <title level="m">Slavers </title>
               generated a similarly mixed response in 1840, directly put by Thackeray: “Is the
               painting sublime or ridiculous. I don’t know which.” Andrew Wilton has noted that the
               fine line separating the sublime from the ridiculous was acknowledged by Turner
               himself. In one of his sketchbooks, the artist comments that Tom Paine “says that the
               sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related that it is difficult to class
               them separately. One step above the sublime becomes ridiculous and one step above the
               ridiculous makes the sublime again” (cited in Wilton 356). In the case of Turner’s
                  <title level="m">Slavers</title>, this fragile line between the sublime and the
               ridiculous threatens to dissolve, conveying the horrors of slavery via black bodies
               that are fragmented and degraded to the level of the bestial. The hands are so
               abstractly rendered that they appear more like glyphs than illusionistic
               representations, offering the minimal amount of visual information necessary to
               identify them <emph>as</emph> hands (Bryson 48-52). Some of them are formally
               indistinguishable from the wings of birds and the tailfins of the fish hovering
               around them. It is hard, therefore, to imagine these bits, then, attached to wrists,
               arms, and bodies. Likewise the leg is so oddly formed and disposed that it is nearly
               impossible to imagine the body to which it belongs. (McCoubrey 338).<note place="foot" resp="editors">McCoubrey claims that the leg
                  belongs to a woman whose breasts are “clearly visible” above the picture frame,
                  but he admits that he cannot make sense of the leg’s relationship to the rest of
                  this body (338). No contemporary critic claimed to see bodies and breasts in the
                  water or indeed attempted to assign a gender to any of the depicted human
                  fragments. </note> These ill-formed and disconnected extremities have a cartoonish
               air about them, bringing the ridiculous into direct and dissonant confrontation with
               the sublimely-marked sea and sky. In this way the painting serves as a visual
               demonstration of the unstable line between the sublime and ridiculous that Turner
               referenced in his sketchbook.</p>
               <p>If, for a viewer like Ruskin, the horror of the event is brilliantly connoted by the
               slashing brushwork and clashing colors of sky and sea, the hands and leg would seem
               to impede viewers from imagining the dead and dying victims lying beneath the waves.
               These parts seem more like incongruous bits of flotsam, rather than tragic fragments
               that index a human wholeness. And, as British writers on humor repeatedly insisted,
               incongruity forms the basis for laughter (Kriz, <title level="m">Slavery</title> 74).
               James Beattie, for example, wrote in 1764 that “laughter arises from the view of two
               or more inconsistent, unsuitable, or incongruous parts or circumstances, considered
               as united in one complex object or assemblage” (602).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Beattie reviews the writings of Thomas Hobbes,
                  John Locke, Richard Addison, and Mark Akenside in the course of making this claim.
               </note> Whatever Turner’s motives, then, his painting’s reliance on the device of
               fragmentation offered his contemporary critics the occasion to treat it like a
               sublime caricature that did not so much subvert as reinforce the fragmentary image of
               “the negro” in scientific discourse, civil and natural histories, pro-abolitionist
               tracts, and caricatures. </p>
               <p>Appearing in the same exhibition as Turner’s painting was another on the subject of
               the slave trade that seemed to offer wholeness in place of fragmentation, and to
               solicit a sigh of empathy rather than the awful laughter and bafflement generated by
               the <title level="m">Slavers</title>. François-Auguste Biard’s <title level="m">Bartering for Slaves on the Guinea Coast</title> (<ref target="bartering">figure
                  10</ref>) offers viewers the titillating spectacle of newly captured slaves being
               whipped (upper left), branded (center left), inspected (center), and led away in
               coffles (left and right middle ground) as two slave traders, an exotically dressed
               black and a languorous white, sit and watch (foreground right). This aesthetically
               conservative display of academic exoticism has been vehemently disparaged by modern
               scholars. Albert Boime and Marcus Wood have (rightly, I think) attacked Biard for his
               flagrant sentimentalism and for the sadistic thrills he affords viewers, who are
               invited to disapprove of and, at the same time, take perverse pleasure in violence,
               humiliation, and torture so illusionistically presented (Boime 138, Wood, <title level="m">Blind Memory</title>, 44). The work appears to have been a popular
               favorite at the Exhibition, however; it was taken off the walls of the Academy and
               presented to Thomas Fowell Buxton, the organizer of the Society for the Extinction of
               the Slave Trade and for the Civilization of Africa, which was meeting in London in
               the first week of June 1840 (Boime 37). Decorated with whips and chains, the picture
               was hung in Exeter Hall for the World Anti-Slavery Convention, which followed
               directly on the Society’s meeting.</p>
               <p>Thackeray raved about <title level="m">Bartering for Slaves</title>, perhaps, as John
               McCoubrey has suggested, to demonstrate his support for abolition in the face of his
               savage treatment of the <title level="m">Slavers</title> (345-6): <quote>Yonder is a
                  poor woman kneeling before a Frenchman, her shoulder is fizzing under the hot iron
                  with which he brands her, she is looking up shuddering and wild yet quite mild and
                  patient: it breaks your heart to look at her. I never saw anything so exquisitely
                  pathetic as that face. ([Thackeray] 731) </quote> John Eagles followed suit: his
               review of Biard’s picture, was, if anything more enthusiastic than Thackerary’s.
               Declaring <title level="m">Bartering for Slaves</title> to be “perhaps in reality the
               most powerful picture in the exhibition,” he concluded that “[w]e have seen
               representations of horror, of plague, pestilence, and famine—but we never saw a piece
               of more real deep pathos” (384). For decades abolitionists deployed this kind of
               sentimental rhetoric in texts and images of suffering slaves in an effort to stir the
               feelings of white Britons. But, as Saidiya Hartman and Marcus Wood each have shown,
               these kind of empathic representations involve an act of displacement. In attempting
               to feel for the slave, the reader/viewer imaginatively (and here, sadistically) takes
               possession of the slave’s body (Wood, <title level="m">Slavery, Empathy</title>,
               16-7; Hartman 18-19). As a result, the spectator ends up feeling “for himself rather
               than for those whom this exercise in imagination presumably is designed to reach;” in
               the process the sentimental object is obliterated (Hartman 19).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Hartman is referring here to a specific
                  instance of this kind of sentimental projection—a letter written by John Rankin
                  that was published in 1837—but her analysis can be applied to images and other
                  texts. </note> In Thackeray’s case the spectacle of the suffering slave woman
               prompts a performance of suffering by both the critic and the viewer (“it breaks your
               heart to look at her”). This process of displacement and display is flexible and can
               accommodate a variety of sentimental objects. But, as Hartman notes, the problem of
               sentimental obliteration is particularly acute in the case of African slaves, since
               one of the ways the system of plantation slavery rendered black people as “thingly
               bodies” was to disavow their capacity to feel the physical pain of hard labor and to
               experience the trauma of separation from homeland and family (18-23). </p>
               <p>For all their important aesthetic and ideological differences, then, there is a way
               that Turner’s <title level="m">Slavers</title> and Biard’s <title level="m">Bartering
                  for Slaves</title> reinforce each other by soliciting similar responses to the
               suffering black body: they keep the feeling, sentient black body at a distance,
               threatening it with obliteration or dehumanization. Turner represents slave victims
               as glyphs that comically mimic fish and birds, and displaces “feeling” from bodies
               onto the sublime natural elements of sky and sea. Ian Baucom has suggested that this
               distancing effect in the <title level="m">Slavers</title> is enhanced by the artist’s
               use of smeared Romantic brushstrokes throughout the composition (275). These blurry
               strokes serve to abstract what they seem to represent: they show us what we cannot
               see. In contrast, Biard offers a high degree of figural illusionism in the form of
               whole black bodies that are reduced to the level of suffering beasts in their
               “wildness” and passivity, a point that both Thackeray and Eagles emphasize in their
                  reviews.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Eagles, for
                  example, reverts to the language of the savage and the bestial when he describes
                  some of the agitated slaves “tossing their arms about in despair—not as any other
                  of the human race would throw their limbs; but with the peculiar action of savage
                  life” (384).</note> This double move, promoting sympathy for African slaves and
               political redress for their plight while maintaining their inferior, savage status,
               is what allowed slavery to be abolished, but racism directed against black people in
               Africa and the Atlantic Diaspora to persist and even increase in the nineteenth
               century.</p>
               <p> I want to be clear that I am not saying that Turner’s <title level="m">Slavers</title> is as banal and aesthetically impoverished as Biard’s picture.
               Rather, I am claiming that at the historical moment in which it was exhibited, the
               affective viewing relationships the <title level="m">Slavers</title> constitutes
               between the African body and the white viewer are compatible with that produced by a
               sentimental mode of representation and also by caricature. One can laugh at, be
               horrified by, and take empathetic possession of this kind of body—but not imagine an
               equal power relationship with it. That breakdown of imagination is in part due to the
               way aesthetics came to occupy the heart of scientific racism. It is all to easy to
               assume that politically liberal or radical artists who produced aesthetically
               progressive or modern or difficult works of art in the nineteenth century rendered
               these works immune to ideological appropriation by conservative interests. But even
               when—or, <emph>especially</emph> when—an aesthetically innovative work of art is
               greeted by confusion, contempt, and laughter among a group of conservative critics
               and an uncomprehending art public, it can still be actively involved in the
               production of a regressive “commonsense” notion of racial difference. I am suggesting
               that one way (among many) to move beyond a Romantic art history is to pay serious
               attention to the dismissive laughter of seemingly uncomprehending viewers. In the

               <p>In tracing the transatlantic roots of historical authority and epistemology in his
                  <title level="m">How to Write the History of the New World</title>, Jorge
               Cañizares-Esguerra argues “the tradition that locates the ‘West’ somewhere adjacent
               to the North Atlantic is amusingly pompous” (10). Following his provocation, this
               essay traces the contested genealogies and hybrid origins of the panorama, the camera
               lucida, and the daguerreotype: a set of Romantic-era visual technologies frequently
               discussed as originating in European metropoles. “Camera Lucida Mexicana,” then,
               recasts the geneses and genealogies of these technologies as a process of
               transatlantic exchange oriented toward the New World and the south, in this case,
                  Mexico.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Throughout this essay
                  I use the terms “Mexico” and “Mexican” as many foreign travelers in the nineteenth
                  century used the umbrella term “Mexico”—to refer to the entire region south of the
                  United States as far south as Costa Rica. All sites I discuss were either inside
                  the borders of New Spain or part of a territory (the Federal Republic of Central
                  America) whose political existence was generally deemed too unstable to warrant a
                  different name.</note> In locating the history of Romantic technologies and
               visuality in the New World, and in the global south, I argue that this re-orientation
               undermines claims to them as agents of imperial dominance. Instead, I show how these
               technologies emerge as contested, ambiguous, and frequently defiant obstacles against
               the desires of their operators in an attempted visual conquest of Mexico in the first
               half of the nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>My interest in visual technology’s destabilization of objectivity is indebted to the
               work of Lorraine J. Daston and Peter Galison, who argue that, in the second half of
               the nineteenth century, scientific discourse posited objectivity as dependent on
               mechanical technology. Daston and Galison find in the pursuit of “mechanical
               objectivity” an “insistent drive to repress the willful intervention of the
               artist-author, and to put in its stead a set of procedures that would, as it were,
               move nature to the page through a strict protocol, if not automatically” (121). Here,
               the modifier “mechanical” works to re-structure objectivity through changing
               conceptions of the interdependence of technology and operator, while emphasizing the
               role of optical devices in the quest for “images, machines, and illustrators [that]
               would not budge even to obey the scientist’s own misdirected will” (124).</p>
               <p>I draw Daston and Galison’s argument backward to the end of the long eighteenth
               century, and from the desires of scientists to those of the explorers of the New
               World. Perhaps it is no accident that when Thomas Carlyle first publishes the term
               “visuality” in 1841, he does so the same year the daguerreotype makes landfall in
               Mexico, in the hands of explorers wishing to literally own Mexican history by
               photographically reproducing it. Writing that Dante’s <title level="m">Divine
                  Comedy</title> presents a narrative where “every compartment of it is worked out,
               with intense earnestness, into truth, into clear visuality” (149), Carlyle equates
               truth with the uninhibited gaze by compartmentalizing Dante’s poem. At the same time,
               in Mexico daguerreotypists seek to tame the unwieldy compartments of Daguerre’s bulky
               box in order to clearly and truthfully replicate the landscape and the constitution
               of the what Nicholas Mirzoeff defines as the “visual subject in colonial modernity”
               (“Ghostwriting” 241). Thus when Hal Foster first defines visuality as “sight as a
               social fact” (ix), this definition is in many ways indebted to the contested
               definitions of visuality in early nineteenth-century Mexico, where explorers’ desire
               for mechanical objectivity battled against the very devices wielded in its
               pursuit.</p>
               <p>My goal, then, is to argue first that discussions of visual technologies should
               occupy primary importance in the history of the interrelationship between visuality
               and travel in the Romantic period. This argument necessitates locating the emergence
               of Romantic visualities in the global south. The case studies I present show how the
               desire for objectivity was articulated and contested through antiquarian Mexican
               travel narratives in the first half of the nineteenth century. I pay special
               attention to the roles of nascent visual technologies—the camera lucida, the
               panorama, and the daguerreotype—in the creation of those images. Specifically, I
               argue that while such technologies were deployed in pursuit of mechanical
               objectivity, they continually emerged as powerful agents with the ability to grapple
               with and defy the wishes those using them.</p>
               <p>Prevailing scholarship on the place of aesthetic ideals in Romantic travel has tended
               to focus on shifting conceptions of objectivity and subjectivity in tandem with
               shifting ideals of the place of the viewer, and the visual subject.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For example, Benjamin Colbert
                  argues that the creation of the subjective being necessitated a shift away from
                  Enlightenment notions of human vision as pure and unmediated (8). In <title level="m">Voyage into Substance</title>, Barbara Maria Stafford takes this a
                  step further, displacing subjective Romantic vision onto other sense modes
                  entirely, arguing that the Romantic traveler “felt the landscape without seeing
                  it” (443). Nigel Leask counters both positions, showing that travelers always
                  grappled with the complex relationships between subjective aesthetics and the
                  continued goal to present objective knowledge (167-168). </note> While this
               remains my goal here, I place visual technologies at the center of this shift. Ron
               Broglio shares my focus in this regard: in his <title level="m">Technologies of the
                  Picturesque</title>, Broglio argues that Romantic-era visual technologies
               dramatically changed the cultural relationship to visuality without being noticed.
               While I also place technologies at the center of this moment, the technologies I
               reference here did the opposite: they were noticed, lauded, and grappled with
               precisely because they did <emph>not</emph>, as Broglio argues, “help us master the
               landscape” and “further a sense of individual power over nature” (26).</p>
               <p>In addition, scholarship on the importance of visual technologies generally focuses
               on its relation to the rise of photography, rather than an explicit engagement with
               their role in practices of travel and exploration. For example, Geoffrey Batchen and
               Jonathan Crary both cite the importance of the camera obscura leading up to the
               advent of the daguerreotype in the late 1830s (Batchen; Crary 78). My account of
               Romantic travel also gives a privileged position to the daguerreotype, but in
               relation to the camera lucida, a device not discussed by Batchen, Crary, or Stafford,
               and one that even in nineteenth-century use figured as a decidedly domestic and
               amateur apparatus rather than a device used by professional artists in the context of
               exploration in foreign lands (Hammond and Austin 54; Lee 63). I present the
               daguerreotype as a major point of conflict and contrast to the camera lucida, even as
               travelers desired that the production of objective images would be facilitated by
               both apparatuses.</p>
               <p> As explorers and travelers produce images of Mexico that circulate on both sides of
               the Atlantic in the early nineteenth century, they continue to walk the fine line
               between the desired mechanical objectivity of the nineteenth century and picturesque
               vision that dominates discourses of the late eighteenth. I begin with the cases of
               Pedro José Márquez (1741-1820), a Mexican Jesuit priest working in Rome in 1804, and
               German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859), who publishes his views of
               Mexico in Paris in 1816. I move on to the way the camera lucida emerges (in the hands
               of Scottish artist and architect Frederick Catherwood [1799-1854] in the
               Mediterranean and Mexico, with the support of English entrepreneur Robert Burford
               [1791-1861]) as an important instrument through which to join the ideals of the
               Romantic landscape with the desire for objective scientific accuracy achieved by the
               use of visual technologies. Burford’s panoramas, then major attractions in London,
               rely directly on Catherwood’s camera lucida-aided drawings as prototypes for
               panoramic images. Yet Catherwood’s relationship to the camera lucida is in doubt, as
               its supposed ability to re-create the objective world is disrupted during his work
               with John Lloyd Stephens (1805-1852) in the Yucatán between 1839 and 1841. This
               tension leads directly to the pair’s use of the daguerreotype on their second trip to
               Mexico. Originally viewed by Stephens and Catherwood as a tool to expedite their goal
               of presenting an objective visual account of Mexican antiquities and landscape, the
               daguerreotype emerges as a stubborn, defiant apparatus in contrast to its desired
               results. I conclude with a consideration of the daguerreotype’s new roles in Mexico,
               and how Stephens and Catherwood’s initial uses of the daguerreotype further
               complicate its relationship to the camera lucida and to later photographic practices
               in the Americas.</p>

               the Viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru begin to assert their autonomy in opposition
               to the Spanish crown, giving birth to independence movements throughout the Americas
               that, by the 1820s, leave Spain almost devoid of American territory. Spain’s
               isolationist colonial policies—a major cause of the nascent independence
               movements—also mean a restriction on foreign travelers in the Americas. As such,
               almost no drawn-from-life images of American natural history or archaeology are
               produced prior to the 1820s, with two notable exceptions: Pedro José Márquez and
               Alexander von Humboldt. Márquez publishes <title level="m">Due antichi monumenti di
                  architectura messicana</title> (“Two Ancient Monuments of Mexican Architecture”),
               in Rome in 1804. <title level="m">Due antichi</title> marks the first time Mexican
               archaeological images are produced in Europe, and even more significantly, they are
               images Márquezadapts from the work of José Antonio Alzate y Ramírez (1737-1799), a
               Mexican polymath and prolific author. Thus, Ramírez’s groundbreaking research on
               Mexican archaeology is first seen by a European audience as a result of Márquez’s
               work. Márquez’s presence in Rome is the ironic result of a July 1773 decree by Pope
               Clement XIV suppressing the Jesuit order, an order applied unevenly around the
               Catholic world but harshly in New Spain (Roehner 167). That year, Márquez is forced
               to leave Mexico and enter into a city with a long antiquarian tradition as well as,
               in his opinion, a long history of misrepresentations of Mexico (Cañizares-Esguerra
               254-255). <title level="m">Due antichi</title> responds to both of these problems. In
               the text, Márquez makes a passionate argument for the cultural advancement and
               complexity of the civilizations of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, implicitly tying them
               to the civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Rome, and Babylon which function as the basis
               of antiquarian travel images. Márquez’s illustrations reinforce this point. In the
               untitled first plate from <title level="m">Due antichi</title>, an engraving of the
               Pyramid of El Tajín (in modern-day Veracruz state) shows a highly schematized,
               geometric structure absent of any background context (<ref target="#fig1">Figure
                  1</ref>). What would have been a foliage-covered and largely unexcavated pyramid
               in 1804, Márquez renders as a flawless work of architectural precision. The pyramid’s
               six levels, each with identical rows of window openings and level roofs, mimic each
               other in proportional size and shape. The pyramid inhabits a nearly two-dimensional
               landscape where spatial depth is shown only through incised lines and the hint of a
               shadow at the pyramid’s right side. This rendering of the pyramid’s sharp angles, the
               precision of the stairway, windows, and level steps are deliberate attempts by
               Márquez to connote a degree of Mexican technological advancement tied to ancient
               Greek or Egyptian monumental structures. In short, in removing the structure from
               Mexico, Márquez seeks to place the pyramid in the most familiar context: the cultural
               sophistication of the ancient Mediterranean.</p>
               <p> When contrasted with Márquez’s work in Rome, Humboldt’s contemporary images of
               Mexico open up a space to theorize the relationships between picturesque vision,
               subjective experience, and the desire for scientific objectivity. Humboldt spends the
               year of 1803-1804 conducting archival research in Mexico City, at the tail end of his
               now-famous exploration of the Americas between 1799 and 1804. On one of his few
               excursions outside the city, Humboldt journeys to what is now Puebla state and
               produces one of his final images in the Americas, <title level="m">Pyramide de
                  Cholula</title> (<ref target="#fig2">Figure 2</ref>). In Humboldt’s rendering, the
               massive four-stepped pyramid, topped by a small chapel, rises gently from the valley
               floor, dwarfed by the mountains in the background. The mountains’ jagged edges and
               shallow slopes serve as a point of contrast and comparison to the pyramid,
               simultaneously positioning it as united with the picturesque landscape as it
               maintains evidence of human artifice. In the foreground, two men clad in matching
               hats and topcoats converse, while a shirtless figure sits on the path next to them,
               staring into the ground. The figures’ proximity to Humboldt’s careful rendering of
               native Mexican trees makes apparent the image’s dual concerns of Enlightenment
               traditions of encyclopedic representation, visual legibility, and visualities during
               the Romantic period, particularly that of the picturesque landscape. This tension is
               especially apparent in Mexico, since Humboldt’s illustration of the Pyramid of
               Cholula represents such a marked contrast with Márquez’s contemporary work.</p>
               <p>When Humboldt returns to Europe and publishes <title level="m">Pyramide de
                  Cholula</title> in his <title level="m">Vues des Cordillères</title> (1816), it
               marks the moment for the genesis of an emerging visual dialogue in the Atlantic world
                  <foreign>vis-à-vis</foreign> Mexico between the production of faithful
               representations of Mexican archaeology and geography, and the visual production of
               Romantic aesthetics in tandem with nascent visual technologies. This distinction and
               flux follows Nigel Leask’s elaborated tension between “subjectivist and objectivist
               strategies of representation” (167), which emerge as continually in flux and
               counterbalance in Humboldt’s work. In this way, Humboldt’s objective-subjective
               tension espouses a worldview where “the <emph>way we feel</emph> about the external
               world is as much a part of its meaning as what we can measure or know about it”
               (Leask 166). <title level="m">Cholula</title> is an excellent example: Humboldt’s
               concern with presenting an encyclopedic inventory of the flora and geological
               landscape surrounding the pyramid speak to his desire to present the “beauty of the
               landscape” as a direct aspect of its scientific recording, both of which could be
               seen as mutually reinforcing in a “human-scale” (Godlewska 247) landscape view.
               Humboldt’s and Márquez’s work emphasizes the centrality of the Mexican imaginary in
               the construction of Romantic Atlantic visual genealogies. Their images are,
               especially in Márquez’s case, an encounter between Mexican visual concerns and the
               visual iconography of Mediterranean archaeological illustrations. Thus, their work
               sows the seeds for further contested visualities in Mexico following independence, as
               European and American travelers use, adapt, and grapple with Romantic-era visual
               technologies (the camera lucida, the panorama, and the daguerreotype) in relation to
               the aforementioned discourse exemplified by Márquez and Humboldt.</p>
               <p> When New Spain gains its independence and splits into Mexico and the Federal
               Republic of Central America in 1823, suddenly Europeans and Americans are free to
               explore the region. Mexico occupies an unstable position in a post-independence
               world. Released from the Spanish crown, Mexico remains outside the linear historical
               narrative of the North Atlantic West. Its pre-conquest civilizations are an
               “historical tabula rasa” (Evans 2), ready to be mapped onto a larger transatlantic
               cultural geography. In this context, the Mexican landscape works to construct the
               illusion of totalizing, panoramic experiences for the citizens of the European
               metropole—in this case, London. Panoramas of Mexico originate from the interactions
               of two British citizens: William Bullock (c. 1773–1849), an English explorer and
               naturalist, and Robert Burford, owner and proprietor of the most popular panoramas in
               London. In 1822, Bullock travels to Mexico for six months, moving through Veracruz,
               Xalapa, Pulque, Puebla, Cholula, and Mexico City. Bullock uses his journey to write
               observations for his <title level="m">Six Months Residence and Travel in
                  Mexico</title> (1825), and to collect artifacts, documents, and illustrations for
               use in his exhibition <title level="m">Modern Mexico</title> (1824), shown at the
               Egyptian Hall in London. Fittingly, the frontispiece to <title level="m">Six Months
                  Residence </title>is a panoramic landscape vista entitled <title level="m">View of
                  the City and the Valley of Mexico, from Tacubaya</title> (<ref target="#fig3">Figure 3</ref>). The print, displaying a rolling central valley floor, distant
               cragged mountains, and encyclopedic representation of Mexican flora, presents many of
               the same interests as Humboldt’s <title level="m">Pyramide de Cholula</title>. But
               Bullock expands what was previously a squared-off view into one that encircles the
               viewer’s visual field, tying the spectator into the panoramic vista. The dramatic
               effect delimits the space available to exploration as it opens the boundaries of that
               exploration to the edges of the mountains, a possibility that was limited through
               Humboldt’s illustration.</p>
               <p>When Burford receives Bullock’s print, he immediately makes plans to convert the
               image into a large-scale panoramic painting and exhibit it in the Leicester Square
               Panorama in London (Burford and Bullock). By 1820, as European audiences’ desire for
               more exotic spectacles grows stronger, and Burford begins incorporating the works of
               other artists from more distant locales. This is by no means unique to Burford:
               panorama owners frequently declare panoramic exhibitions as a safe and inexpensive
               alternative to international travel (Thomas 17). Bullock’s Mexico City panorama is
               one of many Burford exhibits during the early 1820s, from places as distant as New
               Zealand, India, the Arctic, and the Levant (Hyde). James Chandler and Kevin Gilmartin
               discuss the genesis and role of the panorama (both as a public exhibition and a
               visual system) originating from London and exported, in tandem with the conception of
               the modern metropolis, to other cities (7-10). At the same time, exotic locales in
               general, and Mexico in particular, are central to the formation of the panorama, and
               thus also to the cosmopolitan Londoner whose subjectivity was implicated in the
               panoramic view. As the origin of the panoramic view, London adapts and exports Mexico
               as a panoramic landscape, and thus as a visual mode to be applied to other locales
               (Chandler and Gilmartin 7). As the panoramic view is exported from London, it is
               adapted in two ways: first, to the aforementioned relations between objectivist and
               subjectivist modes of vision during the Romantic period, but second, it is
               problematized and disrupted in tandem with other visual technologies of
               exploration—most specifically, the camera lucida.</p>
               <p> Daston and Galison note that the camera lucida was one of the primary devices used
               in pursuit of mechanical objectivity (119). An artist’s drawing tool consisting of a
               bent lens attached to a metal pole, the device had been theorized in scientific texts
               as early as 1611, but was only re-invented and manufactured on a large scale
               beginning in the early nineteenth century. The camera lucida’s bifocal prism allowed
               the artist to look through the glass and see an external image reflected on drawing
               paper. The camera lucida’s association with scientific mechanical objectivity belies
               its original target audience: amateur artists and domestic users who could take
               advantage of the device’s low cost and supposed ease of use. As a result, the camera
               lucida gains wide popularity after its invention in 1807, but strangely, it occupies
               a marginalized position in the history of nineteenth-century visual practice.
               Jonathan Crary’s foundational <title level="m">Techniques of the Observer</title>,
               for example, never mentions the camera lucida. Celia Lury notes this gap in Crary’s
               account, suggesting that the camera lucida is an equal participant in the new mode of
               visual primacy, but only as an “archaic artisanal practice” (Lury 158). Yet in his
               seminal treatise on photography, <title level="m">Camera Lucida</title>, Roland
               Barthes declares it “a mistake to associate photography, by means of its technical
               origins, with the [. . .] <emph>camera obscura</emph>. It is the <emph>camera
                  lucida</emph> [. . .]” (106). Barthes’ idea will emerge as central to my argument
               later; for now, note the privileged position of the camera obscura in the
               contemporary history of nineteenth-century visual practice, particularly in relation
               to photography. Most discussions of the camera lucida situate it as an antecedent to
               early photographic practices (as opposed to a distinct visual system that impacts
               photography on multiple levels) and/or as a domestic visual tool for aspiring artists
               or scientists. But these two conclusions greatly underestimate the tool’s use and
               importance in Romantic travel and archaeology.</p>
               <p> The work of Frederick Catherwood provides the best case study for the importance of
               the camera lucida. It is in his hands in Mexico that the camera lucida emerges, like
               the panorama and the daguerreotype, as an at once faithful tool and disobedient
               employee. Catherwood’s use of the camera lucida upends the established chronology of
               camera lucida to photography while illustrating the device’s contested genealogies
               and associations with purely scientific or domestic use in the European metropole. In
               1836, Catherwood returns home to Britain after an eight-year stay in Egypt and the
               Levant, and he quickly gains a reputation as one of the finest archaeological travel
               artists in Europe. Catherwood is one of the first professionals to use the camera
               lucida in his work, some thirty years after the device’s invention (Hammond and
               Austin 3). The images produced on his travels, which include large-scale drawings and
               true-to-life schematics of archaeological sites through the Near East, are all
               rendered with the aid of a camera lucida. In fact, Catherwood’s fame rests partly on
               his ability to produce accurate recordings, an ability accentuated by the assistance
               of the camera lucida in his work (Bourbon 26).</p>
               <p> The amount of experience and personal skill required to master the device undermines
               potential claims to the camera lucida as either a domestic or amateur instrument. An
               1809 editorial by R.B. Bate, published in the London-based <title level="j">Journal
                  of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts</title>, speaks to the camera
               lucida’s usefulness for more advanced artists like Catherwood. After a six page
               delineation of the difficulty of working with the camera lucida, including discussing
               the proper placement of the prism, proper posture to allow for effective transverse
               eye movement, and the correct angle at which to tighten the drawing paper, Bate notes
               how the camera lucida will benefit advanced artists as they will <quote>Find a great
                  economy of time, upon extensive and complicated subjects in particular, by using
                  the instrument in determining the situation of so many points as he may deem
                  important; and which the camera lucida is allowed to give ‘with perfect truth and
                  correctness of perspective.’ [. . .] [T]he truth of the reflected image in every
                  circumstance give the camera lucida a decided superiority over all other known
                  contrivances for the same purpose. (Bate 149-150)</quote> This bears repeating:
               “with perfect truth and correctness of perspective.” Anticipating Carlyle’s
               declaration of “truth and clarity,” Bate espouses the camera lucida as an effective
               weapon in the pursuit of mechanical objectivity. The camera lucida’s ability to
               re-create the world-as-image today marks the political stakes of contemporary
               visuality: defined as the system through which, as Nicholas Mirzoeff describes,
               visual subjects and representations are made to seem natural and ordered (<title level="m">The Right to Look</title> 3).</p>
               <p> While in London in 1836, Burford invites Catherwood to construct a panorama of the
               city of Jerusalem, entitled <title level="m">View of the City of Jerusalem</title>,
               based on Catherwood’s camera lucida drawings of the city. Catherwood himself paints
               the details of the image (Bourbon 31). John Lloyd Stephens, in London at the time, is
               immediately taken with Catherwood’s panorama (Bourbon 37). Burford sets up a meeting
               between Catherwood and Stephens, which would be the beginning of a lifelong
               friendship eventually resulting in the first scientific explorations of Central
               America. For Robert Burford, the meeting has a more practical entrepreneurial aspect:
               Burford encourages Catherwood (an architect by trade) to go with Stephens back to New
               York and open up his own panorama that can be used to exhibit Catherwood’s and
               Burford’s drawings (Comment 56). In 1838, Catherwood travels to New York with
               Stephens and opens the Catherwood Panorama at the corner of Prince and Mercer Streets
               in Manhattan. That panorama’s founding comes about as a result of personal exchanges
               from men on both sides of the ocean. Its global variation of exhibited scenes are
               intended as substitutes for world travel for an emerging American metropolitan
               population; in turn, those images are the result of transatlantic movements of visual
               technologies. Here, the visual discourses that define their formal elements remain
               part of an ongoing negotiation of visual concerns set in motion by Márquez
               thirty-four years before in Mexico. At this point, then, discourses of Romantic
               visuality articulated through visual technologies remain unstable in both form and
               content, while oriented both transatlantically and toward the south.</p>
               <p> The grand opening of the panorama with <title level="m">View of Jerusalem</title> is
               a great success. Catherwood’s 1838 advertisement provides a glimpse: “Splendid
               Panorama of Jerusalem, a painting of the largest class, 10,000 square feet, from
               drawings of Mr. Catherwood, brilliantly illuminated every evening by upwards of 200
               gas-lights, admission 25 cents.” On June 23, <title level="j">The New Yorker</title>
               publishes a rave review of the painting: <quote>The most splendid panorama ever
                  exhibited in this country [. . .] the painting of <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> is a masterly production and conveys as perfect an idea of
                  that memorable city as could be acquired by looking upon the real scene[. . .]
                  After gazing for a few moments the illusion becomes complete, and you imagine
                  yourself perched upon the governor’s terrace and looking down upon the narrow
                  streets and massive walls beneath[. . .] [This] reflects great credit upon the
                  taste and enterprise of Mr. Catherwood the proprietor. (“The New
                  Panorama”)</quote> Here, what appears as a seamless marriage between the camera
               lucida and the panorama constitutes the eager American crowds as participants in the
               visual conquest of Jerusalem: travel is now unnecessary since the “ideal” Jerusalem
               already exists in New York. For such an experience, the crowds poured in. Later
               Catherwood and Stephens show three more of Burford’s canvases: <title level="m">Niagara Falls</title>; <title level="m">Lima</title>; and most notably <title level="m">View of the Great Temple of Karnak, and the surrounding city of
                  Thebes</title>, based on Catherwood’s own drawings from Egypt. No panorama
               canvases survive to the present day, but one can reconstruct some of this massive
               painting’s visual impact by examining the illustration in its accompanying guidebook
                  (<ref target="#fig4">Figure 4</ref>). It is clear that during his time in Egypt,
               Catherwood has no intention of creating panoramas for large-scale exhibition. In
                  <title level="m">Karnak</title>, Catherwood’s attention for detail rendering the
               Karnak temple’s architectural features merges with views of the receding Sahara
               desert, here populated with scores of travelers and local Egyptians re-created from
               Catherwood’s drawings. Thus, the tension between panorama and camera lucida, born
               from competing visual concerns among artists, archaeologists, and entrepreneurs in
               Europe and the Near East now appears in the emerging international metropolis of New
               York. But the next year, Catherwood’s unique perspectives would grapple with yet
               another new context: Mexico. There, with Stephens, Catherwood’s artistic production
               in pursuit of mechanical objectivity invites another device, one that generates an
               uneasy relationship with his camera lucida: the daguerreotype.</p>
               <p>When Stephens is appointed Special Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Central
               America in 1839, he uses the opportunity to conduct the first systematic exploration
               of Maya archaeological sites, with Catherwood as his chief artist. Mexico remains an
               historical tabula rasa for Stephens, and one he wants to inscribe with the United
               States’ national and historical imaginary. Stephens supposes that modern Mexicans are
               incapable of preserving Mexican archaeological sites, and remain disconnected from
               the cultures that produced them. He consistently refers to the areas south of the
               United States as “American” and “our country;” terms which serve to bring the Mexican
               material past into United States custodianship (Evans 58). As such, Stephens’ goal,
               with Catherwood at his side, is to utilize objective recording of the landscape to
               produce as many true-to-life visual representations of Mexican sites as possible, and
               in so doing claim them for the United States’ national consciousness. Stephens’ and
               Catherwood’s ability to reproduce that which they saw functioned as a visual conquest
               to bring the pieces to the United States, if only through the politics of display.
               For Stephens, as for the panorama’s visitors, there is no distinction between
               accurate representation and ownership. While utilizing Catherwood’s skill to
               reproduce Maya sites, Stephens plans to purchase and transport the entire Maya city
               of Copán to a “great museum of national museum of American antiquities” (<title level="m">Incidents of Travel in Central America </title>1: 115) as a permanent
               exhibit. The extent to which Stephens would ultimately pursue this goal—giving up
               only in light of massive transportation costs and impractical logistics—speaks
               directly to the correlation between accurate, reproducible visual representation and
               physical ownerships of the objects Stephens and Catherwood seek to represent
               (Patterson 25).</p>
               <p>Together, Stephens and Catherwood conduct two different expeditions to Mexico,
               resulting in the publication of <title level="m">Incidents of Travel in Central
                  America, Chiapas, and Yucatan </title>(1841) and <title level="m">Incidents of
                  Travel in Yucatan</title> (1843). In addition to being travel narratives, both
               books recount how the camera lucida and the daguerreotype repeatedly rebel against
               the desires of their operator, thus ironically rendering visible the unavoidable
               presence of the artist in pursuit of the mechanically-reproduced view. In Mexico,
               Catherwood’s use of the camera lucida begins to frustrate him as he finds Maya
               iconographic designs more complex than what he was accustomed to on his previous
               travels, and so too complex for the naked eye. Catherwood produces a number of
               iconographic studies of Maya works, particularly of memorial stelae (<ref target="#fig5">Figure 5</ref>), and the intricate iconographic programs that
               accompany them. In <title level="m">Incidents of Travel in Central America</title>,
               Stephens notes <quote>[T]he designs were so intricate and complicated, the subjects
                  so entirely new and unintelligible, that [Mr. Catherwood] had great difficulty in
                  drawing [. . .] He had made several attempts, both with the camera lucida and
                  without, but failed to satisfy himself or even me [. . .] The “idol” seemed to
                  defy his art (1: 120).</quote> Thus, at the moment when Stephens and Catherwood
               have gained international recognition for their ability to transport viewers through
               perfectly reproduced images, here both the instrument of mechanical objectivity—the
               camera lucida—and the landscape itself defy their pursuits and render visible their
               own presence and the failed promises of their pursuit. For Catherwood, the Maya world
               requires extended meditation on his place as an artist, whereas previously it was his
               ability to render his own presence invisible in his work that gained him such fame.
               The instrument that had previously been his trustworthy partner now abandons him.
               Following the publication of <title level="m">Incidents of Travel in Central
                  America</title>, Catherwood and Stephens return to Mexico in 1841 armed with what
               they hope is a device to again render the landscape perfectly, what Stephens refers
               to as “the daguerreotype apparatus.”</p>
               <p>Daguerre’s invention, formally announced by the French government in January 1839,
               leads to other inventors claiming similar devices, which only serves to further fuel
               the invention’s popularity (Batchen 34). News and use of the device spreads so
               quickly that in their first expedition of October 1839, Stephens states his regret at
               neglecting to secure a daguerreotype apparatus for their journey, particularly since
               he had sponsored the first open public demonstration of the instrument in New York
               (Newhall 73). Only eighteen months later, Stephens and Catherwood are packing up the
               boxy instrument and transporting it to the Yucatán peninsula for their second Maya
               expedition. Just as prevailing historiographies of photography posit an evolution
               from the camera obscura and camera lucida to photography, Catherwood too hoped
               Daguerre’s machine would solve the problems they encountered with the camera lucida.
               Yet in continued defiance, Stephens and Catherwood encounter myriad difficulties with
               their new instrument. <title level="m">Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</title> is
               filled with frustrated descriptions of the device’s bulkiness, failures, and finicky
               nature. Their first time using the device, Stephens relates how <quote>[. . .] [T]he
                  process was so complicated, and its success depended upon such a variety of minute
                  circumstances, it seemed really wonderful that it ever turned out well. The plate
                  might not be good, or not well cleaned; or the chemicals might not be of the best;
                  or the plate might be left too long in the iodine box, or taken out too soon; or
                  left too long in the bromine box, or taken out too soon; or a ray of light might
                  strike it on putting it into the camera or taking it out; or it might be left too
                  long in the camera or taken out too soon; and even though all these processes were
                  right and regular, there might be some other fault or omission which we were not
                  aware of; besides which, climate and atmosphere had great influence, and might
                  render all to no avail (1: 103-104).</quote> Here, even acknowledging the extent
               to which its success depended on a variety of technological and personal factors, it
               is Stephens’ bafflement at the “climate and atmosphere” of Central America that stand
               out. Though Stephens and Catherwood are armed with a supposedly objective,
               rationalizing, scientific instrument, it is the landscape itself that rebels against
               their efforts at visual conquest. As Stephens’ attempted conquest depends on the
               production of a clear, mechanically-objective view, the daguerreotype fails to
               deliver: even when the image came out correctly, the detail was nowhere near what
               could be captured with a camera lucida. In short, the daguerreotype’s immediate fame
               and supposed technological advancement over earlier techniques matters little in this
               new context. The final straw for the daguerreotype’s use among the Maya ruins comes
               when Stephens and Catherwood are finally able to finish the daguerreotype process
               successfully. Even if everything goes well during the production of the image, the
               quality is such to dissatisfy Catherwood and Stephens. During the recording of
               buildings at Uxmal, <quote>Mr. Catherwood began taking views; but the results were
                  not sufficiently perfect to suit his ideas [. . .] They gave a general idea of the
                  character of the buildings, but would not do to put into the hands of the engraver
                  without copying the views on paper, which would require more labor than that of
                  making at once complete original drawings. He therefore completed everything with
                  his pencil and camera lucida (1: 175).</quote> Catherwood’s images of the
               buildings at Uxmal (<ref target="#fig6">Figure 6</ref>), while showing their
               “character” through the daguerreotype, cannot be accurately rendered to Catherwood’s
               preference. This is an unstable and crucial moment in the history of objectivity and
               the modern visual subject. Less than two years after its invention, in Mexico the
               daguerreotype emerges as an ambivalent and defiant instrument, and occupying an
               ambiguous position in relation to the camera lucida. When fine detail cannot be
               reproduced in a daguerreotype, Catherwood substitutes it for his own camera lucida; a
               device which, less than two years prior, he found similarly insufficient for
               producing records of Maya imagery. Here, Catherwood’s preference for the camera
               lucida is evidence for the destabilization of the camera lucida / photography
               progression, at least in the early years of the apparatus. At the same time, both
               devices function as mutually reinforcing and interchangeable, each one used in
               different contexts for different reasons. Only a short time into their trip, the
               pragmatic pair cease with the daguerreotype for archaeological illustrations
               altogether, using only the camera lucida. But they do not abandon the device: the
               pair set up a makeshift studio in Mérida, which is quickly converted into a local
               portrait studio once word of the machine spreads through the city. Suddenly, the
               daguerreotype—so inappropriate and ill-fitted to the scientific recording of
               archaeological sites—is perfectly suited to producing images of people.</p>
               <p> It is in this small studio in 1841 that the visual interests of Stephens’ and
               Catherwood’s exhibition takes a sharp turn away from a pursuit of objective
               scientific accuracy, as they begin a short career as “ladies' Daguerreotype portrait
               takers” (<title level="m">Incidents of Travel in Yucatan </title> 1: 100). The first
               daguerreotypes produced in the Americas specifically for exhibition (Stephens will
               display many of the images from his studio at the Catherwood Panorama in New York)
               present both subjects and ideologies completely removed from Stephens’ original
               motivation for the trip. This moment in the visual history of the Americas, caught
               amidst Stephen’s imperial project and the daguerreotype-mania that will spread across
               the continent in less than a decade, marks the emergence of a long nineteenth-century
               history of the use of photography in the formulation of personal subjectivities,
               identities, and discourses of (scientific) racism. In <title level="m">Incidents of
                  Travel in Yucatan</title>, Stephens takes great care to recount in detail some of
               the first people to sit for daguerreotype portraits, all of them women: <quote>The
                  young ladies were dressed in their prettiest costume, with earrings and chains,
                  and their hair adorned with flowers. All were pretty, and one was much more
                  pretty; not in the style of the Spanish beauty, with dark eyes and hair, but a
                  delicate and dangerous blonde, simple, natural and unaffected, beautiful without
                  knowing it, and really because she could not help it. Her name, too, was poetry
                  itself (1: 101).</quote> Stephens never reveals the name of the “delicate and
               dangerous” woman, choosing only describe her as she sits for her portrait. It is
               telling and fortuitous that Stephens chooses to describe her in such detail. In
                  <title level="m">Camera Lucida</title>, Roland Barthes notices the tendency to
               transform oneself in front of the camera, remarking how he would “make another body
               for myself, I transform myself in advance into an image” (10). Stephens describes
               this process in terms of the daguerreotype making the woman into an image of her
               bodily arrangement and costuming. He goes on to relay the difficulties encountered in
               this process: <quote>Our first subject was the lady of the poetical name. It was
                  necessary to hold a consultation upon her costume, whether the colors were pretty
                  and such as would be brought out well or not; whether a scarf around the neck was
                  advisable; whether the hair was well arranged, the rose becoming, and in the best
                  position; then to change it, and consider the effect of the change, and to say and
                  do many other things which may suggest themselves in the reader’s imagination, and
                  all of which gave rise to many profound remarks in regard to artistical effect,
                  and occupied much time [. . .] (1: 102-103).</quote> In detailing the woman’s
               appearance, ethnicity and her concern with the presentation of her own costume,
               Stephens alludes to what will emerge in the mid-nineteenth century as a prevailing
               discourse in daguerreotypy: the invention of personal subjectivities as a byproduct
               of photographic practice. Only two decades after Stephens and Catherwood’s trip to
               Mexico, Francis Galton (1822-1911), a British naturalist and polymath, uses composite
               fabrication of portrait photographs to create a series of racialized types in one of
               the first photographic attempts at visual eugenics (Sekula). In 1850, Louis Agassiz
               (1807-1873), doing for the United States what Galton did for Victorian audiences,
               produces a series of daguerreotypes of enslaved persons in Columbia, South Carolina,
               aimed at proving innate racial differences to support his theory of humanity’s
               polygenesis (Wallis). And in the 1860s, Agassiz produces a series of photographs of
               racial hybrids as undeveloped, tropical, degenerate bodies during a research
               expedition to Brazil, with the explicitly anti-Darwinian goal of proving racial
               differences as static, fixed, and climatically variable in line with his polygenetic
               theory (Stepan 85). Thus, the discourse of mechanical objectivity that here acts to
               accurately reproduce the individual subject is soon after taken up by scientists to
               mask their own presence in pursuit of an “objective” hierarchy of mankind.</p>
               <p>While I argue that Stephens’ studio acts as a potential genesis for this discourse,
               there is no evidence that Stephens’ goal was to produce a classification or record of
               racial difference in the Yucatán. His intricate description of the dress of “the lady
               of the poetical name,” and the care with which her portrait was arranged, bears
               little evidence that a racial typology or desire to record was implicit in Stephens’
               thinking. Moreover, it was Stephens himself who found the need to differentiate
               between an accurate, encyclopedic visual record of the archaeological sites he
               discovered in order to situate them inside American national consciousness; versus
               the people now living around them whom he characterized as less than able custodians.
               For whatever reason, Stephens did not emphasize this point by presenting visual
               evidence of U.S. and Mexican racial difference along which to construct a cultural
               hierarchy, much as Galton and Agassiz would do only a few decades later.</p>
               <p>It is difficult to say more regarding Stephens and Catherwood’s photographs of the
               women of Mérida because the daguerreotypes no longer exist. When the pair returns
               from the Yucatán in 1842, they immediately set up an exhibition of their collected
               (or conquered) Maya artifacts, as well as their daguerreotypes, in the Catherwood
               Panorama. Catherwood’s rotunda, like most others at the time, was constructed of wood
               and met its end in an accidental fire on the night of July 31, 1842 (Barger and White
               77). Upon seeing the ruins on the morning of August 1, Stephens writes in <title level="m">Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</title> only that he “had the melancholy
               satisfaction of seeing their ashes exactly as the fire had left them” (1: 103). The
               loss is devastating on both sides of the Atlantic: Catherwood had neglected to take
               out insurance on his building, and Stephens on the artifacts inside, so both lose a
               great deal. Back in London, Burford—still hoping to create an international network
               for his panorama business—is forced to abandon his plans. And the modern record of
               the first daguerreotypes and camera lucida drawings produced in the Yucatán, as well
               as Catherwood’s panoramas, is destroyed.</p>
               <p>Yet this loss may also provide insight into Stephens’ emotional infatuation with both
               his daguerreotype and the unnamed woman who sat for it. In <title level="m">Camera
                  Lucida</title>, Barthes describes in detail a photograph of his mother as a young
               woman, an image he refers to as the “Winter Garden Photograph.” He uses the image to
               posit the existence of two separate qualities inherent in every photograph: the
                  “<foreign>studium</foreign>,” the photograph’s objective contents; and the
                  “<foreign>punctum</foreign>,” that part of the photograph which impacts the viewer
               most forcefully, creating a subjective experience between viewer and image. Barthes
               recognizes the <foreign>punctum</foreign> of his mother’s presence for his own
               experience, and by extension the impossibility of a similar experience for any other
               viewer, so Barthes chooses not to reproduce the image: <quote>I cannot reproduce for
                  you the Winter Garden Photograph. It exists only for me. For you, it would be
                  nothing but an indifferent picture, one of the thousand manifestations of the
                  “ordinary”; it cannot in any way constitute the visible object of a science; it
                  cannot establish an objectivity, in the positive sense of the term; at most it
                  would interest your <title level="m">studium</title>: period, clothes, photogeny;
                  but in it, for you, no wound (73).</quote> It begs the question, given Stephens’
               account of his visual and emotional infatuation with the daguerreotype of the unnamed
               woman, whether this image can “establish an objectivity.” Just like the “Winter
               Garden Photograph,” Stephens’ intimate experience with that image would have been
               accessible only to him, and hint as he may at his emotions, it is fitting that the
               photograph no longer exists. The image’s inaccessibility to, in Barthes’ terms,
               “science” and “objectivity” is insightful given Stephens’ presumed motivation for his
               and Catherwood’s mission to Mexico: the scientific, objective recording of Maya
               archaeological sites through the utilization of visual technologies created for the
               purpose. While, as mentioned previously, daguerreotypes would later be intertwined in
               a history of supposedly scientific, objective human typologizing, they function here
               as the final piece in a long line of foils to Stephens’ and Catherwood’s own
               insistence on the ability of the daguerreotype and the camera lucida to objectively
               record the art and archaeology of the Yucatán.</p>
               <p>While daguerreotypes would later be intertwined in a history of human typologizing,
               they function here as the final piece in a long line of foils to Stephens’ own
               insistence on the ability to accurately record the world. As I have argued, the quest
               to accurately represent Mexican archaeological sites was a complex, multidirectional,
               and often highly contentious process whereby the definition of “accuracy” constantly
               adapted to new frameworks, locations, and visual technologies. While Márquez and
               Humboldt in many ways started this dialogue, Catherwood and Stephens brought it to
               its height with their use of the panorama, camera lucida, and daguerreotype in
               service of their goal of objectivity. Yet far from being their loyal servants, in the
               context of the Yucatán these technologies forced the pair to acknowledge the highly
               subjective nature of their task. The camera lucida continually fought with Catherwood
               in the Yucatán, forcing him to move to the daguerreotype, which in its own defiance
               moved Stephens toward an experience of total subjective personal infatuation in
               contrast to his own stated mission. And when this image is displayed, the wooden
               panorama gives way. Every device Stephens and Catherwood sought to use, from the
               camera lucida to the daguerreotype to the panorama, abandoned them. In the end,
               presented with the pile of ashes of all they had created, Stephens’ words take his
               concern with objectivity and hold on to it, but inside, without image or referent
               beyond emotional reaction: “I had the melancholy satisfaction of seeing their ashes
               exactly as the fire had left them.”</p>
               <p>In presenting this series of contested technological genealogies and travel accounts,
               my goal has been twofold: to argue that visual technologies, long marginalized in
               discussions of Romantic travel, should occupy primary importance in that discourse;
               and second, that these technologies and their role in the evolving discourse of
               visuality emerges principally in areas located outside the historical West. The
               evidence for this was multifaceted. First, I showed that visual technologies act as
               mediators between desires to convey subjective experience versus objective knowledge
               and their presentation in visual media—an assertion that disrupts characterizations
               of linear evolutionary development in visual technologies during this period. For
               Catherwood, the use of the camera lucida is the culmination of a burgeoning
               intellectual exchange system that values scientifically accurate representation in
               tandem with Romantic picturesque aesthetics, both of which come together in Burford’s
               panoramas. And the daguerreotype, alternately viewed by Batchen and Crary as a
               descendant of the camera obscura or a device to supplant the camera lucida, here
               functions simultaneously as inadequate for mechanical objectivity and valuable enough
               to produce images of subjective emotional power. But the meditative power given to
               these technologies led to my second point, that these technologies are powerful
               agents that render visible the artifice of both mechanical objectivity and visuality.
               Catherwood’s frustrations with the camera lucida in Mexico, Stephens’
               characterizations of the perils of daguerreotypy, and the pair’s adaptation of the
               daguerreotype to a new context all speak to this. Finally, I sought to illustrate the
               inability of a center/periphery model of cultural and intellectual diffusion to
               account for the proliferation of images of Mexican history and archaeology in the
               Atlantic world during the early nineteenth century. Though all these technologies
               were “invented” in Europe, this fixation on geographic origin belies a transatlantic
               and southern-oriented genesis for the constitution and construction of visual
               technologies, Romantic visualities, objectivity, and the rise of the visual
               subject.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores questions related to the representation of history and
                  actuality at the popular panoramas of the early nineteenth century, drawing on at
                  least two meanings of the term “actuality”: its reference to existing objective
                  fact, and to realism in representation. It focuses on London and Paris, key cities
                  for the development of the panorama as a form of urban representation, as both
                  sites and subjects for exhibition. At the center, however, of this confluence of
                  place, event, and panoramic illusion making, is an examination of the popularity
                  of Paris as a subject at the panoramas of London. A range of complex factors
                  contributed to its prominence, from the city’s architectural beauty and urban
                  sophistication, to the fear and anxiety it aroused—for political reasons—in
                  English observers. Not surprisingly, many representations of Paris coincided with
                  periods of war or revolution. For example, in 1802 and 1803, during the Napoleonic
                  wars, at least two pictures of Paris were on display in London; in 1814, the
                  battle of Paris was shown at Leicester Square; and as Richard Altick elaborates,
                  the three-day revolt of 1830 was represented at the Queen’s Bazaar in 1832, in the
                  form of “eight grand diorama views, painted on many thousand feet of canvas”
                  (179). Also in 1832, the Diorama presented a view of Paris from Montmartre, and in
                  1848, the “Colosseum” in Regent’s Park opened a showing of Paris by night, at the
                  very moment the city was in the grip of revolution. Foreign cities were popular
                  subjects at the panoramas generally, but the representations of Paris are
                  instructive because of the strong connection they make between scene and event,
                  and for what this connection tells us about the descriptive procedures of the
                  panorama as a form.</p>
                  <p>While this special consideration of Paris offers a model for thinking more widely
                  about the relationship between the Romantic viewer and urban experience, it also
                  allows us to address larger questions related to the problematic status as well as
                  the popular appeal of both historical and contemporary events, as subjects for the
                  panorama—subjects that engaged a powerful desire to see and know things as they
                  are (or were), while necessitating an equally powerful element of illusory
                  representation. In addition to assessing the panorama as a popular entertainment,
                  with special links to the city as both context and subject, this paper will
                  explore the ideological inflection of representations of Paris in London, and link
                  these to the importance of the panorama as a medium for conveying certain kinds of
                  visual—and historical—knowledge. None of these vast rolls of painted canvas
                  survive, however, and what we must principally examine are the printed
                  explanations that accompanied the exhibitions (which generally included a
                  small-scale key map or drawing), and contemporary notices and reviews. There is
                  thus an additional element to include here that is often overlooked in discussions
                  of the panorama, namely the relationship between the visual representation and the
                  written text. These interdependent regimes of description bear in revealing ways
                  on the effectiveness of the panorama as a medium for the representation of history
                  in the making, while pointing to the tension in the very medium of the panorama
                  between documentary and spectacular realism. </p>
                  <p>The term “panorama” now has a broad range of meanings, from “an unbroken view of
                  the whole region surrounding an observer” to “a comprehensive survey or
                  presentation of a subject” (<title level="m">OED</title>). More metaphorically
                  still, the term can refer to “a continuously passing scene; a mental vision in
                  which a series of images passes before the mind’s eye.” That these meanings, taken
                  together, suggest an alignment of perception, knowledge, and imagination, is far
                  from accidental given their source in the “Panorama,” a form of visual spectacle
                  that presented, in full circular form, a three-hundred and sixty degree view of
                  its subject. The invention of an Irish painter, Robert Barker (1739-1806), who
                  referred to it in his 1787 patent as “<emph>La Nature à Coup d’Oeil</emph>”
                  (nature at a glance, or view at a glance), it aimed to offer an “all embracing
                  view,” and simulate the experience of being “on the very spot.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The patent is reproduced, in excerpts, in an
                     exhibition catalogue for the centennial of the Mesdag Panorama (see Fruitema
                     and Zoetmulder 13-14).</note> Barker’s patent included details about the
                  structure and layout of the building, specifying that it should be circular,
                  top-lit, and with a central viewing area normally entered from below, so as not to
                  obstruct the illusion. These details are clearly visible in the cross-section of
                  the Leicester Square rotunda (<ref target="#fig1">figure 1</ref>) prepared by
                  Robert Mitchell, the building’s architect. Great lengths were taken to conceal any
                  visual borders or frames, not only around the circular interior walls, but also at
                  the level of floor and ceiling, where the sky seemed to disappear behind the upper
                  canopy or roof of the viewing area. In the roof of the rotunda, a velum, or
                  umbrella-like ceiling, concealed a large glass opening that lit the painting with
                  diffuse natural light, which appeared to emanate from the view.</p>
                  <p>The strength of the illusion depended on other factors too. Apart from strict
                  fidelity to documentary detail, the creators took steps to dissociate viewers from
                  external reference points, and to induce disorientation to a degree that would
                  heighten their receptivity to the illusion. To that end, visitors would enter
                  through winding stairways and/or dark passageways, which, by dilating the pupils,
                  would also augment the first impression upon entering the lit viewing area.
                  Viewers experienced disorientation and visual disturbance for other reasons, which
                  also enhanced the power of the illusion: one, for example, was the difference
                  between the represented distance of the painted scene—the illusion of depth of
                  field—and the relative proximity to the viewer of the painted wall. Another was
                  the sheer profusion of visual detail, which surrounded the viewer completely, and
                  undermined any single, stable viewpoint. This surfeit, and the inherently
                  excessive and absorbing nature of the illusion, were the very things that made the
                  panorama so sensational, if occasionally more than a little unsettling.</p>
                  <p>The most popular subjects of the panoramas of Barker, his successors, and his
                  competitors, right through the nineteenth century, included grand or imposing
                  landscapes (such as the Swiss Alps or the Bay of Naples) and cities of particular
                  cultural or historic note, such as Rome, Venice, Palermo, Pompeii, Athens, and
                  Constantinople. Some were clearly associated with the Grand Tour, and in these
                  cases the familiarity of those places made them appealing, particularly if
                  visitors could relive earlier experiences in memory. In both landscape and city
                  categories, conversely, far-flung, exotic locales (such as Calcutta, Cairo, Rio de
                  Janeiro, or the Arctic), where spectators were unlikely ever to travel themselves,
                  exerted a strong pull. Important contemporary events were also extraordinarily
                  popular at the panorama, particularly wars, where battles and naval scenes clearly
                  fed nationalist interest (for example, the battles of the Nile, of Copenhagen,
                  Salamanca, Vittoria, Moscow, and Navarino).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a good overview of the popularity—and challenges—of
                     represented battle scenes, see Griffiths 48-55. One should note here that the
                     development of the panorama as a technology had an explicit military
                     connection. Barker enjoyed the financial backing of Lord Elcho, who had an
                     interest in how panoramic representations of topography could be a useful aid
                     to military strategy; and Barker was himself a draughtsman “who taught
                     perspective drawing as a technique for military reconnaissance” (Grau 366-67).
                     Barker’s panoramas have also been understood as very closely related to the
                     forces of British imperialism, for which they helped shape a supportive public.
                     See particularly Denise Blake Oleksijczuk’s terrific recent study, which
                     investigates how “changes in the Panorama’s form and subject matter began to
                     strategically solicit the active participation of its spectators in ways that
                     helped naturalize Britain’s imperialist goals” (7).</note> According to William
                  Galperin, the various engagements of the Napoleonic wars made up close to half of
                  the Panorama’s subjects until well into the 1820s (43). Robert Burford, who took
                  over the Leicester Square Panorama in the late 1820s, was said to have chronicled
                  his times on canvas, often bringing events to the public within months of their
                  occurrence (Eekelen 19). What the panorama could offer was not simply the
                  enticement of an impressively realistic visual display, but direct knowledge of
                  places and historical events otherwise inaccessible to sight or understanding—not
                  just the promise of seeing, then, but also of gaining insight from the broader
                  viewpoint that “panoramic” vision affords.</p>

                  <p>London and Paris were both important cities for the development of the panorama as
                  a form of urban representation: both had a population base substantial enough to
                  support several rotundas, underscoring the close link between the panorama and the
                  modern metropolis.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See della
                     Dora 302. By the last third of the nineteenth century, Paris was, Bernard
                     Comment says, “the capital of the panorama” (67). It is important to note,
                     however—and this argument is made by James Chandler and Kevin Gilmartin in
                     their introduction to the essays in <title level="m">Romantic
                        Metropolis</title>—that what is often seen as the Parisian basis for a link
                     between the panorama and the Romantic “cityscape” in the nineteenth century
                     (particularly after Benjamin’s work on the subject), is in fact established
                     first in London, where a new metropolitanism emerges with the entertainment
                     culture spearheaded by Barker’s panorama in the 1790s (5-8).</note> Both
                  cities, interestingly, featured panoramic representations of themselves among the
                  very first productions to be displayed, thus revealing the possibilities for
                  self-representation to be a particularly strong attraction of the form. Barker’s
                  “View at a glance of the Cities of London and Westminster” went on display in June
                  of 1791, in a temporary rotunda near Leicester Square; a larger version of the
                  view of “London” was mounted in the upper circle of Barker’s new purpose-built
                  rotunda in 1795. This view was taken from the top of Albion Mill, Blackfriars—a
                  viewpoint that, although industrial in nature, included the peripheral
                  countryside, and important city buildings, as well as the local activity along the
                  river Thames.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Where, as
                     Peter Otto points out, well over a hundred vessels were visible (40). Frederick
                     Birnie’s series of commemorative aquatints based on Barker’s panorama that
                     effectively recreate its scope—at once orderly and dynamic—is reproduced in
                     colour in Hyde, <title level="m">Panoramania!</title>, and can be consulted in
                     Otto, who discusses it at length. See also the extensive discussion of this
                     panorama in Markman Ellis.</note> The mill, as the highest point then existing
                  along the south bank of the Thames, and at the foot of its newest bridge, was a
                  spectacle in its own right (see Ellis 139). In Paris, meanwhile, the very first
                  French panorama was a view from the pavilion in the garden of the Tuileries
                  (Oettermann 143f). Making use of this vantage point—historically the residence of
                  the Kings of France—effectively created a new mode of looking by which, as
                  François Robichon points out, “all citizens could literally dominate the city”
                  (83). Commentators have speculated about the extent to which the panoramas of
                  “home,” in contrast to those of more exotic and distant locales, may have given
                  pleasure precisely because they allowed for a re-appropriation of places from
                  which residents had come to feel increasingly alienated.</p>
                  <p> A great many cities and towns, in fact, inaugurated their panoramas with views of
                  themselves, and Bernard Comment argues that for most viewers, these self-mirroring
                  displays were less about an experience of “aesthetic gratification” than to
                  entertain the “more precious illusion that they were masters of the world, of
                  collective space; in the panorama, a city was a calm configuration arranged around
                  the spectators; they thus were able to re-appropriate the town which, when they
                  were in it, always gave them the impression that they were lost” (Comment 136).
                  This “compensatory or atoning” role was primarily a feature of panoramas in large
                  urban centers like Paris and London, which both experienced substantial geographic
                  and demographic expansion (137-8). It was less a feature of smaller centers, such
                  as Berlin, where the inaugural panorama of “Berlin” was not especially popular, or
                  indeed Hamburg, where a critic wondered why, really, the inhabitants should “feel
                  compelled to go to a rotunda in order to gaze at a view they could quite easily
                  see from their kitchens” (138).</p>
                  <p> In the case of the larger metropolis, however, the panorama also served to
                  idealize urban scenes that industrialization was rendering unsavoury. One way it
                  did this was by making the countryside within the city, its green spaces, more
                  visible. The other was by highlighting the presence of the countryside around the
                  city, as a kind of natural perimeter or frame that restored a balance between
                  urban and rural, the close-up and the distant. This view of the city was “new and
                  improved,” but of course idealized; paradoxically, Comment argues, this scene
                  “compensated for the crowd’s feeling of alienation while reinforcing that
                  alienation by creating illusions that were false” (137). Moreover, in addition to
                  how the balance of nature was restored beyond and within the city, the panorama
                  “remade” the urban fabric of the city as a natural landscape. The panorama, as
                  Walter Benjamin noted, represents the attempt of the city dweller “to bring the
                  countryside into town”: in this way the city “opens out to landscape” (6).
                  Certainly in successful panoramas such as Horner’s representation of London, taken
                  from the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral and displayed in the Regent’s Park Colosseum
                  in 1829 (<ref target="#fig2">figure 2</ref>), the sprawling metropolis could be
                  marshalled into view <emph>like</emph> a landscape. As Roland Barthes points out,
                  the belvedere normally offers a lookout upon a particularly fine view of nature.
                  In the case of a viewpoint from something like the Eiffel Tower, or indeed a
                  panorama, the city is made into nature: the swarming of men becomes a landscape,
                  where what is at stake is a “new Nature, that of human space” (Barthes, “Eiffel
                  Tower” 241).</p>
                  <p> Meanwhile, the panorama was clearly a place where the illusion of command, the
                  logic of superiority and compensation, was fundamentally undermined by the
                  immersive and detailed nature of the “all-embracing” view, by the sheer
                  multiplicity of places to look. Comment suggests that panoramas were appealing
                  because of this mixture of feelings in the viewer, from dominance on the one hand
                  to dissolution on the other (138). A similar dynamic is also elaborated in
                  Barthes’ essay on the Eiffel Tower. With the bird’s-eye viewpoint spreading the
                  world before us like a text, the “bliss of altitude” is experienced alongside an
                  active desire to decipher (244); in effect, the dream-like and the documentary
                  features of the view exert a double pull. For Barthes, the proliferation of sights
                  characteristic of “panoramic vision” engages our powers of intellection: the world
                  before, beneath and around us must be <emph>read</emph> as much as perceived. Thus
                  a new sensibility of vision arises. Where once we were immersed in sensation,
                  “thrust in the midst” of urban experience, the new architecture of vision created
                  by towers (and aviation), for example, allows us to “transcend sensation and to
                  see things <emph>in their structure</emph>” (242).</p>
                  <p>Yet looking at Paris, for example, from the heights of the Eiffel Tower involves a
                  struggle between knowledge and perception, as the elements before the viewer (the
                  sensations he or she directly experiences) combine with memory to create a
                  simulacrum of place in the mind: “the elements are in front of you, real,
                  ancestral, but nonetheless disoriented by the total space in which they are given
                  to you, for this space was [previously] unknown to you” (243). Thus we begin to
                  appreciate the dialectical quality of panoramic vision: “euphoric”—yet also in
                  need of active de-coding. The panoramic vision of the Panorama is, however, both
                  like and unlike the view of the known city from the tower-top, since the
                  viewpoints at the panorama were more various in terms of elevation; some scenes
                  were indeed represented from great height, but the panorama in general also aimed
                  at surrounding its viewers and thereby immersing them. It placed them both above
                  and within the view, offering to their eyes a rationalized landscape that was
                  perceptibly contained and structured, but which could only be experienced
                  piece-meal and irrationally. Panoramas were, moreover, <emph>indoor</emph>
                  exhibitions of the outdoors. In terms of urban space, this creates an additional
                  fold: as Benjamin reflects in <title level="m">The Arcades Project</title>, “the
                  interest of the panorama is in seeing the true city—the city indoors” (532).</p>
                  <p>Horner’s 1829 panorama of London, in which, as <ref target="#fig2">figure 2</ref>
                  shows, the city stretches away below a viewpoint situated on top of St. Paul’s
                  Cathedral, is a good example of these features of the panorama, and of “panoramic
                  vision” broadly understood. During a period of restorative work on the bell tower
                  in 1822-24, Horner had been able to spend many months on scaffolding erected at
                  the very top of the cathedral, producing some 2000 detailed sketches. The accuracy
                  was enhanced by Horner’s practice of verifying the actual disposition and details
                  of buildings, streets and squares, by subsequently visiting them all on foot.
                  Horner installed telescopes on the viewing platform precisely so that those tiny
                  particulars, invisible at such distance to the naked eye, might be duly
                  appreciated. So effective was this that some visitors, while straining to locate
                  their own addresses, maintained that the miniscule people depicted in the streets
                  and squares actually moved. In the cross-sectional view offered by the 1829
                  lithograph, in which we see the upper part of the pavilion from a painter’s
                  platform suspended from the roof ridge, the illusion and its mechanism—the
                  “interior” and “exterior” of the representation, so to speak—co-exist. The
                  simulation of London is seen as though from the dome of St. Paul’s, complete with
                  simulated scaffolding. This panoramic simulacrum, intriguingly, did not include
                  the Colosseum itself, since it had not been built at the time the sketches were
                  made. However, visitors to Horner’s Colosseum could round out their visit by
                  ascending a stairway to an open air gallery at the very top of the rotunda, which
                  offered a view—outdoors—of London, including of course the prominent domes of the
                  actual St. Paul’s (see Altick 141-50 and Otto 283-92).</p>
                  <p>The perspectival snapshot of the Colosseum captured in Ackermann’s lithograph
                  shows roughly one-quarter of the whole panorama, a portion in which London
                  disappears suggestively to the west along the Thames, from a stable viewpoint.
                  Nevertheless, it hints at the Barthesian “bliss of altitude,” and the sublime
                  effect of both surfeit and surround, at their fullest extent. While the urban
                  landscape has been undeniably naturalized, the relationship between the Romantic
                  viewer and urban experience is predicated here on the powerful place of the city,
                  of one’s <emph>own</emph> city, at the panorama. Arguably, the act of “self”
                  representation involved in exhibiting “London” for Londoners, or “Paris” for
                  Parisians, emphasizes the mimetic as well as documentary nature of the panorama,
                  and particularly underscores the circuitous relationship of the illusory (the
                  imaginary, the euphoric) to the real: the tension between the dream-like space of
                  the panorama, and the “actual” world it depicted. The pull of panoramic images
                  between these poles also comes across in contemporary reviews, where their power
                  to transport the viewer is invariably celebrated. And yet, the recreation of the
                  actual, the historical, at the panorama, problematically engages both a powerful
                  desire to see and know things <emph>as they are</emph>—or were—and displays the
                  fundamental instability inherent in the illusory nature of the representation.</p>

                  <head>Viewing Paris in London</head>
                  <p> Paris was of particular interest to panorama-goers in the early nineteenth
                  century because it crossed at least two categories of popular appeal. Not only was
                  it remarkable for its qualities as a city, in architectural and cultural terms,
                  but it was also the scene of extraordinary political and social upheaval: the
                  scene of history in the making. On the first point, the pamphlets that accompany
                  the panoramas promoted it as “the most splendid and luxurious of modern cities”;
                  it is: <quote>[. . .] universally acknowledged to be one of the largest and finest
                     cities of Europe. In the number and splendour of its public edifices it is
                     unrivalled. Its national establishments of Learning and Science, magnificent
                     Museums and Cabinets of the arts, and vast collected stores of human knowledge
                     in the extensive libraries, have rendered it the admiration of the world.
                     (“Description” 1829: 3) </quote> While the hyperbolic rhetoric is typical of
                  the tracts, of more interest is how they play up the appeal of Paris as a
                  “theatre” of action, and by 1848 the opening preamble adds the observation that
                  “the extraordinary and unexpected political and social change that has just been
                  achieved, has placed Paris prominently before the whole world; and the striking
                  events that each day develops, invests it with a peculiar and absorbing interest”
                  (“Description” 1848: 3). The simultaneous emergence in the late eighteenth century
                  of the panorama and the French Revolution is of more than passing interest, and we
                  may understandably look to panoramic representations of Paris, as shown in London,
                  for indications of how British onlookers chose to regard the French capital during
                  the years that followed.</p>
                  <p>Henry Aston Barker’s “View of Paris, from Montmartre,” which he exhibited at his
                  Panorama in the Strand in 1814 (<ref target="#fig3">figure 3</ref>), was one of a
                  clutch of exhibitions that followed the [first] defeat of Napoleon by Allied
                  forces; it thus capitalized on both intense public interest and freer access to
                  the city. The explanation tells us that: <quote>[T]he View was taken by Mr. Barker
                     in the month of May, when the Allied Armies held possession of the Barriers,
                     and the Heights commanding the City; and, though there were some years since
                     two Views of the interior of Paris exhibited by his late Father, he hopes this
                     general View will be acceptable to the Public. (“Explanation” 1814: 3) </quote>
                  Montmartre of course offers an excellent “general view” of the city, and is, as
                  Barker points out, “in itself the most picturesque of the Heights, as well as the
                  nearest.” Few visitors leave Paris, he notes, “without visiting Montmartre, to
                  take a view of the City and Country from that eminence, which commands the whole.”
                  Not only is the London panorama-goer following explicitly in the footsteps of the
                  continental tourist, he or she is situated in a position of “command” that, in
                  this instance, has military resonance. </p>
                  <p> As the eye—or rather the pen—of the describer (for this is after all the
                  accompanying text that we examine) sweeps across Paris and its surrounding
                  countryside, things are detailed in the order of their encounter. This makes for a
                  miscellaneous sounding array of sights that takes the form at times of a
                  perfunctory list. Items include, for example, (No. 2) “Two Plots of Ground on
                  which the Cossacks bivouacked for a few nights after the capitulation of Paris.
                  People are represented raking the straw off one of them: the other was set fire
                  to” (4). Or, (No. 3), “The Heights of Belleville and Romainville, where the
                  severest of the late battle was fought” (4). Clearly these are sites of interest
                  primarily because of their links to recent events; other sites are noted, one
                  suspects, simply because they are encompassed by the view and draw the viewer’s
                  attention, such as the new slaughter-houses “built by order of Bonaparte.” Still
                  others are more mediated sights, such as the cathedral of Notre Dame, or the
                  former Church of St. Geneviève—“the finest in Paris”—that has now become the
                  Pantheon, “converted, during the Revolution into a grand Mausoleum for great men
                  who deserve the honours of their country; and to receive their statues, monuments,
                  &amp;c.” The pamphlet reports that “All attributes of a church have been removed;
                  and a new pavement of marble was nearly completed before Bonaparte lost his power”
                  (5).</p>
                  <p> Many of the buildings chosen for description are related in some way to recent
                  history (the Place de la Concorde inevitably arouses the reflection that this was
                  where “the unfortunate Louis the Sixteenth and his Queen were beheaded” [8]), or
                  connected to some longstanding military or governmental purpose. There is, for
                  example, a particularly lengthy description of Les Invalides—the Hospital of
                  Invalids, that “noble edifice [that was] one of the many great works of Louis the
                  Fourteenth” (7). Napoleon’s extensive public building works, from bridges to
                  monuments, also receive considerable attention (“Paris abounds with new public
                  buildings, some of which are just began, others half built, and some nearly
                  completed” [9]), such as new barracks, new palaces, the new Legislative Assembly.
                  The extensions to the Louvre are pointed out, as is the nearby Triumphal Column
                  “erected by order of Bonaparte in honour of the Grand Army and the Campaign of
                  1805, which terminated in the conquest of Germany in three months.” This column,
                  an imitation of Trajan’s column in Rome, sported a 10-foot statue of Napoleon,
                  which was removed by the Allied forces upon their arrival in Paris—and replaced by
                  a flag-pole upon which the “Royal Standard” was hoisted. None of this information
                  is as neutral, none of these appearances as natural, as the descriptive prose of
                  the pamphlet might as first sight suggest.</p>
                  <p> The signs of recent history are everywhere visible in this panorama of Paris and
                  its environs, in traces of unfinished monuments, such as a Temple of Victory, of
                  which only the stumps remain (an ironic case that suggestively blurs the line
                  between a ruin and something under construction). The more egregious erasures and
                  alterations are not visible, and most viewers would require the supplementation of
                  the text, which takes obvious pains to spell these out. It is also necessary at
                  times for the description to clarify certain elements within the view that are
                  particularly contingent, or at least not self-evident. One of the final items
                  catalogued here are the city walls, which the viewer may trace in the distance,
                  and outer roads, where “the Cossacks and other troops of the allied armies are
                  represented parading about, [. . .] as they frequently did at the time the View
                  was taken” (10-11). The nationalist inflection of this account comes out
                  unambiguously in the further observation that these troops “observed the strictest
                  discipline” and committed comparatively few depredations: “according to every
                  appearance, no great army, possessing themselves of an enemy’s capital, ever
                  behaved better” (11). Like most media reports, the tracts take few pains to
                  conceal their ideological agenda.</p>
                  <p> The following year (1815), again at his panorama in the Strand, Barker exhibited
                  another view of Paris. The view this time was of “The Interior of the City of
                  Paris,” and was taken “from the end of the Palace of the Tuileries next to the
                  river, and varies considerably from all the views that have hitherto been painted
                  of that city” (“Explanation” 1815: 3). The accompanying description details the
                  buildings, bridges and monuments that occupy the more central parts of the city
                  with occasional references to outlying areas, such as to “the Bute de Chaumont,
                  where the severest of the late battle was fought” (4), or to the heights of
                  Montmartre, “the subject of the last Painting exhibited in England” (12). There
                  are however fewer references to recent revolutionary events—and rather more to the
                  presence of the restored monarchy. For example, the description of the triumphal
                  arch that was erected to commemorate (along with the triumphal column) the
                  campaign of 1805 mentions that “[p]revious to the surrender of Paris to the
                  allies, there were inscriptions in raised letters, gilt, descriptive of the
                  campaign, on marble tablets in the upper part of each side and end, but they were
                  cut off, and the marble left smooth.” Some pieces of history, then, have once
                  again been subtracted; others meanwhile, have been added, for the panorama depicts
                  the coach of “his majesty Louis XVIIIth [. . .] having passed through the arch,
                  [while] her royal highness the duchess d’Angoulème is on the other side, just
                  entering” (5-6).</p>
                  <p> Two further panoramas of Paris were shown in London, in 1829 and 1848, either
                  during or on the eve of revolutions in the French capital, and thus at moments of
                  particular historical interest. In 1848, in addition to the depiction at the
                  Panorama, the Colosseum in Regent’s Park exhibited a dramatic view of Paris by
                  night, under moonlight. Underscoring this topicality, the <title level="j">London
                     Illustrated News</title> commented that “[a]ll the points where barricades were
                  erected in the June insurrection, and where the carnage was hottest, are clearly
                  indicated, thus giving a greater degree of historical interest to this great
                  picture” (Altick 179). Both of the later panoramas were keen to capitalize on
                  precisely this kind of appeal. Although much of the descriptive language is
                  recycled from one text to another other, a pattern of interests clearly emerges, a
                  set of preoccupations shared with the earlier panoramas that underscore both the
                  difficulties as well as the attractions of seizing and representing the scene of
                  “actuality.” Like the earlier panoramas, these perform an uncertainty about where
                  history can be articulated and thus situated: in the text or on the walls, in the
                  details or in the key diagram that puts them in their place.</p>
                  <p> With each further panoramic representation, and each subsequent revolution, comes
                  greater opportunity for presenting, at least in the accompanying text, a broad
                  political and historical panorama underlining the relationship between place and
                  event, both distant and recent. The choice of location in these later cases offers
                  a vantage point over a period of successive revolutions in France, to which the
                  descriptions explicitly refer, with occasional reference to earlier periods and
                  events sketched in as part of the wider backdrop. Both the 1829 and 1848 panoramas
                  choose as their viewpoint the “Place Louis XVI”: <quote>The view from the Place
                     Louis XVI, from whence the present Panorama was taken, is of the most grand and
                     picturesque description; and, although it presents but a small portion of the
                     numerous works of art which the City contains, yet, whichever way the spectator
                     turns, some object of peculiar interest claims attention by its architectural
                     effect, or by the remembrance of the singular events of which it has been the
                     theatre” (1829: 3).</quote> This language turns up again, more-or-less
                  verbatim, in the 1848 description, which positions the viewer (again in the Place)
                  between the Tuileries and the Champs Elysées, with the Seine along the south, and
                  the “magnificent structures of the Grande Meuble and the Rue Royale” along the
                  north (see <ref target="#fig4">figure 4</ref>). The bridge of Louis XVI crosses
                  here to the Chambre des Deputées. The viewer can look along the banks of the river
                  towards the more ancient part of the city, such as “the towers of Notre Dame,
                  gloomy and dark as the age in which they were built.” Also visible are “the more
                  modern domes of the Palace of the Fine Arts, St. Geneviève, and l’Hôpital des
                  Invalides.” On the east side, the view takes in the gardens and part of the palace
                  of the Tuileries, and in the other direction, the fresh and inviting vistas of the
                  Champs Elysées. Thus is combined, “in one noble and interesting <foreign>coup
                     d’oeil</foreign>, the various beauties of architecture, sculpture, and
                  gardening” (1829: 3). The 1848 notes add to this a brief description of how the
                  “Place de la Concorde, now called Place de la Révolution,” is one of the world’s
                  finest—how for a spectator standing at its centre, it offers (yet again) “one of
                  the finest <foreign>coups d’oeils</foreign> imaginable—its cardinal points being
                  bounded by four of the most splendid buildings in the city” (1848: 4). Not only
                  does the fabric of the city thus coincide harmoniously with its history, it also
                  conveniently meets the spatial and aesthetic requirements of the panorama. </p>
                  <p>In the text accompanying the 1848 exhibition, a politico-historical survey
                  follows, including a brief description of the reign of Louis XVI (“when the city
                  became the scene of the most alarming and sanguinary disorders” [5]), and of
                  Napoleon’s reign, with its support of the arts and public works. The very first
                  item is the “Place Louis XVI” itself, which is described in detail and at length,
                  primarily because of its potent historical associations. Some attention is devoted
                  to its early history, and to the celebration held there in 1770 for the marriage
                  of the Dauphin and Marie Antoinette, but the principle focus is the centrality of
                  this site in the history of the French Revolution. The text for 1848 is more
                  expansive on this point: <quote>One of the first symptoms of the great revolution
                     displayed itself in this place, a riotous mob who were parading round the
                     statue with busts of the Duke of Orleans, Necker &amp;c., were charged by the
                     Royal Guard and several killed. Two days later, the Bastille was destroyed. In
                     August 1792 the Legislative Assembly ordered the destruction of the statue of
                     Louis XV and a plaster figure of Liberty to be erected on the pedestal; the
                     name of the place was also altered to the Place de la Révolution. At the foot
                     of this statue, which was of colossal size, the Sainte Guillotine was erected,
                     which for a long period was daily spilling some of the best and noblest blood
                     of France. (1848: 12)</quote> We are subsequently informed that in 1800, when
                  the figure of Liberty was removed and the first stone of an unfinished triumphal
                  column laid by Lucien Bonaparte, the place was renamed Place de la Concorde. At
                  the time of the restoration, it was renamed Place Louis XVI; in 1830, it became
                  again Place de la Concorde, and in February 1848, also for the second time, Place
                  de la Révolution. The changes of name accompanying these events are of course
                  “invisible” to viewers of the scene in the present, and spelling this out is a
                  supplementary task that falls to the written tract. </p>
                  <p>Another key site subject to successive changes of name and purpose is the Church
                  of St. Geneviève. The 1814 panorama of Paris, discussed above, offered an account
                  of its transformation into the Pantheon. That history is rehearsed again under
                  item number 23 in the 1829 description, which offers a detailed account of the
                  church’s features and construction—its consecration by the National Assembly in
                  1791 for the burial of the illustrious (Mirabeau, Voltaire, Rousseau, Marat), its
                  re-consecration in 1822 for “divine service” by the archbishop of Paris. Now,
                  “most of the illustrious remains have been removed, and it is intended to remove
                  them all” (1829: 11). Typically, an apparently trite detail is added, that
                  (literally) signals the currency of the view: “This building has cost upwards of
                  two millions sterling.” Yet another such site is the Palace of the Tuileries; item
                  no. 16 in the 1848 description asserts that “the history of the revolution has the
                  Tuileries inscribed on almost every page” (1848: 9). At issue here, though, is not
                  so much a change of name as of occupants. In the wake of the events of 1792, the
                  palace would become the residence of Napoleon, and then of the restored royal
                  family. It would be subject to attack and occupation by the populace in 1830.
                  Finally “in February last [it] was, for the third time, [. . .] sacked of
                  everything appertaining to royalty” (1848: 9).</p>
                  <p>A combination of scene and event is implicit throughout both the 1829 and 1848
                  accompanying descriptions, where the historical surveys include anecdotes from the
                  revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, and indeed from successive restorations. “In
                  1830, Paris was again thrown into great disorder by another important revolution,
                  altogether, however, of a very different character; during the three days of July,
                  which it continued, from five to six thousand persons were killed, the royal
                  family deposed, and fled, and Louis Philippe raised to the crown” (5). Certainly,
                  by 1848, there was sufficient distance, temporally speaking, to make such a survey
                  or “panorama” possible. The events of 1848 were themselves deemed “so generally
                  known, that they do not require even a passing notice here” (1848: 6), although it
                  is explained that “in the present year, Paris has, for the third time in little
                  more than half a century, been the scene of yet another even more extraordinary
                  revolution—one indeed without parallel in history—the most bloodless, yet the most
                  complete, of modern times,” a revolution in which by “the spontaneous
                  unpremeditated act of the unarmed population of Paris” the king “was suddenly
                  dashed from his throne [. . .]” (5-6). </p>
                  <p>In addition, however, to offering a certain, rather fixed, historical perspective
                  (and indeed, in the descriptive texts, much detailed historical accounting), the
                  panoramas also took steps to include the representation of a contemporary event—an
                  element of the “present” moment. In the 1829 exhibition, for example, the
                  attention of viewers is drawn to the Champs Elysées (no. 2). There follows a
                  lengthy account of how it came into being, with reference to the Cossack and
                  British encampments of troops there in 1814-15. More interesting, however, is the
                  use of the site as a scene of celebration: by Louis XVI (when he accepted the
                  constitution in 1791); by the Directory, after the revolution, for “all public
                  rejoicings” (1829: 7); and by Napoleon, for the distribution of provisions (which
                  continued in fact after the restoration). The contemporary event depicted at the
                  panorama is the festival of St. Louis, “when wine and provisions are given away in
                  great profusion, and various amusements provided; such as climbing well-greased
                  poles for watches and trinkets, dancing, riding wooden horses, round-abouts,
                  &amp;c. and the evening is closed with illuminations and fireworks.” A procession
                  depicted crossing the square is “conveying wine to the places of distribution”
                  (7). A review of this panorama in <title level="j">The Times</title> remarks
                  approvingly that the artist has enhanced the interest of the picture “by
                  introducing some well-painted and highly characteristic groups, among which he has
                  represented the rabble-rout which follow the procession of wine-carts, the
                  contents of which are intended for distribution on the King’s
                     <foreign>fête</foreign>, which the mob are celebrating” (November 29, 1828:
                  3).</p>
                  <p>In 1848, the tract notes that the painting depicts, on the “steps of the portico
                  of the National Assembly,” the declaration of France, by the Provisional
                  Government, on May 4, to be a republic. In accordance with the momentousness of
                  this occasion, there are “countless masses below, on the quays and the bridge; and
                  considerable animation is given to the Place de la Concorde, by the representation
                  of one of those scenes so peculiarly characteristic of the feelings and enthusiasm
                  of the Parisians, and of such constant occurrence during the preceding
                  month—namely, a long procession escorting a tree of liberty to its destination”
                  (1848: 4). A review in <title level="j">The Rambler</title> is less than convinced
                  by the overall effect, suggesting that there is a lack of excitement and spirit in
                  the depiction of the scene surrounding this proclamation. Even though “crowds
                  innumerable are swarming towards the vast portico of the Chambers, where
                  tri-colors and all the rest of the republican paraphernalia bespeak the scene that
                  is going on,” it is not enough to animate the view as a whole, about which there
                  is alas a look of “sleepy heaviness” (2: 23; June 3, 1848: 113). Quite possibly
                  this is the inevitable result of reducing the event to one set of visual details
                  among others, all clamouring for the attention of the viewer.</p>

                  <head>Panoramas of London in Paris</head>
                  <p>The interest of Londoners in the French capital had its analogue across the
                  channel; there too, national ideology played an explicit role. The very first
                  exhibitions at the Paris panoramas in 1799 were (as noted above) of Paris itself,
                  but also of the English fleet retreating in haste from Toulon in 1793. The opening
                  of the first panorama rotunda was announced with a certain pride: “‘We now have
                  our own panorama, like the dwellers on the Thames. It is only a copy of theirs,
                  but it attracts an unbelievable number of spectators every day’” (Oettermann 143).
                  The first depiction of London as a subject was mounted in 1804, when it was
                  reviewed in the <title level="j">Journal London Und Paris</title> by a reporter
                  who had seen an earlier depiction of London, possibly Girtin’s <title level="m">Eidometropolis</title>, which was on show in London between 1802 and 1803 (see
                  Comment 30 and Oettermann 146f.) He pointedly criticized the viewing conditions of
                  this display, for it seemed that in Paris the viewing platform was larger in
                  relation to the diameter of the painting, which affected the quality of the
                  illusion—even though the topographical precision of this painting was declared
                  superior to the one the anonymous reporter had seen before. The viewpoint used
                  here was the glassworks near Blackfriars Bridge. Two years later in 1806, after
                  Pierre Prévost mounted successful shows of Naples and Rome, London was shown
                  again. Possibly this was the same canvas, for it too was from the same vantage
                  point, and it was paired in the second rotunda (not by accident, needless to say)
                  by a view of “Boulogne and the Fleet Assembled for the Invasion of England.” Again
                  a report appeared in the <title level="j">Journal London Und Paris</title>, this
                  time deploring the choice of viewpoint as one from which no important buildings
                  are close enough to see. Moreover, it seems that Prévost had cast a dark pall over
                  the capital and painted out most of the ships on the Thames: <quote>Incidentally,
                     Mr Prévost (who painted the panorama) has let his patriotic feelings get the
                     better of him, for he shows the <emph>Tower of London</emph> at such a great
                     distance that the ships around it are all but invisible—only a few masts the
                     size of straws hidden behind a projecting bridge. Along the Thames near the
                     above-mentioned <emph>Blackfriars Bridge</emph> one sees only three or four
                     miserable little fishing boats, although the writer knows from experience that
                     this stretch of the famous river is crowded with vessels of every kind. But
                     what the patriotic artist withheld from the British fleet he gave back all the
                     more generously to the French in his panorama of Boulogne [. . .] (Oettermann
                     148)</quote> An eloquent and detailed description of this picture follows,
                  after which the writer resumes his theme, criticising the unusual calm of the
                  Thames (under “artfully natural” grey skies), the unrecognizability of key
                  buildings—again, because of the distance—and exclaims: “What interest can such a
                  panorama have for anyone who has lived in this city and come to see it as home, in
                  a manner of speaking? This is why everyone who has never been there leaves the
                  exhibit exclaiming, <emph>bah! people go on so about London, but what a miserable
                     place it must be!</emph>” (148).</p>
                  <p>Prévost exhibited a new view of London in 1816. This one was reviewed however in
                  glowing terms: “The Panorama of London is one of the largest and most beautiful
                  ever made” (Oettermann 153); and this time, all the “most important details” were
                  clearly on view. Churches, palaces, squares and parks, the embankments, the Thames
                  and its bridges, the outskirts of the city replete with green fields and a
                  sweeping horizon—“all [are] reproduced in perfect imitation and give a precise
                  impression of the most extensive and most populous city in Europe” (153). Times of
                  course had changed, and the years from 1811 to 1816 had been more difficult for
                  the Paris panorama, for as Oettermann notes, “Napoleon’s military actions took a
                  heavy toll on the French population and at times brought the cultural life of the
                  capital almost to a stop” (152). Moreover, contemporary events—from the Russian
                  campaign to the battle of Waterloo—were not uplifting subjects for the panorama,
                  and while the English could choose from a range of suitable “historic” moments,
                  panorama painters in France were at a distinct disadvantage. </p>

                  <head>Panoramic Text</head>
                  <p>The “image” (of place, of history, of time) presented at the panorama is only one
                  part of what the panorama-goer experienced. Much of what we know about the
                  exhibitions—as the discussion above bears out—is mediated by the accompanying
                  pamphlets or booklets containing textual accounts of the scenes on display. Partly
                  this is an inevitable consequence of historical transmission, insofar as these
                  documents and the key maps are in most cases all that have survived. This textual
                  mediation is largely descriptive in mode, and it is important to consider that our
                  relationship to what the panoramas actually showed is fundamentally triangulated,
                  insofar as the relationship of the panoramic image to the “reality” it conveyed is
                  doubled by the relationship of textual (re)construction to the now lost image. A
                  rhetoric or “regime” of description intervenes, offering an instance of text-image
                  relations in the period that has been seldom discussed. The descriptive rhetoric
                  and textual function of the accompanying tracts may productively be linked to the
                  larger challenge, abundantly evident in the depictions of Paris, of capturing the
                  actual, or history in the making. Arguably, it is these discursive texts that
                  provide anchors for an image that, despite its attempts to seize the moment, comes
                  across as cut off from any time and space other than its own. </p>
                  <p> The act of description is itself, in its historical uses, connected to both
                  visual and verbal means. The term refers in contemporary usage to the act of
                  giving “a detailed or graphic account” of the characteristic qualities and
                  recognizable features of a person, thing or scene (<title level="m">OED</title>).
                  In its more obsolete uses, it refers to acts of transcription or copying out, to
                  pictorial delineation, and indeed to marking out the form or outline of
                  geometrical figures, which might be linked metaphorically to the perspectival and
                  optical procedures of the panorama itself in relation to actual places.
                  “Description” is one way of characterizing what the panoramas set out to do, in
                     <emph>visual</emph> terms, in their attempt to delineate place, in the most
                  precise and detailed manner possible. This is made explicit in the descriptive
                  pamphlet accompanying Burford’s 1833 panorama of Niagara Falls, which quotes the
                  comments of a visitor to the falls, a Captain Basil Hall: <quote>All parts of the
                     Niagara are on a scale which baffles every attempt of the imagination, and it
                     were ridiculous therefore to think of describing it; the ordinary means of
                     description, I mean analogy, and direct comparison, with things which are more
                     accessible, fail entirely in the case of that amazing cataract, which is
                     altogether unique; yet a great deal, I am certain, might be done by a
                     well-executed Panorama. (1833: 4 fn.)</quote> Hornor’s panorama of London
                  elicited an even more confident assertion, from the antiquarian John Britton, of
                  its power to in fact exceed “histories, descriptions, maps, and prints”—which are
                  all “imperfect and defective,” mere scraps and “touches of the pen”—by imparting
                  “at a glance, at one view, a <title level="m">cyclopoedia of information</title>—a
                  concentrated history—a focal topography, of the largest and most influential city
                  in the world” (cited in Otto 290).</p>
                  <p>However, such visual “descriptions” or representations as a panorama might provide
                  were not fully readable on their own terms, as the depictions of Paris discussed
                  above make clear. The addition of directed reading material in the accompanying
                  pamphlets, which ostensibly enhanced the experience of the viewer, raised the
                  educational profile of a visit to a panorama—though as Galperin notes, the
                  pamphlets were by no means central to its appeal.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Though commentators have often assumed that the desire to
                     learn about places and events drew people to the panoramas, Galperin suggests
                     that the notices, rather than the accompanying narratives, offer “a more
                     accurate measure by far of what the public wanted,” and this was clearly more
                     related to its “visual and sensational features” (Galperin 44). Even so, the
                     descriptions offered a crucial sense of mastery, in their efforts to contain a
                     host of unruly detail. </note> As will be clear from the passages cited above
                  from descriptions of the panoramas of Paris in London, the textual supplements
                  organized the scenes on view into a numbered series of monuments, objects, or
                  “spots” or special interest, that related to the numbers on the key map. The
                  descriptions of those spots could be very brief—a simple statement of fact—or
                  several paragraphs in length, and thus the pamphlets had the effect of translating
                  the simultaneous or “at a glance” qualities of the visual form into successive
                  verbal presentations. The key map meanwhile “duplicated” in miniature what was
                  visible on the walls, in one of two ways: either in two diagrammatic strips each
                  representing 180 degrees of the view, which we see in the “View of the City of
                  Paris, taken from the Place de la Concorde” in 1848 (see <ref target="#fig4">figure 4</ref>), or in the form of an anamorphic diagram that re-represented
                  the panorama in a “fish-eye” view (as in <ref target="#fig3">figure 3</ref>, the
                  view of Paris from Montmartre displayed in 1814).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> These two different conventions of visual
                     re-representation figure prominently in Oleksijczuk’s argument, where they are
                     considered as miniature panoramas in their own right. The circular fish-eye
                     keys, which demanded the viewers’ imaginative engagement with the panorama as a
                     form, were gradually replaced by the horizontal strips, which were to be “read”
                     from left to right, reflecting an increasing (and increasingly rational)
                     emphasis on the subject matter, and interpolating a more passive and objective
                     viewer (162-171).</note> Neither form could really replicate the total effect
                  of the image, but could at least “describe” it if the viewer attended to one spot
                  or detail only.</p>
                  <p> Running counter to the very premise of the “all embracing view,” the key maps and
                  their accompanying descriptions focused the attention of the viewer in particular
                  ways: indeed, the descriptions tend to emphasize specific over general detail, and
                  in all cases to select items that have, as we have seen, topical or historical
                  relevance and/or visual interest. The difficulties inherent in acts of description
                  are nevertheless inscribed in the often arbitrary choice of foci, and in their
                  sequential accumulation. The entry on “description” in Diderot and D’Alembert’s
                     <title level="m">Encyclopédie</title> helpfully lays out the problematic nature
                  of descriptions, such as their potential limitlessness. They are, the article
                  suggests, subject to internal disorganization, if one attends indiscriminately
                  (i.e. too minutely) to all the things of nature and the variety of their forms. A
                  book, for instance, that contains many long descriptions does not give us clearer
                  conceptions of its subject(s), but rather presents us with unformed and
                  “gigantesque” figures, possessing neither order nor proportion (878). No effort of
                  the imagination or of conceptualization can compensate for this absence of
                  inherent arrangement, in which only a mass of detail, of detached parts, can be
                  recognized, without any sense of their internal connections and structures.</p>
                  <p>These remarks are directed specifically to description in relation to natural
                  history, though they articulate a general problem that applies to the accumulation
                  of detail at the panorama, as our close examination of the panoramas of Paris
                  reveals. The abstraction of detail, by both the tracts and the nature of
                  perception, distracts the panorama viewer from a grasp of the total effect, just
                  as immersion in the view works not just alongside but also against mastery of the
                  scene. Other sections of the <title level="m">Encyclopédie</title> entry address
                  description as a geometric term, and in relation to literature
                     [<foreign>Belles-Lettres</foreign>], where the same problem crops up: a
                  literary description can amount to an enumeration of superficial and accidental
                  features, without revealing any of the essential attributes of its subject.
                  Description is thus aligned with the aims of poets and orators rather than those
                  of philosophers who seek after “absolute truth,” and lends itself particularly to
                  specific types of knowledge, several of which coincide with the preoccupations of
                  the panorama: the relation of dramatic events such as wars, fires, shipwrecks;
                     “<foreign>chronographie</foreign>,” or the events of the past;
                     “<foreign>topographie</foreign>,” or the description of (remote) places; and
                  portraits of persons or characters (879).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a rich investigation of “description” across domains
                     and discourses of knowledge in the eighteenth century, largely inspired by the
                        <title level="m">Encyclopédie</title> essay, see Bender and Marrinan; Joanna
                     Stalnaker’s <title level="m">The Unfinished Enlightenment</title> suggestively
                     explores the project of Enlightenment description, and offers a terrific
                     reading of Louis Sébastien Mercier’s <title level="m">Tableau de Paris</title>
                     (1781-88), a twelve-volume “painting” of contemporary Paris that proceeds
                     entirely by verbal description.</note> Successful verbal descriptions can
                  render things as though they were present, however, and give us pleasure insofar
                  as we may “compare the ideas to which words give birth with those arising from the
                  very presence of the objects” (879). If one considers that the activities of the
                  visitors to the viewing platform at the panorama, whose focus shifts between the
                  image and the descriptive text, involves something like this kind of comparison,
                  one might then ask to what extent the textual description simply doubles the
                  “visual” one, and to what extent it disturbs it by attending to certain kinds of
                  detail at the expense of others. Like literary description, it cannot capture the
                  “essence” or meaning of a scene, cannot show what is “really” there, but can name
                  it, designate it, and supplement it with information about what cannot be shown:
                  the effects of time and change, and the complex nature of historical events. </p>

                  <head>The Panorama of/and History</head>
                  <p>Part of the attraction of the panorama, as a mode of representing history, drew
                  from its vaunted authority as a window onto the world. As with maps, its
                  documentary nature, its dependence on topographical accuracy, conveyed a
                  persuasive degree of truthfulness. Meanwhile, despite this apparent objectivity,
                  much room was left for subtle (or not so subtle) propaganda—in keeping with the
                  way the description at the panorama, in light of our discussion above, could be
                  seen to operate according to its own rhetorical poetics. Indeed Napoleon, after
                  seeing himself depicted as the great military hero in Prévost’s “Battle of Wagram”
                  (1810), immediately grasped the ideological possibilities of the panorama and
                  commissioned the construction of seven rotundas that would each depict the
                  principal battles of the Revolution and of his empire (Comment 45). These would
                  then “tour” France and other cities in his empire, but future events prevented
                  this project from ever being carried out.</p>
                  <p>Military panoramas, which remained eminently popular throughout the nineteenth
                  century, particularly in France, were “powerful instruments for the corroboration
                  of national identity and the propagation of grand ideals” (della Dora 301). The
                  panoramas of Jean-Charles Langlois (1789-1870) are noteworthy here; a disabled
                  former officer of Napoleon, he embarked on a new career as a painter, and devoted
                  himself to innovative panoramas celebrating French military history.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Langlois is recognized for the
                     attention he devoted to the relationship between the viewing platform and the
                     foreground, where he introduced a more elaborate
                        <foreign>faux-terrain</foreign> of three-dimensional objects, and for
                     experimentation with lighting techniques. His first great success was a staging
                     of the Battle of Navarino (shown in 1831), for which he sourced a wrecked ship
                     that had actually taken part in the battle, and used its poop-deck as the
                     viewing platform (Fruitema and Zoetmulder 42). </note> For the English,
                  panoramas of the Battle of Waterloo, not surprisingly, were a huge draw, and
                  Philip Shaw has investigated the extent to which they functioned as effective
                  propaganda: from 1815 on, “plans were afoot for a variety of static and travelling
                  panoramic exhibitions, designed for the sole purpose of pleasing and instructing
                  the public in the truth of Wellington’s great victory” (83). From the
                  “picturesque” tour of the battle site to the theatricalized staging of the
                  panoramas, Shaw explores but also questions the extent to which historical
                  experiences could be simply “recreated in the sphere of aesthetic practice” (79).
                  The relationship between war and art is a complex one, and beyond the scope of
                  this paper; it is noteworthy however that “mastery” of the scene at the panorama
                  had the effect of putting the viewer of “Waterloo” into the imagined “omnivoyance”
                  of Wellington (89-90). Shaw notes very pointedly the way in which the chaos and
                  disorder of war was regulated by the panorama, and its fantasy structures, “as a
                  mechanism for alternating pleasure and pain, mastery and loss” (79). </p>
                  <p>The panoramas of the nineteenth century systematically fore-grounded their
                  pedagogical possibilities, which informed their pronounced interest in recent
                  historical events. But whether or not the panorama lent itself to the imparting of
                  “historical” knowledge is another question. Certainly it has been suggested that
                  the public in general was more taken by the sheer magic of the spectacle. More
                  pointedly, as François Robichon has put it, the panorama would become a formidable
                  machine for <foreign>imagining</foreign> history, a machine for staging historical
                  time—not by reproducing in any meaningful sense the actuality of historical events
                  (as if that were possible) but by producing the illusion of events as they took
                  place. Drawing from Roland Barthes’ essay “<foreign>Le discours de
                     l’histoire</foreign>,” Robichon remarks that in the panorama of history, the
                  events (<foreign>le procédé</foreign>) are of themselves insufficient; rather the
                  panorama mobilizes these episodes into a dynamic that naturalizes history, that
                  erases their complex and dialectical nature. “History” comes to us without
                  contradictions because it is without depth—what the panorama offers is finally,
                  Robichon concludes, a “mythic image” (84).</p>
                  <p>Turning to Barthes’ essay on “The Discourse of History,” we can interrogate more
                  closely the idea that historical discourse is imaginary—particularly if we allow
                  that the descriptions of panoramas (at least those with close ties to historical
                  events) can be understood as a form of historical discourse, designating “what
                  was,” under the guise of “what is.” For Barthes, “historical discourse is in its
                  essence a form of ideological elaboration, or to put it more precisely, an
                     <emph>imaginary</emph> elaboration, if we can take the imaginary to be the
                  language through which the utterer of a discourse (a purely linguistic entity)
                  ‘fills out’ the place of the subject of the utterance” (“Discourse” 16). The
                  intervention of language in the constitution of historical fact, the primary focus
                  of Barthes’ account, means that such facts can only be understood tautologically,
                  for as Nietzsche argued, “‘[t]here are no facts in themselves. It is always
                  necessary to begin by introducing a meaning in order that there can be a fact’”
                  (17). The facts of historical discourse are a function of their linguistic
                  existence, “yet it is exactly as if this existence were merely the ‘copy,’ purely
                  and simply, of another existence situated in the extra-structural domain of the
                  ‘real’” (17). The relationship between the panorama and its historical (or
                  “actual”) signified could be productively interposed here, since the panoramic
                  image could be seen to operate as just such a supposed “copy” of the
                  real—uncannily freestanding, and yet pointing always to a higher order of reality
                  beyond the rotunda’s (cleverly concealed) walls.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, historical discourse, like any discourse “that lays claim to ‘realism,’”
                  performs an <emph>illusory</emph> confusion of referent and signified through
                  which it signifies rather than follows the real (it merely repeats “it happened”).
                  In other words, Barthes claims, “in ‘objective’ history, the ‘real’ is never more
                  than an unformulated signified sheltering behind the apparently all-powerful
                  referent” (17). This situation underwrites “the <emph>realistic effect</emph>”
                  that characterizes such genres as “the realist novel, the private diary,
                  documentary literature, news items, historical museums, exhibitions of old objects
                  and especially in the massive development of photography” (18). To this list, one
                  might add the panoramas, which were thoroughly invested in the documentation of
                  the “actual” through realistic effects. The panoramic image, too, can be
                  understood as the “all powerful referent” that shelters the unformulated (and
                  unformulatable) “real”—and the same could be said of the discursive history
                  performed in the descriptive text of the accompanying pamphlets, although these
                  also have the effect of shifting attention from the imaginary historical referent
                  back to words.</p>
                  <p>Barthes dwells on the distinctiveness of photography as bound up in the assertion
                  “that the event represented has <emph>really</emph> taken place” (18). Historical
                  panoramas assert the same thing, but with a twist, since the representation of
                  “place” has also sheltered (taken over—or simply overtaken) the posited event. It
                  is noteworthy however that while Barthes deplores, implicitly, the hidden nature
                  of historical representation (the “what is”) as a form of ideological obfuscation,
                  Walter Benjamin is attracted to what he calls the “hidden” pathos of the
                  panorama—the place, by contrast, where history might show itself in valuable ways.
                  In the <title level="m">Arcades Project</title>, he wrote of his intention to
                  “reflect rigorously on the particular pathos that lies hidden in the art of the
                  panoramas,” and on “the particular relation of this art to nature, but also, and
                  above all, to history” (529). At first glance, what Benjamin means by the
                  “historical” nature of the panorama has less to do with its attempts at historical
                  representation than with its embeddedness in the material history and
                  entertainment culture of the nineteenth century metropolis—a world of gaslights,
                  fashion, boredom, and wax museums.</p>
                  <p>The panorama’s relationship to the “actual,” which I have used here to navigate
                  its attempt to counterpoise realism with historical representation, is deeply
                  paradoxical—not least in its unreal and unnatural simulations of both nature and
                  reality. Benjamin, to articulate the “peculiar” relationship between the panorama,
                  nature, and history, turns to the reflections of the painter A. J. Wiertz, who
                  argues that what passes for realism in painting should be aligned more closely
                  with the underappreciated power of <foreign>trompe-l’oeil</foreign> (529). Here
                  too, then, the problem of history is the problem of simulation, or, as Peter Otto
                  puts it, of the “contingent nature of all perceptual worlds, the <emph>unreality
                     of reality</emph>” (42). Indeed, our fascination with the panorama has much to
                  do with the way it prefigures the very aspects of the contemporary world that
                  Derrida summons with the terms “artifactuality” and “virtuactuality.” In an
                  interview entitled “The Deconstruction of Actuality,” Derrida reflects on our
                  relationship to contemporary events, on the problem with “actuality” today (one
                  must bear in mind here that in French “<foreign>les actualités</foreign>” also
                  refers to “the news”). When one thinks about one’s time, the time of that thinking
                  is, he argues, an artifact: all such public gestures of speech are “formatted” and
                  “initialized” by media organizations. Thus the first portmanteau term alerts us to
                  the extent to which actuality is <emph>made</emph>—“produced, sifted,
                  contained”—rather than given (86). The second, “actuvirtuality” or
                  “virtuactuality”—Derrida deploys it both ways—refers to the relationship of the
                  virtual (“virtual image, virtual space, and thus virtual event”) to the actual, to
                  the inscription of virtuality “in the very structure of the event produced” (89).
                  The panorama, as an early and spectacular form of newsreel, attempted to inscribe
                  the “historical” in its images—to function, to coin a third term, as
                  “actuvisuality” in its preoccupation with capturing the place of the present, and
                  representing its relationship to the past. Yet in the panoramas of Paris and
                  London—of themselves, of each other, and in their textual mediations—the
                  difficulty representing history at all, its tendency to escape our attempts to
                  formulate it, is dramatically underscored.</p>

               <p>Epitomized by Caspar David Friedrich’s <title level="m">Wanderer Watching a Sea of
                  Fog</title> (c. 1817-18), and the Wordsworthian peripatetic, the gentlemanly or
               artistic wanderer is integral to the Romantic imagination. Wandering lies at the
               heart of picturesque sightseeing, blank verse poetry, specimen collecting, and the
               Romantic cultivation of self. However, these forms of sanctioned wandering exist
               against a backdrop of less desirable movements that, nonetheless, inform, color, and
               at times literally converge with, the endorsed amblings of the inquisitive
               artist-gentlemen. Unsanctioned forms of wandering existed on a spectrum of
               criminality, which at times included peddlers, actors, shepherds, discharged
               soldiers, beggars, orphaned children, gypsies, sailors, highwaymen, pirates, and
               ultimately, as Toby Benis has argued, “anyone on the road without adequate cause”
               (2). These disparate groups, while often meticulously differentiated, were also
               increasingly amalgamated as <emph>vagrants</emph> through a series of common burdens
               and discriminatory practices, resulting from changing Poor Laws, licensing, and
               Vagrancy Acts in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. </p>
               <p>It is not my aim or desire to reproduce here an exhaustive catalog of wandering
               types. Rather, I hope to sketch some of the strategies of representation used to
               capture the vagrant body in print. And further, to tease out some of the tensions and
               slippages between the text as material object and the roaming body it seeks to
               arrest. To do this I will examine a selection of British Romantic prints, all bound
               in books published in London in the first two decades of the nineteenth century
               (1800-1820). Some of these texts explore a signal category of wanderer (e.g., the
               urban beggar in the case of John Thomas Smith’s <title level="m">Vagabondiana, or,
                  Anecdotes of mendicant wanderers through the streets of London </title>[London,
               1817], or the gypsy in the case of Heinrich Moritz Gottlieb Grellmann’s <title level="m">Dissertation on the Gipseys</title> [London, 1807]) while others
               assemble a variety of eccentric persons, among which can be found wandering types
               (e.g., James Caulfield’s <title level="m">Portraits, Memories, and Characters, of
                  Remarkable Persons</title> [London, 1819], or G.H. Wilson’s <title level="m">The
                  Eccentric Mirror</title> [London, 1806]). The prints discussed are chosen because
               they represent different strategies of resistance to the project of containment or
               arrest, strategies which include signifying in ways that resist the cataloging
               missions of the text/author, critiquing the text as material object and commodity,
               representing stasis as a potentially political act, and encouraging the reader/viewer
               to be cognizant of their complicity in processes of erasure. </p>
               <p>The rich body of scholarship interested in Romantic vagrancy tends to focus primarily
               on Wordsworth’s representation of and engagement with the itinerant poor. The hope of
               this project is to explore how a more sustained survey of contemporaneous visual
               representations might alter and expand our understanding of Romantic vagrancy and its
               relationship both to the artist’s construction of self and the (supposedly) static
               image. This project resists the impulse to treat as a given the print’s stasis, or to
               accept prints as a default medium used in the absence of alternative representational
               technologies. In highlighting the tension of wandering as a space-time practice and
               the apparent stasis of the published print, I do not mean to suggest that Romantic
               moving-picture technologies (such as P.J. de Loutherbourg’s <title level="m">Eidophusikon</title>, exhibited in London in 1781) would have offered a more
               accurate, neutral, or appropriate means of representing acts of unsanctioned
               wandering. Rather, by examining prints that represent wanderers we are able to
               explore instances of resistance that complicate a binary understanding of the moving
               and the still. Prints may seem to “arrest” or “make still” the wandering impulse, but
               they also reproduce and disseminate the vagrant body. In this way, prints allow for
               the movement of images even if they are not typically considered “moving images.” </p>
               <p>The Romantic era saw the displacement of many people as a result of enclosure,
               clearances, and revolutions. As Anne Wallace has argued, the resultant increase in
               pedestrian mobility, not only in the form of those exiled from common lands and sent
               adrift, but also in the form of “deliberate excursive walking, especially by the
               relatively well-to-do and educated,” meant increased contact between those wandering
               for spiritual or artistic refinement and those made mobile out of economic necessity
               (166). Such contacts feature prominently in the poetry and prose of the Romantic
               period, as authorial wanderers frequently encounter members of the wandering class,
               finding cause to celebrate, condemn, or identify with those traversing the landscape
               in less orthodox ways. </p>
               <p>While it may be problematic to assemble such divergent groups into a single category,
               a series of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century laws and ordinances worked
               to consolidate the wandering poor and to place them in a particular relationship to a
               wage- and settlement-based economy, which, I would argue, gave them a distinct class
               status. Since 1662, poor relief had been largely based on a system of parish charity
               that took “settlement” (defined as birth, long-term residence, or employment in a
               given community) as a prerequisite for assistance (22-23, 29). The wandering poor
               were inherently disqualified from such assistance, as they were not settled and were
               thus not the responsibility of any particular parish. Furthermore, this system of
               localized assistance increased hostilities towards the unsettled, as those forced to
               pay the poor rate were invested in limiting any additional burden on parish funds.
               Tales of transporting pregnant women in labor over parish lines, the destruction of
               cottages, and the forced eviction of unwanted dependents suggest (with possible
               hyperbole) some of the strategies used to decrease the pauper population and its
               concomitant costs (Lloyd 122; Olsen 23). For the nomadic poor this meant continually
               enforced movement. Unwilling to take on additional charity cases, many communities
               set laws restricting the number of days vagrants could camp within parish limits.
               Simultaneously, a series of Vagrant Laws made the very act of continuous, unsettled
               movement a criminal offense. Thus, an ironic and illogical system was produced
               whereby nomadic persons were (through local ordinances) required to move regularly,
               yet by conforming to these laws they subjected themselves to a variety of
               state-sanctioned punishments, including whipping, imprisonment, and forced labor
               (Mayall 258).</p>
               <p>If, as Celeste Langan has argued, vagrancy functions as both the paradigm of Romantic
               movement and thought, and as the structural analogy by which we understand the
               liberal subject, how does this liberalism relate to the materiality of the book,
               particularly the encyclopedic volumes of types which both contain and mimic the
               movements of their subjects (Langan 27)? While wandering may be integral to Romantic
               thought and action, so too is the desire to capture, record, and classify. Indeed,
               the most immediately apparent discontinuity in prints of wandering types centers on
               the tension between mobility and stasis. These are persons defined by their
               unauthorized movement, and yet, to record them as distinct personalities or types
               requires a degree of arrest. Thus, we find a collection of images organized around a
               verb that is largely unrepresented. These figures sit, stand, crouch, pose, gesture,
               and occasionally step, but they do not seem to <emph>wander</emph>. </p>
               <p>A print of Margaret Finch, “Queen of the Gypsies at Norwood,” from James Caulfield’s
                  <title level="m">Portraits, Memories, and Characters, of Remarkable
                  Persons</title> is particularly striking in its apparent stasis (<ref target="#fig1">figure 1</ref>). As “Queen of the Gypsies,” Finch is unequivocally
               a representative of a wandering people, and we are told that she has spent her life
               “traversing the whole of England, in the double capacity of gipsy and thief.”
               However, in this image we find Finch boulder-like in her squat immobility and
               groundedness. Having adopted the custom “of sitting on the ground with her chin
               resting on her knees,” the author explains, Finch’s sinews became “so contracted,
               that she could not extend herself or change her position” (Caulfield, <title level="m">Portraits</title>, 247-249). In this way, Finch becomes almost
               hyperbolically immobile, her body calcifying into a stationary lump. Thus fixed, she
               becomes a site of pilgrimage, a cause for wandering rather than its practitioner, as
               “persons from the highest rank and quality to that of the lowest class in life” clog
               the roads leading to Norwood, hoping to see the “singularity of her figure” and
               benefit from the “fame of her fortune-telling” (Caulfield, <title level="m">Portraits</title>, 247-249). Her spatial movement restricted, she remains an
               embodiment of temporal roving, as she is believed to possess the ability to see into
               the future. </p>
               <p> As Michael Kramp has argued, the figure of the deformed and repulsive gypsy hag was
               a Romantic type constructed to undercut the “threat to heterosexual and labor
               (re)production” posed by the late eighteenth-century trope of Gypsy femininity as
               aggressively sexual. The old fortune-teller, the “antithesis of sexual allure,” does
               not endanger heteronormativity, or pose the threat of miscegenation (Kramp, <title level="m">Reconceptualization</title>, 1339). In her decrepit and static state,
               Margaret Finch becomes an attraction rather than an attractor, and yet, this
               depiction also exceeds its presumed project to simply re-present a “type”. </p>
               <p> Though unwanted by Norwood (Caufield complains that Surry and Kent are especially
               “pestered” and “plundered” by gypsies), Margaret Finch appears defiant in her stasis
               (Caulfield 247-249). The cave-like structure that she inhabits seems to have grown up
               around her, mimicking her contours and naturalizing her place in the landscape. Her
               face, the nose of which has been drawn in more dramatic profile than the eyes and
               mouth, seems to hover between a frontal and side view, and concomitantly between a
               specific likeness and an attempt at physiognomic typing. Her direct stare confronts
               the viewer, even as her pronouncedly arched and elongated nose distracts from the
               specificity of this address by calling upon ethnic stereotypes meant to signal her
               eastern origins and status as “domestic other” (Nord 5). </p>
               <p> Bolstering the potential defiance of this address are details that would signal her
               irreverence to the Romantic reader. In addition to the predictable advice regarding
               hard work, religious devotion, and frugality, the poor were often advised to avoid
               unnecessary dependents, such as pets. In a 1795 article in <title level="j">The
                  Times</title>, we find a curious preoccupation with dogs as signifiers of excess
               (qtd. in Olsen 21-22). Dogs are presented as luxuries that may be afforded the rich,
               but are so impractical for the poor that their retention disqualifies their owners
               from charitable assistance. The presence of not just one, but two dogs solidifies
               Finch’s status as undeserving of—even defiant toward—charitable aid. Likewise
               signaling Finch’s “excess” are her tobacco pipe and drink.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The accompanying text suggests that a “mug of
                  beer” may be had “at the place generally called the Gipsy-house” (Caulfield
                  247-249). </note>
               </p>
               <p> Though Margaret Finch dies in 1740, anchored to a Norwood hovel by a decrepit body,
               through the reproduction and dissemination of this print, she regains a measure of
               spatial and temporal movement, persisting through time and “traversing the whole of
               England” once again. Here, the print seems not to “arrest” or “capture” the subject
               so much as record an act of defiant immobility—stasis as a political act, in the face
               of discriminatory laws and practices. The boulder-like solidity of Finch’s form,
               enveloped by the landscape and seemingly immovable, suggests an insubordinate
               persistence. </p>
               <p> Refusing a teleological and hierarchicalizing narrative, recent scholarship purposes
               a greater degree of ambiguity, reciprocity, and oscillation between still and moving
               images. More importantly, such work critically rethinks the implications of stasis.
               Resisting an easy alignment of stasis with death, or a confusion of “rigor with rigor
               mortis,” Karen Beckman and Jean Ma advocate the “recursive temporality of the ‘still
               moving’ ” (5, 11). Beckman and Ma are particularly concerned with the political
               potential of the recursive and hope that it may provide an alternative to
               conceptualizing collective political agency solely in terms of “movement” (14).
               Attempting to forge a model of productive recursive activity, recent scholarship
               stresses the double meaning of “still,” which may be used to connote an arrest or
               immobility as well as a persistence or continuation. Significantly, if taken in the
               latter sense, “the still is on the side of becoming and moving rather than in strict
               opposition with it” (Kaplan 221). It is this tension or doubleness within “the still”
               that Jean-Luc Nancy has explored in relation to the logic of concealment (31-47). In
               a like vein, Jean Baudrillard has interrogated stasis that is not static in diverse
               instances of “freezing,” arguing that such “immobility is not an inertia, but a
               paroxysm which boils movement down into its opposite” (67). Whereas Nancy purposes a
               understanding of (the) “still” which is implicated in movement, Baudrillard insists
               that <emph>even</emph> if the still is understood as the antithesis of movement, it
               cannot be carelessly aligned with inaction or apathy. Rather, it is a particularly
               concentrated, dense, or “intense” extraction of that movement. </p>
               <p> An inaugural plate in Heinrich Moritz Gottlieb Grellmann’s <title level="m">Dissertation on the Gipseys</title> (<ref target="#fig2">figure 2</ref>), may
               offer an instance of one such dense freeze. Arrested in the moment of taking a step,
               a gypsy woman of elongated stature moves from light to shade with an infant and small
               child. The varied positions of eyes and bodies gives the figure group a varied
               directionality that seems to work against the suggestion of movement in a particular
               direction. At the same time, the woman’s movement from light to dark within the
               hillside scene suggests a true spatial movement through a landscape that is more than
               a token backdrop. In combination, these aspects of composition and lighting give the
               scene the odd effect of appearing both spontaneous and posed. A coin in the woman’s
               outstretched hand (though vaguely delineated) is marked by the simple cross-and-dot
               pattern of a medieval two- or four-pence (Fleetwood 34-35).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Coins with a similar pattern on the obverse of
                  the monarch’s profile were minted between the reigns of Richard I and Henry VII
                  (c. 1189-1509). Choosing to show the back of the coin further obscures the
                  temporal as a coin’s face changes with each new reign. </note> Though ostensibly
               meant to signal that the woman has received alms, this numismatic anachronism also
               complicates the temporality of the scene. In conjunction with the figures’
               ahistorical dress, the coin suggests a temporal as well as spatial unrootedness,
               which stands in tension with the print’s claim to have captured a specific moment. In
               this way, the print seems to present its subjects as simultaneously caught in the act
               of wandering and performing the act with choreographed exaggeration, and thus gives
               us a particularly dense extraction of the act that is both specific and symbolic.
               While acknowledging that anachronistic details fit comfortably with primitivizing
               constructions of Gypsies as unchanging and timeless, we can still recognize a
               resistant potential between the supposed temporality of the ethnographic sketch (the
               claim to have captured) and suggestions of a deeper, un-moored time within the
               image.</p>
               <p>The ethnographic project of containment and classification may be further undermined
               by the book as material object. Many of the books dedicated to vagabonds, gypsies,
               and others of the wandering class become themselves strangely nomadic texts. Even a
               work as seemingly focused as Grellmann’s <title level="m">Dissertation on the
                  Gipseys</title> is notably sprawling and fragmented in its execution.
               Illustrations are clearly appropriated from other contexts, and gesture more towards
               their disparate origins than a cohesive narrative. Even the frontispiece, an
               engraving of a pirate and wanderer by James Heath (1757-1834), apparently after a
               painting by Richard Corbould (1757-1831) or one of his sons (<ref target="#fig3">figure 3</ref>),<note place="foot" resp="editors">Richard
                  Corbould (1757-1831) had two sons, George Corbould (1786-1846) and Henry Corbould
                  (1787-1844). Richard Corbould married Charlotte Heath, a daughter of the Heath
                  family of engravers and their eldest son, George, apprenticed with James Heath
                  (Peltz). </note> seems to have been appropriated from another context (as the
               unrelated volume and page numbers below the caption suggest). Thus, an image intended
               to introduce a focused treatise on a single topic (gypsies), instead conflates
               gypsies with other wandering types (pirates) and encourages the viewer to think of
               other mediums and published contexts for the image at hand. Unfolding pages cut to
               different sizes, interspersed with plates illustrating themes only tangentially
               related to the argument of the text, continually push the reader out of the confines
               of the book to imagine additional sources, narratives, and paths of inquiry. While
               Grellmann’s text strives to categorize, re-present, and define gypsies in a
               systematic fashion, its format and diverse content continually undermine this agenda. </p>
               <p>Even in seemingly more cohesive ethnographic projects, competing desires to
               generalize and particularize stand in tension. In <title level="m">Vagabondiana, or,
                  Anecdotes of mendicant wanderers through the streets of London</title>, John
               Thomas Smith strives to depict the “wanderers” of London, but in order to obtain
               portraits “drawn from life” he must arrest his roaming subjects. Thus, a vagrant like
               “Black Joe” (Joseph Johnson) (<ref target="#fig4">figure 4</ref>) is identified by
               the specific address of his supposed encounter with Smith, “N4 Chandos Street,
               Convent Garden.” Ironically, however, this specific location is not articulated in
               the print, the background of which consists only of non-descript shading. Smith
               undertakes the seemingly contradictory task of assembling subjects that are both
               unique and representative. Organized around abstract qualities such as
               “industriousness,” the text produces as archive of distinct “types” valued for their
               perceived role as representatives of larger categories. “Black Joe” is taken to
               represent both the black urban poor (he is one of only two characters in the book
               identified by a racial signifier) and the particularly creative or ingenious beggar.
               Thus, Johnson is represented as both a unique subject and a type, and as both
               emplaced and de-contextualized.</p>
               <p>Smith explains that Johnson, imaged with a crutch and cane, has sustained wounds
               rendering “him incapable of doing further duty on the ocean.” However, as a
               “consequence of his having been employed in the merchant’s service only,” Johnson is
               “not entitled to the provision of Greenwich,” and “having no claim to relief in any
               parish” must glean a living on the streets. Though the elaborate model ship, which
               Johnson wears affixed to a simple cylindrical cap, is described by Smith simply as
               evidence of especially creative beggary inspired by his former life as a sailor,
               between text and image other narratives surface. The author explains that Johnson
               animates his model ship “by a bow of thanks, or a supplicating inclination to a
               drawing room window,” thus simulating the “appearance of sea-motion” (33). Johnson’s
               decision to masquerade as an aquatic vessel may stem from his time as a sailor (one
               of many, primarily lower-class, occupations available to black Britons in the late
               eighteenth and early nineteenth century), and yet the juxtaposition of a black man
               and large ship during a time of heated debate surrounding slavery also resonates on
               other levels. </p>
               <p>At the time of this sketch, the British slave trade had (ostensibly) been abolished,
               but slavery itself was still rampant. Additionally, ships held the threat of
               deportation, as London officials concocted solutions to the “problem” of the city’s
               black poor, an effort that culminated in an attempt to ship London’s impoverished
               blacks to a colony in Sierra Leone (Gerzina 142-173). Though unexplored by Smith, the
               context of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the possible threat of deportation are
               difficult to repress. Although we are assured that Johnson’s gestures are
               “supplicating,” his performance carries a political edge, an edge that may or may not
               have been registered by the women taking sugar in their tea as Johnson theatrically
               “sailed” past their drawing room windows. </p>
               <p>The fact that Smith’s <title level="m">Vagabondiana</title> could itself enter such
               drawing rooms, becoming a sort of guidebook to the eccentric characters that passed,
               further complicates the project of “capturing” Johnson’s likeness. Smith’s impulse to
               record his own meanderings through sketches of fellow wanderers could be read as an
               act of violence by which the implied movement of the author/illustrator is
               privileged, while the subject’s movement is arrested or denied. By assembling an
               encyclopedic volume of vagrant types, Smith simulates the act of wandering using the
               conceit of “happening upon” beggars in their native environs and making “sketches
               taken from life”. Arguably, the disassociative perusing offered by such texts could
               function as safe supplement for more radical movement. </p>
               <p>Romantic sightseeing and landscape texts were likewise invested in simulating the act
               of wandering in potentially problematic ways. In Humphrey Repton’s <title level="m">Fragments on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening</title>, the
               enclosure of common lands and the clearance of undesirables is enacted with the
               simple lift of a page (Harrison 46). In “View from my own cottage, in Essex” (<ref target="#fig5">figure 5</ref>), the concluding hand-colored aquatint from Repton’s
               final treatise and memoir, we find a view of the artist’s own yard. Framed by two
               large trees, Repton’s view is molested by the traffic of public thoroughfares, which
               lie just beyond his low lattice fence. More troubling still is the one-eyed,
               one-armed, one-legged vagrant who leans against this fence. Disabled, elderly, and
               seemingly exhausted, the man’s mournful eye, long face, and hunched weariness, echoed
               by the long shadow he casts, seem intended to win our sympathy as viewers. Behind
               him, in a meager triangle of public green, flocks of ducks scavenge for food, perhaps
               underscoring the beggar’s own reliant state. Repton’s solution to the aesthetic
               problem posed by these vagrant scavengers (the beggar as well as the birds) is simple
               erasure. Lifting the half page reveals an “improved” garden, in which the formerly
               common green is appropriated and privatized with the use of handsome shrubbery.
               Plantings and trellises further obscure undesirable aspects of his surroundings (such
               as the butcher shop) and the beggar disappears altogether. In a final—almost
               perverse—gesture, Repton offers an empty chair (near the shade of a tree), but only
               after that weary traveler so clearly in need of such a comfort has been completely
               expunged. In this way, the "before" and "after" design of Repton’s over-slip
               illustrations work to justify both the enclosure of common land and the removal of
               unwanted persons on aesthetic grounds (pun intended). </p>
               <p>While the reader/viewer is made potentially complicit in the act of erasure by
               lifting the page of Repton’s book, it is a process that can be reversed (the vagrant
               body can be reinserted into the landscape by replacing the over-leaf). Arguably, the
               nature of “before” and “after” views depend on a certain back and forth comparison
               between the two images. While the “before” and “after” images are valued differently
               and their sequencing is meant to suggest improvement and progress, fully appreciating
               the extent and specificity of the renovation requires that the reader/viewer refer
               back to the original scene. Likewise resistant to the process of erasure is the
               inclusion of such a memorable and explicitly damaged body (bearing three distinct
               wounds), the removal of which is difficult to excuse as an ethically neutral act. </p>
               <p>This is not to assume that the injured vagrant is necessarily seeking aid. Certainly,
               many wandering poor practiced trades and had strategies for living off the land, and
               were explicitly not looking for charitable assistance or long-term residency in a
               parish. However, their forced—and simultaneously criminalized—nomadism made almost
               any action dangerous and suspect. Those who preferred, or were forced into, continual
               movement were faced with the additional difficulty of navigating lives on rapidly
               dwindling common lands. In “View from my own cottage, in Essex” we see enclosure on a
               small scale, as Repton appropriates the apparently public triangle of green for his
               own purposes, thus alienating both the beggar and the scavenging birds.</p>
               <p> Enclosure, the privatization of communal grounds, greatly restricted both the
               movement and the resources of the wandering poor. The process of consolidating and
               enclosing commons, wastelands, and open fields into private holdings demarcated by
               fences, walls, hedgerows, or trenches originated in the late medieval period, but
               experienced an unprecedented surge in England between 1793 and 1815 (McCalman 496).
               In many regions the process of enclosure eroded customary rights, including the right
               to graze animals, gather wood (estover), fish (piscary), cut peat (turbary), and
               glean wheat or produce left after the harvest (Janowitz 155). Like the agricultural
               laborers that depended on access to common lands to supplement their meager incomes,
               for members of nomadic or wandering classes attempting to live off the land, the loss
               of these customary rights severely affected their ability to subsist. Such rights are
               explicitly flaunted in an introductory plate from Grellmann’s <title level="m">Dissertation on the Gipseys </title> (<ref target="#fig6">figure 6</ref>), in
               which a group of encamped gypsies flaunt their estover and piscary rights. </p>
               <p>This depiction of potential theft is exacerbated by the tense relationship between
               the book as commodity and the vagrant body’s supposed exclusion from commodity
               circulation. The Gypsy “thirst for glittering Gold” described in <title level="m">Dissertation on the Gypsies</title> is echoed in the glittering crest and
               gold-coated pages of the book itself, reminding the reader that the artfully-bound
               volume which collects and contains these observations may itself be an object both
               coveted and stolen. In this way, the text, which delineates a particular relationship
               between the Gypsy and personal property, participates in this construction by making
               the possibility of theft more immediate to the reader—you hold in your hand something
               that is simultaneously described as desirable to the “dangerous” gypsy vagrant. Thus,
               the text itself seems to speak the threat of theft.</p>
               <p> While vagrants were often differentiated by degree of perceived criminality, I
               maintain that considering groups as seemingly disparate as beggars, gypsies and
               highway-men under the umbrella of a threatening un-rootedness helps to clarify how
               even the most explicitly criminal of these could be appropriated by artists as
               models, objects of meditation, or catalysts for expressions of empathy, longing, and
               admiration. </p>
               <p>The competing modes of representation we see in “The Trwe [sic] Effigies of James
               Whitney, the Notorious Highwayman” (<ref target="#fig7">figure 7</ref>) from James
               Caulfield’s <title level="m">Portraits, Memories and Characters of Remarkable
                  Persons</title> (1819), speak to an ambivalence toward the Romantic criminal
               wanderer as well as to a conflation of artistic and criminal types. Though decidedly
               a criminal—defined (in part) by his roaming, un-rooted movement—Whitney is here seen
               as a leisured artist or writer dressed as though seated in his study. Comparable
               images abound in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century portraiture, attesting to what
               fashion historian Aileen Ribeiro describes as the “well-established, (even hackneyed)
               convention for artists, men of letters and musicians to be painted in loose gowns”
               (34). James Maubert’s 1695 portrait of John Dryden (poet, critic, and author of
               heroic verse) and a 1689-90 portrait of Robert Boyle (after J. Kerseboom) are but two
               examples of the long tradition upon which Whitney’s “portraitist” draws. However, the
               engraver clearly plays against these associations as well. Though the dressing gown
               is understood as comfortable domestic attire for the gentleman who works at home (or,
               more specifically, the gentleman who does not work, but has pursuits or improves
               himself at home), it is here coupled not with the usual slippers and study, but with
               markers of Whitney’s outdoor livelihood: his boots and hat. Further parodying the
               convention, Whitney directs our gaze not to his accomplishments or objects of study,
               as we often find in similar images of learned men, but rather to the shackle on his
               left ankle, underscoring his captivity and criminality. Whitney signifies as both
               artist-gentlemen and notorious outlaw, and thus the image, while static, moves the
               viewer along (at least) two separate channels of association.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The “gentlemen thief” was a salient category in
                  the Romantic imagination, exemplified by the “Prince of Pickpockets,” George
                  Barrington (1755-1804), a trained actor and London’s most notorious and celebrated
                  thief. Although arrested repeatedly, Barrington was often (supposedly) released on
                  account of his “gentlemanly demeanor and eloquence,” testifying to the slippage
                  between the categories he embodied (McCalman 417). </note> Thus, the conflation of
               types inevitably leaches out through competing vocabularies of representation—a
               process echoed by the fugitive pigments that, with time, leak across the page,
               allowing the figure to move once again as a ghostly remnant. Though all aging prints
               are subject to this chemical instability, there is something particularly haunting
               about this effect in relation to the nomadic body seemingly captured within the
               text.</p>
               <p> Whitney’s “arrest” seems particularly pronounced as he is both literally imprisoned
               and figuratively captured by the text. Yet, images of cages, prisons, and captives
               often functioned to inversely signal ideas of physical and mental liberty in
               eighteenth-century art. As Lorenz Eitner argues, unlike the allegorical
               representations of previous centuries, the Romantics turned away from the Goddesses
               of Liberty and Phrygian caps of Baroque art, toward more indirect representations of
               Liberty, primarily signaled through images of its antithesis.<note place="foot" resp="editors">There are, of course, notable exceptions (e.g.,
                  Delacroix’s <title level="m">Liberty Leading the People</title>, 1830) however,
                  Eitner persuasively argues that, in general, the Romantic period sees a movement
                  away from this type of overt allegory. </note> Compassion for prisoners, images
               that underscore the pathos of enchainment, sensational tales of prison escapes, and a
               general public sympathy for the incarcerated seem to pervade the period. Likewise,
               Eitner points out that “the prisoner’s plight became a favorite metaphor of the
               isolation or persecution of artists by society” (37). Thus, the importance of liberty
               is underscored by images that depict its absence: the bound captive, the
               long-suffering prisoner. Similarly, perhaps, static portraits of wandering types call
               to mind the mobility they negate. </p>
               <p>The representation of “Victor, the Savage of Aveyron,” (<ref target="#fig8">figure
                  8</ref>) in G.H. Wilson’s <title level="m">Eccentric Mirror</title> provides
               another instance of a wandering body both literally and figuratively captured, but
               makes more explicit the role of text in that arrest. Having wandered the woods
               unsupervised for many years, Wilson relates, Victor is finally caught by three
               sportsmen in 1798. Wilson tells us that they find “a disgusting slovenly boy,
               affected with spasmodic, and frequently with convulsive motions, continually
               balancing himself like some of the wild animals in the menagerie” (5). And yet, in
               the portrait that introduces the story, we see the clean, almost classical torso of a
               boy poised and fully contained within an elaborate set of framing devices. Though
               supposedly a child of the wilderness, in this likeness, nature is sent to the
               margins, contained and domesticated in two entwined cornucopias that pour down their
               bounty as decorative flanking. Far from a threatening or enveloping wilderness, this
               vegetation is contained and merely ornamental. However, the portrait, in which he is
               groomed but still naked, introduces an ambiguous temporality. Is this “Victor” before
               or after his capture? </p>
               <p>In a panel below, “Victor” is shown seated with a tutor learning his alphabet. Above,
               a stylus, paper, and alphabetic flashcards reiterate the theme of literacy. To the
               right, a badminton racket and birdie indicate a strategy for channeling his
               “sporadic” movement into organized sport. Together, these symbols suggest the
               disciplining of the mind and body. However, they also underscore the fraught
               relationship between the nomadic body and the text as a conduit of literacy,
               suggesting that “Victor” must be made literate in order to understand his own process
               of domestication. That is, he must be brought into literacy in order to recognize his
               own place in the text—a process underscored by the mirror-like quality of the
               medallion that contains his likeness and the way his gaze is directed at the facing
               page, on which the narrative of his life commences. The scene may narrate the process
               by which “Victor” will come to understand his own imprisonment within the text, but
               it also holds out the possibility of future self-representation. </p>
               <p>As a strategy of tying language to static forms that can thus be (at least in some
               sense) “owned,” the printed word seems inherently at odds with the itinerant subject
               it strives to depict. The historiated initials (<ref target="#fig9">figure 9</ref>)
               that populate John Thomas Smith’s <title level="m">Vagabondiana</title> speak to the
               anxieties surrounding mobility in relation to the written word as property, and
               suggest acts resistant to reductive classifications. The small human figures that
               entwine themselves around inauguratory letters molest, steal, and vandalize the words
               used to describe them in subtly subversive ways, suggesting that language—even
               written language—is never stable. The movement of these embodied letters may also
               speak to what Michel de Certeau has called the “parallelism between linguistic and
               pedestrian enunciation,” whereby walking (understood as analogous to the speech act)
               produces the possibilities it executes (99). Thus, walking, as a space of
               enunciation, can make certain possibilities “exist as well as emerge” (98). Likewise,
               the man who entwines his body with the inauguratory letter of the word “Beggary”
               simultaneously presents and performs the word that seeks to classify him. That is, he
               performs a sort of linguistic theft.</p>
               <p>The tensions registered here between nomadic bodies and the texts that strive to
               anchor them are furthered complicated by the changing understandings of texts as
               intellectual property during the Romantic period. Emerging from a Kantian
               understanding of original genius as antithetical to the <emph>spirit of
                  imitation</emph>,<note place="foot" resp="editors">As put
                  forth in the <title level="m">Critique of Pure Judgment</title> (1790). See, for
                  example, Kant 150-51. </note> Wordsworth, Coleridge, and other major literary
               figures of the period argued for a distinction between original labor and original
               genius (Saint-Amour 30-31). Ironically, as Paul Saint-Amour argues, “the Romantic
               conception of authorship revolted against the very market conditions—mechanical
               reproduction, textual commodification, logics of equivalency, labor-based copyright
               laws—that had made authorship professionally viable in the first place” (31).
               Imbedded within this idea was the belief that the artist was ahead of his time. In
               the words of Saint-Amour, the Romantic conception of Genius “was earliness
               personified: not only did geniuses do things before anyone else, they antedated even
               their own comprehensibility and consumability” (32). The Romantic roots of what would
               solidify into a more self-conscious conception of the avant-garde as the century
               progressed is worth underscoring as it coincides with changing understandings of
               intellectual property and copyright law. </p>
               <p>Between 1814 and 1842, copyright protection was expanded from 14 to 42 years, and the
               first posthumous copyright law was enacted, protecting a work for 7 years after the
               author’s death. A major catalyst for these extensions was the argument, put forth by
               Wordsworth and others, that true artistic genius could not be understood in its own
               time and thus required a postmortem window, during which its value could finally be
               recognized (Saint-Amour 32). While the idea of artistic genius far precedes the
               nineteenth century, the concern that this genius was unlikely to be sufficiently
               appreciated during the artist’s own lifetime, that the artist was “out of synch” with
               his contemporaries (explicitly not co-temporaneous), seems a peculiarly Romantic
               preoccupation, and is suggestively imbricated with assumptions about the vagrant as
               having an eccentric relationship to time. Gypsies, and to a lesser extent other
               wandering types, were consistently assumed to have prophetic powers, as countless
               representations of gypsy fortune telling and divination attest. Thus, in addition to
               a sort of spatial eccentricity, members of the wandering class were often presumed to
               have a temporal eccentricity. </p>
               <p>The origins and lineage of vagrants were often (temporally as well as geographically)
               obscured. Grellmann’s <title level="m">Dissertation</title>, for instance, spends an
               entire chapter attempting to determine from what country Gypsies originate and at
               precisely what date they came to be in England. By definition without land or title,
               vagrants were by and large excluded from the city and parish records that would give
               them a clear place in hegemonic time (further obscuring questions of origin and
               lineage). Perhaps a reflection of this ambiguity, the wandering figure is often
               constructed as a timeless, prophetic figure.<note place="foot" resp="editors">A popular subject in art of the preceding centuries, the gypsy
                  fortune-teller gained renewed cultural currency in the beginning of the nineteenth
                  century with Sir Walter Scott’s <title level="m">Guy Mannering, or, The
                     Astrologer</title>, published in 1815. The novel’s ambiguous hero, Meg
                  Merrilies, a tempestuous gypsy, and one of the most memorable literary gypsies of
                  the era, famously divines young Harry Bertram’s horoscope. Not only were
                  illustrations of this scene well known through the various prints of Scott’s
                  novel, the figure of Meg Merrilies became the popular subject of paintings and
                  poetry, including John Keats’ “Meg Merrilies,” of 1818. </note>
               </p>
               <p>Through changing copyright laws we find Romantic authors insisting on their lack of
               contemporanaiety and an attendant need for temporal freedom (through the prolonged
               life of their works). In this argument for a proto-avant garde I see a sort of
               temporal wandering, a feeling of disrootedness from one’s own era, a belief that
               artistic production is not of one time or place, but roams—not unlike those vagrant
               bodies with whom the Romantic artist so readily identifies. However, we should also
               note a certain paradox operating within this forced alliance. The Romantic conception
               of original genius, as a less tangible and heavily mythologized alternative to
               original labor (understood as industrial and solid), ostensibly resists the
               labor-based copyright laws it helps to enact—laws concerned with the production and
               distribution of texts as private commodities. </p>
               <p> To state this contradiction more precisely, at the same time that Romantic artists
               take the wandering, property-less subject as a model for creative production, they
               advocate for intellectual property laws that draw increasingly rigid boundaries
               around the intellectual-as-commodity. Concomitant, then, with the land enclosures
               that help to further dispossess the wandering class, we find a series of
                  <emph>intellectual</emph> or <emph>literary enclosures</emph> that privatize
               texts, removing them from the public domain. As an added insult, these texts
               frequently contain representations (either literary or visual) of wandering bodies,
               which they twice alienate: both in their representational arrest, and through their
               commoditization and privatization as texts operating within a capitalist economy and
               under the protection of copyright monopolies. And yet, despite this double gesture of
               appropriation and enclosure, the vagrant body is not wholly confined. Repeatedly, we
               see it surface, resist, and question the parameters of its enclosure. </p>

               <p>The following analysis considers four abolitionist satires produced by Angelo
               Agostini (1843–1910), a satiric lithographer of genius who worked in Rio de Janeiro
               in the second half of the nineteenth century. Agostini made his prints in a place and
               at a time riven with contradictions which resulted from the manner in which incipient
               urban capitalism was thrown up against the survival of a slavery system operating
               feudal social structures. Rio was a metropolitan center in which slave labor existed
               hand in hand with the development of new technologies including gas-lighting and
               steam power. Rio also had more operative photographic studios than any city in the
               world with the exception of London. Agostini, while he incorporated modern
               developments into the subject matter of his work, produced print satires which dealt
               with ancient social abuses. In their compositional complexity and metaphorical
               ambitions, many of Agostini’s works, in fact, resonate with much earlier visual
               analogues. His most successful prints are best compared with the work produced by
               James Gillray and Francisco Goya at the height of the golden age of Romantic print
               satire in England and Spain, well over half a century earlier. A detailed examination
               of some of Agostini’s more ambitious designs might open up a space in which to
               initiate understanding of the specific qualities which define Brazilian late-Romantic
               graphic art. </p>
               <p> Agostini’s designs for the journal <title level="j">O Mequetrefe</title> [“The
               Good-for-nothing”] typically focus on one central dramatic scene, which is set
               against a blank, or almost empty, backdrop. Several prints analyze slavery and
               abolition in terms of fantasies with quasi-allegorical settings. Many of the more
               effective prints use the beast-fable or draw upon well-known classical and Christian
               martyrological narratives. Their metaphorics consequently evolve out of some of the
               basic building blocks of European graphic traditions of satire. Yet what gives
               Agostini’s work its dynamism, and its unique status within graphic print satire, is
               the manner in which the visual language is infused with quintessentially Brazilian
               elements. These elements are sometimes quite literal, and involve the incorporation
               of Brazilian flora and fauna into his symbolic repertoire. Yet Agostini also does
               things with Brazilian social custom, political process, labor methods, and even the
               idiosyncrasies of the Brazilian sense of humour which are quite unprecedented. </p>
               <p>Agostini’s big, almost lumbering, prints for <title level="j">O Mequetrefe</title>
               are at their most powerful when they challenge the limits of genre and formal
               convention, and when they destabilize political truisms. At their best they share
               with late Goya, both as painter and printmaker, an expressive universality which is
               capable of getting beyond the limitations of specific political causes or the
               peccadilloes of particular politicians. <ref target="#fig1">[figure 1]</ref> The
               following print satire “ESCRAVIDÃO” (<title level="j">O Mequetrefe</title>, no. 447,
               January 14, 1888, 4-5) meditates in a general way upon slavery and emancipation, as
               Brazil teetered on the very verge of abolition. Here Agostini expands the potential
               of the beast fable by conflating antagonistic elements of realism and fantasy. He
               creates both a mythical monster, and something very real, and in this particularly
               looks straight back to Goya’s ghastly <title level="m">Fiero monstruo!</title> [Wild
               Monster!], from <title level="m">The Disasters of War</title>. Agostini’s print is
               both wise and pragmatic, and suggests that the moral dilemmas which slavery and
               emancipation generate have no simple solutions and may well lead to a violent,
               uncertain, and quite possibly ruined future. </p>
               <p>The print could not on the surface be simpler, one word “ESCRAVIDÃO” [“SLAVERY”] is
               inscribed in capitals upon the body of a crocodile, which a group of men try to
               restrain and capture. Yet despite its monumentality the print is deeply conflicted.
               On closer examination the interplay between word and image emerges as saturated in
               ambiguities. The inscription at the bottom of the print reads: “Emquanto estes não
               atam nem desatam, vem chagando o caçdor que lhe dará o <hi rend="underline">coup de
                  grace</hi>.” [“The huntsmen, really don’t want to let it go, they move forward to
               make the <foreign>coup de grace</foreign>”]. The print seems to say that, whether
               they want to or not, the politicians must slay the monster slavery, and yet to kill
               slavery they must paradoxically let go of it.</p>
               <p>This print uses narrative and stylistic shock tactics; it appears to be naturalistic,
               but juxtaposes antagonistic realities. The naturalism is consequently layered and
               charged, for the drawing throws into bizarre collision two contexts which, although
               both realistically observed, would never normally co-exist. A specific set of
               caricatured, fashionably accoutred, and spectacularly bourgeois Rio politicians
               express intense psychological anxiety. They experience their extreme emotion over the
               issue of abolition, yet this emotion is combined with a realistic rendering of the
               technical methods used by professional crocodile hunters, as they restrain their very
               real and very dangerous prey, prior to executing it. The print is built upon an
               ingenious and confusing contradiction which is cleverly embedded in a pun on the verb
               “desatar.” “Desatar” means in its most immediate sense “to let go,” or “to untie,”
               but also carries, or implies, many other meanings including “to release from
               captivity a person or animal,” “to liberate,” “to give up control over,” and “to
               become unravelled” (<title level="m">Novo Michaelis</title>). Finally there is a set
               of meanings leaning towards desertion, in its familiar English sense: the verb can
               imply the withdrawal of involvement in a thing or project, the act of walking away.
               Viewed as the center of a web of possible significations, the crucial verb
               consequently takes on a series of disconcerting political inferences. The politicians
               don’t want “to let slavery go” in each and every one of these possible senses. They
               don’t want to end the system of bondage they are familiar with and responsible for,
               and they don’t want to let the monster they have both created, and which they
               control, go loose. The paradox at the heart of the satire can be summarized as
               follows: in order to kill slavery the slave power must commit an act of emancipation.
               But of course this is “to let slavery go” in a further sense, to release it into a
               chaotic future in the form of an unknown and untried socio-cultural phenomenon,
               “freedom.” It is in this context that several of the secondary meanings of
                  “<emph>desatar</emph>”—“to unravel,” “to come apart”—become prominent. In this
               sense the real crocodile is not mere “slavery” but a more horrifying prospect: the
               politicians” internalised terror of “freedom.” </p>
               <p>The print consequently articulates a social and psychological dilemma, the idea that
               slavery may become much more potentially lethal for the former slave owners once it
               is reconstituted in the form of a concrete mass liberation. The print looks out with
               a certain unflinching—not to say grim—pragmatism, at the reality of emancipation for
               a slave-holding empire. Written into this metaphoric crocodile is a terror of the
               effects of emancipation which cuts two ways. Once it has been let-go-of, what will
               this freed crocodile of slavery/liberty represent, how will things fall apart, in
               what form will the snapping jaws manifest themselves? The two extremes of violence
               held in balance in this print—one liberationist, one repressive—embody two possible
               but apparently irreconcilable futures. One might be manifested in the violence of the
               ex-slavers, in the expression of a colossal resentment and in a continued desire to
               re-impose control and to exploit. The other might be manifested in the fury and
               revolutionary potential of a slave population bent on revenge and pumped up for it by
               centuries of persecution. </p>
               <p>In its ideological interrogation of slavery and freedom through a metaphorics of
               monstrism, this print makes significant intellectual advances upon the extant
               tradition of Anglo-American abolition graphics. When this print was made it was
               building upon—while simultaneously interrogating—a longstanding tradition of late
               eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century English and American abolition prints which
               had shown slavery as a monster. Yet this monster invariably took the form of a
               rampant and insatiable force of evil. The most common manifestation was a rabid,
               often animalized, planter with a whip, or a knife, or instruments of torture,
               actively tearing into slave bodies. Other examples depicted slavery as a serpent or
               fantastic dragon with crocodilian elements. Slavery appeared conveniently allegorized
               and distanyiated; it was invariably an inhuman mythologized force of evil actively
               consuming the slave body in acts of brutality and torture. Demonic, bestial,
               anarchic, and sadistic, it was an evil “other” which abolition as a manifestation of
               the civilized power of developed and enlightened nations needed to kill off (Wood,
               2000, 95-101; Wood 2010, 112-30).</p>
               <p>The novelty and shocking Brazilian-ness of Agostini’s work emerges in the manner in
               which he makes slavery into such a naturalistic beast. To show slavery as a very
               realistic salt-water crocodile, being restrained according to a system of capture
               used by coastal Indians in the Northeast then (and to this day) is disconcerting at a
               number of levels. The creature is not simply emblematic or allegorical in the manner
               of earlier abolition prints, but it is complicated by its documentary naturalism. If
               the label “slavery” is removed from its side, what we have is a very lifelike
               crocodile being disabled by having its two natural weapons—the muscular tail, and the
               deadly jaws—bound up and tied down. The crocodile squats on a muddy shoreline, very
               reminiscent of endless mangrove swamps of the Northeast, of Penambuco and Alagoas.
               The scrubby intertwining trees in the background reaching down to the tide-line
               appear to be mangroves. The men at the back are lashing the tail to a tree to
               immobilize it, one bracing himself by the knee against the trunk to get better
               purchase; the men at the front have bound the jaws together, and are keeping the
               crocodile fully extended in order that it cannot exert any leverage. The crocodile’s
               fore and back legs grip the muddy bank in an attempt to hold their ground, while the
               body is accurately drawn and exists as one serpentine torpedo of muscle. In spatial
               terms the print is wonderfully ordered. The whole thing is set on a tilt; on the
               slide, the knotted groups of politicians forced out to the right and left desperately
               fight to stay where they are, to stop the beast, aided by the inevitable forces of
               gravity, drawing them back into the waters from which it was seized. </p>
               <p>The satiric brilliance of the print lies in throwing such a precisely observed
               description of the genuine technique used to catch a crocodile up against the fantasy
               of the politicians, who have jumped in from another world, decked out in the
               fashionable European costumes of Rio power-brokers. These gentleman politicians,
               complete with bow ties, wing collars, and elegant Victorian trews, slither awkwardly
               about in the dirt, pushed out to the margins of the composition, with the monster of
               slavery clearly at the center of attention for the viewer and the would-be captors
               alike. We are given a world on the slide, where the majority of the surface areas is
               composed of a blank wall of mud. The animal belongs to the landscape, and is at home
               on Brazilian water, Brazilian land, or in a soupy mixture of the two. It is the
               politicians in their European borrowed robes and their precarious patent leather
               shoes, who are the alien presence. They are moving out of their depth, and as they
               slither on the bank, the mud which they slide upon—and which entraps them—is also a
               symbol of political corruption. </p>
               <p>These men come off as truly out of their element, artificial, somehow foreign; they
               attempt to battle a natural force which is at home, angry, and resistant. One strong
               reading of the print is as a pessimistic and pragmatic warning that modern Brazil
               should simply walk away from, or blank out, the horror of its slavery inheritance.
               Viewed this way, the print warns that <emph>if</emph> slavery constitutes a saurian
               horror as terrible and as fierce as the politicians envision, then what is the point
               of civilized men trying to capture and restrain it? Surely it is better to leave it
               alone, to live out its sinister existence in peaceful, invisible oblivion within the
               muddy waters which the politicians dare not enter. What the water means in this print
               is consequently also open to conjecture—it is a natural element which is itself both
               symbolically and literally obscure. It is not easy to know what to make of this slow
               impenetrable element which flows out to the bottom-right-hand corner of the print and
               out beyond the margins of the picture. The Atlantic ocean was, of course, the route
               by which the entire slave population of Brazil was originally imported, yet the ocean
               is also an ancient and profound metaphor for freedom. This swamp shoreline may be the
               sign of an ambiguous and torpid freedom, but what sort of freedom lurks in mud? Is it
               freedom for the slaves and the politicians to live together in the warm, dark,
               maternal waters of a post-emancipation Brazil, or the ironic freedom for slavery to
               continue to endure, renamed but essentially unchanged? As with so many of Gillray’s
               greatest political satires, Agostini finally refuses to give the viewer any simple
               final answer, and in this sense addresses the impossible legacy of slavery with a
               maturity that confronts—indeed embraces—conflict and contradiction.</p>
               <p>In the best of the work he did for <title level="j">O Mequetrefe</title>, Agostini
               takes the political lithograph into new satiric and descriptive territories, and his
               innovations seem to grow out of his ability to embrace elements which photography had
               introduced into visual culture. At what may initially seem to be its most simple
               level, the influence of photography upon Agostini’s print technique relates to the
               pure power of documentary realism. Creating political propaganda by adopting an
               aesthetic of “less is more,” Agostini was capable of harnessing within his
               lithographs the objective visual energies generated by photography. Photography had
               injected new and unsettling elements of realism into the conventions of many extant
               visual genres including portraiture, landscape and the <emph>tableau vivant</emph>.
               In the following print he fuses all three of these areas to create what remains a
               genuinely unnerving interrogation of slavery and ignorance. </p>
               <p>
                  <ref target="#fig2">[figure 2]</ref> The title of “O supplicio do escravo Bernardo
               (Vide o texto),” [“The Entreaty of the Slave Bernardo (look at the text)”] (<title level="j">O Mequetrefe</title>, no. 435, May 28, 1887, 4-5) directs the reader to
               a long accompanying article which takes up the two preceding pages of the issue.
               Under the stark headline “Um Crime Impune” [“An Unpunished Crime”], the text gives a
               melodramatic account of the circumstances leading up to the death of Bernardo as a
               result of his prolonged torture and abuse at the hands of a gentleman, one Antonio de
               Atahyde e Souza, described as “a widower, farmer and native of Portugal.” Bernardo,
               who had been given his emancipation papers a year earlier on 4 March 1886, was still
               being kept as a slave by Atahyde. The “slave” had gone to the authorities to state
               that he was free and to complain of his abuse at the hands of Atahyde, only to be
               returned to the now irritated “master.” Bernardo was put in the stocks then
               repeatedly whipped and beaten, the abuse leading to terrible wounding of his back and
               buttocks. He finally died when he was subsequently kept in the stocks. He lay on a
               cold brick floor for 52 hours without food or water, and continually aggravated his
               wounds by rubbing them against the floor. The statement that Bernardo lay there all
               night, in his agony grinding his injuries into the stone and dirt, came from a slave
               witness, and are seen by the article’s author as opening the way into an imagined
               world of unending pain: “What a prolonged and dolorous agony now saturates these
               words!” Despite the exhumation and examination of the corpse, and the presentation of
               medical testimony to the authorities, Atahyde was never prosecuted. The article ends
               with outraged condemnation not only of all who participated in the atrocity, but with
               the statement that if such things can happen in this nation, then Brazil itself is “a
               land of barbarians.”</p>
               <p> Agostini’s task was to create, within a single visual narrative, a commentary on
               this all too typical—and in fact all too commonly reported—little set of
               circumstances. The choice of subject and the descriptive method are quite different
               from anything that had appeared in earlier print satire dealing with slave trauma in
               Europe and North America. The approach Agostini adopts is also dramatically
               different, in rhetorical terms, from that of the written text. He opts for a strategy
               of severe restraint and narrative understatement. The moment and the event he chooses
               to describe are carefully choreographed. The viewer is placed inside the outhouse in
               which the atrocity occurs. We stand on the same brick floor on which Bernardo is
               tortured, and witness the beginning of his ordeal, knowing that the violence we
               witness will damage his body in ways which then cause his lonely and extended death
               during the ensuing night. The design ironically exploits its landscape format. The
               middle and background of the print consists of a view of the farmhouse, and
               outbuildings poking up from a sloping field. It is the sort of outside view that
               people never bothered to paint, but which the camera frequently would record,
               because, quite simply, it is there. The ordinary, open, calm, uninhabited suburban
               land is monumentally banal: a silent everyday backdrop for a banal, silent, everyday
               event expressing the limitless power of slavery. The foreground, on the other hand,
               is formally dramatic, and occurs, like so many narrative studio photographs of the
               period, within a narrow stage-like foreground, complete with proscenium-style frame
               and props. Part of the satire’s power comes from the manner in which it suggests
               frozen action upon a stage—in other words a <foreign>tableau vivant</foreign>. The
               composition is set up through a series of strict rectilinear forms and spaces. The
               outhouse architecture sternly encases the human action, a large horizontal beam runs
               across the top, and two vertical beams point down, like mighty arrows, into the
               composition. Set at a slightly oblique angle against this stark frame are two
               rectangular box forms: the first is the massive stocks, the second the packing case
               upon which Atahyde sits. The stocks itself is drawn with great accuracy, and
               precisely conforms to the typical structure of the communal <foreign>tronco</foreign>
               which occupied such a central and self-consciously dramatic symbolic space in the
                  <foreign>fazendas</foreign> and town squares of nineteenth-century Brazil. Made of
               hardwood, these vast structures, with their geometric holes, still stand in public
               spaces and museums across the Northeast of Brazil. But Agostini insists that the
                  <foreign>tronco</foreign> is not a theatrical monument to the memory of slavery,
               but merely a useful part of the furniture of the farm outhouse. It thrusts
               dramatically into the composition from the left. The far end remains invisible,
               shooting out of the picture frame and suggesting that there is no end to this
               terrible set of parallel lines.</p>
               <p>The most charged space of visual/emotional punctuation in this print are the sets of
               black holes into and out of which the slave limbs penetrate. The great planks are
               periodically cut through by these ghastly geometrical orifices, circles which are
               obscenely polished pebble-smooth by the twisting limbs of innumerable victims over
               immemorial time. The manner in which Agostini inhabits these holes is inspired. On
               the left of the design, the further set are filled by two anonymous legs, the body
               tumbling back and out of the left margin of the design. This faceless disembodied
               victim is challenging us as witnesses to give him, or her, an identity, to make the
               suffering mean something. These are perhaps two of the most traumatically-charged
               legs and feet in the slavery archive. This fragmented body serves, in compositional
               terms, to provide a counterweight to Bernardo’s body. As he lies left to right, the
               other body lies right to left, the space between the two supine victims providing the
               dramatic stage inhabited by the slave with the whip, who is about to begin the
               process of flagellating Bernardo. The knotted flail which he raises has several
               lashes, and each is weighted with pieces of lead. One detail is terrific, pushed up
               above the horizon line of the <foreign>tronco</foreign> we see four toes. These
               pitiful digits are the only part of any body which reaches though a hole and becomes
               visible out beyond the stocks, inhabiting the free space of the landscape. The toes
               “stand” there, yet because of the perspectival trickery of the composition, the
               strands of the cat-of-nine-tails dance around these naked parts of a foot,
               emphasising that there is no escape, no free space, no way out of this world of
               arbitrary torment.</p>
               <p>The display of Bernardo’s smooth, unblemished back has something ghastly about it,
               and only the whipper and ourselves (existing as viewers who are both witnesses and
               accomplices) are privileged to see this. Much of the extraordinary power of this
               design comes from the sense of separateness; there is the constant intimation that
               the scene which we are witnessing is cut off from the eyes of the rest of the world.
               The ultimate terror which the narrative embodies relates to the fact that the only
               white witness, the torturer himself, seems completely oblivious—or to use the
               vernacular phrase “out of it.” The vertical support beam creates a separate
               performative space for Atahyde; he is set up in his own little compartment on the
               right hand margin, almost as if he is posing in a studio for his portrait. His visual
               independence from the rest of the composition is striking; he could be cut off from
               the page with a pair of scissors. He would then exist as a powerful portrait study,
               and nothing would suggest the horror which he is at the heart of. Again Agostini has
               given slave power a new kind of face: this is a modern man, an urban gent, a man who
               could step straight into a Machado de Assis dinner party. He has a manicured beard,
               and elegant brushed back grey hair. He is dressed in a city suit, with white wing
               collar and bow tie, and is holding a large cigar with casual ease in his right hand,
               his left hand resting on the box top. He doesn’t look particularly good or bad, he
               doesn’t look handsome or ugly, he doesn’t look at all. There is no moral decay or
               inuman barbarity written into this face, there is no emotional engagement of any
               sort. He just looks like anyone else, a dull man who is spectacularly unexcited and
               unaware, locked into thinking his own unexceptional thoughts. The crucial thing is
               the detachment: a psychological detachment to match the spatial one. What defines
               both this man’s evil, and the social tragedy his actions create, is the fact that
               there is no sadistic engagement in what he has instigated, and no interest in what is
               happening or will happen. Agostini has risen above the melodrama and sadism with
               which the Anglo-American abolition archive had so energetically and easily demonized
               the slave power. Rejecting the easy and pornographic spectacle of grinning planters
               bathed in the blood of writhing mulattas, or of slaves foundering in boiling vats of
               sugar cane juice, Agostini has given us something far more terrifying and of
               infinitely greater moral worth. Agostini has created slavery in the form of a modern
               monster: a placid, passive being, complacent within the mantle of its assumed
               superiority. </p>
               <p>Agostini takes a mundane story of pointless violence and attempts to explain both why
               it happened and why it will never be prosecuted. While the journalist rants and sends
               up rhetorical fireworks of arch sarcasm, Agostini grimly exposes the silent
               confidence, the meditative oblivion, the transcendent impunity of the slave power.
               Agostini is the only artist I have come across who, in a spirit of furious satire,
               could show the smooth-faced, calm, unimpeachably well mannered appearance which
               Brazilian slavery presented to the world, even at the brutal instant when it did its
               very worst. </p>
               <p>As abolitionist propaganda reached a crescendo in the late 1880s, Agostini produced
               work which seemed to push at more and more aesthetic boundaries. In February of 1888,
               only five months before the passage of the Golden Law abolishing slavery, the
               Brazilian media suddenly became fixated upon a certain extreme case of slave abuse.
               Two small slave girls, Joanna and Eduarda, had been kept in a cellar, starved,
               beaten, burned with irons, and systematically tortured over months by an insanely
               cruel mistress, who shamefully had connections with the Royal Court. The great
               mulatto journalist, propagandist, and abolition leader Jose do Patrocinio had been
               tipped off about the case, and published a series of articles concerning the abuse.
               The case became a <foreign>cause celèbre</foreign>, and a local photographer, one
               Heitor, was called in to make a series of portraits of the traumatised, scarred, and
               swollen children who were also displayed in public. Agostini contributed to the cause
               and used the photograph as the basis for a lithographic portrait <ref target="#fig3">[figure 3]</ref>
                  <title level="m">Os fructos de perversidade</title> [“The fruits of perversity”]
                  (<title level="j">O Mequetrefe</title> no. 399, 10 February 1886, 8). In giving
               this portrait of horror such a simple brief ironic title he achieves a disgusted
               aphoristic extremity reminiscent of the sparse sarcastic linguistic fury which
               energizes certain of the captions of Goya’s <title level="m">Disasters of
               War</title>—for example, “This brings you luck,” (beneath a grotesque scene of
               torture) or “This is what you were born for” (The caption for an image of a man
               vomiting over a pile of corpses). But Agostini is working in a different technical
               world from that of Goya, and the power of this work comes out of the way it explores
               a peculiar empathy between the qualities of early photographs and stone lithography.
               The portrait that Agostini developed out of Heitor’s photograph maintains—even though
               we are now familiar with the graphic representation of extreme abuse through many
               millions of photographic images generated across the vast tracts of useless violence
               which constitute twentieth-century history—the power to hold our attention. The icon
               of these two small female victims is so unforgiving, and it whips up a combination of
               things that is almost unbearable to see united. There is the pathos of the shabby
               dirty little one-piece utility frocks, collarless, shapeless, ragged at hem and cut
               off sleeves, tied at the waist with string. This is clothing which informs us that
               slavery was a mass institution, that its victims wore uniforms. This is the clothing
               of the work-house, and the industrial factory floor before there were child labor and
               factory acts. This is the clothing which systems of ultimate abuse put on children,
               when they no longer respect or see the innocence they embody. There is the fact that
               one girl is taller than the other, the fact that the shorter one goes barefoot, while
               the taller one wears thin slippers. There is the fact of physical stiffness
               saturating such young bodies. They are bent, prematurely stooped at the waist, lost
               in some sort of space we can never understand, upright but teetering, going nowhere,
               futureless, out of time, forcing us to stay there with them for as long as we can
               take it. The arms out in front reaching into thin air are like a blind person's; they
               are held down and out, they are damaged, useless, bandaged at all four wrists. The
               hands are swollen, the one hand held palm upwards, with the faintest suggestion that
               it is waiting to receive the stigmata, or maybe pleading, or maybe begging, or maybe
               just fractured. Rhetorically more forceful than anything, the fact of isolation—the
               visual fact that in their dumb pain these two little girls, standing so close, do not
               reach out to each other, do not seek to touch, to hold hands, but let their hands
               hang, unfelt in space, because maybe it would hurt too much to make contact with
               anything or anyone, maybe because they inhabit a world of pain where it is
               inconceivable that anyone else can be alive to share it. And then those unspeaking,
               unspeakable, heads, hair shorn like adult felons, or victims of disease, or
               inhabitants of the lager. The large visible ears of the figure on the left have a
               dreadful fragility, a delicate nakedness, that makes us wonder what ghastly and
               unrecoverable sounds they have had to hear. And finally those faces, the faces of
               children beaten into an ageless, genderless, fissured pulp. The foreheads rent with
               sharp slits, precise cuts which Lucio Fontana would have appreciated, and the eyes
               closed, one would say looking down, but these faces seem driven so far beyond the
               capacity to see anything. That simple horizon line, and the barest indication of the
               uneven ground on which they stand, are the only things that locate these icons of the
               human crime of Atlantic slavery in time and space. And yet the patterns the bandages
               make, and the way the black flesh moves in and out of the clothing, is formally
               beautiful.</p>
               <p>Maybe one way to come at the magnitude of Agostini’s achievement in the portrait of
               Joanna and Eduarda is to think about the other options that might have been
               available. What if he had decided to turn the whole event into something more like a
               comic strip, and tried to link it, as some sort of proto-graphic novel, into the
               general concerns of the abolition movement? What if he had done this, yet opted to
               incorporate elements of documentary realism as charged with an hallucinogenic realism
               as those of Goya’s <title level="m">Disaster’s of War</title>, and as infused with
               human metamorphoses and animalizations as extreme as those of Gillray at his wildest?
               We get some idea both of how deeply the event struck Agostini’s imagination, and of
               his ability to draw on a European graphic inheritance, by the fact that he did
               exactly this. <ref target="#fig4">[figure 4]</ref> Here is the alternative
               interpretation of the outrage of Joanna and Eduarda which appeared in <title level="j">Revista Illustrada</title> (no. 427, 18 February 1886, 8) eight days
               after the portrait in <title level="j">O Mequetrefe</title>.</p>
               <p>In this remarkable sheet, Agostini has gone for a very different narrative and
               aesthetic approach. He draws again upon photographic resources, but also takes up
               narrative techniques which were developed in the older single-sheet,
               compartmentalized narrative prints of Europe (Kunzle, 1973). Then beyond this, the
               print even seems to anticipate cinematic techniques. The print incorporates a series
               of long and short views, sequential narrative, and shocking surreal montage effects
               to express outrage. The page works through seven vignettes that are to be read,
               initially, from left to right, top to bottom. Yet these images also set up dramatic
               sets of contrasts if read vertically or through diagonals. The sudden jumps in scale
               and viewpoint encourage such visual mixing and matching on the part of the viewer,
               the whole page is in spatial terms radically unstable and so invites us to throw away
               visual convention in responding to it. It is as if the outrageousness of what we are
               being shown requires a new way of telling a visual story to do it justice.</p>
               <p>The top two scenes take up about a third of the page, and consist of a
               middle-distance crowd scene and of a close-up double portrait. The first image to
               left shows the girls being displayed in public by the two abolitionist propagandists.
               Beneath the caption reads: “<foreign>Naõ é só no interior que se commettem crimes
                  contra os escravos. As pretas Eduarda e Joanna levadas ás redacções dos jornaes
                  pelo José do Patrocinio e João Clapp provam que na Corte tambem ha
                  verdugos</foreign>.” [“It is not only in the interior that crimes are committed
               against the slaves. The blacks Eduarda and Joanna, taken up in the newspaper articles
               of José do Patrocinio and João Clapp prove that even at Court there are inhuman
               torturers”]. Agostini starts out, then, by attempting to break down a stereotype
               which still pervades attitudes to slave abuse today. Slavery is not something that
               happens away from civilization and urban centers, in “the interior,” out of site,
               amongst barbarian slave-holders. Again, this is a blow against the emotional
               extremism of European Romantic and Sentimental constructions of slave abuse. Agostini
               focuses on the point that the most extreme abuse of defenseless children is happening
               in the heart of the most modern city in Latin America, the then-capital of Brazil,
               Rio da Janeiro, and further that it is being perpetrated by female aristocrats. The
               crowd that surrounds the two white-clad, staggering girls is not done up in the
               stereotypical attire of the tropical planter, but is dressed in top hats and dark
               suits. The lady who exits the frame at right, and towards whom Patrocinio gestures,
               wears a crinoline and bonnet, and is probably not dressed unlike the lady
               responsbible for torturing these children. All these figures, with the exception of
               the victims, could be transplanted to the streets of central London, Paris, or New
               York with no difficulty. The next scene uses a “zoom” technique to focus in on the
               two girls in close-up, but again looks down from a slightly elevated view-point. This
               portrait is a miniature variation on the full-sized and full-figure portrait Agostini
               had produced for <title level="j">O Mequetrefe</title>. It is based on another of the
               photographs of the girls taken by Heitor, and again shows two victims front on,
               almost blinded by beatings, and with their faces completely wounded and disfigured.
               The caption is simple and factual: “Heitor, the photographer, took the portrait of
               these two vicims, nearly blinded from beating, and with their faces cut up and
               disfigured” [“O photographo Heitor tirou o retrato das duas infelizes, quasi cegas de
               pancadas, e com o rosto todo ferido e desfigurado”]. There are major differences
               between this portrait and the earlier one. This time the girls are shown
               three-quarter figure, and seated. The older of the two girls has the top of her dress
               taken down over her shoulders, uncovering the top part of her breasts, while the
               younger girl’s top remains firmly buttoned up. The effect is to suggest both the
               femininity and the girlish vulnerability of the victims. This device, partially
               unclothing one girl while leaving the other dressed, is used to force the viewer to
               see both of them as abused yet as on display. The hint of sexualised voyeurism in the
               double portrait requires the viewer to remember that these girls, although children,
               are slaves, and as such are sexually available to whoever owns them. There are no
               limits to what the owner can do to either body, as Aime Cesaire instructed, “you can
               do anything” to any slave body. Yet as we as viewers look at these bodies, we are
               made aware of a terrible ambiguity: we cannot tell if they are looking back at us.
               The image is terrifying because of the way it upends the conventions of the full-face
               portrait. Normally we would expect to look into the eyes of the viewer, but here we
               cannot tell where their eyes are directed, or indeed if they have any eyes left. They
               may be looking at us or into some blood-filled haze; their children’s eyes appear
               completely swollen shut.</p>
               <p>The third, fourth, and fifth vignettes fill the middle section of the image, but only
               about one quarter of the space. These intense little views constitute, if the page is
               seen as a whole, the filling in a visual sandwich. For these scenes of the official
               response to the death of one of the girls, Agostini has pulled right back for a
               distant view, almost a wide-angled set of scenes. The effect is to remove us, to take
               us out of the action, to make us distant and less intimate viewers; peering into the
               scenes from far away, we are forced to try and work out what is going on. The third
               scene suddenly shows the girl we have just been looking at, the older of the pair,
               Joanna, now stretched out and completely undressed apart from a sheet over her
               abdomen acting as a sort of forensic modesty veil. She has passed from alive,
               tortured, seated, and partially clothed, to dead, supine, beyond pain, and unclothed.
               Again the prose is tight and factual, reflecting the nature of the scene we are
               witness to: “Three days later the unfortunate female Joanna found herself in the
               Morgue, where several doctors carried out the autopsy, they declared that she died
               from tuberculosis aggravated by maltreatment” [<foreign>“Tres dias depois a miserera
                  Joanna achava se no Necroterio, onde varios medicos, precendendro a autopsia,
                  declaravaram ter ella fallecido de uma tubercolose aggravada por maus
                  tratos</foreign>”]. There is no false sentiment here, only the facts of the case,
               and the uneasy conclusion that the doctors found the cause of death to be TB and not
               the direct result of her extended torture. She, and the doctors who stand around her,
               are shown only about one quarter the size of the figure she was when alive. In death
               she gets a surfeit of medical attention from the best doctors around, she has become
               a tragic celebrity, and at the same time an object of medical curiosity. </p>
               <p>The next two vignettes are drawn from the same distant perspective, but move from
               inside to outside, and show the funeral procession of the girl and her interment. The
               captions take up the theme of celebrity and tell us that Joanna’s death has now
               become the concern and responsibility of the abolitionists: “The Abolition
               Confederation accompanied her to the Cemetery and conducted the burial” [“<foreign>A
                  Confederação Abolicionista fez o enterro, acompanhandora até o
               Cemeterio</foreign>”]. From an elevated viewpoint, as if looking down from a window,
               we see an elaborate procession entering the cemetery gates, and incorporating a
               series of horse drawn carriages. The furthest away comprises a glass-sided and
               elaborately-decorated funeral carriage, Joanna’s body visible to the public. This is
               the sort of spectacular funeral arrangement which would normally be reserved for
               aristocracy or celebrity—Joanna, in death, has become a <foreign>cause
                  celebre</foreign>. The last of the middle scenes shows the scene at the graveside.
               Only at this point does the print, through the caption, pass from grim and
               uninflected social reportage into openly satiric mode. The caption announces: “On top
               of the coffin, beside a garland of flowers, her emancipation certificate was nailed!”
                  [“<foreign>Sobre o caixão, ao lado de uma grinalda, achava-se pregada a sua carta
                  de liberdade!</foreign>”]. Death is here ironized and literalized as the final
               form of liberation for the slave. </p>
               <p>This shift into dark humour allows the print to pass into its final stage, which
               replaces the stark documentary naturalism of the earlier artwork with something that
               borders upon surreal fantasy. In its sudden transfusion this imagery looks weird, and
               yet all Agostini has done is suddenly return to the language of his
               eighteenth-century progenitors. The fantasy, of course, looks directly back to the
               collective animalizations which invigorate countless Gillray satires, and the <title level="m">Capricios</title> of Goya. The bottom half of the print is dominated by
               a strange scene in which two caricatured males are shown surrounded by a menagerie of
               domestic birds and beasts. A small Pierrot-style juvenile in striped body suit,
               wearing a fool’s cap, and clutching a giant pen, bends over them at right. The
               elaborate caption draws out the satire: <quote>

                     all these horrors of slavery, we must not lose heart. The philanthropic spirit

                  </quote> Agostini suddenly shifts attention to the social world in which the
               abolitionists must function and make themselves heard. The surge for animal rights
               had been inaugurated in Europe and America, at exactly same moment as abolition, and
               disconcertingly, often existed in an explicit relationship to it. Animal rights
               rapidly lead to the foundation of the humane societies in Europe and North America in
               the latter half of the nineteenth century, and was also making headway with the
               emergent middle classes of Brazil’s urban centers. This final part of the print is,
               then, a very ingenious and very serious confrontation with a series of issues
               relating to the equation of animals with slaves first evolved in the abolition
               literatures of Europe from 1780-1833 (Wood, 2003, 398-406). This problematic equation
               involves the moral levelling of the rights of human slaves with those of farm
               livestock, an ethical descent which was explicitly legitimized by the slave codes.
               Yet beyond this, the equation incorporates the blurring of the moral boundaries
               between human rights and animal rights, which arose in the wake of the new emotional
               bourgeois concerns for the feelings of animals. Agostini focuses on the insane moral
               contradictions which can allow a society to maintain slavery with all its attendant
               cruelties, while officially buying into the new universal sentimentalism fixated on
               animal rights. The attack works by suggesting that abolitionists need not despair,
               for if Brazil’s elite are prepared to begin by feeling sympathy for beasts, then who
               knows—in time they might feel some pity for African slaves. The design plays cleverly
               with conventional animal symbolism: the two politicians, notorious pro-slavery
               figures singled out in the text for their support of the new animal rights society,
               are shown attached to their bestial symbols. Gonçalves embraces an ass, while a pig
               squats at his feet, and a dog jumps up his leg. The associations of these animals
               relate to stupidity, greed, and servility. Bastos has a gesturing ape on his
               shoulder, the traditional symbol of both foolishness and lust. Bastos, in top hat and
               tail-coat, also holds a large angora rabbit under his arm, and looks exactly like a
               magician who has produced a rabbit out of a hat. The implication is that if these two
               can get away with this piece of political chicanery, they can, in the public’s eyes,
               get away with anything.</p>
               <p>The final phrase is a superb and typically Agostinian pun. While on the surface it is
               a cry of applause for the saviours of the animals, the word
                  “<foreign>bicharia</foreign>” can also mean a crowd of people, or a heap of
               vermin. Are we looking at protectors of animals, or protectors of a crowd of people,
               because the slaves should have—indeed from an ultimate humanitarian perspective
                  <emph>do</emph> have—the same rights as animals? Or is it a venom-spitting finale
               saying that the politicians, their followers, and the animal rights activists are all
               a pile of vermin, as long as they cannot feel for the slaves? There may also be an
               obscene pun on the colloquial meaning of “<foreign>bicha</foreign>” designating a low
               form of homosexual. No wonder the little figure on the right, who runs through the
               pages of <title level="j">Revista Illustrada</title> and is representative of
               Agostini’s satiric muse, gazes in childish amazement at all he has seen in the page
               opposite and above. The very last scene, bottom right, shows the little satirist
               simply giving up. In Juvenalian mode he declares: “This country of ours really does
               take the cake!” [<foreign>Esta nossa terra é um cumulo!</foreign>]. He gives the
               whole thing up—the ghastly joke is beyond the powers of satire—and seems to echo the
               famous declaration from Juvenal’s first satire, that in a world of utterly depraved
               contradiction “it is difficult not to write satire” [“difficile est saturam non
               scribere”]. The satire Agostini has created has achieved a novel shock effect, one
               that comes out of forcing the collision of two hitherto-unknown worlds. The new world
               of photographic documenatry realism and the old world of the transposed beast fable
               (transmogrified into high satiric art by the etching needles of Goya and Gillray) are
               thrown into each others’ arms on terms of aesthetic equality.</p>
