<head>About the Design and Markup</head>
<p rend="noCount">This volume was designed at the University of Maryland by Michael Quilligan, Site Manager at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style applied by Michael Quilligan. TEI renders text in archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the XSLT transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. The image associated with this edition includes elements from an engraving by John Burnet (after William Allan), <ref target="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/antiquarianism/images/HillFig3.jpg">
<title level="m">Sir Walter Scott in his Study</title> (1831)</ref>, which is used as an illustration in <ref target="praxis.antiquarianism.2014.hill.html">Rosemary Hill's essay</ref> in this volume. This image is from Dr. Hill's private collection and is used with permission.</p>

<head>About the <title level="s">Romantic Circles Praxis
					Series</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is devoted to
					using computer technologies for the contemporary critical
					investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and
					theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of
					Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge,
					<title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world
					where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a
					period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on
					the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the
					intellectual and theoretical discussions of today.
					<title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this terrain with
					the best and most exciting critical writing of
					contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>

</head>
<p rend="noCount">In their Introduction to <title level="m">Romantic Antiquarianism</title>, Noah Heringman and Crystal B. Lake survey the history of antiquarianism and theorize its practices, concluding with an overview of the seven essays in this volume.  Paying particular attention to antiquarianism in popular culture, Heringman and Lake seek to redress the critical tendency to isolate antiquarianism as an amateurish fad, an eccentric pastime of interest to only a few specialists, or a discourse concerned primarily with documents and texts.  Instead, Heringman and Lake position antiquarianism as an embodied practice in which ancient objects themselves exerted a powerful influence on the process and products of knowledge work.  Increasingly specialized study of periods and types of objects shaped the networks that linked antiquaries, engravers, and publishers with a public eager to experience in detail the customs and manners or material culture of the past.  The introduction places a special emphasis on remediation as a rubric for understanding how antiquarian practices informed the circulation of ancient and medieval objects and their representations in the Romantic period.</p>

</head>
<p rend="noCount">Historical writing on landscape painting in 18th and 19th century Britain has often been guided by a distinction between topography and the Sublime. The sharp line thus drawn between the routine and the exceptional, the plain and the imaginative, the derided and the elevated, matches that drawn between antiquarianism and the modern discipline of history. By exploring two images by the nineteenth century artist John Martin which defy or confuse these various distinctions, this essay seeks to complicate our sense of landscape painting’s history and its relationship with topography and antiquarian image-making.</p>

<anchor xml:id="SachsAbstract"/>Jonathan Sachs</hi>, <title level="a">Poetical Geography: The Place of the Antiquarian and the Situatedness of Literature</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">This article explores problematic relation between the local, the national, and the international in antiquarianism through a focus on the issue of place in antiquarian writings. It looks specifically at the argument that literature can best be understood in its original place of composition as articulated in the writings of Robert Wood. By shifting emphasis from Wood’s later writing on Homer to his first published work, <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> (1753), the article suggests that Wood is not a late entrant but an early contributor to the "media environment" of the mid-eighteenth century, an environment characterized by the belief that poetry originates in an early stage of society, that it is composed orally, that it expresses the local particularity of landscapes and national or tribal culture, and that it can properly be traced and recovered by ethnographic, first-hand engagement with its place of origin. That Wood's theory of ancient poetry echoes (and perhaps anticipates) the later work of Percy, Ritson, Scott and others underscores not the separation but the proximity and overlapping concerns of popular antiquarianism with other varieties of antiquarianism less invested in the particular traditions of the British Isles. Ultimately, the article raises the possibility that classical antiquarianism broadly understood, including its varieties more attuned to classical and not national cultures, could also bolster the creation of national literatures that we associate with Romanticism.</p>

<anchor xml:id="BryloweAbstract"/>Thora Brylowe</hi>, <title level="a">Antiquity by Design: Re-Mediating the Portland Vase</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">Counterintuitively, Josiah Wedgwood's Staffordshire-made clay replicas of the acclaimed ancient Roman glass vessel known to Britons as the Portland Vase exceeded the cultural authority of the Vase itself. The Wedgwood copies were celebrated as national treasures, extolled in paint and poem, and a copy remains on exhibit in the British Museum. Both Benjamin West's painting <title level="m">Manufactory Giving Support to Industry</title> (1791) and Erasmus Darwin's <title level="m">The Botanic Garden</title> (1791), which includes illustrations of the Vase by William Blake, offered tribute to Wedgwood’s copies. Wedgwood's achievement was not merely a technological or aesthetic triumph. He also managed to harness competing discourses held by classical antiquarians and Royal Academicians regarding the nature and status of the copy.</p>

<anchor xml:id="HillAbstract"/>Rosemary Hill</hi>, <title level="a">The Antiquary at Home</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">Between 1789 and 1851 antiquarianism blossomed. One of its more notable manifestations was the creation of "Romantic interiors," rooms, houses, even occasionally churches, which expressed the dynamic relationship with the past that characterised the period. In these spaces the personality of the creator was expressed through objects. Past and present were elided and rearranged for imaginative effect. Though not unknown, in the earlier eighteenth century such creations were rare; by the mid-nineteenth century the Romantic interior was an accepted style of interior decoration. This article considers some examples.</p>

<anchor xml:id="CampbellAbstract"/>Timothy Campbell</hi>, <title level="a">Pennant's Guillotines and Scott’s Antiquary: The Romantic End of the Present</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">In this essay, Campbell traces the peculiar re-circulations of Thomas Pennant's 1770s antiquarian description of an archaic Scottish proto-guillotine.  These re-circulations culminated in a late-Romantic fantasy that Pennant's antiquarian labors had brought the modern, French guillotine to life.  But even in the 1790s moment of the French Revolution, as the fashionable periodical <title level="j">The Bon Ton Magazine</title> makes most remarkably clear, Pennant's prose was mediating the British encounter with the French guillotine in extraordinary ways.  As an encapsulation of the antiquarian enterprise, the episode illuminates how the antiquarian fragment (liberated from an originary context) always threatened to belong to new times in uncontrollable ways, and so generated an illicit kind of temporal belonging more familiarly ascribed to fashion's recursive cycles.  Campbell turns from the re-circulations of Pennant to the fiction of Walter Scott, where a prominent and simultaneous address of antiquarian fragments and fashionable dress aimed to mitigate precisely the kind of dangers on view in Pennant's unwitting resurrection of the guillotine.  Scott's Waverley Novels finally bind fashions and antiquities to their respective times of origin, but the novels nevertheless remain in the shadow of Pennant's old guillotine.</p>

<p rend="noCount">This essay reads the genre of illustrated antiquarian history to argue that in contrast to literary antiquarianism, this form of publication rooted in the archive was governed by a poetics of the piece premised on the portability rather than persistence of the past.</p>

</head>
<p rend="noCount">The Irish artist and antiquarian George Petrie's publication <title level="m">The Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</title> (1845) refers to its illustrations by George Hanlon as exemplary instances of accuracy and truthfulness, very different in kind to picturesque depictions.  Petrie's statement prompts further thoughts about the function of archaeological/antiquarian illustration and the possibility of its attaining the standard Petrie endorses. Charles Sanders Peirce's semiotic system (index, icon, and symbol) is drawn on to refine understandings of this imagery and to underline the coded nature of visual communication.</p>

<anchor xml:id="SiegelAbstract"/>Jonah Siegel</hi>, Response: <title level="a">Mere Antiquarianism</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">The antiquarian project is based on the unbridgeable gap we know to divide the past from the present. The embarrassment it provokes is due in part to the necessary failures of all attempts to truly understand a lost era combining with the insight the attempt affords into the never fully dispassionate drives motivating the researches in the first place.  The articles in this volume illustrate the ways in which Romantic antiquarianism exists at a point of transition between the speculative regimen of an earlier era and the emergence of the period of licensed scientific research and accreditation we still inhabit.  As such they provide an opportunity for reflection on the passions underlying any manifestation of the desire to know, and on the gains and losses entailed in the emergence of an ostensibly dispassionate new scholarship.</p>

<p rend="noCount">Counterintuitively, Josiah Wedgwood's Staffordshire-made clay replicas of the acclaimed ancient Roman glass vessel known to Britons as the Portland Vase exceeded the cultural authority of the Vase itself. The Wedgwood copies were celebrated as national treasures, extolled in paint and poem, and a copy remains on exhibit in the British Museum. Both Benjamin West's painting <title level="m">Manufactory Giving Support to Industry</title> (1791) and Erasmus Darwin's <title level="m">The Botanic Garden</title> (1791), which includes illustrations of the Vase by William Blake, offered tribute to Wedgwood’s copies. Wedgwood's achievement was not merely a technological or aesthetic triumph. He also managed to harness competing discourses held by classical antiquarians and Royal Academicians regarding the nature and status of the copy.</p>

<p>The mediation of antique vases was part of a larger project that domesticated Greek and Roman classicism so that it could be claimed as part of English heritage. The Portland Vase serves as a useful example of Romantic-era management of antiquity as both economic and cultural capital, and it points to a multifaceted mediation of ancient artifacts that crosses and complicates the categories of art and craft. While it is true that reproduction has produced an aura of originality around the ancient Portland Vase, a priceless Roman artifact housed in the British Museum, there was a time in the 1790s when the original had less cultural authority than its copies. In fact, the copies had so much authority that they were taken up by artists, who preferred them to the original Vase. Raymond Williams argued that the movement from individual to institutionalized patronage of the arts occurred concomitantly with the professionalization of cultural producers. Terms like "artist," "artisan," and "craftsman," according to Williams, came to signify the ways in which made objects were mediated through the market, their institutional status, their means of production, and their intended or perceived purpose (44-52). Taking up this unstable relationship between art and craft, I want to consider the Wedgwood copies of the Portland Vase as well as two instances where Wedgwood's factory-made copies were celebrated in genres that can comfortably be described as "high" art—or at least genres we agree are not craft. Those examples are Erasmus Darwin's inclusion of the Vase in his poem <title level="m">The Botanic Garden</title> and Benjamin West's oil-on-paper study for <title level="m">Manufactory Giving Support to Industry</title>. Both Darwin's poem and West's painting are dated 1791, the year after Wedgwood first displayed his jasperware copies of the Portland Vase. There are several reasons Darwin and West's artistic tributes prefer native copies over the Roman original. Foremost, the copies declare English genius. Josiah Wedgwood invented and perfected a clay process he named "jasperware," which was well suited for the imitation of cameo glass—but the copies served the added function of domesticating the Continental Other, of making the distant past into a consumable product of the present. </p>
<p>More to Williams' point, the inclusion of his copies of the Vase in these works of art points to Wedgwood's ability to leverage competing institutions whose missions were to promote contemporary art on the one hand and antiquity on the other. London artists struggled for legitimacy and market share, and classical antiquarians were often also art collectors and connoisseurs. The classical antiquarians who sought to guide artists' taste through publications like those funded by the Society of Dilettanti were also likely collectors of the art they "encouraged." English artists maintained a complex and sometimes vexed relationship to collectors, who were accused of preferring the old over the new. William Hogarth acknowledged this tension in several satiric prints, including his 1761 <ref target="http://metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/90038629?rpp=20%26pg=1%26ao=on%26ft=etching%26what=Etchings%26who=William+Hogarth%26pos=3" rend="new">
<title level="m">Time Smoking A Picture</title>
</ref>, in which Time, having lost his usual robe, looks rather like a fleshed-out angel of Death. This Father Time sits on broken antique statuary, his smoke varnishing an Old Master painting into obscure ruin as his sickle pierces the canvas. 
                  
While most English artists genuinely shared a taste for classical art, they needed collectors to support them by purchasing contemporary, native artwork. Practically, this meant that both artists and antiquarians had a stake in saying what counted as art. Pierre Bourdieu has argued that competing producers of fine art "consecrate and underscore critical differences" in order to highlight their own theory of taste; but I want to show that Wedgwood's apotheosis occurred because he minimized the differences between the theories of copying put forth by antiquarians and artists (Bourdieu 51, 65). </p>

<p>Before it was known as the Portland Vase, the so-called "Barberini Vase" was a tourist destination, and the Vase has been included in antiquarian accounts of classical antiques since the late sixteenth century (Jenkins and Sloan 187). The Barberini family, whose fabulous art collection was housed in a family palazzo designed by Bernini and completed in 1633, owned the Vase from the year 1626, three years after Maffeo Barberini was named Pope Urban VIII, to somewhere around 1780, when Donna Cordelia Barberini-Colonna sold it to a Scotsman to pay off her gambling debts. Over the course of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the Palazzo Barberini was a frequent stop for British Grand Tourists visiting Rome (Walker 21). However, seeing the Vase in person was not a prerequisite for writing about it. The antiquarian Pierre d'Hancarville was author of the tremendously influential <title level="m">Antiquités Etrusques, Grecques, et Romaines tirées du Cabinet de M. Hamilton</title> (hereafter <title level="m">AEGR</title>), which lavishly displayed the collection of Sir William Hamilton, who would eventually bring the Vase to London. Volume II of <title level="m">AEGR</title>, brought out in 1770, acknowledges the Vase's fame, confirms the prevailing notion that it was a funerary urn containing the ashes of the Emperor Severus, and takes note of its unique composition: "it is a sort of paste of two coats of colours, of which, one detatching itself from the other, by the difference of its tint, is worked with the turn, in the same manner as the finest Cameos" (2:74). The passage goes on to say the Vase is housed in the Palazzo Farnese, not the Palazzo Barberini, suggesting that either d'Hancarville had confused its location or that the Vase had already been moved as a result of Barberini family insolvency. Hamilton did not apparently see the Vase until a decade later, after Donna Cordelia had sold it to James Byres, the aforementioned Scottish antiques dealer (Jenkins and Sloan 187). Nevertheless, he would have been aware of the Vase through numerous antiquarian publications.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
               Jenkins and Sloan offer a description of many of the antiquarian publications that mention the Portland Vase in their catalogue entry #63, p. 187.
            </note> Hamilton was the English Envoy to the Court of Naples from 1764 to 1800. His acquisition of the Portland Vase sometime in 1782 was probably profit-driven, motivated by the expense of his collecting and publishing efforts. He seems to have acquired the Vase on a £1000 bond with a 5% interest rate, suggesting he must have planned to dispose of it with relative haste (Jenkins and Sloan 187). Hamilton's speculation clearly paid off; by January of 1784 it was in the hands of the Duchess of Portland, who bought it for 1800 guineas. </p>
<p>Hamilton's collection, the publication of <title level="m">AEGR</title>, and his location in Naples consolidated his authority on matters of antiquarian taste, and he was interested in encouraging English artists and artisans to take up classical design in contemporary production. D'Hancarville warns artists away from simply copying the style of their masters, urging them instead to attend to the principles of classical art. The introduction to the first volume of <title level="m">AEGR</title> explains that part of the book's purpose is to serve as a collection of superior models "in order that the Artist who would INVENT in the same stile, or only COPY the monuments which appeared to him worthy of copied may do so with as much truth and precision as if he had the Originals themselves in his possession" (1: vi). And indeed, engravings from the work served as models for contemporary paintings.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">
            For example, Henri Fuseli used the Erastes scene depicted on Plate 32 of Volume II as a model for his 1771 <title level="m">Hamlet, The King of Denmark, Posioned by his Brother while Sleeping in the Garden</title>. The two images are reproduced in the introduction the Taschen edition of <title level="m">AEGR</title> 32-33 and in Siegel 51-53.
            </note> However, d'Hancarville made sure readers understood it was not only painters he and Hamilton had in mind. The text goes on to assert:
         <quote>[W]e make an agreable [<emph>sic.</emph>] present to our Manufacturers of earthen ware and China, and to those who make vases in silver, copper, glass, marble &amp;c. Having employed much more time in working than in reflexion, and being besides in great want of models, they will be very glad to find here more than two hundred forms, the greatest part of which are absolutely new to them.... (1: xx)</quote>
The arrogant tone of the introduction, especially in statements like those quoted above, makes it easy to see how artists and artisans might complain of antiquarian interference in matters of their own professional authority. As organizations like the Society of Dilettanti and later the Committee of Taste, which included the outspoken antiquarian Richard Payne Knight after 1802, claimed to know art better than institutionally sanctioned fine artists did, authority over matters of taste was a source of conflict.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
   As I said in the introduction, examples of conflict between connoisseurs of Antiquity and European Old Masters and English artists can be found in Hogarth. Another good Romantic example is James Barry's 1775 <title level="m">Inquiry into the Real and Imaginary Obstructions to the Arts in England</title>, which articulates the problem in terms of the relative craftiness of Italian dealers in antiquity vis-à-vis the foolishness of British collectors (75).
            </note>
</p>
<p>Josiah Wedgwood was less interested in arbitrating taste than he was in ensuring he was on the right side of it; a businessman who wanted to produce and profit on the sale of pots, he recognized Hamilton's importance and his authority on matters of taste. Wedgwood was said to have his own problems with fine artists, and in a letter dated 13 September 1769 he complained of their "coxcombical manners" and said he "would rather Man for Man have to do with a shop of Potters than Painters" (120). Wedgwood's library was filled with antiquarian publications, and he had London connections that offered access to engraved proofs of <title level="m">AEGR</title> well before the volumes were brought out (Irwin, <title level="a">Design</title> 289). In fact, Wedgwood's letters offer evidence that English fine artists <emph>did</emph> compete with antiquarian prints. In 1776, he wrote to his business partner in London attempting to cancel an expensive commission to John Flaxman, suggesting that engravings of ancient gems might serve as acceptable models for "little more than five shillings" (Irwin, <title level="a">Design</title> 289). Under Hamilton's influence, Wedgwood had gone so far as to name the Staffordshire works he began construction on in 1768 <title level="a">Etruria,</title> in honor of the pots Hamilton collected, which were thought to be of ancient Etruscan origin. </p>
<p>As far as the Portland Vase was concerned, Hamilton maintained his economic and cultural interest by retaining the right to display it at the Society of Antiquaries and even to copy it, despite its sale to the Duchess of Portland. Though the Vase was no longer his, he nevertheless commissioned Cipriani to make drawings that were subsequently made into <ref target="http://www.britishmuseum.org/system_pages/beta_collection_introduction/beta_collection_object_details/beta_collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=763256%26objectId=3136411%26partId=1" rend="new">copperplates by Francesco Bartolozzi</ref> (Wills 197). The prints were published by John Boydell, who in 1786 was still in Cheapside but was already advancing his scheme for the Shakspeare Gallery that would move his expanded operations to Pall Mall. The Society of Antiquaries noted in its minutes of 11 March 1784 that "having been for many Years in the possession of that Noble [Barberini] Family &amp; considered by them, &amp; all Travellers of Taste &amp; Judgement, as a Cimelium of extraordinary Curiosity &amp; Value," it was presented to them by Hamilton with no indication that he was not the owner of it (qtd. Wills 198).  Thus the Vase accrued <emph>English</emph> cultural capital as it was remarked upon by important institutional arbiters of taste at both the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Academy. </p>
<p>The president of the Royal Academy, Sir Joshua Reynolds, also endorsed the Vase before Josiah Wedgwood's involvement with it. After the Duchess had secretly owned it for but a short time, she died. Upon her death, the contents of her extensive collection were put up for auction. The Vase was purchased by the Duke of Portland, the Duchess's third son.  Horace Walpole wrote, "In August of 1786 Sir Joshua spent a few days at Bulstrode with the Duke of Portland, whose adviser he seems to have been in his purchase of the famous Vase for a thousand pounds" (qtd. in Wills 201).  In fact, the sum of purchase was somewhat more than Walpole indicates, but Reynolds' authority did encourage the Duke to keep the Vase in the family—and it would be Reynolds as well as Hamilton on whom Josiah Wedgwood would rest his own authority as he transformed the Vase from a singular work of fine art into a reproduced commodity. Its success went beyond the quality of the copy. Wedgwood's ability to garner high-profile endorsements from both antiquarians and the institutionally sanctioned London art world put him in an excellent position before work on the copies ever began.</p>
<p>More generally, Wedgwood used both the whims of domestic fashion and export markets to expand his name and business. Marx might have been thinking of Wedgwood when he noted that industrialization stimulated the creation of new markets as well as "more thorough-going exploitation of the old ones" (478). Josiah Wedgwood was acutely attentive to the taste of the consumers he served, and as early as the 1770s, he recognized that overproduction called for a larger market in order to sell existing stock:  "&amp; nothing but a foreign market ... will ever keep [our stock] within a tolerable bounds" (qtd. in McKendrick, <title level="a">Marketing</title> 426). He had initially made a name for himself making creamware, which was to be split off into his lines of "useful" wares, as opposed to the "ornamental" wares that his partner Thomas Bentley, a cloth manufacturer with a classical education, encouraged Wedgwood to develop.  Wedgwood's letters indicate his deference to Bentley in matters of taste.  In one particularly telling example, Wedgwood points out his dependence on Bentley's knowledge of Continental and Antique fashions.  In September of 1769, he wrote:
         <quote>If you continue to write such letters as the last [detailing classical fashions] there is no saying where our improvements will stop.  I read it over, &amp; over again, &amp; still profitt by ever repetition of your agreeable lessons.  </quote>
<quote>And do you really think that we can make a <emph>complete conquest</emph> of France?  [...] My blood moves quicker, I feel my strength increase for the conquest.  Assist me my friend, &amp; the victorie is our own ...I say we will fashn. our Porcelain after their own hearts, &amp; captivate them with the Elegance &amp; simplicity of the Ancients.  But do they love simplicity?  Either I have been greatly decieve'd, or a wonderful reformation has taken place amongst them.  <hi rend="italic">French &amp; Frippery</hi> have jingled together so long in my ideas, that I scarcely know how to separate them, &amp; much of their work which I have seen <emph>cover'd with ornament</emph>, had confirmed me in the opinion.  (<title level="m">Letters</title> 77)</quote>
</p>
<p>Wedgwood was willing to be directed, but he also understood how to use his relationship to Hamilton. As he was negotiating access to the Portland Vase, he also instructed Bentley to show wares Hamilton "&amp; a few other Connoisieurs not only to have their advice but to have the advantage of their puffing them ... as they will, by being consulted, and flatter'd agreeably, as you know how, consider themselves as sort of parties in the affair &amp; act accordingly" (qtd. in McKendrick, <title level="a">Marketing</title> 414). Wedgwood's genius lay partly in this deference, partly in his brilliant ability to exploit what he learned, and partly in his capacity for applying scientific experiment to the process of manufacture. Jasper was the only real invention of Josiah Wedgwood in terms of clay composition, and he worked for years perfecting it (Buten 139).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">
               Jasperware was the result of hundreds of experiments. See Robin Reilly's <title level="m">Wedgwood Jasper</title>, Chapter 2, for a full account of the composition of Jasper clay and its aesthetic links to Chinese porcelain.
            </note> He was looking for a clay that was easily colored and would hold a sharp, detailed relief image when fired, in order to replicate the aesthetic of bas-relief and cameo glass.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">
               Jasper's capacity for color change allowed it to fit the tastes of any number of patrons and consumers, who could purchase pottery that matched the architectural designs they had chosen for their homes' interiors. Because the neoclassical aesthetic was not interested in the literal rendition of classical images, the combination of form and color were vital in decorative motifs of Robert Adam and his imitators (Buten 139). Jasper, with its bas-relief technique, takes up the fashion of interior design perpetuated after the 1760s, when wainscoting fell out of fashion in favor of ornamental plasterwork. Wedgewood intended for architects to use jasperware plaques in their neoclassical interiors but was unsuccessful in influencing them to the extent that they had influenced him, as he notes in a letter to his partner Bentley in 1779 that it is "really unfortunate in the introduction of our jasper into the public notice, that we could not prevail upon the architects to be the godfathers of our child."
            </note>
</p>
<p>Wedgwood wasted no time in congratulating the Duke of Portland in his acquisition of his vase at auction.  Three days after the sale, 10 June 1786, Wedgwood and the Duke had drawn up an agreement whereby Wedgwood borrowed both the Vase and a glass cameo from the same auction lot in order to produce accurate copies (Mankowitz 20). Wedgwood understood what he had. Later on the 24<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> of June, Wedgwood wrote a very long letter to Hamilton.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn6" n="6">
               The letter is reproduced in its entirety in Mankowitz 21-31.
            </note> In the letter, he explained that he had begun "to count how many different ways the vase itself may be copied to suit the tastes, the wants &amp; purses of different purchasers,"  explaining that he could envision making cheap, all-white biscuit copies for artists, copies with a painted blue background for middle-class collectors, and polished jasperware copies for the richest collectors. At the same time, he was acutely aware of costs, worrying to Hamilton that it would take a team of the best engravers and modelers, who would have to be bought out of their current employments—and it would cost "£5000 for the execution of such a vase, supposing our best artists capable of the work." In the end, he used his own labor and the labor of the modelers already employed by the factory, and by 1790 he had garnered twelve subscriptions, which helped defray some of the costs (Mankowitz 31).</p>
<p>In the same letter of 24 June, he also asked for advice in terms of improving what he saw as imperfections in the Vase. Perhaps Wedgwood saw in <title level="m">AEGR</title> what Hamilton himself could not. Hamilton's book had promised accuracy, but in the process of translating three-dimensional artifacts onto engravings on paper, it idealized ancient vases into neoclassical versions of themselves (Coltman). These inaccuracies were not ungoverned error. Rather, accuracy was mediated through a network of the visual materials produced in contemporary antiquarian publications, which on the whole represent what we might think of as a "way of seeing" that idealized and remade the antique.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7">
            I am borrowing this term from John Berger's <title level="m">Ways of Seeing</title>.
            </note> Wedgwood, in keeping with <title level="m">AEGR</title>'s prescription to manufacturers, had initially tried to copy the Vase from prints. Upon access to the original, he acknowledged the significant gap between antiquarian engravings and the real artifact:
         <quote>When first I engaged in this work I had Montfaucon only to copy, I proceeded with spirit, and sufficient assurance that I should be able to equal, or excel if permitted, that copy of the vase; but now that I can indulge myself with full and repeated examinations of the original work itself, my crest is much fallen, and I should scarcely muster sufficient resolution to proceed if I had not, too precipitately perhaps, pledged my self to many of my friends to attempt it in the best manner I am able. Being so pledged, I must proceed, but shall stop at certain points till I am favored with your kind advice and assistance. (Mankowitz 22)</quote>
Wedgwood's initial reliance on paper vases and his crestfallen reaction at seeing the original tells us first that he was aware of the commercial potenital in the Barberini Vase before it came to London—but more importantly, it registers the gap between the usual procedure of copying from copies and the unmediated confrontation with what Keats in his 1816 Ode would call the "unravished bride," the unmediated Vase, with all its unyielding meaning.</p>
<p>In turn, manufacturers were not simply copying antiquity from prints; they sought to further improve upon it. Moreover, Wedgwood saw it as his purview to improve the taste of consumers as much as Hamilton had improved the taste of manufacturers. Nevertheless, in reply Hamilton wrote: "You are very right in there being some little defects in the drawing; however, it would be dangerous to touch that, but I should highly approve of your restoring in your copies what has been damaged by the hands of time" (qtd. in Wills 201). This exchange demonstrates not only that Wedgwood deferred to authority on matters of taste but that Hamilton could not see that antiquarian engravings irrevocably changed what they mediated or that his own publications were as guilty of inaccuracy as were the English artists whose work they sought to guide.  </p>
<p>At the same time, of course, London artists also sought to guide and improve the taste of the nation. Joshua Reynolds' annual addresses to students of the Royal Academy were published as his widely read <hi rend="italic">Discourses on Art</hi>. He wrote in his very first Discourse, delivered 2 January 1769 as the inaugural lecture of the newly founded Royal Academy, that the fine artists of his new institution would, by virtue of their own superior taste, serve "the inferior ends" of manufactures while remaining above the commercial fray (13). While Discourse I is clearly less directive than <title level="m">AEGR</title>'s introduction when it comes to "our Manufacturers of earthen ware and China," its tone regarding the inferiority of the commodified goods is consistent. Professional artists and their institutions assumed their superiority over the manufacturers as comfortably as the antiquarians did over them. Whatever Wedgwood may have thought of these "coxcombical manners," he negotiated the situation with his usual deference and finesse.</p>
<p>The genesis of Wedgwood's question to Hamilton is suggested by Reynolds' sixth Discourse, he argues that artists should both copy from antiquity and labor to improve upon their subjects: "He who borrows an idea from an ancient ... can hardly be charged with plagiarism ... But an artist should not be contented with this only; he should endeavor to improve what he is appropriating for his own work" (107).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">
            This passage is quoted more fully in Coltman (2). She also discusses <title level="m">AEGR</title> in terms of copying and improvement, largely in the context of interior design, and she argues that Reynolds' claims in <title level="m">Discourse VI</title> form the theoretical justification for artists' and artisans' copies of antique designs.
         </note> While d'Hancarville and Hamilton were telling artists to steer clear of their masters' prejudices and return to the principles of the ancients, those very masters, Reynolds among them, were advising artists to take the ancients as a starting point, and to improve upon them by remaking them based on the modern principles presented in the <title level="m">Discourses</title>. Wedgwood's philosophy on copying deftly incorporated Reynolds's position while citing Hamilton as its source. As Wedgwood explained on 28 June 1789 to Erasmus Darwin: 
            <quote>I only pretend to have attempted to copy the fine antique forms, but not with absolute servility. I have endeavored to preserve the stile and spirit or if you please the elegant simplicity of the antique forms, and so doing to introduce all the variety I was able, and this Sir W. Hamilton assures me I may venture to do, and that is the true way of copying the antique. (<title level="m">Letters</title> 307)</quote>
         On 15 June 1790, Reynolds wrote of the fifteenth copy of the Vase, which he examined personally, "I can venture to declare it a correct and faithful imitation, both in regard to general effect, and the most minute detail of the parts."<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" n="9">As cited in Mankowitz, who also notes that the accuracy of Wedgwood's copy was endorsed by "The Duke of Portland himself, The Earl of Leicester, President of the Society for Antiquaries, and Sir Joseph Banks, Bt., ... the respected President of the Royal Society" (35).  
         </note> Wedgwood's hybrid marketing technique owed more to the London art world than to its mere endorsement of his product. Wedgwood by this time had begun to mark his pottery and issue descriptive catalogues as well, which was unusual for a manufacturer (Buten 9). These catalogues link him to the art field in both their physical appearance and their size, and, perhaps more importantly, in the way they connected the object described in the printed catalogue to a metropolitan gallery space where those objects were on display (in this case Wedgwood's Soho showroom). These ties to fine art, in turn, strengthened the legitimacy of his Portland Vase copies. </p>
<p>Like Boydell, another great cultural entrepreneur of the 1790s, Wedgwood used a combination of print advertisement, ticket sales, and catalogues to generate excitement and anticipation over an end product that took years to produce. Boydell, a London Alderman, was the proprietor of the Pall Mall Shakspeare Gallery, which commissioned paintings for display in the gallery and sold engraved facsimiles of those paintings. Just as Boydell printed catalogues and sold subscriptions to his high-profile engravings of scenes taken from Shakespeare, so Wedgwood sold subscriptions to his early Portland Vase copies, used gallery-style showrooms, and printed catalogues.</p>
<p>The analogy between Wedgwood and Boydell is worth pursuing in this instance, since both trafficked on the fame of an original to sell copies. Whereas Boydell's engravers contemporary painted canvasses onto copper, Wedgwood transformed ancient artifacts into contemporary jasperware. Their tactics were strikingly similar—and so were their overreachings. Wedgwood garnered twenty subscriptions for his first edition of the Portland Vase with a final price between thirty and fifty guineas each (Keynes 248). As early as 1786, he had planned the subscriptions, as he wrote to Hamilton:
            <quote>Several gentlemen have urged me to make my copies of the vase by subscription, and have honored me with their names for that purpose; but I tell them, and with great truth, that I am extremely diffident of my ability to perform the task they kindly impose on me; and that they shall be perfectly at liberty, when they see the copies, to take or refuse them; and on these terms I accept of subscriptions, chiefly to regulate the time of delivering out the copies, in rotation, according to the dates on which they honor me with their names. (<title level="m">Letters</title> 296)</quote>
                     In spite of the technical and aesthetic success Wedgwood ultimately achieved, half the subscribers chose not to take the copy they had agreed to pay for (Keynes 248). As with the Boydell Shakspeare Gallery, subscriptions served to drum up public interest, inasmuch as prominent members of society signed on and subscription lists were widely circulated, but in the final analysis they failed to bring about financial success. In spite of their fame and acclaim, both the Shakspeare Gallery and the Wedgwood Portland Vase copies were ultimately financial failures, although as public spectacles celebrating the possibilities of commercial art, both were tremendously successful. Although both Boydell's and Wedgwood's designs for a financial payoff may have been thwarted, neither man's firm was ruined by his venture. Alderman Boydell died around the same time his Shakspeare Gallery stock was sold off by lottery, but the firm went on with his nephew Josiah Boydell at the helm. In Wedgwood's case, the fame of the undertaking and the invention of jasperware far outweighed the fact that so few copies of the Portland Vase actually sold. The popularity of the Portland Vase generated traffic in Wedgwood showrooms, which multiplied across London and the Continent.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Wedgwood copies of the Portland Vase upstaged the Vase itself, demonstrating Wedgwood's success in doing precisely what engravers of the Romantic period could not quite manage: producing the notion that a reproduced, manufactured product that many hands had labored to produce was worthy of the consecrated status of art object. Boydell's attempts to transform English engravers into household names went only as far as William Woolett, who engraved an incredibly successful print of West's <title level="m">Death of General Wolf</title> for Boydell before he opened the Shakspeare Gallery (Bruntjen 36). It is likely that his success at making Woolett a household name planted a seed of the Shakspeare Gallery, a gallery that sold English Engravings of English paintings on specially made English paper. However, the idea that an engraver might be as much an artist as a painter did not sit well with painters, who (with the notable exception of Benjamin West) regularly blocked engravers' attempts at full membership in the Royal Academy over the course of the Romantic period. English pots, made of English clay, however, didn't have to compete with living artists and their ideas about originality. In copying the antique, Wedgwood did not compete with any living artist; he was free to scoop up his native clay and make from it a new body, cast from the ancient legacy of this Roman vessel.</p>

<p>Josiah Wedgwood made his friend Erasmus Darwin a present of the first perfected copy of the Portland Vase (Keynes 248). In turn, some seventy-seven lines of Canto II of Darwin's <title level="a">The Economy of Vegetation</title> are devoted to ceramics, with a view to celebrating Wedgwood as the culmination of some two millennia of the art form's development. The Canto, addressed to the elemental Gnomes of Earth, mentions "Portland's mystic urn" in the context of a list of Wedgwood's accomplishments, and it also refers readers to a four-page endnote, which interprets the images on the surfaces of the Vase as depicting the Eleusinian mysteries. As a whole, Darwin's second Canto celebrates various geologic discoveries and phenomena, including the section that narrates the development of pottery from China to Etruria to Wedgwood's Stoke-on-Trent works. The Gnomes:
            <quote>
<lg>
<l>[P]leased on WEDGWOOD ray your partial smile,</l>
<l>A new Etruria decks Britannia's isle.— 	(303-4)</l>
</lg>
</quote>
         With such an endorsement from the spirits of the earth, Wedgwood's "bold Cameo speaks" and his "soft Intaglio thinks" (310). Wedgwood, "Friend of Art," that he is, has the authority to copy "the fine forms on PORTLAND'S mystic urn" (313, 320). The Vase's decorations are ekphrastically described in lines 321-340, but the copy is given far more imaginative space than is the original. After all, there is no mention of a Roman artist or even a cameo glass body. The Gnomes of this Canto are concerned with Chinese, then Italian, then English <emph>clay</emph>—but never Roman glass. </p>
<p>Darwin evidently felt that a visual representation of the Vase was important enough to delay publication of his <title level="m">Botanic Garden</title> until his publisher, Joseph Johnson, could supply engravings of it (Brooks 152). Darwin had wanted to include the engravings Hamilton had commissioned when it was initially brought to London. Perhaps it was natural that Darwin would have thought of Bartolozzi's recently made Portland Vase engravings as he wrote his poem, but Hamilton held the copyright on Bartolozzi's engravings, so Johnson had no choice but to hire someone to re-engrave the Vase. There is no evidence that his employee, William Blake, who Johnson assured Darwin was "certainly capable of making an exact copy of the vase," ever actually examined the original (qtd. in Keynes 251).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn10" n="10">Secondary accounts do not agree, though most assume that Blake did not have access to the original Vase (e.g., Bentley 108). Some sources simply leave ambiguity, but some do suggest Blake did have access to it (e.g., Brooks 152). However, Brooks misattributes Bartolozzi's engraving of the Vase as Blake's of 1791. It seems unlikely given Blake's relatively low professional status that he would have been given access to it, and even less likely that, given the gossip surrounding the Vase's movements and visitors, that if he had been given access there would be no mention of it. Moreover, it was convention for professional engravers to work from copies, and that kind of conventional work is less worthy of mention.
            </note> Blake certainly did ask to see Bartolozzi's engravings, however, in July of 1791, when Blake began work on new versions of the illustrations (Keynes 251). Both Blake's pictures and Darwin's poem relied on prints, textual analyses and Wedgwood copies—copies of copies, cycled over again through the "Mill &amp; Machine" of English presses. </p>

<p>Blake's illustrations of the compartments look enough like Bartolozzi's to suggest that Bartolozzi was probably Blake's only source. One notable difference between Bartolozzi's 1786 engravings and Blake's copies of them is the introduction of fig leaves, which must have been Johnson's emendation. Darwin himself would have been perfectly happy to use Cipriani's designs, which, of course, contained fully nude male figures. In 1786, the Vase, which had been on display at the Society of Antiquaries and was now the recent acquisition of the Duke of Portland, was an antiquarian art object; but reading audiences were a more diverse lot than the connoisseurs who might have been expected to purchase a folio of expensive prints. Johnson's care in protecting readers from visual indelicacy shrewdly anticipates a more widescale practice of "improving" classical antiquity to make it palatable for an array of British readers.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn11" n="11">
            The best example of this is Thomas Kirk's 1804 <title level="m">Outlines</title> from the figures and compositions upon the Greek, Roman, and Etruscan vases of the late Sir William Hamilton. For a fuller analysis of this change, see my <title level="a">Two Kinds of Collections: Sir William Hamilton's Vases, Real and Represented</title>
<title level="m">Eighteenth-Century Life</title> 32.1 (January 2008), 23-56.
                     </note> Such a practice was sanctioned by Reynolds' authorization, in the <title level="m">Discourses</title>, to improve upon ancient designs, and this particular improvement was a wise decision, given the number of editions the book went through.</p>
<p>In Darwin's note, the ekphrastic description of the Vase contains no information that could not be gleaned from the engravings. Using a teleological narrative that starts in ancient China and arrives at Britannia's Etruria, Darwin implies that Wedgwood represents the apex of pottery's technological development. In case the verse leaves any doubt in readers' minds about what he means, Darwin includes this footnote:
         <quote>In real stones, or in paste or soft coloured glass, many pieces of exquisite workmanship were produced by the antients. Basso-relievos of various sizes were made in coarse brown earth of one colour; but of the improved kind of two or more colours, and of a true porcelain texture, none were made by the ancients, nor attempted, I believe by the moderns, before those of Mr. Wedgwood's manufactory. (89)</quote>
            In fact, Wedgwood is mentioned in three of the four substantive footnotes in Section VI of Canto II, which also includes an interleaved engraving of two of Wedgwood's commemorative medallions. Darwin's puffery certainly afforded Wedgwood public exposure: <title level="m">The Botanic Garden</title> went through several editions over the course of the Romantic period in London, Derby, Dublin, and New York; a French translation appeared in 1799, a Portugese in 1803, and a German translation was brought out in 1810.</p>
<p>In Darwin's long footnote that interprets the Vase's designs, Josiah Wedgwood himself—not Hamilton or any of Wedgwood's carefully selected Portland Vase endorsers—is positioned as the expert on the artifact. Contrary to positions taken by antiquarians or fine artists, Darwin finds the pinnacle of aesthetic perfection in neither in ancient classical artifacts nor in native fine art. It is extraordinary that Wedgwood could have accomplished such a feat, but in Darwin's poem, the manufactured craft object has more cultural credibility than the work of art. In a striking example of the Benjaminian formula, Wedgwood's reproductions not only disrupt the authority of the original work of art—they supplant it.</p>
<p>A painting by Benjamin West further demonstrates that Wedgwood's Portland Vase copies achieved consecration in the London art world. As they do in Darwin's poetry, Wedgwood's copies of the Portland Vase occupy a central place in West's painting. David Irwin goes so far as to suggest that it is "presumably Josiah Wedgwood's first copy" of the Vase that appears in the painting, which would make it a representation of the very copy he presented to Darwin (<title level="m">Neoclassicism</title> 173). In 1787, West was commissioned to paint designs to be used as decorations on the drawing room ceiling of the Queen's Lodge at Windsor. The Royal family had chosen the site of Queen Anne's lodging for their new residence, and the Queen's Lodge was the primary Royal Residence until it was razed after the death of both George III and Charlotte (Loftie 38). West's ceiling designs were executed by a German decorator named G.L. Haas, who had invented a sort of sand-art technique "to which no name ha[d] yet been applied" at the time the ceilings were put up (<title level="m">Windsor</title> 119). It involved gluing colored marble dust to canvas or board and apparently had "all the force and effect of the best oil painting" (<title level="m">Windsor</title> 119). Haas later took out newspaper advertisements calling his "entire new-invented" technique "marmot-tinto," and he mounted an exhibit at the rooms at 19 Great-Pulteney Street on 14 February of 1791.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn12" n="12">Advertisements appeared Saturday, February 12, 1791 in <title level="j">The World</title> (Issue 1285) and in the <title level="j">Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser</title> Saturday (Issue 19 p. 402). Burney Collection.
            </note> According to a contemporary guidebook, <title level="m">The Windsor Guide</title>, "The Ceiling consists of several subjects. In the centre, in an oval, is genius reviving the arts; in the four corners, are agriculture, manufactory, commerce, and riches, depicted by emblematical figures in the different vocations, with the symbols of several sciences" (119). In 1787, when West received the commission for the ceiling designs, the Portland Vase copies were not yet been complete. It is impossible to know exactly what the designs looked like, but West either changed his sketch to include the Portland Vase copy, or he produced a second one after the fact.</p>

<p>West's oil-on-paper sketch related to Haas's ceiling design, which bears the longer name <title level="m">Etruria or Manufactory Giving Support to Industry</title>; the sketch is known simply as <title level="m">British Manufactory; A Sketch</title> or sometimes as <title level="m">Etruria</title>. Suggestive of the designs on the Vase, the central vignette depicts two allegorical female figures draped and dressed in classical garb as well as two naked boys, one a cherub. The boys are handing up a Wedgwood copy as well as a rolled paper, presumably a plan or paper model, to the seated figure of Industry, who is busily at work on a jasperware vase. Behind her, Manufactory holds a wheat-colored drapery into which a ceramic platter is nestled. At Industry's feet, various earthenware plates and vases are piled. Behind her, other scenes taken from the British textile industry fill the oval frame. </p>
<p>Although the sketch included the Portland Vase, the ceiling probably did not, since the date of the sketch is well after the date of the ceiling (Helmut Von Effra and Allen Staley 412). <title level="m">The Windsor Guide</title> reports that the ceiling was "affixed up" early in 1789, two years before the sketch is dated. That West changed his painting in the first place indicates the importance and status of the Portland Vase copies. The ceilings in the Queen's Lodge were left to Hass, a mere decorator who appears to have only exhibited once, in a rented room at Golden Square. West's sketch, by contrast, was exhibited in the consecrated space of Somerset House. It is striking that the relationship of West's original vis-à-vis Hass's decorative copy is so radically different from the Vase's status as an object copied by Wedgwood, a craftsman known for producing decorative arts. It is even possible that West changed the design to include the Portland Vase as a response to Haas's exhibition, which went up just a few months before the Royal Academy's annual exhibition. If true, it serves to highlight the way Reynolds's directives regarding painterly improvement on originals might have been deployed to maintain a hierarchy where fine art trumps decorative craftwork. </p>
<p>In any event, the sketch was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1791 under the title <title level="m">British Manufactory; A Sketch</title>. Before 1791, Etruria might have occupied the central spot in the ceiling medallion because of a sort of pun: Wedgwood had renamed his creamware "Queen's Ware" in 1765 when George III named him "Potter to the Queen," so decorations for the so-called Queen's Lodge might well have put the Queen's Potter in the center of the design. <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn13" n="13">Farington reports that relations between West and the Queen were tense and she ordered the paintings taken down shortly after they were put up, but that they were put back, damaged, because the King wished to see them (as cited in von Effra and Staley 412).
            </note> However, after 1791, Wedgwood's successful copies of the Portland Vase gave West a more specific reason to place Wedgwood front and center. The same year, West also exhibited <title level="m">British Commerce; A Sketch</title> and indeed most of West's exhibited work in the years before and after 1791 suggest that he was producing allegorical designs celebrating British industry and trade (Graves 215). Taken as a whole, these sketches, designed to be reproduced on a large scale, are reminiscent of James Barry's designs for the Great Hall of the Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. West's <title level="m">British Manufactory</title>, if it does not exactly reference, certainly trafficks in the same imagery as Barry's depiction of British commerce and manufacture in that series of paintings.</p>
<p>Barry's aim in those murals was to combat the "illiberal picture of British genius" offered by the great antiquarian J. J. Winckelmann and to unite the "Grecian style and character of design, with all those lesser accomplishments the Moderns have so happily achieved" (Society of Arts iii, iv). Although the paintings had been completed and placed in the Great Room in 1783, they were contemporary news. West was adapting Barry's visual celebration of the manufactures just as Barry was finishing up his prints and distributing them to subscribers.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn14" n="14">Barry's subscriptions were fulfilled in 1792, and he published a <title level="m">Letter to the Right Honourable President ... of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce</title> discussing the changes made to them to accommodate to the medium of print in 1793.
            </note> The year 1791 saw first Haas's exhibition, then Barry's print, then West's sketch.</p>
<p>In May, Barry finished the engraving of his fourth Great Room frieze, <ref target="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/barry-the-thames-or-the-triumph-of-navigation-t03785" rend="new">
<title level="m">Commerce or the Triumph of the Thames</title>
</ref>. The bottom right of Barry's picture is crowded with "Nereids," who carry "several articles of our manufactures and commerce of Manchester, Birmingham, &amp;c." (Barry, <title level="m">Account</title> 61). In Barry's description of the picture, he explains:
                        <quote>[I]f those Nereids appear more sportive than industrious, and others still more wanton than sportive, the Picture has more variety and I am sorry to add the greater resemblance to the truth; for it must be allowed that if through the means of an extensive commerce, we are furnished with incentives to ingenuity and industry, this ingenuity and industry is but too frequently found to be employed in the procuring and fabricating such commercial matters as are subversive to the very foundations of virtue and happiness. Our females...are totally shamefully, and cruelly neglected, in the appropriation of trades and employments; this is a source of infinite and most extensive mischief.... (<title level="m">Account</title> 61-2)</quote>
                        Barry quickly moves on from this bit of social commentary, claiming that he has treated a serious subject lightly (<title level="m">Account</title> 62). In this context, it is interesting that in place of sportive, wanton nymphs, West offers the portrait of a somber female Industry. Wedgwood had been apprenticing girls since the 1770s, so that by the early 1790s a small but significant portion of Etruria's labor force was made up of women (McKendrick, <title level="a">Discipline</title> 38). Records indicate that all together Wedgwood employed 278 men, women, and children in 1790, each with a specific, repetitive task (McKendrick, <title level="a">Discipline</title> 33). Where Barry offers nudity, West provides a subject fully clothed in classical sandals, a sleeved peplos with a blue drapery, and a blue cecryphalus, or headband. Where Barry offers water nymphs and wanton sport, West presents Industry employed in decorating jasperware—the recently made most-famous example of English manufactory. </p>
<p>West's vignettes toward the back of the painting also offer utopic settings of industrial labor, wherein men, women and children appear perfectly at ease in their textile-making employments. However, Etruria and its most famous ware remain the central focus. The vase Industry is employed at painting has not been identified (von Effra and Staley 412). While West may not have had a specific Wedgwood vase in mind, the general shape of the vase, a kind of lidded amphora, does suggest a reference to <title level="m">Triumph of the Thames</title>, which includes an ormolu amphora depicted in the bottom right of Barry's painting. Ormolu was a famous Birmingham production, pioneered by Mathew Boulton. Even as Barry proposed his Great Room paintings, the fashion for the Frenchified ormolu was waning, and Wedgwood's friend had moved on to minting coins (Uglow 416)—but in the post-1789 political climate vases like the one in Barry's painting were even less popular. The invention of jasperware and the success of the Wedgwood copies of the Portland Vase ensured that Josiah Wedgwood, with his prejudice against "<emph>French &amp; Frippery</emph>" and wares "<emph>cover'd with ornament,</emph>" gained supremacy over Matthew Boulton as the manufacturer most representative of dominant English taste. </p>

</figure>
<p>The painting portrays Industry <foreign>in medias res</foreign>, before she has had a chance to take up the drawings or the Vase that the rather buff <foreign>putto</foreign> hands up to her.  Industry and her allegorical support staff are depicted in classical garb, in keeping with Reynolds' dictate in Discourse X that modern dress is to be avoided "[h]owever agreeable it might be to the Antiquary's principles of equity and gratitude" (187). Allegory combines with achievement to elevate Wedgwood's works above the backgrounded labor vignettes, which are rendered in the more typical fashion. West's textile vignettes resemble those in books like Pyne's <title level="m">Microcosm, or, a Picturesque Delineation of the Arts, Agriculture, Manufactures &amp;c.</title>, which certainly valorizes English manufactory but does so in a conventional visual genre. The Portland Vase copy is in the possession of the <foreign>putti</foreign> who sit on the factory floor at Industry's feet, at once celebrating the Vase’s classical origin at the same time it celebrates a contemporary achievement of mythic proportions. As with Barry's depiction of Commerce, the sea and the English cliffs are vaguely visible in the background, suggesting again that this English vase, worked by English hands and made from English earth, is worthy of reverence.</p>

<head>*	*	*</head>
<p>Throughout this paper I have been speaking of Wedgwood as if he were the sole designer and copier of the Portland Vase. Of course he was not. Just as West had a workshop filled with unnamed assistants—whom Blake, writing in the margins of Reynolds' <title level="m">Discourses</title>, derisively called "journeymen"—so Wedgwood employed modelers and mold-makers who assisted him with the perfection of his jasperware copies. In our current moment, the arts find themselves under intense political, economic and institutional scrutiny. In the U.S., public arts funding came to the forefront of the 2012 presidential election when the Republican candidate said he would stop funding the National Endowment for the Arts. Under the current administration, funding continues a trend of decline.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn15" n="15">Mitt Romney originally made this statement in an interview from <title level="m">Fortune Magazine</title> dated 6 August 2012, but it was repeated many times from August through November. Some information on the general trend of public arts funding <ref target="http://www.giarts.org/article/public-funding-arts-2012-update">is available here</ref>. 
            </note> At the same time, the economic value of "consecrated" art objects is in no danger. The international art market continues to increase as the wealthy invest and trade billions of dollars per year in commoditized objects of art and antiquity (Goodwin 1). The situation invites us to consider the attribution of value to art objects, how value is created, and who produces it. Wedgwood's ability to smooth the facets of factory production into a single end product bearing his name was new. However, I think his ability to leverage factory production at the same time that he brought together competing modes of institutional meaning was nothing short of remarkable. Highly liminal, these objects were produced in a factory; they were distributed, like prints or books, by subscription; they were displayed and catalogued like painting or sculpture. They were a financial failure wrapped in aesthetic success. </p>
<p>The Portland Vase and its Wedgwood copies undoubtedly served to prop up each other's aesthetic and economic value. Sir William's initial willingness to pay such an extravagant sum for the Barberini Vase and the subsequent buzz the Vase generated in London made Wedgwood's project a viable way to gain attention for his new invention. To this day, jasperware remains Wedgwood's best-known product. After the response to the Portland Vase copies, the factory could not resist making cheaper replicas to commercialize its aesthetic triumph. While Josiah's "original" copies were aesthetic achievements celebrated in the realm of high art, the factory went on to produce what Wolf Mankowitz described as "a moulded biscuit apology," onto which dark paint was applied to mimic the bas-relief appearance of jasperware (18).
               He goes on:
         <quote>The particular characteristic of the 1839 copy is, however, the triumph of Victorian morality which it embodies. In it the figures, naked and austere in the original vase, are draped 'in the Greek manner', with a scrupulousness of which the Prince Consort himself would have approved. (18)</quote>
         Blake's fig-leaf-decked illustrations, which predate the Wedgwood company's Greek drapery by a half century, suggest that the urge to clean up the classical was Romantic rather than Victorian. Wedgwood's worry that copying the Vase would cost the enormous sum of £5000 in artists' labor was not far off—but Wedgwood's legacy of cheap nineteenth-century reproductions proved popular and more than made up for the expense of producing the first copies. It was only a matter of time before this triumph of technological innovation, marketing, and nationalism was subjected to three-dimensional mechanical reproduction. Since 1841, the factory has produced copies of various size and in various shades of blue. The consecration conferred upon the first copies by Reynolds, Hamilton, Darwin, and West made subsequent copies economically inevitable. As Wedgwood had imagined in his June 1786 letter to Hamilton, the Vase could indeed be "copied to suit the tastes, the wants &amp; purses of different purchasers." Today, it will cost the average citizen a quick trip to ebay and around forty dollars to obtain a pale blue, genital-free Portland-Vase Christmas ornament; but patrons of the British Museum gift shop can purchase made-to-order Wedgwood factory reproductions of the Portland Vase for the exact sum of £5000.</p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">In this essay, Campbell traces the peculiar re-circulations of Thomas Pennant's 1770s antiquarian description of an archaic Scottish proto-guillotine.  These re-circulations culminated in a late-Romantic fantasy that Pennant's antiquarian labors had brought the modern, French guillotine to life.  But even in the 1790s moment of the French Revolution, as the fashionable periodical <title level="j">The Bon Ton Magazine</title> makes most remarkably clear, Pennant's prose was mediating the British encounter with the French guillotine in extraordinary ways.  As an encapsulation of the antiquarian enterprise, the episode illuminates how the antiquarian fragment (liberated from an originary context) always threatened to belong to new times in uncontrollable ways, and so generated an illicit kind of temporal belonging more familiarly ascribed to fashion's recursive cycles.  Campbell turns from the re-circulations of Pennant to the fiction of Walter Scott, where a prominent and simultaneous address of antiquarian fragments and fashionable dress aimed to mitigate precisely the kind of dangers on view in Pennant's unwitting resurrection of the guillotine.  Scott's Waverley Novels finally bind fashions and antiquities to their respective times of origin, but the novels nevertheless remain in the shadow of Pennant's old guillotine.</p>

<p>In this essay I trace a Romantic-era alignment between the procedures of fashion culture and the methods of a noteworthy antiquary.  I center this discussion around an extraordinary micro-episode in print in 1793 (at the verge of the Reign of Terror), when the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine, or Microscope of Fashion and Folly</title> radically repurposed Thomas Pennant's 1772 prose description of an ancient British implement of capital punishment.  By transposing Pennant's antiquarian account into the eventful present moment, the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine</title> transformed this commentary into a fully adequate dispatch on the ultra-modern guillotine—the signature emblem of the ostensibly unprecedented violence of the French Revolution.  This remarkable event in print, I argue, suggests how fashion's characteristic recyclings of past artifacts for present purposes (and fashion's consequent liberations of the objects of its desire from their original contexts) also disclosed destabilizing qualities of the antiquarian enterprise itself.  For if in some ways the rise of fashion was adding new danger to antiquarian practice (by putting antiquarian findings to fashion's own purposes), in other ways fashion only exposed dangers that were always inherent in the ways antiquarians managed their objects.  While Barrett Kalter calls our attention to the pronounced, contemporaneous sense that the "past was not so much retrieved as manufactured in the present, and therefore artificial," in this essay I emphasize the complexity that an object like the guillotine represents for such an ethos, as the sort of retrieval that is much more evidently a dangerous repetition than the kind of conspicuous artifice that could be readily distinguished from the past in its authenticity (12).</p>
<p>I begin with a retrospective view that will ultimately set the stage for Pennant's reemergence in the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine</title> in 1793—namely the more distant scrutiny, <foreign>circa</foreign> 1840, of the consequences of Pennant's recovery of these British proto-guillotines. At the later moment both the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> and <title level="j">The Court and Lady's Magazine</title> broach a causal link between Pennant's antiquarian labors and the arrival of the guillotine in revolutionary France, with the implication that Pennant's recirculation of the archaic in some sense elicits Dr. Guillotin's infamous engine.  These later accounts are striking in their own right; but I further insist, in ways these accounts do not countenance, on the specific revelations of Pennant's adoption within print fashion at the original moment of revolution.  The strongest implication of the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine</title>'s appropriation of Pennant's description, and of the mode of exuberant deformation that prevails in the magazine even amidst the extremity of regicide, is that such bald commingling of ancient and modern is rather more characteristic of the age than deviant, more central than marginal, due to an increasingly general susceptibility to fashion's ways of knowing.  In essence what happens to Pennant's prose description in print (via fashion) manifests the structure or form of what actually happened in the world with the instrument.  Just as the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> silently set Pennant's somewhat dusty prose at the unfolding, world-historical scene of regicide, so revolutionary France quietly recast his object-artifacts as distinctively novel emanations of modernity.</p>
<p> I proceed from this particular episode toward an account of its larger stakes by suggesting how a renewed, fashion-driven appreciation for antiquarianism's dangerous liberations deeply shapes Walter Scott's iconic redefinition of the figure of the antiquary in his novel of that title.  Here, in a novel where the threat of imminent invasion by French Revolutionary forces (that is, history so-called) never quite materializes, the present itself also never quite obtains as an ontologically distinct location.  Rather, in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> old dress fashions stubbornly persist in ways that point us to the essential ground of Scott's revision of Pennant and his ilk.  But while the comic mode of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> works to stabilize the relics of the past alongside recently obsolete fashions, and persons—so that all these categories speak their time of origin or impressionability with the same, steady persistence—I will also consider how the shadows of Pennant's instruments of execution continue to haunt the long series of Waverley Novels to come.</p>

<head>I. "The novelty of the invention"</head>
<p>	In a review essay published in the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> in December 1843, and subsequently revised and published in its own right as <title level="m">The History of the Guillotine</title> (1853), John Wilson Croker consolidated a recent flurry of interest in the guillotine's origins with a diagnosis of the peculiar kind of historiographical problem the French Revolution posed.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"> The prose of the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> essay and the "revised" <title level="m">History of the Guillotine</title> is often identical. In the interest of consistency, I will cite from the latter throughout this essay.
                  </note> The "effects of [the] protracted system of Terror" that prevailed, Croker pronounces, have not "yet passed away," for this system "poisoned in its passage the very sources of history."  These corrupted historical sources, moreover, continued to impose even on the posterity of Croker's subsequent day, which therefore labored under precisely the "same delusions" the system had "imposed on its contemporaries" (1). Most noteworthy are these sources' unspoken elisions.  "It is the fashion," for instance, "to call the <title level="j">Moniteur</title> the best history of the Revolution, and its pages are universally appealed to as indisputable authority," yet the newspaper startlingly omits mention of the regicide of Louis XVI in the issue that appears on the day following the execution (2).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
<title level="j">Le Moniteur Universel</title> was the leading newspaper of the time in France and sometime official journal of the government.
               </note> In this context, Croker observes, the question of the early history of the guillotine is a representatively "strange obscurity," for "Little or nothing was to be found" in the "leading journals of the time" "as to when and where this formidable engine made its first appearance, by what law it was sanctioned, and who were the earliest of that innumerable series of victims who perished by it" (4).</p>
<p>Croker's assertion of the inadequacy of official history in this moment has self-conscious historiographical critique in mind.  In calling attention to the discursive obscurity around the guillotine, he moves beyond a generalized horror over the Revolution's excesses to paint the broader moment as in need of the special skills of the antiquarian.  It is especially "strange," Croker notes, that "persons calling themselves <emph>historians</emph>—whose attention might have been excited, not merely by the novelty of the machine, but by the moral and legal questions which led to the invention, and by the terrible, the gigantic consequences which followed its adoption—take little or no notice of it" (4). Croker's subjects, it seems, are those the historian has overlooked.  And in the example he posits of one particularly revealing narrative of the regicide itself, it is an incapacity to attend to the remarkable machine with sufficient, material precision that elides the essential historical spirit of the event.  As Croker reports with frustration, this historian's inadequate "words, 'the descending axe terminated his existence' [...]—there having been no preceding allusion to any machine—would have equally described that of Charles I [in England in 1649]" (6).  For Croker, the "poisoned" sources of ordinary historiography remake the epoch into the opaque sort of terrain that had always necessitated antiquarians' outsized dependence upon what might be learned from objects and artifacts, and from these objects' reinsertion in historical narrative that was otherwise inadequate.  </p>
<p>Insecure about its own distance from the French Revolutionary moment, Croker's history admits of an uneasy mixture of national pride and anxiety in unveiling the English and Scottish antecedents of the machine that defined the Revolution's excesses.  He enfolds the <title level="m">Report on the Mode of Decollation</title> that "M. Louis" offered to the Legislative Assembly in France as part of the process of devising the French machine. Louis, Croker notes, points directly to an English precedent for the instrument while making no mention of the soon infamous Dr. Guillotin himself.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"> Anthony Louis reported in his capacity as Secretary of the Royal Academy of Surgery in France.  Louis's <title level="m">Report on the Mode of Decollation</title> explains how, given the difficult and precise task of cleanly severing the vertebral column and the imperfect skill of human executioners, "there is no certainty but in an invariable mechanism, of which the force and effect can be regulated and directed.  <emph>This is the mode adopted in England</emph>" (Croker 30, emphasis in original).
               </note>
<quote>Poor Guillotin paid dearly for the foolish vanity of affecting to be an inventor, when he was only a plagiary; and it seems very strange how so general an opinion should have prevailed as to the <emph>novelty</emph> of the invention, when we find M. Louis, in the very first distinct description of the machine, representing it as one <emph>already known in England</emph>—indeed, his expressions seem to imply [a misconception] that it was then actually and habitually in use amongst us [....]  If M. Louis had inquired a little farther, he would have found not only that the implement was not in general use in England, but had not been used for near 150 years in the small district [of Halifax] where it belonged. (34)  </quote>
                     
         This revelation, both of the machine's liability to "plagiarism" and of Louis's failure to register the English machine's present obsolescence—or, to distinguish properly between <emph>knowledge</emph> of the machine in England and ongoing <emph>use</emph> thereof (in the way a robust past-present distinction would require)—then prompts Croker's extended recapitulation of Pennant's own detailed description of the earlier British instruments of execution. For Croker, the instability of the distinction between knowledge and use is precisely what is at issue with regard to Pennant's account, for Croker emphasizes how, at the dawn of the French Revolution, the ancient British machines had been "recalled to public attention" in Pennant's "then so recent work" (39).</p>
<p>As part of his second tour of Scotland, published as <title level="m">A Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides; 1772</title> (1774-1776), Pennant's account focuses upon the so-called Maiden, the machine that he had observed closely in Edinburgh, and its direct ancestor the Halifax Gibbet, which had supposedly served as the centerpiece of an idiosyncratic local jurisdiction centered upon the thief-ridden forest of Hardwick in Yorkshire.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"> Pennant's <title level="m">A Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides; 1772</title> was published in two volumes in 1774-1776 and then in a new edition in 1776 that combined <title level="m">A Tour in Scotland</title> with the previously published account of his first tour of Scotland, <title level="m">A Tour of Scotland in 1769</title> [1771].</note>  During his tour, Pennant first observes the still extant stone platform that had been the site of Halifax's executions (the machine itself is long gone); he then recounts his direct encounter with a machine "of the same kind" in Edinburgh.  The Scottish Maiden, he writes, 
         <quote>is in the form of a painter's easel, and about ten feet high: at four feet from the bottom is a cross bar, on which the felon lays his head, which is kept down by another placed above.  In the inner edges of the frame are grooves; in these is placed a sharp axe, with a vast weight of lead, supported at the very summit with a peg; to that peg is fastened a cord, which the executioner cutting, the axe falls, and does the affair effectually, without suffering the unhappy criminal to undergo a repetition of strokes, as has been the case in the common method.  I must add, that if the sufferer is condemned for stealing a horse, or a cow, the string is tied to the beast, which on being whipped, pulls out the peg, and becomes the executioner. (700) </quote>
                     
                     The direct link between the machines is the sixteenth-century Scottish Regent James Douglas, Earl of Morton, the tragic figure who "took a model of [the Gibbet] as he passed through Halifax"; introduced it to Scotland; and then "at length suffered by it himself" (700).  Notably, the narrative of Pennant's <title level="m">Tour</title> concluded with this description of Halifax and its distinctive "machine of death," and so the tour's very sequence grants the episode a kind of formal privilege and prominence.  At the same time, the precise content of Pennant's description of the Edinburgh machine, as I will show, is all the more significant because it was so often repeated.  Croker and others like him directly interpolated the descriptive passage again and again within their own accounts of the French guillotine.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"> In addition to the examples I discuss in the present essay, Pennant's prose also migrates into the <title level="m">Newgate Calendar</title>, where it becomes the main substance of an appendix entitled <title level="a">The Maiden, or Scottish Guillotine</title> in the 1826 edition.  The Maiden is more briefly mentioned in the 1795 version of the <title level="m">Newgate Calendar</title> published by William Jackson, where much of the information in Pennant's description seems to be incorporated into an <title level="a">Account of John Hamilton, Esq.</title>
</note>
</p>
<p>Croker himself concedes in the end that Dr. Guillotin himself, "foolish" as he was, "probably knew nothing" about the English precedents; and Croker dutifully outlines a wider series of Continental precedents to the guillotine beyond the British examples Pennant had named (34).  The summary lesson of all these precedents, however, remains the oddity of the guillotine's genuine air of novelty in France: "We conclude from all this that this mode of execution was common on the Continent in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and yet had passed into such entire desuetude and oblivion as to have appeared as a perfect novelty when produced by Dr. Guillotin" (46). Striking here, though not explicitly articulated by Croker, is the extraordinary symmetry of Pennant's recently "recall[ing] the machine to public attention" and the quality of "perfect novelty" the machine nevertheless embodied, as if there is a latent correspondence between "perfect novelty" and at least one mode of antiquarian recovery. The "oblivion" of living or popular memory, in other words, seems precisely the avenue through which the archaic form resurrected by antiquarian enterprise can conduce to the "appearance" of novelty (which in Croker's ambiguous phrasing might equally point to false appearances or to a genuinely sudden, impactful coming into being).</p>
<p>Within the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title> for May 1840, an essay nearly contemporaneous with Croker's likewise brought the British prehistory of the guillotine to life while making a more unapologetic case for a direct line of influence between the Halifax Gibbet, the Scottish Maiden, and the later guillotine.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"> The <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title> is a descendant of the prominent Romantic-era fashion periodical <title level="j">La Belle Assemblée</title>.</note>
<title level="a">The Maiden and the Guillotine</title> dramatically underscores the scandal of this tale of origins: "Sceptical, as the reader may probably be upon the accuracy of this fact, it is nevertheless quite true! –the Guillotine is a machine of English invention, the use of which (singularly enough) was well known during the reign of Queen Elizabeth [...]" (429). Moreover, "The machine invented by Halifax law, was not [...] destined to remain within the limits of a narrow provincial district, but, at a later day to cross the sea and reach Paris by the somewhat circuitous route of Scotland" (431).  The <title level="j">Court and Lady's</title> account, which closely resembles Croker's four years later, evinces a similar reliance upon Pennant's antiquarian descriptions (again quoted at length) but dwells more intently upon the specific power of Pennant's reanimation of the old machine: 
                     <quote>When Pennant visited Edinburgh, the Halifax machine had [...] entirely disappeared from the public eye.  The sole trace of its existence in that city was a model of large dimensions, preserved in one of the halls of the ancient parliament house.  <emph>This model had become nothing more than a mere object of curiosity—a vestige of antiquity, in the eyes of a new generation</emph>; and as the national pride was not interested in its preservation, it fell subsequently into private hands, and is now, we believe, to be seen in the Museum of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries. <emph>Pennant was evidently able to examine it in its minutest detail, and he comprehended all its mechanism with peculiar sagacity</emph>, as will be seen by the description which we have previously given in his words. (433, my emphasis)</quote>
                     
                     In the intricate comprehension of "mechanism" that marks Pennant's description, we are to understand, one can observe the kind of antiquarian operation that restores the object of the past to the living "public eye" and also shapes its future course.</p>
<p>For my purposes here, I am more committed to the force of this fantasy of Pennant's authorship of the guillotine than to its objective historical accuracy, but I do wish to emphasize the particular qualities of Pennant's modes of observation that seemed to lend themselves to such speculation.  At the original moment of the <title level="m">Tour of Scotland</title>, Pennant's first readers already identified the qualities that made his writing especially expropriable. Samuel Johnson, for instance, observed in praise that Pennant was "the best traveller I ever read; he observes more <emph>things</emph> than anyone else does" (Boswell 3:56, my emphasis). For the <title level="j">London Magazine</title> in the same moment, Pennant "communicat[ed] to the world, the knowledge of their country in its present state" alongside "ancient customs and manners, and various antiquities, scarcely known before" (<title level="a">Impartial Review,</title> 337).  The latter assessment makes clear how Pennant's proliferating "things" are set loose in the world as part of a motley assortment of present knowledge, ancient customs, and "various" antiquities, the last of which do not properly belong to those "customs and manners" with which we might expect to align them.  James Boswell detected in Pennant a similarly paratactic habit of collection, but Boswell also understood this habit to be a serious detriment: Pennant "traversed a wide extent of country in such haste, that he could put together only <emph>curt, frittered fragments of his own</emph>" (3:56). Pennant is a "writer, who at best treats merely of superficial objects, and shews no philosophical investigation of character and manners," and who likewise borrows far too much from the real understanding of those local experts who assisted him (3:56).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">See also Charles W.J. Withers's introduction to <title level="m">A Tour in Scotland</title> (Pennant 1998). </note>  From the start, something about the mode of Pennant's attention <emph>generates</emph> fragments, or objects "superficial[ly]" denuded of cultural context, and—perhaps in consequence—has the power to transform objects like the Maiden from mere "curiosities" into things with a life of their own.  Such new life depends not so much upon a reanimating context, or the "character and manners" of a place (in Boswell's terms), as upon the intrinsic "mechanism" of the objects that (in the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title>'s terms) Pennant sagaciously discerned.</p>

<head>II.  Fashioning the King's Death</head>
<p>From the distant perspective of the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> and the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine,</title> Pennant's consequences for the French Revolution seemed at once evident in retrospect and diffusely unavailable to the original moment, which had labored under the delusion of the guillotine's novelty.  But the striking case of the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine</title> episode turns this perspective on its head. Here, the pages of fashion quite readily register the peculiarly mobile quality of Pennant's object descriptions in real time, with their own kind of distance.  Admittedly, the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> seems in many ways an unlikely candidate for the kind of perceptiveness I am describing.  In Paul-Gabriel Boucé's summation, the magazine is the most prominent of a set of periodicals ("predecessors to <title level="j">Playboy</title>") that "thrive[d] on the sexual content" of trials for criminal conversation and on the "obscene prints" they produced to accompany such tales (Wagner 132). In more pornographic moments, the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> shuttles between graphic tales of lesbianism (and "the art of <emph>tribade</emph>") and voyeuristic sadism, as in the "old debilitated Croesus, of Broad-street" who arranges with the mistresses of two boarding schools to observe unseen as girls are "flogged upon their bare posteriors" (April 1792: 56-57). But the remarkable quality of the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s exceptionally abandoned pages is that even those moments that would seem like genuine irruptions of the precipitous events of revolution finally bear out fashion's resiliently prurient and promiscuous capacity to traffic in such events on its own terms.  </p>
<p>The <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s strange modulations of the rush of history via its own peculiar priorities and procedures is nowhere more evident than in a seemingly straightforward dispatch on the execution of Louis XVI in the issue for January 1793. As the <title level="a">Epitome of the Times</title> for the issue reports in a brief, fashion-saturated shorthand, the French monarch "pulled off his stock, coat and waistcoat, and, with his neck and breast bare, ascended the scaffold with intrepidity, and undaunted fortitude; (it was only 20 minutes after ten o'clock) he wore a clean shirt and stock, white waistcoat, black Florentine silk breeches, black silk stockings, and his shoes were tied with black silk strings" (444). Notably, the outsized proportion of dress description in the abbreviated <title level="a">Epitome</title> functions as a hook for the next month's issue of the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>, where this passage plays a diminished role amidst a more extended narrative of the execution (but presumably continues to serve as a primary anchor of readers' attention).  At the same time, the passage is lifted directly from the <title level="j">Lady's Magazine</title>, the leading fashion publication of the moment that was interpellating respectable female consumers rather antithetical to the libertine, male audience of the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>. Commenting on the original context of just this passage in the <title level="j">Lady's Magazine</title>, Mary Poovey notes the absence of comparable attention to dress in the contemporaneous account of the execution in the <title level="m">Gentleman's Magazine</title>; this gaze for Poovey thus instances women's relegation to a private sphere of "polite conversation" and "sensual" concern rather than rational political judgment (16-18).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"> Deidre Lynch has more recently rectified Poovey's neglect of the "utopian, and feminist" potential of the scene of fashionable consumption as a "counter public" or proto-public. But the more fundamental deformation of the king's execution via fashion in the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine</title>, in its libertine, masculine address, speaks of a more unruly and asocial side of fashion (213, 215).</note>  But if the dress served readers of the <title level="j">Lady's Magazine</title> as supplemental information that might at least invite a gendered mode of attention to the larger circumstances, the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s disproportionate attention to dress at the very moment of regicide gleefully disrupts such a project, by making of the fashionable objects this history precipitated the most salient content of the execution.  </p>
<p>As the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> understood, the "state" of dress, especially in the cycles meted by the royal birthday, was fundamental to imagining the monarchy and its sovereign expression of the social life of the moment.  A prototypical issue of the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> for June 1791, for instance, relayed reports on the celebration of George III's birthday earlier in the same month.  The King "appeared in a <emph>chocolate</emph> coloured silk tabby coat, richly spangled all over with silver spangles, and embroidered on the seams; the waistcoat was of white silk, ornamented in the same manner [...]"; the Queen appeared "in a train of white and silver, with a petticoat of the same, richly embroidered" together with brilliant jewels and "ornaments of silver and foils"; and the Princess "Was in a rich silver silk body and train, a petticoat richly embroidered with silver spangles and pink convolves, with a loose drapery of green and silver in folds on the corners of the hoop, which had a new and beautiful effect" (141-143).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn10" n="10">In this issue the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s dress description also indicates how fashion-seeking puts special pressure on questions of representativeness, especially as the focus moves  from the singular costumes of the royal family to the larger crowd: "The gentlemen's dresses were generally of dark tea green, and chocolate coloured silk, or dark stripes, with white silk waistcoats, spangled, embroidered, or tamboured"; and  "The ladies mostly wore white crape petticoats, spangled, and spotted with white foil, corn flowers, and other fancy flowers [...];"The ladies' bodies and trains were chiefly of crape or striped gauze, trimmed with silver fringe [...] The fashionable colour for ribbons was decidedly purple; a great many lilacs were also displayed [...] The caps were principally trimmed with rich blond lace [...].  The caps in general were rather low and broad; they were mostly of white or coloured crape, suitable to the dresses, ornamented with artificial flowers [...].  The hair was almost universally dressed in curls."  The language of trend-spotting, and its promise to convey what is "generally," "mostly," "chiefly," "decidedly," or "principally" characteristic amidst a wider set of possibilities, bears a clear resemblance to sifting for more properly historical signs of the times (141-143).
                  </note> Against this backdrop, the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s plagiarized account of Louis XVI's wardrobe takes on a distinctly perverse valence. Even the ostensibly straight reporting on Louis XVI's execution, in other words, makes the scene a grotesque rehearsal of the ubiquitous print fashion scene of the royal ball and of its characteristic mode of description: the "white waistcoat" of Louis XVI is a macabre reflection of George III at the birthday celebration (in his own "white silk" waistcoat).  Likewise, a subsequent report in the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> for September 1792, on the new fashions of the gentlemen of France, sardonically pointed to garments "<emph>spotted</emph> with a mixture, called the blood of their countrymen—<foreign>Sans Culottes</foreign>" (285, my emphasis). The satire most directly puns on the account of the ladies' petticoats in 1791 (and others garments like theirs) which are "spotted with white foil."<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn11" n="11">See my previous note.</note>  But if the satire in part rebukes the revolution, it just as surely makes of the blood-spotted shirts of Frenchmen a grotesque kind of fashion in a way that destabilizes any secure stance of judgment on the bloodshed.  </p>
<p>My concern, then, is not with the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s abiding plagiarism as such but rather with its fashion-informed mode of appropriation, whereby the objects and events that come within its purview are powerfully recontextualized or remade. This mode is once again borne out in the magazine's adoption of Pennant's guillotine description. The aforementioned issue of the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> for February 1793 (which expands the initial passages on Louis XVI's dress into a fuller narrative, the <title level="a">Authentic Particulars of the Last Moments of Louis XVI</title>), also turns its attention to the guillotine itself, as an object worthy of visual and verbal attention in its own right. Added to the narrative of the king's execution is a footnote, which promises "a description of the machine by which the king suffered and which takes its name of Guillotine from that of the person who brought it into use."  The footnote further references a plate included with the magazine and then repeats Pennant's familiar prose ("It is in the form of a painter's easel, and about ten feet high [...]," etc.)—but does so with acknowledgement neither of Pennant himself, nor of the different machine Pennant was actually describing, so that his prose becomes a kind of fabricated on-the-spot reporting.</p>
<p>In being organized around objects or sites rather than by sustained narrative, antiquarian writing always potentially conduced to this kind of circulation.  The <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s interpolation of Pennant in the 1790s is not unique; and the immediate inspiration for the invocation is likely Richard Twiss's travel narrative, <title level="m">A Trip to Paris, in July and August, 1792</title> (1793).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn12" n="12">In addition to <title level="m">A Trip to Paris</title>, Richard Twiss's travel writings include his <title level="m">Travels Through Portugal and Spain in 1772 and 1773</title> (1775) and his noteworthy <title level="j">Tour in Ireland in 1775</title> (1776).
                  </note> Amidst Twiss's wider survey of British and Continental precedents to the guillotine and engravings thereof (in concrete anticipation of Croker's much later essay), Pennant's description characteristically comes to the fore.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn13" n="13">Twiss's account is also the occasion for a small ripple of related commentary in the <title level="j">Gentleman's Quarterly</title>.  After the magazine reviews Twiss's <title level="m">Trip to Paris</title> in the issue for December 1792, two correspondents supply further context on the guillotine's antecedents in March 1793 and January 1794; and the March 1793 letter also includes an illustration of the Scottish Maiden.  (See also the advertisement for Twiss's opportunistic exhibition in London, <title level="m">Execution of the King of France now exhibiting at No. 28, Hay-market. La Guillotine; or The beheading machine, from Paris, by which the late King of France suffered</title> [1793].)</note>  In a chapter entitled <title level="a">Execution of Two Criminals, with a Beheading Machine</title> Twiss reports on the execution's immediate aftermath, which affords him the opportunity to see the guillotine: 
         <quote>I did not see the execution, because, as the hour is never specified, I might have waited for many hours in a crowd, from which there is no extricating one's self.  I was there immediately after, and saw the machine, which was just going to be taken away.  I went into a coffee-house and made a drawing, which is here engraven.  It is called <foreign>la Guillotine</foreign>, from the name of the person who first brought it into use in Paris [...].  In English it is termed a maiden. (32) </quote>

Twiss's account conveys some of the nuance of the moment by initially equating the British and French machines (i.e., in Scotland the seemingly same machine "is termed" a maiden) but then subsequently, in a footnote, detailing Pennant's "long account of <emph>such a machine</emph>," in a phrase that will not quite admit equivalence (32, my emphasis).  In the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>, then, the shift from this analogizing language ("such a machine") to the direct application of Pennant's description to the guillotine itself is all the more striking because the provenance of Pennant's description (its original applicability to an object of antiquity) is available—and therefore deliberately effaced.  </p>
<p>The rupture that results in the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> from the failure of this borrowed description to accord fully with the accompanying illustration, entitled the <title level="a">Form of the Machine on which Louis XVI suffered Death,</title> partly seems of a piece with the dizzying mix of aesthetics, politics, sovereignty, sex, and costume therein.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn14" n="14">In a further destabilization of any sense of urgency related to the regicide, for instance, this initial account of the death of Louis XVI appeared alongside the unperturbedly salacious account of the <title level="a">Trial of Mrs. Wilmot,</title> including an illustration entitled <title level="m">The Kissing Scene</title> (in which the male adulterer bends to perform cunnilingus on Mrs. Wilmot, who has lifted her dress to facilitate the act).</note>

Yet if the illustration evinces an aestheticizing distance from the enormity of the event that echoes the unperturbed scrutiny of details of dress in the prior issue, the image also suggests how such distant scrutiny was being sustained from the start by the distance built into Pennant's prose description.  The diagrammatic qualities of the image, particularly evident in the more schematic window to the lower left, suggest functional attributes of the blade and stock but also lend them an air of geometric regularity that pushes our sense of the machine's "Form" toward a perversely aesthetic appreciation, one that is further sustained by the architectural regularity of the perfectly centered guillotine's rectilinear form.  Likewise, the jarring qualities of the king's floating head (which the perspective has visually separated from his body even before the blade falls) and of the clashing diagonals of background scene (which echo the machine's form in non-representational ways that compete with the scene's narrative meaning) offer the scene as a visual conundrum as much as an obvious occasion for sentiment.  Far from signaling the exceptionality of regicide, the unreal qualities of this image are fully consonant with a more overt, visual conjuring of aesthetic dissonance in the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> in 1792 (and again in 1795), an illustration entitled <title level="a">Critical Observations Upon Beauty</title>.

</p>
<p>In this context, the contingent qualities of Pennant's own mediation of the object come to the fore—most especially the conspicuously aesthetic qualities of his description, which were to some extent elicited by intrinsic qualities of the Maiden but that were also enhanced by Pennant's particular practice of antiquarianism.  The image Croker included in his history makes clear that such associations would in some sense have been unavoidable.

            But the Maiden's unmistakable appearance in the "form of an easel" also made its shape suddenly compatible with both an emerging appreciation of the picturesque (before the letter) and with contemporaneous reenvisionings of governance as art.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn15" n="15">Like many critics, Stephen Copley numbers Pennant among those "unsympathetic to the claims of the Picturesque," but such a firm distinction (especially prior to the publication of Gilpin's <title level="m">Observations</title> in 1782) seems dismissive of the complexity of the enterprise of Pennant's second tour, all the more when the illustrations and manifold antique ruins are considered (42).
               </note> Pennant's second tour of Scotland was a noteworthy departure from his first tour in benefiting from the talents of Moses Griffiths, Pennant's "servant and an 'able artist' who produced the many sketches later published as engravings" (Pennant xvi). The odd way in which Griffiths's visual-aesthetic appropriations of Scotland aligned with the "easel" shape of the antique guillotine suggests an added element of the Maiden's interest for Pennant as well as the peculiar "framing" of history the device of the Maiden might conjure as a result.  At the same time, as Eric Slauter has shown with particular reference to the early American context, governments of the age were increasingly seen to be aesthetic projects, "works of art," meant to be materialized, in turn, in artful form.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn16" n="16">As Slauter emphasizes, "Political thought not only coincided with aesthetic theory, sharing a few crucial terms like 'distinterestedness,' the self-negating stance of tasteful spectators before an art object and the proper posture of enlightened representatives in the face of party zeal: in the eighteenth century, political thought and aesthetic theory were mutually constitutive" (98).</note>  The Maiden itself, on this view, seems both like an instantiation of an antique mode of governance and a means or technique by which to make governance aesthetically meaningful. In all these senses, it is not only Pennant himself but a shifting aesthetic context that irresistibly draws the Maiden into new prominence on the basis of this peculiar form.</p>

<div type="section">
<head>III.  Scott's Maidens</head>
<p>I now turn from the story I have reprised so far, in which Pennant's resurrection of the antique Scottish Maiden played a role in the emergence of the French guillotine, to what I will suggest is Walter Scott's extended (and perhaps counter-aestheticizing) response to this story. I begin by registering the remarkable ways in which Pennant's encounter with the Maiden anticipated the form or structure of Scott's <title level="m">Waverley</title> itself. Most concretely, perhaps, Croker emphasizes how "Near thirty years prior to Pennant's publication, the execution of the Scotch lords for the Rebellion of 1745 by the axe and block seems to have recalled the obsolete <emph>Maiden</emph> to notice" (38).  Croker points specifically to the <title level="j">London Magazine</title> for April 1747, which mentions a (seemingly abandoned)  plan to execute Simon Lord Fraser of Lovat by means of "an Engine [...] like that called <emph>the Maiden</emph>" (153), and which contains illustrations both of Fraser's execution by axe and block and of the Maiden itself, "as anciently used in Scotland for beheading traitors" (187).  In this way, the living local memory and material preservation that enabled Pennant to scrutinize the Maiden in 1772 were extended effects of the Jacobite rising of 1745-1746 that became the subject of Scott's novel.  </p>
<p>In another sense, Pennant's counterintuitive account of the Maiden upheld it as an ambiguous icon of progress; it was not a surviving token of archaic brutality but a relatively recent improvisation in response to the growing pains of commercial proto-modernity. Pennant reports the conjecture (which he describes as "very probable") that the Halifax Gibbet arose at a moment when the woolen manufactures—now thriving in Pennant's day—first "began to gain strength."  The spectacle of justice the Gibbet created was intended to moderate the "lawless set" who inhabited the "wild country around," and whose Highlander-like "depredations on the cloth-tenters might [otherwise have] soon stifle[d] the efforts of infant industry" (Pennant 699). Such a prehistory of textile production bears an inevitable relevance to the dress-driven art of Scott and the taste he created; and indeed in its 1840 account, the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title> cannot resist translating Pennant's sparer fable of commercialization into a more enticingly concrete image of primitive retail exhibition and its temptations: Halifax's "hilly environs were daily seen speckled with pieces of cloth of all colours, suspended from tenters' poles.  This display of valuable stuffs was unfortunately beheld by other eyes than those of the honest chapmen of the cloth-market" (430).  As such a scene might suggest, and as the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title> put it explicitly, the Maiden was itself a kind of prolepsis for the English commercial ingenuity of the eighteenth century.  That is, the guillotine's early arrival in Halifax "proceeded from the same mechanical genius, which, in our own days, has given birth to the wonder-working <emph>Spinning Jennies</emph>" (429).</p>
<p>	The actual history of the Maiden also converges with the fictional landscape Scott created in quite direct ways.  <title level="m">The Heart of Mid-Lothian</title> (1818), for instance, is Scott's most extensive meditation on the problem of state execution under the broad dispensation of public interest (and in this case, without proof of crime). The unfortunate Effie Deans, whose newborn child is missing, stands to lose her life for the crime of infanticide; for the law deems her constructively guilty by virtue of her previous silence about her pregnancy. Effie's sister Jeanie ultimately saves her by obtaining a pardon in a royal audience facilitated by the Duke of Argyle. In part Argyle's assistance is consistent with his status in the novel as Scott's great hero of moderation in the period (as an accommodating Presbyterian who "Soar[ed] above the petty distinctions of faction" and softened the tensions between Scotland and England [344]). But Jeanie's solicitation of his aid also directly invokes the memory of the Duke's "unfortunate" grandfather and great-grandfather (350).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn17" n="17">Jeannie Deans presents the Duke of Argyll with a letter from his own grandfather (bestowed on the grandfather of Jeannie's betrothed in gratitude for loyal service in trying times) that enjoined his friends and family in the future to come to the assistance of the bearer (and his family and friends) in times of need.  In the same moment she is remarkably described as dressed "in the style of Scottish <emph>maidens</emph> of her own class" (Scott, <title level="m">Midlothian</title>, 350, my emphasis). </note> Never directly mentioned but always lurking is the fate these Argyle ancestors met on the Maiden itself, in 1685 and 1661, respectively.  The present Duke's valorization of modernity, then, as well as his heightened sympathy for Jeanie, bear the special weight of the memory of the Maiden's operation.  And if <title level="m">The Heart of Mid-Lothian</title> itself is perhaps Scott's most eloquent intimation of the Maiden's legacy, the machine's fateful operation is similarly implicated in works like <title level="m">A Legend of Montrose</title> (1819), which features Argyle's aforementioned great-grandfather, and both <title level="m">The Abbot</title> (1820) and <title level="m">The Monastery</title> (1820), where James Douglas, Earl of Morton (who had carried the Maiden from Halifax to Edinburgh in the first place and ironically met his end upon it) prominently features as a character.</p>
<p>There is further evidence of the Author of <title level="m">Waverley</title>'s quiet intimacy with the Maiden's shadow—and of a secondary mediation of the French guillotine through Scottish history by way of Scott's oeuvre—not only in Croker's general proximity to Scott through their mutual work for the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>, but also in the particular pages of Croker's <title level="m">History of the Guillotine</title>.  Croker's history directly cites Scott's <title level="m">Tales of a Grandfather</title> (as collected in Scott's <title level="m">Complete Prose Works</title> in 1836) as the source for his most gleaming anecdote on the ancient victims of the Maiden: the moment when the doomed Earl of Argyle in 1685 had "pressed his lips on the block," and "declar[ed] [...] that it was the sweetest <emph>maiden</emph> he had ever kissed" (39).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn18" n="18">Notably Scott undertook the <title level="m">Tales of a Grandfather</title> in order to improve upon Croker's own <title level="m">Stories Selected from the History of England</title> (1822), which Scott found overly condescending to child readers.</note>  At this moment in the <title level="m">Tales of a Grandfather</title>, Scott himself had likewise interrupted his recounting of the execution of Argyle to cite Pennant's description of the Maiden in a lengthy footnote ("in the form of a painter's easel," and so on, once again) and to identify it explicitly as "an instrument resembling the Guillotine of modern France" (280-281).  If Pennant had unwittingly circulated the guillotine within actual history in the 1790s, Scott was likely at the root of the late re-appreciation of the British origins of the instrument by way of Pennant's work, as reflected in both Croker's history and <title level="j">The Court and Lady's Magazine</title> in the years to come.  </p>
<p>In Scott's carefully chosen wording, the nature of the relation between the Maiden that Pennant described and the French guillotine is "resemblance," which subtly but tellingly consigns each machine to its own moment.  In a way that emphasizes how Scott's construction of this relationship (as resemblance) was not inevitable, the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title> figuratively construed the same relationship as one of direct, material continuity. Having traced the Maiden's route from Halifax to Edinburgh to Paris, the <title level="j">Court and Lady's</title> pauses to "behold [in the guillotine] the rotten and disjointed members of the Halifax <emph>Maiden</emph> collected together again after so long a desuetude—the old fragments cramped and repieced, and after complete restoration of all parts and a fresh coat of paint, given forth to the world as a <emph>discovery</emph> made by French philosophy!" (433). The insistent troping of the guillotine as an archaic object lurking only just beneath the thinnest of restorative veneers reads like an especially fearful accounting of the logic of fashion that treated the past as a reservoir of forms—and so indeed reconstituted old models as new by infusing them with all the allure of novelty and presence.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn19" n="19">Perhaps reflecting Pennant's distinctive qualities, these "disjointed members" and "old fragments" from Halifax are not so unlike the "curt, frittered fragments" that Boswell had accused Pennant of producing in print, to be passed off as new in the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>.  </note> Scott's opposing insistence on (mere) resemblance, finally, is part and parcel of his fictions' larger project to insist that the true time of origin of historical objects will out—that artifacts and styles alike may often resemble but never quite recur.  </p>
<p>In foregrounding the work Scott did to assign archaic or obsolete objects more fixedly to their times of provenance—and in emphasizing that he did so with the peculiar aid of fashion—the remainder of my essay means to intervene in recent debates about the status of the residual in the Romantic moment, when the ominousness of the category seemed far more menacing a problem than it had for Pennant himself. I especially have in mind what Ina Ferris, in the best recent consideration of the problem, calls "the time of the remnant." Ferris rightly draws our attention to a series of persons and objects in Scott whose remnancy "generates a curiously insubstantial existence in the present"; and she describes a special, Romantic genre of the remnant tale, which "retains at its core an experience of disconnection from present energies" (475).  In turning to <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> in light of my preceding discussion of the troublingly unbounded objects harvested by the antiquarian enterprise, I want to fill out the range of possibilities for remnancy in Scott by considering the ways in which remnancy might best be thought as a normative, rather than an exceptional, state.  That is to say, in part, that the "experience of disconnection from present energies" that Ferris describes is as frequently and as characteristically conjured by Scott's manifold presentations of outdated dress as it is in the more evidently historical disconnections Ferris foregrounds. </p>
<p>In the broadest terms, Scott's antiquary haunts the supposed distinctness of the temporal present with a reminder that attachment to the moment at hand might not be so different from the antiquary's ostensibly aberrant attachment to a favored moment from the past.  Ferris herself underscores the distinctness of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>, as a text that "enfolds all manner of remnants in a generous model of community," in what she sees as a contrast to less harmonious Waverley Novels (475).  But that otherwise useful formulation of "community" obscures how much the <emph>present</emph>, in any strong sense, is displaced by that very different, and not so obviously temporal, conception of unity.  If Scott's fiction is instrumental in creating a sense of "connect[ion] to the energy of historical process" (in Ferris's terms), Scott is equally a theorist of enduring provenances (for persons and for objects), of determinations by former moments that are much more compelling than the weak sort of synchronic coincidence that tends to characterize any given "now" (476).  "Historical context" on this view may be nothing more than the weak collective product of the idiosyncratic temporal attachments of persons (to many times)—and thus a space wherein historical affiliations rather than determinations may come to the fore.</p>
<p>Ferris's account of remnancy is emblematic of how, in contrast to the way I want to think about Scott, recent secondary work on the antiquarian enterprise has tended to bifurcate the historical specimen between the categories of the "fragment" (which persists as an isolated or residual entity fully cut off from the present) and the "forgery," literal or otherwise (which despite a pretense to pastness finally belongs, in one way or another, fully to the present).  But at the literary epicenter of the figure of the antiquary, Scott himself is precisely interested to <emph>stage</emph> this fragment/forgery division.  As a character, Jonathan Oldbuck at least rhetorically presumes a hard and fast division between past and present, classical antiquity and modern times.  But Oldbuck's refraction in the person of his sister Griselda points to the fuller complexity the novel has in mind from the start.  During the young hero Lovel's initial encounter with her at the threshold of Oldbuck's estate of Monkbarns, Griselda first appears (in the novel's setting of 1794) as the living embodiment of 1770: "The elderly lady rustled in silks and satins, and bore upon her head a structure resembling the fashion in the ladies' memorandum-book for the year 1770—a superb piece of architecture—not much less than a modern Gothic castle, of which the curls might represent the turrets, the black pins the <foreign>chevaux de frize</foreign>, and the lappets the banners"; likewise, "An antique flowered silk gown graced the extraordinary person to whom belonged this unparalleled <foreign>tête</foreign>," along with "triple blond ruffles" at the elbows, "gloves of a bright vermillion color," and "a short silk cloak, thrown in easy negligence over her shoulders"; and when Lovel pays his respects he is "answered by the prolonged curtsey of 1760" (57-58).  As an antique <emph>person</emph> who takes on the qualities of styles prevailing in the various days of her own making, Griselda's way of adhering to time more closely resembles the lives of objects than the fates of the written texts or dematerialized spaces of historical encounter (e.g., just-discernible traces of Roman-era earthworks in the landscape) that Oldbuck tends to privilege. And if Griselda's seemingly eccentric perpetuation of the past sets the tone for the novel, it finally appears not so much in contrast as in parallel to "the fashion of the day" that adorns Oldbuck's niece, Maria (58); to the "old-fashioned barbering" of Jacob Caxon upon the three wigs still being worn in the parish (48); and to the "ornaments in the taste of a former and distant period" that furnish the foreboding Glenallan House (273).  Griselda's dress is the template for the novel's proliferation and preservation of times other than antiquity and the present.</p>
<p>  In the last instance, through the French invasion that famously never comes, <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> spoofs the very possibility that presentness could emerge in a strong sense. In retrospect, the novel's most genuine moment of urgency is the clockwork tide best observed via the Fairport Almanack's catalogue of the sea's repetitive motion. (An unusually high tide threatens to sweep the unsuspecting Sir Arthur Wardour and his daughter, Isabella, out to sea.) <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn20" n="20">On this scene and its larger relevance, see Richard Maxwell, who suggests that Oldbuck knows "the rules of time and its periodic inundations" (452).                  
               </note> Crucially, the merely calendrical succession of the tides directly displaces the aspiration to cohesive, cultural presentness embodied within the fashionable women's "pocket almanack" of Oldbuck's niece, which would have carried precisely such information as the "dress of the year," in prose description and in visual illustration of the latest styles. Struck with the urgency of the moment, Oldbuck flings this pocket almanac aside to consult the other volume so denominated.  ("An almanack! an almanack! [...] not that bauble!" he cries [69].)  Maria's ostensibly current pocket book, like her attachment to the "fashion of the day" (58) (as registered within the almanac as well as on her person), has no more essential connection to the urgent situation at hand than does the "ladies memorandum book for the year 1770" (57) that continues to guide Griselda's headdress style. </p>
<p>Scott, whom literary history largely continues to see as the architect of historical presentness, is in a different way a projector of the present's impossibility. In the many times of Monkbarns, Scott recasts the antiquarian idea as the negative image of modernity's naïve faith in a unified present (or moment, or episteme, or crisis) different in kind from the past.  Scott's antiquarian counter-vision animates historical specimens but refuses either to relegate or conscript them—and so refuses to concede the ontological privilege of a present that, like all other moments, can finally bear on human existence only insofar as it is called, or loved, or loathed into being by its custodians.  A longer perspective on the antiquarian enterprise, then, begins to suggest how modern historical fiction is built against a backdrop of fashion's rival relation to the cultural archive.  And as a deep response to Pennant's mobile guillotines, Scott's historical fiction takes shape, in part, through a complex refusal to allow fashions to be present again.

<p>In Aleida Assmann's succinct definition, cultures are "systematic and highly elaborate strategies against the primary experience of ongoing decay and general oblivion" (43). Her model derives primarily if not exclusively from work on modern cultural memory focused on twentieth-century Europe, but it bears suggestively on late eighteenth-/early nineteenth-century Britain, when the sense of an ever more uncertain future impinged powerfully on the present, altering what was being asked of and about the past. Assmann thus understands cultures as temporal practices, reading them as a constellation of tactics and techniques of transmission, retrieval, and repetition geared to the survival of a particular group. But the memory sites cultures generate stand in different relations to the group as a whole. Assmann draws particular attention to the distinction between a "canon" and an "archive": this distinction marks the line between an "active memory" enacted in a wide range of public practices and institutions and a latent "archival memory" made up of what can be materially retrieved but is no longer current: the forgotten, overlooked, obsolete (43). Archival memory, she stresses, is a specialist memory, circulating outside the spheres of "common knowledge"; at the same time, however, she notes,"the borderline between the archival and the canon's active memory is permeable in both directions" (44). Items constantly migrate back and forth, so that cultural memory is properly understood as an ongoing dynamic of transfer and exchange. The story of antiquarianism in the early Romantic period is importantly the story of such a migration, as antiquaries, quintessential custodians of "archival memory," actively sought to move its materials out of the archive and into wider public circulation. </p>
<p>	No longer confining themselves to collecting bits of the past, corresponding about these, or describing them in papers for antiquarian circles, Romantic antiquaries increasingly turned into public authors, producing books for the literary market. Volumes of "curiosities," "popular antiquities," "specimens," and "reliques" appeared with regularity, achieving a surprisingly high critical profile in the periodical reviews, even as the old negative trope of the (specialized) myopic antiquary burrowing away among the "rubbish" of the past continued to remain in prominent play. By the end of the eighteenth century, Rosemary Sweet has shown, antiquarianism was becoming "popularized," as participation in antiquarian activities moved down the social scale into the "middling" reaches of the population and antiquarian authors,  anxious to provide the public with a "more easily digestible antiquarianism," began to gain a broader readership (Sweet 330). Underlying these shifts in practice and reception was antiquarianism's own shift of interest over the course of the eighteenth century from the study of the classical past to that of the "popular antiquities" of Great Britain, both literary (ballads, rhymes, songs) and socio-historical (customs, manners, costume). As essays in this volume demonstrate, the classical past by no means dropped out, but the emergence of obscure sections of the national past as sources of historical interest produced important new genres and publication format. Prominent among these was the illustrated antiquarian history largely shaped by Joseph Strutt. This genre was instrumental both in opening up the study of everyday life in remote eras (particularly the Anglo-Saxon) as a historical subject and in promoting visual material as evidential source, but its success and influence were in no small part due to the fact that its innovations operated within the textual parameters of traditional historiography. By the late eighteenth century, illustrated antiquarian publications like the Society of Antiquaries' series of <title level="m">Vetusta Monumenta</title> and Richard Gough's <title level="m">Sepulchral Monuments of Great Britain Applied to Illustrate the History of Families, Manners, Habits and Arts, At the Different Periods from the Norman Conquest to the Seventeenth Century</title> (1786-96) had developed new forms of historical investigation founded on the study and representation of material remains. Illustrated antiquarian histories, however, based themselves primarily on archival materials located in venues such as the British Museum, the Bodleian and other scholarly collections (private as well as semi-public). In this documentary bias, as well as in the interest in "popular antiquities," they thus converged with literary antiquarianism, which too was intent on moving matter out of the archive and into public circulation. At the same time, I will argue, the tactics of illustrated antiquarian histories exemplify a poetics of the piece in which the past was placed rather differently than in the more familiar publications of literary antiquarianism. </p>
<p>	I take as representative of the popularizing thrust (in several senses) of illustrated antiquarian history the influential but under-studied figure of Joseph Strutt. Strutt himself came from outside the gentry-professional circles that traditionally dominated historical study, underscoring the central role of such self-educated figures in the period's reconfiguration of knowledge (Heringman). Apprenticed in his teens to the celebrated engraver William Wynne Ryland, Strutt turned antiquarian author in his early twenties with a seminal publication, <title level="m">The Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of England</title> (1773). This book grew out of his researches in the manuscript collections of the British Museum and literally offered readers a new "view" of early English history in the engravings with which it was profusely illustrated. Pioneering the use of manuscript illuminations as historical material, Strutt sought in his engravings to provide a more accurate depiction of historical dress and customs. Importantly, he was motivated not only by the desire to contribute to historical knowledge but also, as Roy Strong has noted, by an explicit wish to transmit such knowledge to painters and others engaged in representing the past to the public (Strong 51). After this first work, which concentrated on the noble classes, Strutt's books greatly widened their focus to cover the whole range of social ranks, and they increasingly devoted themselves to the subject of informal social life (habits, customs, pastimes). His authorship remained governed by the desire to make his antiquarian researches more widely accessible, and culminated in an attempt at an antiquarian romance set in the fifteenth century, left unfinished at his death. In one of literary history's happy coincidences, his publisher, John Murray, asked the best-selling antiquarian-poet Walter Scott (not yet a novelist) to conclude the work, which appeared in 1808 as <title level="m">Queenhoo-Hall: A Romance</title>.</p>
<p>	The engravings Strutt had pioneered in <title level="m">Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities</title> constitute  the core of his achievement and became the hallmark of his historical publications. Thus the engravings are prominently advertised in the titles of his two most influential books: <title level="m">A Complete View of the Dress and Habits of the People of England ...Illustrated by Engravings Taken From the Most Authentic Remains of Antiquity</title> (1796-99); and <title level="m">Sports and Pastimes of the People of England...Illustrated by Engravings selected from Ancient Paintings</title> (1801). Strutt himself in his prefaces repeatedly emphasized the centrality and provenance of the engravings, as in the <title level="a">Address to the Public</title> prefacing <title level="m">Dress and Habits</title>: "The engravings, which form the most material part of this publication, are taken from drawings in Manuscripts coëval with the times that they are intended to illustrate, or other monuments of antiquity equally authentic" (<title level="m">Dress and Habits</title> 1:ii). Importantly, authenticity rested not only on the archival source but on the fidelity of Strutt's craftsmanship. Hence he follows this initial statement with the affirmation that the engravings are "faithfully copied from the originals, without an additional fold being made to the draperies, or the least deviation from the form of the garments" (<title level="m">Dress and Habits</title> 1:iii). At the same time, the <title level="a">Address to the Public</title> draws attention to the epistemological difficulties encountered in the making of the engravings. The "labour" of antiquarian research is a standard motif in antiquarian prefaces, but Strutt had to contend with particular problems attendant on dealing with two sign systems in the archive (words, images). Correlating these proved difficult, sometimes impossible.</p>
<p>	On the one hand, he reports, the verbal descriptions of clothes in contemporary accounts were often too "vague or nugatory" to be of help in explicating the drawings or monumental effigies contemporary with them; on the other hand, where the descriptions were in fact full, Strutt could often find no paintings or other images to offer "concordant assistance" (<title level="m">Dress and Habits</title> 1:iv). Even as he exerted himself to coordinate these "two sources of information," he often had to admit defeat and resorted to "conjectural evidence" (<title level="m">Dress and Habits</title> 1:iv). In other words, if he wanted to produce an illustration (as he typically did), he had to make a decision. In illustrated antiquarian histories, Sam Smiles astutely observes, the uncertainties and conflicting interpretations that could be accommodated in the text could not be reflected in the images: indeed, Smiles argues, the "authoritative closure" of the latter tended to efface the indeterminacy often present in the former (Smiles 63). Images dominate, and it was Strutt's images that developed a potent afterlife as sources in history textbooks, historical paintings, and theatrical productions (Mitchell, Strong). In them, Roy Strong remarks, Strutt "pieced together for the very first time a picture of everyday life in England from the Anglo-Saxons down to the Tudor age" (Strong 50). But if Strutt "pieced" things together, he did so by first pulling them apart. The importance of Strutt's publications from a more literary-theoretical point of view is that they throw into relief the degree to which this mode of the antiquarian transmission of the past depended less on preserving its remains than on turning the past itself into pieces: a deliberate, even aggressive, disaggregation of the past. </p>
<p>	Antiquarianism as a whole is notoriously a phenomenon of pieces and piecing. Its signature practice, Yoon Sun Lee points out, is a "foraging" among the defunct, the broken off, and the obscure. Such "foraging," she observes, operates within a temporality of discontinuity, premised on the "loss and extinction that made retrieval necessary," and hence stands at odds with discourses or narratives premised on a temporality of continuity (Lee 77). This discordance intensified when antiquaries turned from collecting to publishing pieces of the past. That is, where antiquarian collecting approached the past as a found object (actual "remains" that persisted from the past), antiquarian publications (thick volumes foregrounding authorial or editorial "labours," their pages typically broken up with footnotes and marginal notations) made apparent that the past was something worked on and worked up. Taking up—and taking out—bits of the past, antiquarian authors, editors, engravers, and bibliographers explicitly engaged in acts of reframing and reshaping. So Francis Douce (like Strutt, interested in "popular antiquities") notoriously removed individual leaves and cut out images from his manuscripts and early printed books, pasting them into scrapbooks in the hope of assembling a chronology for the history of dress (Jensen 181-82). As Kristian Jensen emphasizes, Douce had "no interest in the integrity of books as medieval objects" (181). For him they were not found objects ("relics") but literally "bits" of information, ready to be put to modern use whether to produce an informal chronology of dress or, as in his <title level="m">Illustrations of Shakespeare and of Ancient Manners</title> (1807), to elucidate references in literature from the past. Unlike the antiquarian soul in Nietzsche's famous image, Douce did not wrap himself up in his antiquities and move into them; rather, he moved the past about (Nietzsche 19). </p>
<p>	So too did Strutt. While his engravings may not have deviated in "the least" from the "form of the garments," matters were rather different when it came to their "arrangement." Strutt's commitment to publication as a communicative act made for certain breaches of fidelity. Notably, the same <title level="a">Address to the Public</title> that claims absolute accuracy in copying figures allows for some fudging when it comes to putting them together: "it has been my study to render them interesting by grouping them as pleasingly as the nature of the subject would admit" (<title level="m">Dress and Habits</title> 1:iii) Moreover, he has introduced "ornamental embellishments," although these (he hastens to say) are not "in any instance" the work of his imagination but "accurate specimens of ancient art, and extracted from the same manuscript that the figures, or some of them at least, are taken" (<title level="m">Dress and Habits</title> 1:iii). A flexible protocol of fidelity (i.e., fidelity with loopholes) governs all his works, reiterated in his final completed work, <title level="m">Sports and Pastimes</title>, where he avers that the plates do not contain "a single figure that has not its proper authority" and declares that all have been "faithfully made," but goes on to qualify the assertion of faithful craftsmanship by remarking that the figures have been copied "without the least unnecessary deviation" (<title level="m">Sports and Pastimes</title> 1). What may make for "necessary" deviation he does not specify, but the concluding sentence offers a clue: "As specimens of the art of design they have nothing to recommend them to the modern eye, but as portraitures of the manners and usages of our ancestors, in times remote, they are exceedingly valuable" (<title level="m">Sports and Pastimes</title> 1). This sentence is at once a concession to the "modern eye," to its assumption that illustrations properly exemplify "the art of design," and an attempt to reorient its vision by redefining such visual matter in non-aesthetic terms: illustrations as documentary, rather than aesthetic, effects. More than this, however, it underlines Strutt's acute awareness of the readerly eye playing over his images, and points up the degree to which his recompositions (a recurring feature of his work) engage the aesthetic as well as historical imperative, recalling his earlier remarks in <title level="m">Dress and Habits</title> on his willingness to arrange figures as  "pleasingly" as possible.</p>

</figure>
<p>	For Rosemary Mitchell the recompositions of Strutt represent "rather surreal collages with an uncertain system of chronology" (Mitchell 64). Figures taken from different manuscripts are combined in the same frame; images drawn from widely separated historical periods appear in the same plate and under the same rubric; and so on. To give a a brief example, Plate One in <title level="m">Sports and Pastimes</title> consists of three images illustrative of "Hunting." The letterpress identifies these as taken from manuscripts produced five hundred years apart: the middle image of a Saxon chieftain hunting wild boar comes from a 9<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>-century manuscript (Cottonian collection); the upper image showing the mode of attacking a boar is from an early 14<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>-century manuscript (owned by Francis Douce); and the lower image of "unearthing" a fox comes from another early 14<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>-century manuscript (in the Royal collection) (<title level="m">Sports and Pastimes</title> 4-5). Where the textual plane specifies and separates, then, the visual plane elides and conjoins. Together they express the doubled logic of the piece activated by genres like the illustrated antiquarian history. Breaking up and moving around bits of the past, this form of historical publication rendered the past at once divisible (as something that could be "placed") and portable (malleable and mobile). </p>
<p>	Richard Maxwell has noted that the techniques of antiquarian history in general constitute a proto-sociology in that they tend to survey social systems section by section and to construct  "inclusive systems of classification" (Maxwell 60). Strutt's works clearly fit this model. Elaborately taxonomic, they continually divide, sub-divide, and sub-sub-divide analytic categories, parsing them into ever smaller units. At the same time, however, they lack the interest in the "interdependence among parts of a given whole" that Maxwell defines as the antiquary's "fundamental interest" (Maxwell 60). Instead Strutt's histories exploit the peculiar status of the piece as a detached and—more importantly—detachable single unit. Pieces signal the divisibility of a category, as in "a piece of music," and their specificity lies in the fact that they are at once separated from a whole and yet complete in themselves. Hence a piece possesses a certain autonomy. We can speak of "a broken piece" without redundancy, for example, and this possibility separates the piece from the more familiar "fragment" of Romantic studies to which antiquarianism itself has often been assimilated. Christopher Scalia, for example, aligns "the antiquary's faith in the power of historical remnants" with "the distinctly Romantic aesthetic of the fragment" (Scalia 10). Certainly, antiquarianism as a whole, including illustrated antiquarian histories, was committed to the potency of historical fragments, but to understand the "operation" of these histories (to invoke Certeau's term) in the transformation of historical fragments into print publications, we need to distinguish (if not absolutely) the fragment from the piece. A "piece of writing," after all, does not mean the same things as a "fragment" of writing: the one pertains to the rationality of division, the other to the obscurity of separation.  </p>
<p>	Fragments in both the literary-philosophical sense associated with "high" Romanticism and the more mundane (material) historical sense imply absence: something lost, broken, beyond, or not yet in being. This is not to confound the two modalities—the historical fragment is a function of historical processes, the other of mental ones—but they cohere insofar as both designate the limits of what can be known or thought. The piece, by contrast, imposes a limit. Lacou-Labarthe and Nancy's distinction between the fragment and the piece in <title level="m">The Literary Absolute</title> (while directed specifically to the literary-philosophical fragment) provides a useful gloss. The fragment, they explain, is not simply "a pure piece," nor can it be equated with condensed forms like the maxim because such forms make a claim to completeness whereas the fragment involves "an essential incompletion" (Lacou-Labarthe and Nancy 42). Completeness is thus the sign of the piece. It is not a broken bit but a singular entity, even though but a portion of a larger whole; hence it invokes presence rather than absence, clarity not obscurity. "Fragments or shadowings of true history," Walter Scott writes in <title level="a">Essay on Romance,</title> "may yet remain hidden under the mass of accumulated fable," and such "shadowings" (elusive and unpredictable) speak to the unknowability of the past (180). Strutt himself was acutely aware that he was working in a field where little could be positively known. The Anglo-Saxons, he wryly remarks, were "a people, whose existence is all we can be certain of" (<title level="m">Compleat View</title> 1). But in working on the traces (visual and verbal) they did leave in their texts, he produced the pieces that set out for readers what could be known: a limited completeness.  </p>
<p>	For Strutt the production of such pieces depended on unhinging the past from the frames within which it understood itself. Like most antiquaries interested in popular antiquities at this time (if not antiquaries in general) he adhered to the standard stadial model inherited from Enlightenment historiography, distancing himself from the values and beliefs of earlier ages, notably but not only the medieval period. The Middle Ages he considered largely barbaric and superstitious; the customs, sports and pastimes that he made his special subject were typically "absurd and childish" (<title level="m">Sports and Pastimes</title> xxii).  Moreover, he stresses, these absurdities often lingered on into what we now call the Early Modern era, as in the "extravagant" pageants and shows popular in the sixteenth century to which he devotes a substantial section of his historical survey. "For want of more rational entertainment," he explains, high and low alike enjoyed "motley displays of pomp and absurdity" (<title level="m">Sports and Pastimes</title> xxix). To exemplify, he focuses in on a specific pageant marking the setting of the midsummer watch in Chester, a ritual rooted in medieval custom and revived in the mid-sixteenth century. Suspending his general survey, Strutt presents the fortunes of this pageant through and as an archival document, a literal piece of the past: 
            <quote>
         I have now before me an ordinance for the mayor, aldermen, and common councilmen
         of the city of Chester, to provide yearly . . . on the eve of the festival of Saint John the
         Baptist, a pageant, which is expressly said to be 'according to ancient custome,'
         consisting of four giants, one unicorn, one dromedary, one luce, one camel, one ass,
         six hobby-horses, and sixteen naked boys. (<title level="m">Sports and Pastimes</title> xxvi)
               </quote>

This document stems from 1564, and Strutt goes on to report that under the Commonwealth the spectacle was discontinued, and the constructed items (giants, unicorn, etc.) were destroyed. At the Restoration, however, the practice was revived, and this meant the city had to make new molds, find materials, and (most of all) pay for them. Strutt then lays before the reader "without any farther apology" the "curious" computation of charges for the renewed pageant in 1661, starting with the cost of the four great giants, "all to be made new, as neere as may be lyke as they were before, at five pounds a giant the least that can be, and four men to carry them at two shillings and six pence each" (<title level="m">Sports and Pastimes</title> xxvii). </p>
<p>	He presents the list of charges without comment, although he cannot stop himself from interrupting to note "a very ridiculous entry" for arsenic to be put into the paste used to construct the giants in order "to save the giants from being eaten by the rats, one shilling and fourpence" (<title level="m">Sports and Pastimes</title> xxvii). What makes all this ridiculous (but clearly entertaining) is incongruity, a disjunction both at the level of discourse (the language of giants mingling with that of bureaucratic calculation) and at the level of historical existence (modern Chester reviving obsolete medieval ritual). Strutt's account of sixteenth and seventeenth-century pageants in general is structured by motifs of incoherence and artifice that define them as regressive movements. His ultimate target can be seen as the idea of tradition and the temporality of historical continuity that such spectacles sought to uphold. Suggestively, insofar as Strutt does identify historical continuities in popular life, these tend to be negative (like gambling). Strutt, that is, writes from across a divide marked by modernity's forward movement, and it is precisely the sense of historical distance that allows him to extract the case of the Chester pageant (its origins, its revivals) from a no longer meaningful ideological-historical matrix in order to move it into the foreground of his text as a piece-in-itself. The past is moved into the present precisely through/as difference.</p>
<p>	We can place in instructive contrast to these tactics those of literary antiquaries. Devoted to transmitting popular literary antiquities, they too generally disavowed the ideological frames within which their archaic materials took shape, and (like Strutt) they were equally dismissive of their aesthetic value. However, their disavowals, Ann Rowland argues in an important study, operated in effect as tactics of rescue, a canny transfer of value from content to form, which located the past in different relationship to the present. Rowland's argument is worth laying out in some detail. The key move, she points out, was an "antiquarian formalism" that elided the often scandalous, sensational, and otherwise suspect content of literary antiquities to instead privilege "form as a vehicle of cultural and national continuity" (Rowland 21). This move was premised on the analogy between the collective stages of history and the stages of the individual life promulgated in Enlightenment thought: literary antiquaries overlaid the "primitive" stages of society and the stage of childhood, casting both as primarily oral orientations in the world, especially responsive to the aural and kinetic pleasures of form (repetition, rhythm, and so on). The rhymes and games of childhood in the present were thus understood as a link back to the ancient origins of national culture, and the child became the bearer of a "formal memory," which connected current generations to the earliest generations. If enlightened adults could no longer tap into this "formal memory" in quite the same way, they could access it indirectly through memories of childhood. This helps to explain the recurring motif of  "remembered from childhood" in the prefaces of literary antiquarian texts to which Rowland draws special attention and which lend to the scholarly collections "the aura of personal memory" (Rowland 167). The  literary antiquary's authority and authenticity hence rested on the interplay of "childhood attachment" and "adult scholarly practice" through which he modeled a modern approach to texts of the past, a reading at once affective and yet properly critical (Rowland 167). </p>
<p>	The scenario described by Rowland sustains the claim for a continuous national culture and defines the past as at once an interiorized and externalized object in relation to the modern subject. Even so archival a creature as Joseph Ritson, fierce defender of the integrity of ancient texts, attaches the "originals" of the poems he includes in <title level="m">Pieces of Ancient Popular Poetry</title> (1791) to personal memory: "the pleasing recollection of that happyest period of which most of them were the familiar acquaintance" (Ritson xii-xiii). Moreover, he projects (or at least wishes for) readers who will tap into the poems he has collected, able to shake off "the artificial refinements of modern taste" and participate in "humble effusions of "unpolished nature, and the simplicity of old times" (Ritson xiii-xiv). By contrast to this kind of appeal, the rare moments when Strutt introduces a personal note, as in the reference to the document "I have now before me" in the Chester passage, route personal connection through an impersonal archival memory rather than (as in Ritson) a personal experiential memory. Not memory but portability is the keynote. The impersonal antiquarian piece, that is, rendered the past not simply alien but alienable, something that could be moved about. Where the abstraction carried out by the "antiquarian formalism" of literary collections absorbed the past into the present through a quasi-anthropological notion of an enduring deep memory, the abstraction characteristic of illustrated histories of social and everyday life unrooted the past to render it modular, allowing it to become a platform for experiment, imitation, and performance in the present. Strutt, we recall, directed his research into costume and customs not only to the cognitive realm of knowledge but also to the performative realm of representation (e.g., painters, actors), and his <title level="m">Dress and Habits</title> rapidly became a handbook for theatrical producers and costume designers. The relocation of the past for the present effected by both modes of antiquarian publication underwrote large swatches of intellectual and cultural innovation in the Romantic period, but they represent distinct if often overlapping trajectories within the strategy against oblivion that Assmann identifies as the work of culture. And they do so, I want to suggest, because they proffered very different answers to the question posed by Henri Bergson (in a rather different context): "but the past, once achieved, if it is to be retained, where is it?" (Bergson 191). </p>

<p rend="noCount">In their Introduction to <title level="m">Romantic Antiquarianism</title>, Noah Heringman and Crystal B. Lake survey the history of antiquarianism and theorize its practices, concluding with an overview of the seven essays in this volume.  Paying particular attention to antiquarianism in popular culture, Heringman and Lake seek to redress the critical tendency to isolate antiquarianism as an amateurish fad, an eccentric pastime of interest to only a few specialists, or a discourse concerned primarily with documents and texts.  Instead, Heringman and Lake position antiquarianism as an embodied practice in which ancient objects themselves exerted a powerful influence on the process and products of knowledge work.  Increasingly specialized study of periods and types of objects shaped the networks that linked antiquaries, engravers, and publishers with a public eager to experience in detail the customs and manners or material culture of the past.  The introduction places a special emphasis on remediation as a rubric for understanding how antiquarian practices informed the circulation of ancient and medieval objects and their representations in the Romantic period.</p>

<p>To enthusiastic antiquaries and their publics in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, an object of antiquity presented itself as the romantic object par excellence: democratic, evocative, historically rooted yet ever present, at once the product and the producer of creative imagination.  Romantic antiquarianism levels distinctions between the learned and popular reception of ancient objects and texts, between historical narrative and empirical research, form and content, discourse and material culture.  The Romantic refusal to distinguish between discourse and material culture, though lamented by modern histories of antiquarianism, reflects the transformation of antiquarian practice by artists, popularizers, novelists, and poets in the Romantic period.  Readers, collectors, tourists, and exhibition-goers across Europe became more interested in consuming antiquities than in mocking antiquaries.  This volume, accordingly, sets out to challenge both the comic stereotype of the antiquary, powerfully reinforced by no less an antiquary than Sir Walter Scott, and the historiography that has insisted on separating the literary and material practices of antiquarianism. The embodied practice of Romantic antiquarianism, as the following essays show, promoted a convergence of antiquarian scholarship and imaginative empathy by way of remediation: popular antiquaries such as Robert Wood, Thomas Pennant, Josiah Wedgwood, Joseph Strutt, John Britton, and John Martin collected, displayed, illustrated, and reconstructed antiquities antiquities ranging from Pompeian artifacts to Anglo-Saxon costume to the Portland Vase, transcending the early modern distinction between history and antiquities. These learned spectacles preceded and in some ways anticipated the modern distinction between the historical disciplines and the popular culture of heritage.</p>
<p>It is in large part the popularity of antiquarianism that distinguishes the Romantic from the Enlightenment project of making sense of history's lost and found objects.  The Society of Antiquaries (London), though far from inclusive in its composition in this period, reflects the larger trend: from nearly three hundred members in 1770, the rolls increased to nearly eight hundred by 1820 (Pearce 147). At the same time, artifacts were no longer confined to private cabinets of curiosity.  The British Museum opened its doors to the public in 1757, yet its strict rules for admission meant that many other repositories of antiquities had a claim on the money and attention of the curious.  Richard Altick reports that a tourist from Birmingham complained about the way he was "hackneyed through the rooms with violence" and "came away completely disappointed" from the museum in 1784 (qtd. in Altick 27). Don Saltero's—a coffeehouse where over 1,000 objects ranging from old coins to old books to specimens of antique fashion, jewelry, and armor were on display by 1790—proved both more instructive and entertaining. At Don Saltero's, the man from Birmingham reported that he had at least been "furnished ... with a book, explaining every article in the collection," and that he had the leisure to "take [his] own time, and entertain [himself]."  Don Saltero's was far from being the only alternative to the British Museum. The Tower of London proved to be a popular tourist attraction for viewing regal and military antiquities (and the last of the urban "wonders" catalogued in the "fond imagination" of Wordsworth's boyhood) (Wordsworth, <title level="m">Prelude</title> 232).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">Wordsworth expands this particular reference from half a line in 1805 (VII.135) to six lines in 1850 (VII.136-41).
            </note> So, too, did Thomas Gwenapp's Gothic Hall. Sir Ashton Lever's Holophusikon featured natural history specimens alongside antiquities. Lever also donated objects to Dr. Greene's museum at Lichfield, and artifacts from Greene's were later purchased by William Bullock, who likely incorporated them into his Egyptian Hall at Piccadilly.</p>
<p>Antiquities circulated between curators and impresarios and jostled for prominence in auctions and lotteries.  In other words, artifacts and their custodians, along with a host of other social actants, established new configurations of agency at a highly visible nexus between matters of archaeological fact and matters of aesthetic concern—as Bruno Latour might put it.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">For an extended discussion of antiquarianism and emerging disiplines in the context of Actor Network Theory, see Heringman 14-16. See further Latour 71-72 and passim.
         </note> Robert Aguirre, Ralph O'Connor, and Edward Ziter are among the many scholars who (following in Altick's wake) have explored Romantic-era public exhibitions and spectacles in recent years, particularly in the contexts of science and colonialism.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">O'Connor offers a particularly sophisticated account of popularization (10-13) as well as a strong connection between time travel and the geological past that is especially relevant here.</note> Yet none of these accounts fully recognize the antiquarian framework that provided much of the cohesion among these spectacles.  Popular entertainments from Robert Barker's Panorama to Philip James de Loutherbourg's Eidophusikon also illustrate the vogue for sentimental immersion in historical scenes. Although de Loutherbourg remains most well known for his pre-cinematic projections of scenes from Milton or shipwrecks, he cut his teeth by designing spectacular models and scenery for the revival of James Thomson's <title level="m">The Masque of Alfred</title> (1773), based on the antiquary Thomas Bicknell's biography of the Anglo-Saxon monarch. Likewise, de Loutherbourg provided the scenery for the pantomime <title level="m">Omai, or A Trip Round the World</title> in 1785, which was celebrated for its "exact representations" of the artifacts brought back from the Pacific by the antiquary-naturalist Joseph Banks.  Thus situated, this volume recovers numerous antiquarian spaces, ranging from domestic interiors to panoramic landscapes; it recovers not only antiquarianism's intricate discourses, but also its objects and their agencies.</p>
<p>The profusion of antiquities shows that Don Saltero was just one of many new tastemakers who claimed the right to decide what counts as an ancient artifact. Our emphasis on remediation seeks to account for the power of some old things to demand new recognition as antiquities, as well as the power of representations to transform or displace the things themselves.  That is to say, antiquaries and their publics responded to agential qualities in objects, much as Wordsworth did in his account of "the life of things," or Keats in describing the feeling of dislocation caused by "these wonders" from the Parthenon.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">
<title level="a">Tintern Abbey</title> 50 (Wordsworth and Coleridge 114); <title level="a">On Seeing the Elgin Marbles</title> 11 (Keats 58). </note> For example, the ruins of Palmyra, though previously known as remains of an obscure Roman outpost, were newly infused with classic grandeur by Robert Wood's <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title>, as Jonathan Sachs argues in his contribution to this volume.  Similarly, Thora Brylowe's essay shows how an ancient object such as the Portland Vase could be not only repurposed, but also recycled as the prototype for a Wedgewood commodity and even displaced as the site of cultural prestige.  In both cases, we see the appropriation of ancient objects—predating European national cultures—for a British public by way of a transnational antiquarian traffic.  Rosemary Hill's essay on antiquarian interior design recovers another set of British and French tactics for domesticating antiquities, while Martin Myrone's contribution explores the suggestive juxtaposition of a native ancient site (Avebury) with a classical one (Pompeii) in the painterly <foreign>oeuvre</foreign> of John Martin.  Ina Ferris's essay on medieval costume and Timothy Campbell's on the guillotine both uncover new dimensions of the antiquarian recycling and repurposing of image and text.  Sam Smiles's concluding essay points out the mid-nineteenth-century moment in which the strategic relationship between ancient objects and antiquarian illustration was explicitly theorized.  In short, the essays in this volume integrate art history, book history, and literary scholarship in an effort to do adequate justice to these complex dynamics of images, texts, artifacts, and time. </p>
<p>Much recent work on popular antiquarianism has focused on recovering the verbal artifacts and print culture associated with this cluster of predisciplines and its expanding subject matter.  Stephen Bending has documented the proliferation of increasingly affordable antiquarian books, tellingly promoted by the antiquary Francis Grose in his declaration that  "every man is naturally an antiquarian" (qtd. in Bending 100).  Grose, often remembered for commissioning Robert Burns's <title level="a">Tam O'Shanter</title> for his <title level="m">Antiquities of Scotland</title> (1791-1797), also appears as a central figure in Marilyn Butler's influential essay, <title level="a">Antiquarianism (Popular).</title>  Butler begins her discussion of popular antiquarianism with the "vernacular languages" of the British Isles and focuses primarily on textual and archival work by Joseph Ritson, John Brand, and other popular antiquaries.  Traditionally associated with "fictions and fakes" dating back to Macpherson and Chatterton, Romantic antiquarianism is still understood by literary scholars primarily in terms of textual transmission. Recent studies by Katie Trumpener, Margaret Russett (quoted here), Maureen McLane, and others have recovered the richness and complexity of literary practices formerly dismissed as imitation, forgery, or "improvement" of traditional material; one recent collection, <title level="m">Romanticism and Popular Culture</title> (Connell and Leask), explores the political ramifications of these revivals of popular tradition.</p>
<p>Popular antiquities, however, extended well beyond the literary and oral tradition to social customs and material culture, as Butler herself notes and as many of the essays in this volume demonstrate more fully.  Grose, for example, was not only a popularizer with his eye on the print market, but also a connoisseur and a collector with deep investments in the antiquities he surveyed and depicted in his works.  Recent critical emphasis on texts and literary antiquarianism may, in fact, have contributed indirectly to the marginal status of the antiquarian object in some accounts of Romanticism.  In their efforts to reclaim the textual work of antiquarianism, critics have allowed antiquarianism's material cultures to languish in the "<foreign>mare magnum</foreign> of miscellaneous trumpery" and popular spectacle (Scott 32).  This paradox becomes clear by contrast to archaeological and art historical discussions, in which Romantic antiquarianism often carries a different set of connotations. Stuart Piggott, who did so much to reclaim antiquarianism as proto-archaeology, rejected its Romantic phase because, in his view, the Baconian approach to material culture established by earlier antiquaries became corrupted in this era of  "Gothick romance . . . and mystical Druidry"  (120).  Some sense of this incongruity lingers in Martin Myrone's 2007 account of the "fissure" between "antiquarian exactitude" and "aesthetic pleasure"  (113). </p>
<p>The double bind of "Romantic antiquarianism" is part of a much longer history of questioning antiquarianism's principles and practices; antiquarianism has been under regular satirical scrutiny since the sixteenth century.  According to Joseph Levine, the "interest in antiquities advanced by slow degrees in England in the sixteenth century," challenging longstanding assumptions about the relationship between class and connoisseurship (116). British antiquities in particular appeared initially as a poor substitute for the classical legacy valorized by the grammar school curriculum and the Grand Tour. British coins, inscriptions, sepulchers, and weapons—especially those left to languish undiscovered by gentlemen departing on the Grand Tour—promised to provide new opportunities for establishing authority over taste and history. As Levine notes, however, "the very success of the antiquary provoked criticism and concern, especially perhaps in those who felt the danger of the new interests to the polite attainments of the gentleman" (117).  Although the concerns persisted, a vast array of antiquarian pursuits was on offer by the early nineteenth century. These ranged from polite to impolite, from classical and cosmopolitan to domestic and nativist, and from learned to popular, driven by artifacts as much as texts. </p>
<p>As early as 1628, the antiquary was derided by John Earle as "one that hath that unnaturall disease" for "old things" (qtd. in Levine 117).  This image of the antiquary as an eccentric who loved old things just because they were old things persisted through the eighteenth and into the nineteenth century, finding its apotheosis in Nietzsche's obtuse curator of the "the household utensils of our ancestors" (20).  Where historians like David Hume and Edward Gibbon charted grand narratives of nations and empires, antiquaries like John Woodward and Samuel Pegge were thought to have buried themselves in the most pedantic depths of the archive—not only in documents, but also in images and above all in artifacts. Not quite a connoisseur, then, and not quite a historian, the antiquary lingered somewhere in between, acquiring, classifying, and explicating "old things." </p>
<p>In spite of these obstinate questionings of "unscientific" antiquarianism, recent scholarship has done much to recover its intellectual contributions. This volume seeks both to extend this map of antiquarian variety and vitality and to historicize the negative stereotype.  It is important to recognize that Ossian and the new national antiquities influenced not just literary taste but also antiquarian scholarship, as suggested by the elaborate defense of Chatterton's Rowley poems mounted by Jeremiah Milles, President of the Society of Antiquaries, in 1782. But more archaeologically-minded antiquaries such as Richard Gough reacted against literary antiquarianism as well as against the aesthetic enthusiasm associated with the cult of Ossian.  The empirical study of antiquities developed in tandem with natural history, under the aegis of naturalist-antiquaries including Sir William Hamilton, Sir Joseph Banks, and their legions of knowledge workers, to open new spaces of classical and nonclassical antiquity. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the eighteenth-century pursuit of natural history and antiquities remained associated with pseudoscience and Ossianic mythmaking, an increasingly inaccurate association reinforced by Scott in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>.  Scott, himself an antiquary who made his career as a collector and fabricator of Scottish national antiquities, looked back in this 1816 novel on antiquarian practice in the 1790s.  In Jonathan Oldbuck, the novel's eponymous scholarly amateur, Scott created a lasting popular image of the antiquary that obscured—as Rosemary Sweet has shown—the variety and the influence of antiquarian practice, as well as the empirical rigor of many of its forms. (The essays by Campbell and Hill in this volume shed new light on Oldbuck as well.)  In an essay contrasting Oldbuck with Gough, Sweet focuses on the study of postclassical British antiquities, certainly a more dominant pursuit by the 1790s than Oldbuck's obsession with Roman Britain.  In her <title level="m">Antiquaries</title>, she presents a broader view of the collaborative antiquarian networks, including correspondence networks, which are present in the novel, and many others, which are not: popularizing enterprises, provincial societies, and research networks that increasingly enabled the participation of middle-class men and, sometimes, women.
                           <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">In the 2001 essay, Sweet presented the career of Gough as a corrective to Scott's fictional antiquary, and her subsequent <title level="m">Antiquaries</title> provided the first substantial historical study of British antiquarianism in 50 years.  <title level="m">Antiquaries</title> ably surveys, among other relevant topics, antiquarian correspondence networks (60-69), popularization (309-44), and women antiquaries (69-79). The issue of women antiquaries is especially salient in light of Scott's novel's half-ironic misogyny. On women antiquaries, see further Catalani and Pearce, <title level="a">Particular Thanks.</title>
</note>
</p>
<p>The satirical tradition behind Scott's character is a major legacy that continued to inform the practice and public perception of antiquarianism well into the nineteenth century.  As Sweet points out in her contrast between the real and the fictional antiquary, Oldbuck is based on a "stock caricature" that can be traced back into the sixteenth century—to Earle's "unnaturall disease" and beyond. The satirical tradition, however, sheds light on the wider field of knowledge work because it captures the class connotations attaching to connoisseurship, as exemplified in Thomas Shadwell's farce <title level="m">The Virtuoso</title> (1676) and in long-running conflicts over the terms "virtuoso" and "connoisseur" themselves, terms increasingly reclaimed and put to new social uses in the Romantic period (Hamblyn 183-84).  </p>
<p>Scott's narrative, though indebted to the satirical tradition, nevertheless offers a kind of thick description of Romantic antiquarian practice by way of Oldbuck as well as a second antiquarian figure, the swindler Herman Dousterswivel. The main thing lacking in Scott's portrayal is the institutional context in which both natural history and antiquarianism were practiced in the late eighteenth century.  Rudolf Erich Raspe, for example, long considered the real-life counterpart for Dousterswivel, was involved with both the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and Daines Barrington (perhaps a better analogue for Oldbuck than Gough is) was a pillar of both societies.  In fact, one-third of the fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London in the late eighteenth century were also fellows of the Royal Society, including Thomas Pennant and Owen Manning, who are featured in the essays by Campbell and Hill (respectively) in this volume.  These institutions did not replace wealthy amateurism and patronage but decisively shaped the forms that they took, creating opportunities for independent knowledge work by gradually transforming the humanist model of patronage and facilitating access to print. </p>
<p>It may be in part Scott's own professional bias—coupled with his habitual mock-humility concerning antiquarian pursuits, including his own involvement with the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland—that leads him to occlude these institutional aspects of the antiquarian scene, and in any case the absence of this context serves the novel's narrative of class conflict. Antiquarianism here looks frivolous next to the serious business of earning money, and by dabbling with an avocation formerly associated with aristocratic virtuosi, Scott's antiquary figures the legitimacy of a newly ascendant class. Oldbuck, descended from a family of printers, is a better antiquary than the proud, aristocratic Wardour, and morally sounder than the Catholic baron Glenallan, but like them he is fiercely provincial, leaving Edinburgh behind with a curse at the beginning of the novel. Scott might nonetheless have made him a corresponding member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, if not the London society, a historically likely scenario for the 1790s. <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn6" n="6">Gough's large network of provincial correspondents, such as Samuel Pegge, was crucial to his transformation of the Society of Antiquaries along archaeological lines.  Dousterswivel's employer, Sir Arthur Wardour, is at best a patron of science, while his rival Oldbuck conducts his own knowledge work, after fashion, by employing native informants such as the Mucklebackits. Yet in spite of his occasional fieldwork, Oldbuck remains tethered to the legacy of mythmaking and pseudoscience because of his interests in projects such as the <title level="m">Caledoniad</title> and the Ossian debate.
                        </note> The success of Scott's whole literary brand depended on this somewhat disingenuous characterization of the antiquary, as indicated by the pervasive mock antiquarian tone in the paratexts of his novels, a tone that surfaces in both versions of <title level="m">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</title> (1802, 1830) as well.  Scott's works succeeded by lubricating the "repulsive dryness of mere antiquity," as "Laurence Templeton" calls it in the Dedicatory Epistle to <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>. ("Templeton" is only one of the antiquarian personae used by Scott; here "Templeton" apologizes somewhat ambivalently to "Jonas Dryasdust," another of Scott's personae.)<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7">On Scott and antiquarianism, see, among others, Ferris, <title level="m">Gender and Literary Authority in the <emph>Waverley</emph> Novels</title>.  The Dedicatory Epistle to <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title> stands as perhaps Scott's own most trenchant analysis of the problem or opportunity of popular antiquarianism.</note>
</p>
<p>Despite his frivolity, Oldbuck at times displays antiquarian skills in the field in incidents that Scott supports with real citations from antiquarian authors such as Thomas Percy and John Brand.  Wardour lacks these skills, but in fact the institutional setting of the learned society provided a venue in which aristocratic connoisseurs, too, learned to transcend the limitations of an elite education to develop empirical and collaborative methods.  According to Susan Pearce, "two of the most striking things about this period [1770-1820] at the Society [of Antiquaries] are how the members managed to set the agenda for much future work, and how they succeeded in developing the fundamental methods through which information could be offered for evaluation" (153).  In particular, "the idea of the corpus of a particular group of archaeological objects began to appear," and five of the research areas outlined at that time "are still returned to again and again." These innovations required ambition not only among knowledge workers but also on the part of their university-educated patrons, who may have seen natural history and antiquities as shadow professions standing in for the career in divinity, law, or medicine that their financial independence made unnecessary.  Finally, as Hill notes in her essay in this volume, the Society of Antiquaries ushered in an era of public antiquarianism through such high-profile debates as the <foreign>quérelle de Wyatt</foreign> concerning historically unsound alterations in Salisbury Cathedral.</p>
<p>The metropolitan learned societies favored the creation of monumental learned works on antiquities, such as Robert Wood's <title level="m">Ruins of Palmyra</title> (see Sachs, this volume) and Hamilton and d'Hancarville's <title level="m">Collection of Etruscan, Greek, and Roman Antiquities</title> (see Brylowe, this volume). These privately funded works existed in dialogue with the learned journals and other publication series sponsored by the societies themselves.  They were expensive projects that employed laborers, draftsmen, engravers, specialized printers, and other contributors, but they flourished in a literary marketplace that also produced many cheaper publications, including popularizing and ancillary works.  More independent workers, such as Joseph Strutt (see Ferris, this volume) and John Britton (see Myrone, this volume) used this literary marketplace to produce their own publications, and often the same publishers produced both kinds of works.  Publications more closely associated with the Society of Antiquaries, including the long-running scholarly serials <title level="j">Vetusta Monumenta</title> (from 1747) and <title level="j">Archaeologia</title> (from 1771) used the same printers, engravers, and editorial procedures, often drawing on the same research networks, while others gave more authority to self-taught antiquaries and illustrators such as Strutt and George Hanlon (see Smiles, this volume).</p>
<p>The Romantic publicity surrounding antiquities produced an unprecedented democracy of the antiquarian object, for the liminal spaces between the connoisseur and the historian teemed with intellectual, representational, and commercial possibilities. Newly available for spectacular consumption, antiquities found themselves delicately poised between sentiment and scholarship.  Ancient artifacts offered audiences the opportunity to fashion excursions around and in the material and conceptual gaps in the historical record evoked by antiquities. These excursions could take on diverse forms and meanings. As Jacques Rancière writes in the context of public performances and museums, "there are only ever individuals plotting their own paths in the forest of things, acts and signs that confront or surround them. The collective power shared by spectators does not stem from the fact that they are members of a collective body or from some specific form of interactivity. It is the power each of them has to translate what she perceives in her own way" (17). Rancière's "equality of intelligence" would be too utopian a reading of the unruly spectacle and mythmaking traditionally associated with antiquarianism.  At the same time, his formulation of the agency that can inhere in collective, material experiences aptly expresses the half-suppressed modernity of Romantic antiquarianism.</p>
<p>As the essays in this volume suggest, spectacle and myth-making are only half the story. In various ways, all the essays restore lost connections between artifacts,  texts, and antiquaries, and all attend particularly to the visual remediations of antiquity.  Through the efforts of popular antiquaries (in several senses of this capacious term) such as Hanlon, Strutt, Pennant, the Sobieski Stuarts, Wedgwood, Wood, Britton, and Martin, and in spite of cultural antipathy toward the figure of the antiquary—or even partly because of it, since it established the antiquary, famous for working in eccentric isolation, in the public sphere—antiquarianism captured the public imagination while it also continued to develop as a field of study. In fact, one of the salient features of Romantic antiquarianism is the unique way in which it advanced Enlightenment ideals of scientific history while incorporating more fully the aesthetics of the sublime and of sentimental identification, producing  new forms of historical empathy.  Precisely in its refusal to distinguish between text and material culture, Romantic antiquarianism functions as a historiographical mode that exists simultaneously as science and art, history and literature.  It offers multiple avenues for exploring Romantic subjectivities in their relation to material culture. Blake insists that "Mental things alone are real"; antiquarianism begs to differ, insisting that ancient objects demand recognition, that they are perfectly commensurate as scientific specimens and as quasi-agential aesthetic subjects.</p>
<p>Surely no other objects in Romantic culture hover quite as perfectly between the "invention of history" and the "end of history," in W.J.T. Mitchell's phrasing, as the artifacts of Romantic antiquarianism (173). For Mitchell, two new concepts emerged at the turn of the nineteenth century: the fossil and the totem. These correlate to an emerging distinction between the natural and the cultural, as the natural finds its fullest expression in a deep, ecological record (the fossil) and the cultural in manmade, handmade objects (the totem). For Mitchell, the fossil points to a "system of natural signs;" the totem points to signs of the human (177). These will transform into the disciplinary practices of paleontology and anthropology, respectively. For Mitchell, though, the Romantic era is a brief but poignant moment in which these two things, the fossil and the totem, are not yet fully separate entities, physically or conceptually. Rather, a dialectic exists between the two, as "the desire to secure an intimate communion with nature itself is a form of totemism," and the "inevitable defeat of this desire is named by the fossil" (183). Mitchell concludes, then, that Romanticism is defined by its constant return to the notion that "just when we think that things are safely dead, fossilized, petrified, or confined to the past, they rise from their graves of natural extinction and cultural obsolescence" (183). Thus, the "life of things" that Wordsworth sees into is also configured as a death, just as the "structure of feeling" that would define the Modern against the Romantic (and vice versa) would entail both the invention and the end of history.</p>
<p>When examined from a cultural-historical perspective, Mitchell's high road between the fossil and the totem may be seen to run through a landscape of antiquarian artifacts. Wordsworth, after all, sees into the life and death of things at Tintern Abbey, a historical site of longstanding interest to antiquaries. And Blake began as an apprentice to the antiquarian engraver, James Basire.  In the Romantic period, antiquarian artifacts refused to fit neatly into distinctions between material culture and discourse, past and present, nature and culture.  An object of antiquity elicits imaginative speculations that expose the gaps between objects and knowledge, even as they seek to close them. To say that a miniature guillotine, or a ceramic imitation of the Portland Vase, or the ruins of Palmyra, or an engraving "faithfully copied" from medieval decorations, is "the Romantic object par excellence," is to collapse distinctions that structure our understanding of such objects today.  Reopening the field from which these distinctions emerged permits us to recognize antiquarianism's "miscellaneous trumpery" as a living stream of history, a stream newly open to intellectual navigation by an eager public, by antiquarian collectors and illustrators, and by Romantic writers.  </p>
<p>It is tempting to designate the variety of antiquarian discourses by calling them "antiquarianisms," but the real diversity is to be found among the practitioners and the objects they studied—ancient or new, real or fabricated.  Our singular title, Romantic Antiquarianism, reflects the underlying methodological and epistemological common ground shared by a surprisingly wide range of antiquaries, a common ground we must now struggle to recognize.  As a disciplinary umbrella term, antiquarianism accommodated connoisseurs, artisans, scholars, tourists, and hack writers in their pursuit of the most disparate objects.  It is not enough merely to insist, with Bruno Latour, that these "objects too have agency" (63-86). Jane Bennett and other theorists associated with the new materialism have presented a complex array of agential and quasi-agential properties in matter that could be usefully tested against the objects of antiquarian study—especially given its original proximity to natural history. <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">In addition to Bennett's <title level="m">Vital Materialism</title>, see Coole and Frost, and, in a more literary vein, Harman and Calè.</note>  (This is not to suggest that the contributors to this volume define their individual projects in this way, though the capacities of artifacts are certainly tested in some of the essays, Brylowe's and Hill's in particular.)  Latour himself addresses some of the problematic gradations of agency that might be attributed to objects, establishing a more subtle dynamic of "durablity," "extension," and "force": "there might exist many metaphysical shades between [actants'] full causality and [their] sheer inexistence" (72).
               <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" n="9">Latour continues in a poetical vein: "As if some damning curse had been cast onto things, they remain asleep like the servants of some enchanted castle.  Yet as soon as they are freed from the spell, they start shuddering, stretching, and muttering.  They begin to swarm in all directions, shaking the other human actors, waking them out of their dogmatic sleep" (73).   For Bennett's response to Latour, see Bennett viii-ix and 94-104.
               </note> To the extent that antiquities are nonhuman "participants" in social networks (7), Latour's paradigm helps to establish the vital middle ground between artifacts and antiquaries that the following essays make visible.  These theoretical considerations—intended, as in any introduction, to frame the larger issue and not to pre-empt the chapters to follow—account for some of the contemporary resonance of Romantic antiquarianism and suggest that it is precisely the fetishism with which the antiquaries were charged, their "unhealthy" fascination with objects, that makes them contemporary. </p>
<p>In <title level="a">Extravagant Topography and Sublime Antiquarianism: John Martin, John Britton, Avebury and Pompeii,</title> Martin Myrone examines two works produced by John Martin (a drawing of Avebury and <title level="m">The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</title>, a large oil painting completed in 1822), in order to refocus the antiquarian sublime and invite us to reconsider the disciplinary borders between history and art. Fuseli famously suggested that the kinds of topographical images that appealed to "the antiquary or the traveller" disappointed the artist (Fuseli, qtd. in Myrone 1). If this would seemingly sound the death knell of antiquarianism as it ceded primacy of place to either the archaeology of the nineteenth century or a more august history of art, Myrone finds otherwise. For Martin, who collaborated with the antiquary John Britton, antiquarian ways of seeing proved particularly aesthetically and commercially fruitful. Specifically, Myrone argues that Martin's drawing of Avebury, which was engraved for Britton's <title level="m">The Beauties of Wiltshire</title>, operates as a "predisciplinary" work of art. Martin's drawing is at once an aesthetic production and an argument that correlates with Britton's antiquarian finding that Avebury was a sepulchral rather than a sacrificial site in ancient Britain. Additionally, Martin's reputation as a painter brought an element of the sublime to hover around the image, enhancing both its popular and aesthetic appeal. This process is mirrored in reverse in Martin's much larger and much more famous <title level="m">The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum.</title> Martin's careful readings and contextualizations of these images make it clear that Romantic antiquarianism worked simultaneously as legitimate history and as aesthetics, deftly mobilizing the sublime in order to navigate a shifting economy of scholarly and artistic labor and consumption. </p>
<p>Our second essay, Jonathan Sachs's <title level="a">Poetical Geography: The Place of the Antiquarian and the Situatedness of Literature,</title> traces an earlier stage of the rediscovery of ancient sites.  The antiquary Robert Wood, inspired by Homer, set out on a tour of Mediterranean sites in 1749, at the end of a decade which had seen the first publication on Avebury (by William Stukeley in 1743) and the first glimmering of the rediscovery of Pompeii (1748).  Yet as Sachs points out, when Wood published the first fruit of his travels, <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> (1753), he chose to focus on a less ancient and better-preserved provincial outpost barely mentioned in classical literature.  Sachs raises important questions relating to the contradiction between Wood's literary project of reading Homer <foreign>in situ</foreign> and his seemingly anachronistic choice of a late Imperial Roman site to illustrate it.  The answers turn out to have broad implications for Romantic literature, because Wood shares a close attention to the place of oral composition and to local stages of society with Percy, Ritson, Scott, and other antiquaries associated with the ballad and Romantic revivals. Examining the large and elegant folio engravings that make up <title level="m">Palmyra</title> and its sequel together with their loosely related text on Homer and other matters, Sachs shows that the engravings of these pristine sites gave readers a better idea than maps or descriptions could give of the experience of discovering antiquity through place.  This approach "makes Palmyra . . . timeless," Sachs argues, insisting that the plate book form was essential to the conception of Wood's theory of oral composition in Homer, fully developed in his later <title level="m">Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer</title> (1775).  Sachs's essay makes a welcome contribution to the project of recapturing classical, British, popular, and other strands of antiquarianism as one organic whole. </p>
<p>Thora Brylowe shows how British copies of classical antiquities like the Portland Vase came to be seen as objects with more cultural capital than the originals on which they were based, in her essay, <title level="a">Antiquity by Design: Remediating the Portland Vase.</title> For Brylowe, the famous vase existed at a nexus of competing discourses and ideologies; it was at once a rare antiquarian artifact, a specimen of high art, an object of appropriation, a fetishized commodity, and a product of changing tastes and economy. Brylowe's essay explores the various remediations of the vase, especially those that coalesce around Josiah Wedgewood. She reveals the vase to be much more than an antique object moved from a private collection to a prominent place as a rarefied specimen in the British Museum. Faithfully imitative descriptions and copies of the vase gave way to "improved" engravings. Soon, versions of the vase were featured in paintings, interior designs, and, importantly, narratives in which the vase indexed both British taste and the rise of the nation's manufacturing industry. For Brylowe, then, antiquarianism functioned as a means not only for understanding the past but for reshaping present tastes and the practices of consumption. </p>
<p>In <title level="a">The Antiquary at Home,</title> Rosemary Hill examines the "personal narratives through objects" that were expressed in Romantic, antiquarian interior design in Britain and in France. Hill begins by considering the idea of the antiquarian interior. Paintings by Bonington and Cooke alongside Scott's influential depiction of Jonathan Oldbuck's rooms in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> insist that the antiquarian interior is a hodgepodge of objects, especially especially armor, papers, and carved wood; their crowded, haphazard arrangement in a dark room bespeaks the antiquary's eccentricity and isolation. Hill finds, however, that the reality of the antiquarian interior did not always match its depiction in either prose or visual materials. The designs used by antiquaries at home ran the gamut from "scepticism to enthusiasm" (Hill 13). John Britton, for example, published a description of his home that emphasized his middle-class credentials and the scientific rigor of his antiquarian pursuits. The Sobieski brothers, however, were more wildly extravagant in their performance of design. For the Sobieski brothers, the settings in which they lived were designed to express their identities, sometimes as characters from a Sir Walter Scott novel, other times as supposed descendants of Charles Edward Stuart (The Young Pretender). Hill shows that there was a wide array of uses to which antiquarian interiors could be put, illustrating the leveling force of popular antiquarianism and forging new links between fiction and history, representation and fact. However, Hill argues, as the nineteenth century went on, the opportunities for using the antiquarian interior in these diverse ways diminished: private collections were reconstituted in museums, and history and archaeology took on formal, disciplinary shape. </p>
<p>Timothy Campbell's <title level="a">Pennant's Guillotine and Scott's Antiquary: The Romantic End of the Present</title> traces the history of an antiquarian "micro-episode," in which the antiquary Thomas Pennant's 1772 description of proto-guillotines—<title level="a">The Maiden</title> and its predecessor <title level="a">The Halifax Gibbet</title>—are resurrected in reports on the French Revolution. Campbell follows a fascinating trail of "recyclings," as Pennant's antiquarian prose finds new purpose in the January 1793 issue of <title level="j">The Bon Ton Magazine, or Microscope of Fashion and Folly</title>. Although the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> regularly featured a brief news report entitled <title level="a">Epitome of the Times,</title> it devoted most of its pages to more overtly licentious and fashionable content. (When it reported on the execution of Louis XVI, it initially focused its attention on his wardrobe.) Yet the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> goes on in its next issue to consider the method of his execution, lifting verbatim from Pennant's description of an entirely different machine made in an entirely different context. For Campbell, this is a paradigmatic moment. Pennant's prose would go on to find further appropriation in Sir Walter Scott's <title level="m">The Heart of Mid-Lothian</title> (1818) and <title level="m">A Legend of Montrose</title>, (1819) as well as in mid-nineteenth-century accounts of the guillotine and the Revolution. Contradictory imperatives lurk underneath all of these appropriations, and, as Campbell suggests, they reveal antiquarianism and its objects to be complex configurations of the present as much as the past.</p>
<p>Ina Ferris suggests that Romantic antiquarianism performed the important cultural work of moving history out of the archive and into the public sphere. Her <title level="a">Unhinging the Past: Joseph Strutt and the Antiquarian Poetics of the Piece</title> argues that the increasing popularity of antiquarian research depended on antiquarianism's new interest in illustration. These illustrations reflected not only an antiquarian interest in the meticulously accurate documentation of domestic objects that revealed a history of everyday practices, but also a continued "documentary bias" that repurposed textual, archival material from sources like the British Museum. Importantly, Ferris finds that a poetic ethos mediates between the antiquaries' illustrations and the archive, an ethos that differs somewhat from the literary antiquarianism that traditionally has concerned scholars of Romanticism. Ferris examines, for example, Strutt's depictions of ancient garments in works like <title level="m">A Complete View of the Dress and Habits of the People of England</title> (1796-99) and <title level="m">Sports and Pastimes of the People of England</title> (1801). These works, she argues, maintained the premise that Strutt's engravings were completely authentic copies of ancient objects. Yet Strutt's grouping and arrangement of the figures allowed for creative interpretation. Such a methodology allowed Strutt to accommodate what Ferris terms a "readerly eye" and to shift the fragmentary nature of Romantic forms of reading that "define[d] the past as at once an interiorized and externalized object in relation to the modern subject."</p>
<p>This volume concludes with Sam Smiles's <title level="a">Discursive Modes in the Antiquarian Image: Irish Antiquities in the 1840s.</title>  Smiles takes up the story of popular illustrated works at a point when wood engraving, in a refined modern form unavailable to Strutt, made it less costly to publish abundantly-illustrated antiquarian works.  The major Irish antiquary and popularizer George Petrie pointed out that this technique made high-quality illustrations much more accessible, leveling one of the distinctions between learned and popular works.  In the preface to his <title level="m">Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</title> (1845), Petrie offers a bold literary analogy between the highly accurate woodcuts in the book and faithful quotations from ancient texts.  Taking Petrie's homage to his illustrator, George Hanlon, as his prompt, Smiles surveys the rapidly expanding field of antiquarian illustration to test Petrie's analogy.  C. S. Peirce's semiotic system of index, icon, and symbol provides Smiles with a typology that facilitates critical analysis and differentiation of the antiquaries' broad claims to depict monuments with "rigid accuracy." In fact, the success of Petrie's and similar nineteenth-century works depended, Smiles shows, on a repertoire of visual documentation ranging from diagram to fragment to view, a repertoire that diverged, by degrees, from accuracy in the direction of art.  In the case of Irish antiquities, the visual appeal of the more picturesque of these images—Petrie's and other protests notwithstanding—helped to secure (in addition to a wide readership) the dignity of Irish history and antiquities in a nationalist context.  </p>
<p>This volume concludes, then, with a precise vocabulary of the "visual language of antiquarianism" under investigation throughout the sequence of essays. If, as Smiles concludes, no antiquarian image attains fully to iconic status, this principle also applies historically to the dynamic succession of differing versions of the past.  From the mid-eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth, the electric diffusion of antiquarianism through popular print and visual media and a wide variety of genres led to an accumulation that was less like dust and more like humus.  The living, luxuriant tangle of Romantic, modern, and postmodern ideas about the past is hardly imaginable without it. </p>

<p rend="noCount">Between 1789 and 1851 antiquarianism blossomed. One of its more notable manifestations was the creation of "Romantic interiors," rooms, houses, even occasionally churches, which expressed the dynamic relationship with the past that characterised the period. In these spaces the personality of the creator was expressed through objects. Past and present were elided and rearranged for imaginative effect. Though not unknown, in the earlier eighteenth century such creations were rare; by the mid-nineteenth century the Romantic interior was an accepted style of interior decoration. This article considers some examples.</p>

                  Introduction
               </head>
<p>One of the most striking characteristics of antiquarianism in the Romantic period was the creation of what have become known as "Romantic interiors", rooms, houses, even castles, whose form and furnishing were calculated to express the owner's personal relationship with history. <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">Clive Wainwright in <title level="m">The Romantic Interior</title>, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1989) put the phrase into circulation and his remains the most extensive study of the precise contents of such rooms.
                  </note> These were not cabinets of curiosities but privately inhabited spaces, and while they were not entirely new in the period from 1789 to 1851, nor unknown afterwards, these were the years that saw their greatest flowering. </p>
<p>The dates I have chosen are inevitably somewhat arbitrary, but they are significant. The storming of the Bastille was not the only event of 1789 to have large consequences for the study of the past. This was also the year of the bitter dispute between antiquaries and the architect James Wyatt over his interventions at Salisbury Cathedral. The row split the Society of Antiquaries, introduced the concept of architectural conservation into the public realm and launched a new phase of antiquarianism. From being generally passive, studying and documenting the artifacts of the past, antiquaries became highly active as conservationists, campaigning journalists, authors, and, occasionally, artists. This dynamic relationship with history encouraged the creation of Romantic interiors. By 1851 the mood had changed. The organizers of the Great Exhibition reflected in their arrangement of material artifacts a more utilitarian and didactic ethos. Public museums, university departments and government bodies were taking over from private individuals in the interpretation of the past.</p>
<p>I have considered examples in England, Scotland, and France, a geographical scope that reflects the fact that antiquaries in these countries were closely aware of each other. Many were friends and several were collaborators. Antiquaries were busy in Wales, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere, but their work was not interconnected to the same extent. Of the dozens, or even hundreds, of examples I might have considered I have concentrated on nine. I chose them to span the range of activities and approaches from the strictly documentary, exemplified by John Lingard (1771-1851), by way of the poet and novelist Walter Scott (1771-1832), on to the remarkable brothers known as the Sobieski Stuarts,<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
                     Their somewhat questionable dates are given below.
                  </note> who took antiquarianism beyond the realm of fiction into fantasy, forgery, and what from this distance of time looks not unlike performance art. </p>
<p>In this period of active, Romantic antiquarianism, engagement with the past often took the form of narrative. It might be written, painted, enacted, or created through artifacts. It is the latter which are the subject of this article, personal narratives-through-objects. These were spaces which, while they drew on ideas about history, approached more closely to theatre and autobiography. Furnished and sometimes entirely constructed out of a combination of old and new materials, they were the objective expressions of the personalities, thoughts, feelings, and beliefs of their creators. They might take the form of domestic spaces, sometimes they were infiltrated into museums and on occasion they were created in churches. Almost all were the work of men. Indeed in England and Scotland the antiquarian interior was typically an exclusively male, celibate space in which the intrusion of women or children was anathema. In France the case was interestingly different and I have chosen instances that underline the contrast. The French antiquary might inhabit a space not only Romantic, but also Bohemian in which women, children, and overt expressions of sexuality might be intrinsic to its ethos.  </p>
<p>In the most extreme cases the creator of a Romantic interior became such an inextricable part of his creation as to become a living artifact, apparently the product, as much as the projector of his material context. This too was perhaps a more Gallic phenomenon. Victor Hugo, who created spectacular Romantic interiors in his homes in Paris and on Guernsey, makes such symbiosis a central theme in <title level="m">Notre Dame</title>, where he describes Quasimodo's relationship to the cathedral thus: "so, little by little, growing up in sympathy with the cathedral, living there, sleeping there, hardly ever going out, submissive always to its mysterious force he came to resemble it...and he seemed not only its occupant, but indeed its own natural content" (Hugo 247). <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">My translation. 
               </note> Like a snail or an oyster (and similarly unprepossessing), Quasimodo is the shape of his shell, impossible to understand without it and unable to exist for long apart from it. The relationship between animate and inanimate is perfectly reciprocal. Such cases in real life were rare, but they did occur, and this article considers one that approaches such an extreme, the Rouennais antiquary Eustache-Hyacinthe Langlois (1777-1837). </p>
<p>It begins, however, with a consideration of the popular idea of the Romantic interior and the extent to which it corresponded to reality. </p>

<p>The image of the antiquary in the popular imagination came complete with a characteristic setting. Bonington's <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> (1829) offers a typical jumble of miscellaneous objects and papers to contextualize the figures. <ref target="http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O56231/the-antiquarys-cell-oil-painting-cooke-edward-william/" rend="new">E W Cooke's <title level="m">The Antiquary's Cell</title> (1835)</ref> goes further. It relies entirely on the context to evoke the character of the absent antiquary, whose personality and temperament are conveyed through the artifacts he has gathered around himself. When working on the picture, Cooke bought or borrowed props, which he arranged with great care and made several preparatory studies, including one by candlelight (Wainwright 39-40). The individual elements include armor and a "fine carved chair" that Cooke bought from Edward Hull's shop in Wardour Street in Soho, as well as various rolls of parchment (Wainwright 40). </p>
<p>Armor, carved wood, (usually dark or darkened oak) and papers were the staples of the Romantic interior, along with stained glass, which Cooke does not show, and, sometimes, tapestry. Beyond that, details might vary; what mattered was the impression of profusion, mystery, and disorder. Cooke referred to the "olla podrida" of curiosities in his composition, which recedes into evocative gloom (Wainwright 40). The antiquary's empty chair is the focus of the painting. Its drapery bears the impress of a recent occupant, and it glows, not only with the red silk Cooke bought especially for it, but also with an implied inner power. The occupant of this seat we feel, when present, will complete the picture. The description of the scene as a "cell" plays on links between antiquarianism and both monasticism and magic. A kind of magus, the antiquary's galvanizing imagination will reveal the hidden order in the chaos, as a magnet draws iron filings into a pattern. </p>
<p>Interiors like this were not absolutely new in the late eighteenth century, but they grew in number throughout the period and developed to the point where they became part of polite culture. As the enthusiasm for the past extended from <foreign>objets de vertu</foreign> to "curiosities" it was no longer necessary to be as rich as Horace Walpole at Strawberry Hill or William Beckford at Fonthill to use the artifacts of the past to create a home expressive of its owner's personality. By the same token, for those who were rich the great influx of looted (or salvaged) antiquities from the Continent offered unprecedented opportunities for purchase and display. As Clive Wainwright writes: "In 1780 [Romantic interiors] were unusual and by 1850 so many existed that they constituted a major strand of taste in interior decoration" (25). By 1835, when Cooke painted <title level="m">The Antiquary's Cell</title>, the scene was already recognizable and popular with the public, while Soho in general and Wardour Street in particular had become synonymous with a lively antiques trade. <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">See Wainwright, <title level="m">Romantic Interior</title>, and John Harris, <title level="m">Moving Rooms: The Trade in Architectural Salvage</title> (New Haven: Yale UP, 2007) passim for the development of the antiques trade.

                  The principal source for the image of the antiquarian home was undoubtedly Scott's novel <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>, of 1815. Jonathan Oldbuck's lair is clearly the inspiration for Cooke's picture. It would have been in the minds of his audience, and it resonated through the work of other artists and writers. The details are so particular that it is worth quoting the whole long paragraph in which Scott introduces the reader to Oldbuck's study, and thereby to much that is essential to his character. Young Lovel sees it for the first time through a haze of dust, the chambermaid having taken advantage of Oldbuck's absence to attempt, much to the antiquary's irritation, to clean it, a female intrusion which he much resents.: 
               <quote>
                  It was, indeed, some time before Lovel could, through the thick atmosphere, perceive in what sort of den his friend had constructed his retreat.  It was a lofty room of middling size, obscurely lighted by high narrow lattice windows. One end was entirely occupied by book-shelves, greatly too limited in space for the number of volumes placed upon them, which were, therefore, drawn up in ranks of two or three files deep, while numberless others littered the floor and the tables, amid a chaos of maps, engravings, scraps of parchment, bundles of papers, pieces of old armour, swords, dirks, helmets and Highland targets.  Behind Mr Oldbuck’s seat (which was an ancient leathern-covered easy-chair, worn smooth by constant use), was a huge oaken cabinet, decorated at each corner with Dutch cherubs... the top of this cabinet was covered with busts, and Roman lamps and paterae, intermingled with one or two bronze figures.  The walls of the apartment were partly clothed with grim old tapestry, representing the memorable story of Sir Gawaine’s wedding, in which full justice was done to the ugliness of the Lothely Lady; although, to judge from his own looks, the gentle knight had less reason to be disgusted with the match on account of disparity of outward favour, than the romancer has given us to understand.  The rest of the room was panelled, or wainscoted, with black oak, against which hung two or three portraits in armour, being characters in Scottish history, favourites of Mr Oldbuck, and as many in tie-wigs and laced coats, staring representatives of his own ancestors. A large old-fashioned oaken table was covered with a profusion of papers, parchments, books, and nondescript trinkets and gew-gaws, which seemed to have little to recommend them, besides rust and the antiquity which it indicates.  In the midst of this wreck of ancient books and utensils, with a gravity equal to Marius among the ruins of Carthage, sat a large black cat, which, to a superstitious eye, might have represented the genius loci.... [T]he floor, as well as the table and chairs, was overflowed by the same mare magnum of miscellaneous trumpery, where it would have been as impossible to find any individual article wanted, as to put it to any use when discovered. (<title level="m">The Antiquary</title> 31-32)

<p>
                  As in Cooke's picture, gloom and the profusion of objects in apparent chaos are the main impression, although Scott, typically, creates a little ironic distance by attributing the particularly dim atmosphere to the commonplace in the form of dust. There, as in Cooke, are the armor and the dark carved wood. Scott also makes explicit two elements Cooke only implies: the suggestion of the occult in the shape of the cat and the dubious quality of some of the objects. Beyond that Scott also describes what cannot easily be conveyed in painting but is of the essence for the Romantic interior, the conflation of old and new. The paintings on Oldbuck's wall are divided equally between the "characters" from Scottish history (in what may be old pictures or modern pictures of old subjects) and the family portraits of Oldbuck's own forbears. Here the individual is himself inserted into history. Such claims of direct personal kinship with some chosen aspect of the past were typical of the antiquarian interior, a space where time was not so much suspended as in a manner rearranged to suit the occupant.

<head>Image and Reality</head>
<p>
                  Before discussing particular interiors in more detail we might pause to consider how far the popular image of the  <title level="m">Antiquary's Cell</title> reflected reality. It would be misleading to suggest that it was a necessary concomitant of antiquarian activity. The Romantic interior required a suspension of disbelief, and if its presence was expressive of the personality of its creator, so its absence would also be a reliable indicator of intellectual temperament. To some antiquaries this romantic, imaginative interaction with the past appeared as a positive menace to their enterprise.
               </p>
<p>
                  On a continuum from skepticism to enthusiasm we must surely place the Catholic priest John Lingard at the former extreme. I have found no description of the rooms in which he lived and worked. This in itself suggests that they were of no particular significance to him, and it would be surprising, given his commitment to objectivity in his studies, if he viewed the notion of the Romantic interior as anything other than absurd. Indeed Lingard, who was a humorous man, made what was surely a satirical comment on the whole phenomenon when he named the Catholic chapel which he had built in his parish at Hornby, Lancashire, Henry VIII's Chapel. This ironic dedication to the monarch who took England out of communion with Rome referred to the fact that it was the profits from Lingard's history of the Reformation, which became a controversial best-seller, that paid for the chapel. It also turned on its head the concept of a building's expressing its creator's empathy with historic figures.

<p>
                  Towards the center of the continuum Scott himself presents an unsurprisingly close match to the popular image.  <title level="m">The Antiquary's Cell</title> could be seen as an only slightly heightened version of his arrangements at Abbotsford. Indeed Cooke, and his audience, may well have had in mind William Allan's <title level="m">Sir Walter Scott in his Study,</title> painted four years earlier. In Allan's painting Scott is at home at Abbotsford, the farmhouse he had bought, renamed, reshaped, and furnished so to make it appear to be his ancestral home, a post-Reformation castellated manor house supposedly built out of monastic ruins. He occupies the essential carved "oaken" chair, he studies a parchment, Mary Queen of Scots' proclamation of her marriage to Darnley, and he is surrounded by armor and objects in which historical and personal significance combine and in which his novels and poetry are evoked: the sporran of Rob Roy, the keys of the old Tolbooth, and some of the Napoleonica he gathered on the battlefield after Waterloo are all objects that play prominent parts in his work and bind together history and romance through the person of the author. </p>
<p>
                  Scott's position in literature is suggested by his physical placement between the two writers he most admired, represented here by artifacts: the bust of Shakespeare and the neo-classical urn that was a present to Scott from Byron. The image is tamed somewhat by comparison with Oldbuck's study. The room is untidy rather than chaotic, and the sinister cat has been replaced by the more comfortable presence of Maida, Scott's favourite stag-hound, but this is equally a speaking scene in which the furniture does the talking. Allan, in his account of the picture when it was shown at the Royal Academy in 1832, provided a detailed list of the objects portrayed. <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn6" n="6">

                   Some years later Scott's admirer, the publisher, bookseller, and popularizer of antiquarian topics, John Britton (1771-1857), inhabited what might be called, unkindly, a poor man's Abbotsford. In his home, as in his publications, Britton was just one step ahead of his public, and his suburban villa at St. Pancras showed how far and deep, a decade after Scott's death, the Romantic interior had penetrated middle-class society. In June 1843 Britton published a description of his house. This was in itself significant. Scott declined to publish an account of Abbotsford, even when it was one of the most famous houses in Europe, thinking that to do so would be in poor taste and that "Horace Walpole with all his talents makes a silly figure when he gives an upholsterer's catalogue of his goods and chattels at Strawberry Hill" (<title level="m">Journal</title> 461).</p>

<p>
                  That was in 1828. Fifteen years later Britton had no such reservations about publicizing Number 27 Burton Street. This was partly a reflection of his character, but it was also, as his description makes clear, a factor of the change of taste in an age which knew more and cared more about imitating exactly the principles of medieval architecture. He too compares his home with Walpole's but with none of Scott's deference. To Britton that "'gew-gaw' that flimsy 'paste-board house,' –that 'Gothic toy-castle'" was self-evidently ridiculous, what an estate agent might talk up, Britton suggests, as the "most-to-be-admired example of modern domestic monastic architecture in Europe" (<title level="m">Autobiography</title> 155). We might pause to note the fact that the concept of "modern domestic monastic" as an architectural style had now become a plausible part of an estate agent's vocabulary.</p>

<p>
                  Britton saw his house as more scholarly and more serious, morally as well as intellectually, than Walpole's. Accordingly, Britton, anxious always for both publicity and respectability, permitted himself an antiquarian interior that expressed erudition and a plethora of important acquaintance but stopped well short of anything that could be regarded as occult, eccentric, or even untidy. His Octagonal Cabinet Room, designed round the truly remarkable Stonehenge Cabinet that Britton commissioned, is the epitome of suburban antiquarianism. <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7">For a full discussion, see Chippindale.
                  </note>
                   Octagonal rooms had been a feature of Gothic Revival architecture since Fonthill. <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">Notable examples include Alton Towers in Staffordshire (various architects, 1810-1852) and the central lobby of Charles Barry's New Palace of Westminster, 1835.
                   </note> Abbotsford, though not Gothic, had one, and as a centralized yet not a classical space it had many uses and could be successful even on a small scale. Britton's description of his room, however, somewhat justifies Scott's reservations about the tastefulness of such accounts:

<p>
                  	For some antiquaries, even those who were, unlike Lingard, were collectors, the popular image of their natural habitat could be an irritant. Thomas Frognall Dibdin's breathless account of Francis Douce's rooms no doubt captures something of Douce's spectacular collection but owes as much to literary and artistic conventions as to observation.
               
               <quote>
                  It will delight you, I am sure, to hear that Prospero is yet in the full exercise of his "enchanter’s wand"...His maple-wood bookcases rejoice the eye by the peculiar harmony of their tint, -with the rich furniture they enclose. Here a bit of old bright stained glass –exhibiting the true long-lost ruby tint: -there, an inkstand, adorned in high cameo-relief, by the skill of John of Bologna...the rarest China cups... chess-men...used by Charles V and Francis I on their dining together... the very staff with which Regiomontanus used to walk on his house-top by moonlight... Magic lore, and choice Madrigals...and the parchment roll which Handel wielded in beating time on the first representation of the Messiah. (Dibdin 45)
               </quote>

Apart from the maple-wood instead of the more usual oak, this is a by-now familiar agglomeration, with old and new, the intrinsically valuable, the associationally interesting, and the figure of the antiquary-as-wizard all combined in splendid chaos. Indeed Dibdin's description proved easier to relate to literature than to life. "All absolute Bedlam" was Douce's tart response when he read it, "not one of these articles do I possess or know anything about them" (Joliffe 20).</p>
<p>
                  Moving towards the other end of the continuum, past Scott as it were, (for the moment), we come to those for whom the inhabitation of the past through objects was more, or less, than art, those for whom there was no self-conscious or ironic distinction between their sense of self and their creation. Edward Willson (1771-1854), the Lincoln architect, may have been one such. His obituary in <title level="m">The Builder</title>, written by Britton and largely devoted, like most of his writings, to Britton's own importance.  He describes Willson as a "bibliomaniac" who had "filled his house—mostly through my agency and mediation—with tomes of all sizes and ages" (<title level="a">Edward James Willson</title> 4-5). The catalogue of his post-mortem sale in November 1854 lists three hundred ninety-five lots of books. These are followed by prints, paintings, "ancient and mediaeval remains," "antique porcelain," and "miscellaneous" (<title level="m">A Catalogue</title>). The latter are fewer in number but cover an interestingly typical range:

                  With the Sobieski Stuart brothers and E.H. Langlois we approach the far end of the spectrum, where artifact, identity, and meaning are inextricably interfused. The interiors they created require more detailed discussion. Scott also reappears, for, at the end of his life, he seems to have come to a less detached view of his home and its possible meanings.
               </p>

<div type="section">
<head>The Sobieski Stuarts and the death of Jonathan Oldbuck</head>
<p>	The two brothers who came to be known as the Sobieski Stuarts began life as John Carter Allen (?1795-1872) and Charles Manning Allen (?1799-1880). They were the sons of Thomas Gatehouse Allen, an English naval officer who, they claimed, was the legitimate son of Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender. Not surprisingly, accounts of their lives vary substantially in detail. The most recent, an article by Steven Robb, published in 2003, purports to add more information, although without any indication of its sources (Robb 3-8). The principal critical discussion is Hugh Trevor-Roper's essay <title level="a">The Highland Tradition of Scotland</title> in <title level="m">The Invention of Tradition</title> (1992). It offers an outline of their remarkable career, in the course of which they not only created the concept of tartan as Scottish national dress, but also designed many of the tartans in use today, while claiming historical sources for them in their most famous, or notorious, publication, the <title level="m">Vestiarium Scoticum</title>, of 1842. </p>
<p>The use of historic artifacts to create a context for themselves and their activities was vital to the brothers' success. Literally in the home that they made for themselves from 1839 on the estate of Lord Lovat in Inverness-shire, and literarily in their writings, they created a setting in which their claims appeared plausible. In their house and in their pseudo-autobiographical fiction <title level="m">Tales of the Century,</title> published in 1847, the role of objects and their associations, their authenticity or otherwise is a constant theme, a shadow narrative to the brothers' own story. </p>
<p>Trevor-Roper's essay, like the book of which it forms a part, was essentially a debunking exercise. He was not unsympathetic to these "engaging charlatans" whom he revisited in <title level="m">The Invention of Scotland</title>, admiring the fact that they "went the whole hog," but his predominant interest was in establishing what the brothers were not (Trevor-Roper 216-236). Later, Stewart and Thompson's unambiguously titled <title level="m">Scotland's Forged Tartans</title> established what the <title level="m">Vestiarium Scoticum</title> was not (Stewart and Thompson). This having been so thoroughly done, my interest has been to consider what the brothers actually were. What they themselves came to believe about their inheritance it is not possible to know, but they lived out their claims with complete integrity to the end of their lives. That they were serious antiquarian scholars is not in doubt.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" n="9">
                     Extensive, unpublished, mss. survive in the National Library of Scotland for studies of subjects including firearms (ms. 2193) and, interestingly, <title level="a">Illustrations of Popular Delusion</title> (ms 2173). 
               </note> They also deployed history to serve their own ideas in the present, physically inhabiting the identity that they claimed for themselves, making them forgeries, perhaps, rather than fakes.</p>
<p> In considering their career, the uncontroversial part of the brothers' pedigree, which has attracted little attention, is not without interest. Their mother was Katherine Matilda Manning, a daughter of the Reverend Owen Manning (1721-1801), vicar of Godalming in Surrey, a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and of the Royal Society, county historian of Surrey, and a distinguished scholar of Old English whose annotated translation of the will of King Alfred was published in 1788 (Ross and Collins). Their father, Thomas Allen, remarried after his first wife's death and, having lost all his money in speculation, lived in hiding from his creditors in Boulogne-sur-mer under his second wife's name, Salmond. He apparently took no interest in his sons' account of their ancestry (and his), but claimed for himself the Earldom of Erroll (Robb). Something clearly ran in the family, even if it was not the blood of the Stuarts.</p>
<p>The first glimpse of them in history, as far as I can discover, is in 1822, before they made any claims to royal descent. They were present at George IV's "jaunt" to Scotland, the progress choreographed by Scott that may be said to have begun the modern "Highland Tradition." Scott saw them there and they, perhaps, saw him (Scott, <title level="m">Letters</title> 198-202). That same year John Allen published a book of verse. <title level="m">The Bridal of Caolchairn and other Poems</title> appeared in several editions in London and Edinburgh, some of which gave the author as "John Hay Allan," the Scottish version of "Allen," while others appeared under the name of "Walter Scott" (Todd and Bowden 999-1000). These latter were actually produced by Scott's own publishers, Hurst, Robinson in London and Archibald Constable in Edinburgh. </p>
<p>
                  Exactly how this first act of impersonation was achieved is not clear but it was the beginning of pattern in the brothers' lives. From now on, regardless of their other claims, the pedigree they might most truthfully claim for themselves was that of Waverley. They inhabited the space between fact and fiction, history and modernity that had been created by Scott in his novels. Scott himself, though he warned against taking these "ingenious" young men and their "exaggerating imagination, which possibly deceives even themselves," at face value, was powerless to stop their progress (<title level="m">Letters</title> 198). It was as if two characters had escaped from his novels and could not be recaptured.

<p>
                  The Sobieski Stuarts' living arrangements in their heyday embodied the essence of the Romantic interior as the extension of personality. From 1839 until 1847 they enjoyed the patronage of Lord Lovat who allowed them to choose a site on his land on which he would build for them a home. Lovat was not alone by the late 1830s in taking them seriously as the heirs to the Stuart line. As Elizabeth Grant of Rothiemurchus recalled, "half the clans in the Highlands believed in them; for several years they actually <emph>reigned</emph> in the north country" (Grant 388). The house that Lord Lovat built for them was, naturally, Gothic, its situation on Eilan Aigas, an island in the Beauly River suitably picturesque. The brothers' self-portrait shows them at home surrounded by the usual profusion of oak, antlers, arms, and miscellaneous curiosities. These may well include the possibly genuine relics of Charles Edward Stuart which the brothers acquired, perhaps from the Scottish revolutionary and adventurer Robert Watson (?1746-1838).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn10" n="10">

                   If there is a little less confusion or profusion of objects than in Cooke's painting or William Allan's portrait of Scott, if there is no gloom and no hint of the occult, that is perhaps because the brothers felt their claims to be shadowy enough and wanted to present themselves without any suggestion of further obscurity.
               </p>
<p>
                  The brothers' effect on visitors who saw them either in their home or at mass, to which they sailed from their island in a boat flying the Stuart standard, tended to reflect the level of faith or doubt in the beholder. The setting was, however, important to everyone. In 1842 the architect A.W.N. Pugin (1812-1852), despite Trevor-Roper's boast that "no Englishman seems to have taken them seriously"  (232), found them entirely convincing, and his account shows him forming his impressions as much from the context as the brothers themselves:

</quote>
               Even the more skeptical Elizabeth Grant found these "strange brothers [who]...one day announced that they were Stuarts...astonishing." Being less persuaded than Pugin, she remembered their context in a more humdrum way. The house she saw as a "villa," their garden as "pretty" and the waterfall as 'small" (Grant 388). She was struck, however, by the fact that Charles's wife "played the harp like Flora McIvor" and that "crowds went to visit them" (Grant 388). In their own persons the brothers achieved a remarkable resemblance to their pretended ancestors. "They always wore the Highland dress, kilt and belted plaid, and looked melancholy and spoke at times mysteriously" (Grant 388). Unafraid of the new medium of photography, much admired for its veracity, Charles sat for his portrait to the Edinburgh photographers Hill and Adamson in about 1844, and the result bears out the truthfulness of Grant's description and the fact that if the camera does not lie it may be too easily impressed. </p>
<p>
                  	Meanwhile the brothers were pursuing their work on the history of tartan. By the time Pugin met them they were on the brink of publication and were held to have been "long and honourably distinguished for their devotion to the Antiquities of the Gael," so much so that they were invited to contribute "a series of outlines of Highland Costume" to the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels, which appeared that same year (Scott, <title level="m">Abbotsford</title> 4). The posthumous Abbotsford Edition marked another stage in the integration of illusion and reality in and around Scott's fiction. The editors had studied his home and its contents "with care" in order to illustrate the novels with "a Series of Engravings, representing the Pictorial and Antiquarian Museum at Abbotsford," thereby providing "the most instructive <emph>graphic</emph> commentary that the body of his Writings could receive from any one source" (<title level="m">Abbotsford</title> 3). In addition to which further illustrations were taken from "the real localities of his scenes" and "the real portraits of his personages have been copied" (<title level="m">Abbotsford</title> 4).
               </p>
<p>
                  Here at the crux of fact and fiction the Sobieski Stuarts inserted themselves with their "invaluable" researches which, it was felt, fully justified "the expectations formed of their projected great Work" (<title level="m">Abbotsford</title> 4). This was the <title level="m">Vestiarium Scoticum</title> which appeared in the same year. It was indeed well received. Queen Victoria, despite the authors' claim to her throne, was a great admirer. Five years later, however, with <title level="m">Tales of the Century</title>, the brothers over-reached themselves. In making public and specific their claims they exposed themselves to wider scrutiny, and the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>'s response to the book, an extensive essay by Professor George Skene of Glasgow University, cast as a late review of the <title level="m">Vestiarium</title>, destroyed their credibility with many of their admirers (Skene 57-85). The antiquarian relationship with history at its most imaginative had met the academic at its most rigorous and did not survive the impact. The brothers were forced to leave Scotland and spent the next twenty years in Austria.</p>
<p>
                  By the time <title level="m">Tales of the Century</title> appeared Scott had been dead for fifteen years. The book would no doubt have exasperated him. Yet the Sobieski Stuarts' complete identification with their Romantic interior might not have seemed so alien to Scott in his later years when, towards the end of his life, he changed his mind about the advisability of publishing an account of Abbotsford and its contents. He began work on what became <title level="m">Reliquiae Trotcosienses</title> in 1830, after the first of a series of strokes which preceded his death two years later. It was never finished and the full text remained unpublished until 2004. It offers another portrait of the antiquary in literature and life, its main subject the house and the objects within it. These now, as Scott contemplated the end of his life, began to take on lives of their own. By different means he appears to come to the same end as the Sobieski Stuarts, perceiving himself as a construction of his own Romantic interior. It is also possible that in his elaborate title he nodded deliberately towards the brothers and their dubious productions.</p>
<p>
<title level="m">Reliquiae Trotcosienses or the Gabions of the Late Jonathan Oldbuck Esq of Monkbarns</title>, is premised on Scott's familiar ironizing of antiquarian method. The title, which means, "of the relics of Trotcosey," refers back to Oldbuck's home on the lands that once belonged to the Abbey of Trotcosey. This was already a joke, a "trotcosey" being a modern Scottish word for a hooded cape in which the wearer could trot, cozily, through the cold like a monk in a habit. The term "gabions" derives from Henry Adamson's poem of 1638, <title level="m">The Muses Threnodie</title>, an early, perhaps the first, account of the imaginative, reciprocal relationship between the antiquary and his collections. Scott amuses himself with mock-scholarly attempts to define the word, which he uses, in effect, to mean "curiosities" of little or no intrinsic value. </p>
<p>
                  Just a year earlier, in 1829, in a letter to Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, in which Scott tried, unsuccessfully, to urge caution towards the Sobieski Stuarts, he pointed out that the (then unpublished) manuscript they claimed had been given to their father by Charles Stuart, and on which they said they had based the <title level="m">Vestiarium Scoticum</title>, had a title in "false Latin I should think not likely to occur to a Scotsman of Buchanan's age" (<title level="m">Letters</title> 201). In choosing false Latin for his own <title level="m">Reliquiae</title> was Scott perhaps parodying their pretensions?
               </p>
<p>
                  In the Introduction to the published version of <title level="m">Reliquiae</title> David Hewitt draws attention to Scott's distancing techniques. He suggests that the several parts of the book therefore "both are, and are not about Scott and his antiquarian activities, both are and are not about Abbotsford, and are or are not to be taken seriously" (Hewitt xv). This is true so far as it goes, but Scott was here perhaps using irony for more personal purposes in a text that is not a novel (although, as Hewitt points out, it has the three-volume format) but a narrative that develops out of fiction into documentary fact and finishes as autobiography. The false scents laid in the <title level="a">Introduction,</title>
<title level="a">Proem,</title> and <title level="a">Preface,</title> through which the reader passes, like a series of air locks, before getting to the main text, are there to protect the author who is unmistakeably present there <foreign>in propria persona</foreign>.
                  </p>
<p>
                  The most striking indication that this is a personal apologia is the unremarkable, and by Hewitt unremarked, part of the title, which Scott's lexicographic shenanigans with the rest of it effectively obscure: "the late Jonathan Oldbuck Esq." Oldbuck, the original antiquary, Scott's alter ego, is, we learn, dead, and it is the imminence of death hanging over the <title level="m">Reliquiae</title> that gives it its poignancy. Before he died, we are told, Oldbuck tried to get a friend to write about his collection, but the friend refused, as Scott had earlier refused, on the grounds that it would be ridiculous: "Remember the fate of Woodward who brought every wit in London upon his head by his antiquarian essays" (<title level="m">Reliquiae Trotcosienses</title> 21). What we are presented with instead is supposedly the account he himself left of his gabions, yet the narrator explicitly distinguishes himself from Oldbuck. Who is this then, who has transferred the Oldbuck collection from Monkbarns to his own home and now takes the reader on a tour of it? It must, of course, be Scott though this is left unclear. The incoherence in the narrative mechanism at this point may be due to the author's failing health. It may also be a product of his reluctance, even after so much subterfuge, to emerge fully unmasked into his own text.</p>
<p>
                  Scott goes on to tour Abbotsford in his mind's eye, deploying it like a memory theatre, pausing at significant points to describe the furnishings, the objects and then by association their origin and context. As he goes on the fiction falls away. The characters who emerge from the text to inhabit Abbotsford are not the inventions of Waverley but Scott's own friends and acquaintances, the donors or makers of his collection. The narrative turns into an autobiography-by-objects spoken in his own voice and recalling his own antiquarian feats:  "Before I quit the hall I ought to say that the end which terminates it upon the west or left side of the entrance is garnished with spoils from the immortal field of Waterloo, when I collected them in person very shortly after the immortal action" (<title level="m">Reliquiae Trotcosienses</title> 34).
               </p>
<p>
                  	The repetition of "immortal" is one of several moments when the reader is aware of Scott's failing concentration. With fitting irony Lockhart decided after Scott's death that the <title level="m">Reliquiae</title> would indeed show him in as poor a light as Oldbuck's friend had predicted. He declined to publish it. Yet this is the ultimate consummation of the antiquarian relationship between object and text. Beneath its comic armor <title level="m">Reliquiae Trotcosienses</title> is a tragic fragment.

                  	With the Rouennais E.H. Langlois, we come to another extreme case. There are points of comparison with Scott and the Sobieski Stuarts in Langlois's story, but also significant differences that illustrate the contrasts between antiquarian personae on either side of the Channel. While England and Scotland were peaceful and relatively wealthy after 1815, post-revolutionary France was much reduced by social upheaval. French antiquaries had a more troubled, indeed violent relationship with history.</p>
<p>
                   	Langlois lived in destitution. He was not lacking in a sense of the theatrical or in ironic humor, but he made use of neither in relation to the objects that he had collected and rescued in the aftermath of the Revolution. His apartments in the former Convent of the Visitation were memorable, but not artful. His friend Charles Richard recalled the experience of visiting him, and his description should be quoted as fully as Scott's of Oldbuck's sanctum, for it makes a Gallic pendant to it, the similarities and differences equally striking.
               <quote>
                  It was to the great Convent of the Visitation of St Mary, so deserted, so icy, so melancholy, that the wretched artist had come for shelter, with his seven children and his wife! To find him it was necessary to enter by the cloister door. The visitor crossed a damp and ruined gallery... at the end of this gallery a wooden stair case, in the open air... led to a dusty and decrepit attic. This vast antechamber was inhabited by an extensive family of pet birds which hardly moved to let the visitor through to the door of a study, the only more or less habitable corner in this vast space where the four winds met. The heart contracted horribly on entering the room. Valuable works of art, rich and curious manuscripts, were cast hugger-mugger on the table, on the mantelpiece, on the chairs, on the ground. In winter when, frozen by the north wind, you put your hand on the stove, the iron froze your hand, for there was no fire. No fire in the grate either: the window frame quivered, covered with strips of paper to conceal the wretchedness of this desolate home; the shreds with which it was heaped gave off strange noises, plaintive shiverings, stifled cries. It was his poor little children who ran to hide themselves in this sanctum at the approach of a stranger, like mice in their hole, for they were stark naked!... and, in the midst of this affecting scene, you beheld a man full of dignity, of stoicism and serenity. (Richard 8-10)

<p>
                  Some of this is familiar. The profusion of objects, the chaos, the mingling of the precious with the apparently worthless, but overall the impression is very different from the home life of the English or Scottish antiquary. There is nothing staged about the way Langlois lives, nothing funny about him. The poverty is real. The cold is real and so is the nakedness of the children. Indeed the obtrusion of a family into what in the British antiquarian interior, is a celibate male space marks in itself a significant difference. The objects Langlois has around him have not been bought from brokers" shops in Soho but rescued from violent revolution. As <title level="m">Notre Dame</title> is to the world of Waverley, more lurid, more socially realistic, less polite, so is Langlois to Walter Scott. He is not domesticated, as the British antiquary is, either in art or in life.</p>
<p>
                  Yet while the circumstances are real, Richard's description of them is not without conscious literary effect. The gloom, the contractions of the heart, the emphasis on the contrast between the squalor of the room and the nobility of its occupant, rising above his sufferings, are also conventions. They are conventions not of antiquarianism as understood in Britain, however, but of Bohemia, a milieu well-established in the French popular imagination by 1840, the date of Richard's essay. In Richard's text Langlois is cast as an artist, starving in a garret.</p>
<p>
                  In France the idea of the Bohemian was born, like antiquarianism, directly out of the aftermath of the French Revolution, and the two categories overlapped. <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn12" n="12">
                           For the origins of the idea of "Bohemia" in the aftermath of the French Revolution, see Elizabeth Wilson, <title level="m">Bohemians: the Glamorous Outcasts</title> (New York: I B Tauris, 2000).

                   In the case of Victor Hugo, who could afford to dress the set more artfully, they were entirely fused. Dickens, visiting Hugo in Paris in 1847, gives another measure of the difference between British and Gallic attitudes. With Scott's and indeed his own novels in mind, he could not take Hugo's Romantic interiors quite seriously. The rooms in the Place des Vosges, where Dickens met the Hugos, do not survive intact, but the interiors of Hauteville House, which Hugo created later on Guernsey, do, and they suggest what it was that Dickens saw.

                   He was mildly scandalized: 
                  <quote>A most extraordinary place, looking like an old curiosity shop, or the Property Room of some gloomy vast old Theatre. I was much struck by Hugo himself, who looks a Genius, as he certainly is, and is very interesting from head to foot.  His wife is a handsome woman with flashing black eyes, who looks as if she might poison his breakfast any morning when the humour seized her.  There is also a ditto daughter of fifteen or sixteen, with ditto eyes, and hardly any drapery above the waist, whom I should suspect of carrying a sharp poignard in her stays, but for her not appearing to wear any.  Sitting among old armour, and old tapestry, and old coffers, and grim old chairs and tables, and old Canopies of state from old palaces, and old golden lions going to play at skittles with ponderous old golden balls, they made a most romantic show, and looked like a chapter out of one of his own books. (<title level="m">The Letters of Charles Dickens</title> 15)</quote>
</p>
<p>
                  It is the objects that turn Hugo, as Abbotsford turned Scott, into a character from one of his own novels. If, as the passing allusion to the <title level="m">Old Curiosity Shop</title> suggests, they were accidentally to propel him into one of his own, Dickens makes clear that the effect would be mildly comic. Yet at the same time the dark drama that Dickens reads, half-seriously, into the scene and its sexual edge, quite foreign to the world of Waverley, give a nervous undertow to his amusement.</p>
<p>
                  In August 1831 the Baron Dupont-Delporte, recently appointed head of the Départment de la Seine-Inférieure, wrote to the Mayor of Rouen suggesting the establishment of a museum in the city to display the antiquities rescued or excavated in the region. The proposed location was the Convent of the Visitation. Langlois was already living in the building in the spectacular squalor described by Richard. He was also giving drawing classes there. In England such a presence would almost certainly have been considered an obstacle. In Normandy it was a positive advantage. Achille Deville, a tax inspector and enthusiastic antiquary who was appointed first director of the museum, immediately requested and was granted permission to hire Langlois "pour l'aider dans la régie et l'adminstration du musée" [to help him with the organization and administration of the museum] (Favigny 15). Having rejected the second floor of the building as being unable to take the weight of the architectural fragments he intended to display, Deville opted instead for the cloisters, where the collection is still displayed today.

<p>
                  With the creation of the museum around him Langlois became, if not exactly an exhibit, then a living part of the totality, inhabiting it and ordering it from within. His own collection was absorbed into it during his lifetime, and not only the antiquities. Deville, who was obviously fond of Langlois personally, incorporated Langlois's sword, left over from his military service, into the display (Richard 35). Wandering through the cloisters in Rouen, as Quasimodo wandered through Notre Dame, Langlois would have passed through his own history, among objects that had characterized his career and to some extent formed him. After his death the museum remained, like the shell of a snail, its outlines describing the space his curious character once occupied.</p>

                  The End of the Antiquarian Interior
               </head>
<p>
                  Arguably the antiquarian interior never came to an end, indeed as "interior decoration" developed in the second half of the nineteenth century into a significant element of middle-class domestic culture, more people than ever before could express their characters and ideas through the arrangement of objects in their homes. Wainwright quotes Charles Eastlake's advice in <title level="m">Hints on Household Taste</title> (1868) that "[t]he smallest example of rare old porcelain, of ivory carving, of ancient metal-work...should be acquired whenever possible, and treasured with the greatest care...group them together as much as possible. A set of narrow shelves...forming part of a dining-room sideboard would be admirable" (Wainwright 287).
               </p>
<p>
                  Yet, as Eastlake's detailed instructions make clear, this was now anything but a spontaneous or personal activity; it was rather, as Wainwright says, part of a popular fashion. By the mid-century the antiquarian interior was vanishing. While the idea was absorbed into the mainstream, the reality, in the sense that it has been described here, was on the wane, for the same reasons and to the same extent that antiquarianism itself, of this sort, was dwindling. Collections, such as Douce's and Langlois's, passed at their death into public museums. The flood of Continental antiquities dried up and native medieval objects began at last to attract the attention of professional curators. After years of complaints by antiquaries about the absence of Gothic art from national collections a royal commission of 1850 recommended the establishment of a collection of British antiquities. The British Museum duly appointed Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks (1826-1897), a moving force in the Archaeological Institute, to oversee its formation.</p>
<p>
                  Some antiquarian interiors were dispersed when their owners died. Others, in country houses, survived undetected, as Wainwright points out, and are now often taken to be much older than they are. As distinctions between "true" and "false" in history hardened, the antiquarian interior came to seem naïve or bogus. The Sobieski Stuarts lived long enough to be marooned in an unforgiving age which merely tolerated them as eccentrics. After some years on the Continent they returned to England and lived in Pimlico, then a shabby part of south London. By 1868 they were fixtures in the Reading Room of the British Museum where they pursued their researches using ink wells that bore the Stuart crest. John had complained just before their fall that he and his brother had already been reduced to "mere <emph>dramatic</emph> characters" (Stuart). Yet perhaps that is what they had always been, actors in their own historical romance.

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">Historical writing on landscape painting in 18th and 19th century Britain has often been guided by a distinction between topography and the Sublime. The sharp line thus drawn between the routine and the exceptional, the plain and the imaginative, the derided and the elevated, matches that drawn between antiquarianism and the modern discipline of history. By exploring two images by the nineteenth century artist John Martin which defy or confuse these various distinctions, this essay seeks to complicate our sense of landscape painting’s history and its relationship with topography and antiquarian image-making.</p>

<p>	The opposition between topographical and imaginative landscape imagery has structured the understanding of landscape art in important ways over the last two centuries, in much the same way that the opposition between antiquarianism and historical writing has helped structure historiography (see Momigliano; Myrone and Peltz; Phillips 1996). Moreover, these two oppositions are not merely related by resemblance, but have actively influenced each other and interacted: topographical interests have often given rise to antiquarian research, antiquarian research has led to the creation of topographical imagery, and, insofar as topographical images so often contain and even focus on ruins and monuments as well as the worked, bounded, and otherwise historically marked landscape, they have served as pre-eminent antiquarian resources. Indeed, antiquarianism itself might even be defined as a historical practice by the special status it lends visual images as a form of evidence. The distinction between (and complaint against) the topographical has often also mobilized the prejudices (social as well as strictly intellectual) against antiquaries. The classic statement of such an opposition was contained in Henry Fuseli's Fourth Lecture on Painting as Professor of that art at the Royal Academy (first delivered 1804), in a passage which has been quoted repeatedly in recent scholarship as a means of illuminating the deepened antipathy towards topographical representation from an increasingly powerful metropolitan fine art establishment (see Myrone 2009, 57; Daniels and Bonehill 2012, 178):
            <quote>To portrait painting, thus circumscribed [as "a kind of family kalendar" (sic)] we subjoin, as the last branch of uninteresting subjects, the kind of landscape which is entirely occupied with the tame delineation of a given spot; an enumeration of hill and dale, clumps of trees, shrubs, water, meadows, cottages, and houses, what is commonly called Views. These, if not assisted by nature, dictated by taste, or chosen for character, may delight the owner of the acres they enclose, the inhabitants of the spot, perhaps the antiquary or the traveller, but to every other eye they are little more than topography. The landscape of Titian, of Mola, or Salvator, of the Poussins, Claude, Rubens, Elzheimer, Rembrandt, and Wilson, spurns all relation with this kind of map-work. (qtd. in Baumgarten Vol. I, 141)</quote>
                  The images that would, then, satisfy "the antiquary or the traveller" appear almost inevitably to fall short of the status of art, or at least art of any intellectual or aesthetic ambition. These oppositions, between "map-work" and "art" so defined—oppositions generally assumed to be immediately self-evident and irrefutable—continue to operate with axiomatic force in much curatorial and art historical practice. As John Barrell asserts in his damning critique of the recent exhibition <title level="m">Constable, Gainsborough, Turner and the Making of Landscape</title> (Royal Academy of Arts, London 2012-13), the historical narrative which arises from such a division underlies the most conventional story of landscape painting in Britain. In Barrell's view, this was simply re-stated, uncritically, by the exhibition, for it told (as he quotes the exhibition booklet): 
            
         <quote>how there was in the 18th century a variety of landscape called "topography," sometimes "strict topography," which was committed to "the accurate recording of particular places." The exhibition includes several such pictures, watercolors by Sandby, Michael Angelo Rooker and others, beautiful but somehow small-minded, limited in their ambition, we are invited to believe. Eventually, however, in the early 19th century, topographical art was transcended by something infinitely more serious and more powerful, a sublime style of painting that sought to represent the "grandeur of nature", and to produce in us "feelings of awe, fear or horror." This new landscape art, exemplified primarily by Turner, could also see through mere "particular places" to show us something that transcended all particularity, and which in this exhibition goes by such names as "British landscape scenery in its own right," or "nature itself."</quote>
</p>
<p>The narrative laid out here has some uncanny (and telling) similarities to that which can be told about the rise of "history" and "archaeology" in the nineteenth century in opposition to, and replacing, antiquarianism: the minute and trivial being displaced by the grand and firm, the small-minded by the expansive, the cold and distant by the urgent and engaged. We should be alert to the reflexiveness of such a position in the early nineteenth century—this division was one of the ways the "British School" of art was knowingly defined (see Phillips 2003)—and such an account of landscape art, appearing though it has at a major London exhibition venue, and enduring as it does in some popular and scholarly publishing and broadcasting, has been challenged repeatedly over the last thirty years or more, which fact must help explain the note of exasperation apparent in Barrell's polemic. Accounts of landscape imagery that propose it can "only" or "simply" represent the truth of the natural world have long been under scrutiny while landscape painting has been a primary focus of progressive scholarship in art history and visual culture studies.  Clearly, this has been part of a much larger critique of visual representation which embraces antiquarian image-making as well as high art: as Stephanie Moser and Sam Smiles have asserted in introducing a collection of essays around archaeological imaging: "We now routinely accept that no pictorial device can be a transparent illustration of the world, but instead deploys technical devices, formal conventions, and ideological assumptions to orchestrate meaning" (1). With reference to British landscape art more particularly, we have witnessed a highly concentrated and hugely influential chain of scholarly contributions which, in the 1980s and early 1990s, reshaped British art history at large: John Barrell's seminal <title level="m">The Dark Side of the Landscape</title> (1980), David Solkin's <title level="m">Richard Wilson: The Landscape of Reaction</title> (1982), and Michael Rosenthal's <title level="m">Constable: The Painter and his Landscape</title> (1983), followed by Ann Bermingham's <title level="m">Landscape and Ideology</title> (1989), Andrew Hemingway's <title level="m">Landscape Imagery and Urban Culture in Early Nineteenth-Century Britain</title> (1992) and Kay Dian Kriz's <title level="m">The Idea of the English Landscape Painter</title> (1997), as well as numerous articles and chapters by these authors and others. Where these mainly focused on oil painting and reproductive prints, even more recently Andrew Kennedy, Stephen Daniels, John Bonehill (2009), and others have also subjected topographical and antiquarian landscape imagery to serious critical scrutiny. Topographical imagery is being actively rehabilitated as part of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century visual culture, with the insistence that "topography should be analysed in relation to larger structures of knowledge and value and the changing technologies and communication systems of this nascent consumer society" (Myrone <title level="a">The Monarch,</title> 57).  The heroic narratives which suggested that antiquarianism was simply superseded by modern historical and archaeological methods in the nineteenth century have given way to accounts which are more localized in their concerns and more ready to acknowledge the sympathies, paradoxes, and continuities apparent in the emergence of modern disciplinary formations in the practice of history (see Myrone and Peltz, Smiles and Moser; Arnold and Bending; Pearce and Nurse, <foreign>et al</foreign>.).</p>
<p>	Here I want to address two images which can be positioned productively in the nexus of imaginative and topographical landscape imaging, art, and antiquarianism, in order further to complicate and revise our understanding of these purported divisions: John Martin's drawing of Avebury, imagined in its purportedly original state (<ref target="http://www.wiltshireheritagecollections.org.uk/index.asp?page=item&amp;mwsquery=%7BIdentity number%7D=%7BDZSWS:1982.3270%7D" rend="new">drawn circa 1815-22, published as an engraving in 1825, and housed at the Wiltshire Heritage Museum</ref>) and his large oil painting, <ref target="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/martin-the-destruction-of-pompei-and-herculaneum-n00793" rend="new">
<title level="m">The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</title>
</ref> (completed and exhibited for the first time in 1822; now in the collection of Tate, London). Martin has been only an awkward presence in the history of landscape painting, either too extravagant or too prosaic. Either way, his work has appeared too far detached from the moderated naturalism which purportedly defines the national school to qualify him as a "master". Situating these very different images in relation to the poles of imaginative and topographical image-making, and in the context of "Romantic Visuality" as an inherently unstable and shifting phenomenon, should expose a more complex and even unclear situation than commentators like Fuseli, or even his critics, would seem to allow.</p>
<p>	Both images could readily be considered in the context of much wider visual cultures around the sites concerned, and there is an existing literature around the imaging of Avebury (and of ancient British monuments) and of Pompeii and Herculaneum in the early nineteenth century. We could, very usefully, analyze these images without any reference to their authorship for what they might tell us about the topographical and artistic interpretation of these key historical locations at a moment at which the virtues and possibilities of landscape representation were being so thoroughly explored and overhauled. My intention here, though, is rather more modest and localized and focuses more on the ways we may read these images in relation to the professional positioning of Martin and Britton. Without wanting to revert to a naively biographical form of art-historical interpretation, I would nonetheless insist that this approach may help us to further appreciate the strategic (which is not to say necessarily self-conscious) value attached to antiquarianism and topography as they may have been deployed in the rapidly shifting social terrains of early nineteenth-century metropolitan culture, a cultural <emph>field</emph> in the full sense (as defined by struggle between its members over their respective virtues, values, and rights) (see Bourdieu). </p>
<p>	The first work under consideration, Martin's sepia-tinted drawing of the ancient monument of Avebury, was prepared for publication as a print for the belated third volume of the topographer John Britton's <title level="m">Beauties of Wiltshire</title> (1801-1825).  Martin's design, based—so we are told via the inscription of the published print reproducing the image in Britton's book—on a sketch by Britton himself, is described in a footnote:
         <quote>The annexed view has been drawn for the purpose of conveying to a stranger some idea of this Temple in its primeval state. It professes to shew the whole from an imaginary station, about one mile north of the circles. Near the foreground is a cromlech (still remaining, but fallen,)  with stones surrounding it; and the very skilful artist who made the drawing, has indicated an immense procession of ancient Britons, presumed to be in the act of performing some funeral ceremony. (276-77n)</quote>
                  The drawing is undated, but the reproductive print's inscription gives a publication date of August 1, 1824. It seems reasonable to assume that Martin would have produced it between 1822 and 1824, when he was already at work for Britton producing topographical designs of William Beckford's Fonthill Abbey (also in Wiltshire) and a drawing of Wells Cathedral for another Britton publication, and when too he was part of the same social circle in London (confirmed as a short-lived Pot Luck Club which, besides Britton and Martin, included William Jerdan, Alaric A. Watts and others.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">See Balston, 86; I have previously assumed this dating in Myrone 2011, nos. 18-19).</note> However, given the protracted production of the third volume of the <title level="m">Beauties of Wiltshire</title>
<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">Volume II had appeared as long ago as 1801, and Britton felt compelled to include an introductory autobiographical statement detailing everything else he had done since, as a form of apology to the reader</note>, an earlier date is also possible.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">News that the illustrations to the prospective third volume would include one showing "the immense Druidical Temple of Avebury" was in print in 1815 (<title level="j">New Monthly Magazine</title>, 4: 1815, 423), and this may indicate that Martin was already engaged on the project. A watercolor by Britton showing Avebury from the north corresponds with Martin's drawing in some general respects but suggests a lower viewpoint and a different angle. This is dated to as early as 1815 (following an inscription on the back of the support) (Wiltshire Heritage Museum; see Hatchwell, no.8). Other related drawings of Avebury by Britton (in the same collection) are dated from 1805 to 1821.</note>
</p>
<p>	The drawing has never been given a significant place in the literature on Martin. The original reports of Britton's publication tended to focus on his account of Avebury, but even then the accompanying print is barely noticed (<title level="j">The Literary Chronicle for the Year 1825</title> 660). The modern literature has given only scant attention to this design.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"> It was not noted in Mary Pendered's pioneering biographical study of 1923, nor even in Thomas Balston's thorough and still-important monograph of 1947, nor in the catalogue listing of drawings prepared independently by the poet Ruthven Todd earlier in the 1940s (Todd), nor in the listing of illustrations by Martin which Todd passed to Balston (Todd and Balston). The drawing was only brought to Balston's attention in 1948 by the poet Geoffrey Grigson who, tellingly, was a pioneering writer on the sublime in British art and associated with current "Neo-Romanticism" (letter of 5 February 1948, private collection). Grigson himself was to write about Avebury in the context of illustrated country guides aimed at latter-day antiquarian adventurers: <title level="m">The Wiltshire Book</title> (1957) and <title level="m">Wiltshire: An Introduction</title> (1963). The romantic vision of primitive England presented by Martin's design certainly chimes with the new interest in prehistoric remains current among several modern British visual artists, particularly Paul Nash; (see Haycock, 54-8 and Smiles, <title level="a">Equivalents</title>). Balston planned a new edition of his monograph; although this never emerged, he prepared a note in manuscript prompted by Grigson's information, dismissing the drawing as "rather a diagram than a work of art." The design was noticed in Christopher Johnstone's brief survey of Martin's art (Johnstone 18) but overlooked in William Feaver's full monograph of 1975 (a book which has exercised considerable influence over subsequent commentaries on the artist). More recently, the print was discussed and illustrated in Sam Smiles's <title level="m">Ancient Britons and the Romantic Imagination</title> (1994), and both print and drawing were displayed as part of the recent Tate Britain exhibition <title level="m">John Martin: Apocalypse</title> (2011-12), although only in the context of a range of materials dating from the early stages of Martin's professional career and intended thereby to illustrate the range of often rather prosaic artistic work undertaken by him before his reputation became established (Myrone <title level="m">John Martin</title>, cat. nos. 18-19).</note> By the date of the publication of the print, Martin had already produced and exhibited the several large paintings of biblical epics and historical disasters on which his reputation was to rest: <title level="m">Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still</title> (1816; National Gallery of Art, Washington), <title level="m">The Fall of Babylon</title> (1819; private collection, Europe), <title level="m">Belshazzar's Feast</title> (1821; private collection, England) and <title level="m">The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</title> (1822; Tate), addressed below; he had also launched the series of hugely original mezzotint illustrations of Milton's <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> which secured him even wider fame.  Martin's historical reputation (or infamy) has rested on these images, readily interpreted as extravagantly imaginative and wildly detached from any sort of tamely antiquarian and topographical impulses. </p>
<p>	By almost any criteria, traditional opinions about Martin's <title level="m">Avebury</title> may be allowed to stand, insofar as they establish that this drawing and the resulting small print may not be of primary historical interest in relation to his life and career, to landscape imagery in the early nineteenth century, or perhaps even to the history of the illustration of that site. (Recent accounts generally overlook Britton's publication and Martin's drawing in favour of William Stukeley's earlier and more prominent contributions to archaeological scholarship.) But without wanting wilfully to overturn received opinion or attempting to elevate this drawing to an art-historical standing it is unlikely to bear, I am suggesting that Martin's Avebury nonetheless helps illuminate something of the disorderly, "predisciplinary" energies surrounding antiquarian image-making in the early years of the nineteenth century (see Calè and Craciun). These allowed for a closer interaction than we might anticipate—given accepted scholarly wisdom—between commercial self-interest and public virtue, between antiquarianism and modernity, and between art and its others. In particular, we can point to parallel investments (perhaps over-investments) on the parts of Britton and Martin in an apparently paradoxical kind of sublime or imaginative antiquarianism which promised these authors social and financial remuneration. </p>
<p>	The prehistoric site of Avebury had fascinated antiquaries throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Britton's text documented the many, various theories and suggestions that had been made about the remains, maintaining a skeptical view towards all of these. With its panoramic perspective and orderly presentation of both the site and the ancient Britons themselves, Martin's picture reflects the more positive view at that time of primitive British society as essentially benign, decorous, and only vaguely mystical. Sam Smiles in his important survey of Romantic images of ancient Britons identifies this as helping exemplify the "benign image of Druidic worship" which became dominant by the early nineteenth century: 
            <quote>All is decorous and ordered, the vast crowds move forward with the solemn pageantry appropriate for religious ceremonial. It takes little more than a moment's contemplation to note that the success of this image lies in its complete avoidance of any descriptive detail. The figures are on such a minute scale that the rites which accompany this funeral cannot be specified; all we are left with is a vague sense of religiosity conveyed by the disciplined patterns of the celebrants. (<title level="m">Image of Antiquity</title> 86)</quote>
                  The point is especially clear when Martin's image is compared to <ref target="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3434306&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=The+Druid%27s+Sacrifice" rend="new">William Overand Geller's <title level="m">The Druid's Sacrifice</title>
</ref> (1833), paradoxically "almost a caricature of Martin at his most apocalyptic" where Stonehenge is presented as the site of "savage tumult, whipped on by Druid instigation to an emotional climax with the broody, bloody circles" (Smiles, <title level="m">Image</title> 96). </p>
<p>	Britton's interpretation (tentative as it was, as we will see) was that the site was for "sepulchral" rather than "sacrificial" purposes. He did, though, emphatically reject the "<emph>visionary</emph> theories" about the site forwarded most famously by William Stukeley (1687-1765), and most recently by Henry Browne (1769-1839), the model-maker and custodian of Stonehenge. Although Britton took the opportunity to praise Browne's models of Stonehenge and Avebury ("almost faultless") and went so far as to propose a subscription scheme to initiate a museum space to show them (of which more below), he dismissed as merely fanciful his projection of religious or spiritual qualities onto the landscape and the proposal of an antediluvian vintage for the monuments (<title level="m">Beauties of Wiltshire</title>, Vol. 3, 304-5, 305n). But this maneuver is not simply the eschewal of an imaginative or emotional involvement with antiquity in favour of a scientific objectivity which we would associate, definitively, with modern disciplinary stances (of archaeology).  Britton's position is worth laying out in full:
                  <quote>Having thus briefly noticed the opinions and theories of different authors, who have written on this obscure and unauthenticated subject, I would readily offer an opinion of my own, if I could found it on authority—or if I could adduce any thing like historical or demonstrative evidence; but when neither of these can be obtained—when all is vague, dark, and inscrutable—I cannot help regarding it as arrogant to pronounce a decided opinion, or advance an argument with pertinacity. Otherwise, like Stukeley and his partisans, I could easily contend that the monument at Avebury was a dragontium temple—that the figure, form, and involutions of a coiled serpent, were clearly to be traced—that it could not have been formed by any other class of persons than the Druids—that Druidism was the only system of religion in the island one thousand years before Christ—and that in this place Druidical worship was periodically performed, sacrifices made, and pagan rites and ceremonies observed. On these points there is ample scope for argument, or rather animadversion; and certain minds can readily be brought to yield all their credence to such theories. To the hypotheses of Pinkerton and Maculloch it is equally easy to yield assent; for it is equally easy in either to find a certain style of argument, and to assign certain plausible reasons; but neither the one or the other—neither the antediluvian nor the Roman origin—can be proved by the evidence of authentic history, nor yet by logical demonstration. Hence every one may indulge in speculation and conjecture, and every one <emph>amuse himself</emph> in forming theories, which it would be impossible to establish, either by fact or argument. (<title level="m">Beauties</title>, Vol. 3, 305-6) </quote>
                  Britton seems here to be "having his cake and eating it". He runs through the rather enticing, even thrilling, theories of earlier writers, yet dismisses them as mere speculation. In his later <title level="a">Brief Accounts with Illustrations of Ancient Barrows and of the Druidical Temples of Avebury and Stonehenge</title> Britton acknowledged his own early fascination with "These vast, mysterious, and marvellous relics of distant ages," stating of Avenbury that "The mystic halo which enveloped it, tended rather to awaken than repress research" (<title level="m">Autobiography</title>, Vol. 3, 49):
                  <quote>At first, and for many years, I was harassed, and indeed distressed, by the theoretical opinions and visionary speculations of authors, who had written about the Druids and their monuments; and I was often tempted to relinquish the pursuit, in despair of ever arriving at any thing like proof, or rational evidence. . . .The futile theories of Borlase, King, Waltire, Browne, and many others, respecting rock-basins, sacrificial altars, ante-diluvian monuments, and temples for serpent-worship, not only excited doubt and discredit, but also regret that the patience and philosophy of readers should be so taxed and tantalized with the apparent learning and credulity of writers. (<title level="m">Autobiography</title>, Vol. 3, 50)</quote>
                  Britton claims, therefore, "I deemed it advisable to limit myself to matters of fact, to plain descriptions of the monuments as they now appear, with such intimations for their pristine state and purposes, as common sense and reasonable deduction would warrant" (<title level="m">Autobiography</title>, Vol. 3, 50).</p>
<p>	Yet where would we place Martin's design in relation to the "matters of fact" favored by Britton? As far as we can tell his image shows a "sepulchral" use of the site, or at least there are no signs of the sort of crowd agitation and atmospheric frenzy which artists and writers were wont to introduce into their suggestions of "sacrificial" activities.  In fact, as Smiles implies, it is really quite hard to tell what is going on: we are made witness to a placid procession of no evident purpose. And yet, neither is this a bare record of known facts, but a projection of the historical appearance of a site which (as successive antiquarians down to Britton had recorded) had been greatly transformed by time and human interventions. The great procession of of ancient Britons snaking through the scenery is pure speculation, and if it introduces a sense of scale it does so in an unnecessarily elaborate way. And, finally, to judge from the surviving evidence, Britton himself was a perfectly capable artist who had already executed a series of drawings and watercolors of Avebury, one of which provided the source material for Martin. There must have been an expectation that Martin would add something to Britton's design; but it was not accuracy, nor an added level of finish. (Britton's drawing, dated 1815, is considerably more finished and colored). </p>
<p>	Arguably, what Martin brought must be what the pioneering fossil-hunter Gideon Mantell was later to term "magic" when he referred to his engagement of the artist in the task of illustrating his treatise on prehistoric creatures (Mantell, Vol. 1, 369) or what we might, in this context and evoking Britton's own words, call a "mystic halo." His presence, as an artist now well-established in the public imagination as a painter of the extraordinary and sublime, offers a note of extravagance which the relative restraint of the actual image does not mitigate completely. Notwithstanding his rhetorical appeal to "rational evidence," Britton was very ready to go down the route of optical entertainment and explore the potential for what we might now term "Gothic Technologies" (see Miles 2005; Baugh 2007).  Britton's remarkable, tailor-made "Celtic Cabinet" (now housed at Devizes Museum)—which he designed for a collector but later displayed in his own collection—literally showcases watercolors and models, and features "a glazed shade at the top, of four various tints of glass, to display, under so many different effects" replicas of Stonehenge (<title level="m">Autobiography</title>,161; see Chippendale; Evans 151-2). With this piece, Britton invited the viewer to look at a scale replica of "Nature" quite literally through the "stained glass" that Coleridge had perceived as intruding into John Martin's painterly vision (Woodring 1:152). Following up on the suggestion he made in a footnote in Volume III of the <title level="m">Beauties of Wiltshire</title>, Britton went so far as to announce his plans for a Druidical Antiquarian Company:
                  <quote>In the present age of Joint Stock Companies, or stock-jobbing bubbles, we can scarcely use the word, "Company" without exciting suspicion and almost dread. It is employed here merely jocosely, not with a view of continuing it, should the suggestions now offered obtain the sanction of a sufficient number of gentlemen to carry them into effect. It may be proper to remark, that I have meditated on a novel plan for exhibiting models, pictures to be elucidated by lectures. This plan would combine something of the principles of the Cosmorama, Diorama, Panorama, and Eidophusicon; and I am persuaded that a very interesting exhibition might be formed of Celtic or Druidical Antiquities, whereby amusement and instruction might be united and where "fools who came to scoff" would stay and muse. (Britton <title level="a">[Letter]</title> 511)</quote>
                  Perhaps in an earlier age Britton's allusion to "amusement" could readily be taken as referring only to the possibility of private entertainment, a softening of the hard task of intellectual labor undertaken in the library. Elsewhere Britton articulated such a role for illustration and artifact (writing in 1840, by which time the terminology around the discipline of archaeology was taking on its modern meanings): "As the florist and the botanist have their <foreign>hortus siccus</foreign>, to preserve, and renew, to the eye and mind, the forms and hues of flowers and plants, so has the archaeologist his casts, models, drawings, and engravings, of rare and interesting antiquities" (<title level="m">Autobiography</title>, 333). But early nineteenth-century metropolitan culture offered quite another context for antiquarian knowledge, one characterized, as James Chandler and Kevin Gilmartin have recently observed, by "[b]lurred boundaries and conflicting cultural imperatives" (35). </p>
<p>	From the work of historians of science on the Royal Society, particularly Steven Shapin, we are now familiar with the idea that the discourse of scientific scrutiny and validation which became such a force in the intellectual field from the late seventeenth century also marked out the socially-defined boundaries around formal knowledge: the rhetoric of disinterest, universality, and inclusion also disguised social exclusions. But Britton was writing in the context of a rapidly developing urban culture of entertainment, one that undermined previous generations' disciplining and policing of knowledge. Reviewing the third volume of Britton's <title level="m">Beauties</title>, <title level="j">The Monthly Review</title> noted in its description of Avebury that "though a curiosity of unparalleled interest according to the testimony of every antiquary, [it] is little known to the general body of tourists" (<title level="a">Britton's <emph>Beauties</emph>
</title> 258). Britton himself was, or became, conscious of a frank democratization of knowledge that commercialization made possible:
                  <quote>When I commenced my Topographical career, at the end of the last century, it should be remembered, that most of the books I could refer to, or regard as models, were of the class described by Mr [Richard] Gough; and that the great mass of the people were besotted in ignorance and consequent superstition, whilst the highest orders were generally immersed in partizanship and political ambition. The rich kept aloof from and shunned the poor, whilst the latter regarded the former as severe and cruel taskmasters. Hence discord and contention ensued, and hence arose those hatreds and animosities which became manifested in the insurrections and rebellions of America, France and Ireland. Though these national convulsions were terrific and lamentable at their respective epochs, we may derive from them the consolation of knowing and enjoying the enlightenment and amenity of sentiment which belong to the present philosophical age. In the current state of Topography and Archaeology, we witness the effect of this spirit—the progress of mind and sentiment. (<title level="m">Autobiography</title>, Vol. 3, 334) </quote>
        The potential legitimacy and socially transformative value of enjoying historical and architectural speculations as a form of amusement, without the hope of securing absolute scholarly truths, seems key to the way Martin himself expected his art to be appreciated and, accordingly, how he expected to be accepted as an artist of importance. Writing a few years later of his artistic recreations of the lost cities of Nineveh and Babylon, he pointed to a similar belief in the right to poetic license on the part of the painter, which need not, however, lead to sheer visionary invention or simple fancy: 
                  <quote>The mighty cities of Nineveh and Babylon have long since passed away, and, till lately, the traveller hath sought in vain for the spot where their dust reposed. The accounts of their greatness and splendour, handed down to us by the historians, may have been exaggerated; but, where strict truth is not essential, the mind is content to find delight in the contemplation of the grand and the marvellous. Into the solemn obscure of antiquity we look without demanding, or even expecting, the clear day-light of truth. Seen through the mist of ages, the <emph>great</emph> becomes <emph>gigantic</emph>, the <emph>wonderful</emph> swells into the <emph>sublime</emph>, and we do not start back in derision of the mighty shadows. (<title level="m">Fall of Nineveh</title> 5)</quote>
                  Martin thus rehashes a Burkean position on the amplifying effects of temporal and physical distance: a sublime which is old and/or distant may be more readily admired, may be more sublime. Martin's panoramic view of the Avebury landscape, with its primitive architecture stretching back into the limitless distance and its vast multitude in snaking procession conveying a nearly incomprehensible sense of scale, conforms to this free (but not undisciplined) pursuit of the "grand and the marvelous". The sublime thus proves itself as a kind of loop-hole or blind-spot within Romantic-period artistic and historical discourse, allowing for the possibility of an emotional and sensory engagement with the visual which may in turn facilitate social change and commercial advantage. Yet there were, clearly, risks involved here as well, as the critical reception of Martin's work makes most vividly evident.</p>
<p>	Although Martin does not figure in Britton's autobiography, nor was Britton noticed in Martin's considerably more brief autobiographical statement, there is evidence that the two enjoyed a sustained friendship as well as recurring professional links.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">Both were part of a short-lived convivial club, The Pot Luck Club, in London in the early 1820s and had numerous friends in common. In 1837 they were planning to share a coach to a <emph>conversazione</emph>, and as late as 1849 Martin wrote expressing his huge admiration for the "arduous labors, and great success in advancing art and architecture" of the topographer while seeking to acquire plates from him to complete his collection of his works (letters from Martin to Britton, Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections La.II.426 and La.II.648). Britton, meanwhile, once wrote privately: "Of Martin's genius no one ever thought more highly—more devotedly—than myself—I have often written and spoken his praises" (qtd. in Todd  and Balston, f.36).</note> This may only point to an amicable connection and mutual regard in the context of a densely networked community of metropolitan cultural producers. But the social trajectories of the two men also have some close parallels. Both were born in what they themselves termed "humble" circumstances, in locations physically isolated from the centers of literate culture. Martin was born in Haydon Bridge, in Northumbria, in a small cottage, with a father of no fixed occupation, and despite having received some elementary formal education was sent into an apprenticeship as a coachpainter. Britton grew up in "a rude and truly illiterate village . . . I do not recollect that I ever beheld a newspaper before the age of fifteen, nor did I ever hear of a magazine, review, or any book, but a few novels, which my elder sister occasionally obtained from the neighbouring town of Chippenham" (<title level="m">Beauties</title>, Vol. 3, 16). Both, too, had family connections which connected them to the higher echelons of society. Martin's mother descended from landowners, though the family had come down in the world considerably. In Britton's family there was "talk of 'great relations'" and he admitted, intriguingly, that "these vague, undefined, and probably exaggerated stories, excited a little wonder, and some share of vanity" (<title level="m">Beauties</title>, Vol. 3, 14). Both Britton and Martin moved to the metropolis and engaged in a range of activities to make ends meet, bringing both of them into immediate contact with the burgeoning culture of optical entertainment. (Martin worked as a glass painter; Britton at one point helped operate a version of P.J. de Loutherbourg's famous moving-images show, the Eidophusikon.) We may want to account for all this as mere coincidence. But if we follow Ralph O'Connor's full consideration of the social profiles of a network of fossil hunters and geological exhibitors in the early nineteenth century, we might recognize that there were some more widely shared personal experiences and social destinies which must have helped shape their activities. Martin was closely linked professionally and personally with several of the scientific popularizers given as examples by O'Connor, men from unprivileged backgrounds who tended towards "simultaneously cultivating and repudiating 'vulgar' sensationalism," reflecting their desire for commercial success and their (perhaps competing) social and intellectual ambitions. Like the work of these men in publicizing their scientific discoveries, Martin tended to waver between outright sensationalism and a strenuous attention to detail. His paintings and mezzotints may often be big and spectacular, but he went to great lengths to tell viewers that they were based on a close reading of historical, geographical, and poetic source materials in the illustrated pamphlets he issued to accompany these works. As O'Connor has discussed at length, Martin's pamphlets deserve to be treated as complex documents in their own right, drawing together scholarly, poetic, and imaginative materials and in so doing articulating an unsteady fusion of entertainment, commercialism, and didacticism. O'Connor's account alerts us to the way that while the images may seem to amount to a sort of instantaneously satisfying spectacle, the accompanying texts direct us to take our time, to consider, reflect, and even study, thus articulating a decided tension between sensationalism and intellectual seriousness. </p>
<p>	One of O'Connor's examples is William Bullock, whose Egyptian Hall was the premier or at least the most prominent museum space in the early nineteenth century, where "edification was inseparable from theatricality" (37-8). Which brings us to <ref target="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/martin-the-destruction-of-pompei-and-herculaneum-n00793" rend="new">Martin's <title level="m">Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</title>
</ref>, first exhibited as the centerpiece of his one-man show at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London, which opened with a private viewing at the end of March 1822 and remained open until the end of July. While the drawing of <title level="m">Avebury</title> is a topographical design for an antiquarian publication which has a certain sublime enhancement, <title level="m">The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</title> is very obviously a sublime entertainment which, nonetheless, participates in a topographical and antiquarian viewing dynamic.</p>
<p>	The Egyptian Hall had previously been the venue for a series of successful art exhibitions focused on spectacular works, such as Haydon's <title level="m">Christ's Triumphant Entry into Jerusalem</title>, shown in 1820, Théodore Gericault's <title level="m">The Raft of the Medusa</title> in 1820 and James Ward's vast allegory of Waterloo in 1821. Martin's show ran alongside a program of varied entertainments, including an exhibition on Lapland featuring actual Laplanders in full costume with a sleigh and live reindeer, before a panoramic backdrop (January 15-April 4), the annual exhibition of the Society of Painters in Watercolour (April 23-June 29), <title level="a">The Terror of India</title>, featuring a gigantic snake and other terrifying animals (from late July), and the <title level="a">African Museum of Natural History</title> (from October) (see Costeloe). The exhibition was accompanied by a 31-page pamphlet, which was dominated by a lengthy description of the painting (No.1 in the catalogue and taking up 25 pages) and a line etching providing a key to the important people and buildings in the cities and itemizing some thirty-two geographical, figural, and architectural points of interest ("The Villa Suburbina . . . Granary wherein were found measures with false bottoms . . . The Gate of Nola . . .  Pliny embracing his friend Pomponianus . . . The Sea agitated by the earthquake, and retiring..."). The other twenty-four catalogued items were paintings and drawings also by Martin.  These included some of the small topographical paintings and watercolors from earlier in his career; the large <title level="m">Fall of Babylon</title>, which was illustrated in an etched key with a briefer note of "Historical Accounts" "strictly attended to" in producing the painting and, as No. 26 <title level="a">Plan of the Country, shewing the situation of the Cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum; also the portion of the country included in the picture No. 1</title> (<title level="m">Pompeii</title>).  Martin was able to refer to Edwin Atherstone's recent poem on the theme, and to Sir William Gell's and Joseph Gandy's scholarly work <title level="m">Pompeiana</title> (1817–19) to elucidate his presentation of the disaster. He was particularly at pains to insist upon the correct "scale of proportion" he had applied in representing the scene from the elevated position of Stabiae, and appears to have included as part of the exhibition, besides the map listed as No. 26, further supporting topographical, cartographical, and antiquarian materials for visitors to consult: 
         <quote>The elevation of the foreground, in which the principal figures are seen, is three hundred and forty-eight feet above the level of the sea; an elevation, according to the statement of the most intelligent travellers, more than sufficient to enable the spectator to take into view every city, within the angle of vision represented in this picture.</quote>
<quote>For further explanation of this part, the reader is referred to the maps and plans which are in the exhibition room; and which shew the attention that has been given to place every known object in its true situation, according to the best authorities. (<title level="m">Pompeii</title>, 24)</quote>
                  
            A correspondent in the <title level="j">Literary Gazette</title>, who had criticisms about the painting itself, noted that "Diagrams carefully drawn, and laid down on the table, opposite the picture, may lead to the understanding of it in a geographical point of view" (April 27, 1822).
         </p>
<p>
            The painting was promoted in advertisements as "the most extraordinary production of the pencil that has ever appeared in this or any other country" (<title level="j">Morning Chronicle</title>, March 29, 1822). The fact that Martin chose to make the painting the centerpiece of an exhibition that followed immediately after the huge popular successes of <title level="m">Joshua</title> and <title level="m">Belshazzar's Feast</title> is in itself telling, of course. Other commentators were hardly less enthusiastic in their praise. <title level="m">Ackermann's Repository</title> claimed that:
            
         <quote>It is a powerful address to the imagination, and upon a subject which enabled the artist to indulge the full latitude of his conceptions. The blue lightening has a vigorous effect, and saves the picture from the absolute tyranny of a scarlet tone.  The horror of the scene is much increased by the destruction of shipping from the receding and agitation of the sea.  The total helplessness of man is shown in the various and ineffectual efforts of human beings vainly endeavouring to escape from the general calamity.  Mr. Martin has adhered to the historian's record of the catastrophe, which realised all the horror which the most vivid fancy could paint. (301)</quote>
            
            The <title level="j">Examiner</title> (April 7, 1822) acknowledged some faults with the painting, but proposed that "the work is more complete than any previously painted by this Artist." </p>
<p>	In many ways John Martin's <title level="m">Avebury</title> and <title level="m">Destruction of Pompeii and Hercualenuem</title> occupy separate ends of a spectrum of landscape imagery. <title level="m">Avebury</title> is a relatively modestly-sized graphic work, attending to the archaeological record in its presentation of a "benign" landscape scene and destined for the relatively rarefied context of antiquarian research, albeit as it was transforming into "tourism" as we might now understand it. <title level="m">The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</title> sits at the most extravagant and outlandish end of imaginative landscape painting, with its catastrophic theme, emphatic coloring, and display of the sublime so over-emphatic it exceeded the bounds of acceptable taste (and moved, as many contemporary critics complained, beyond the realm of painting into the phantasmagorical). If traditional criteria were crudely applied, we would have a vivid illustration of the poles of mere topography or "map work" and imaginative landscape. But both works unsettle that opposition. <title level="m">Avebury</title> is a work of imagination, making visible the "mystic halo" surrounding the site that drew Britton into his researches, even as he struggled with his skepticism and towards rationalism. <title level="m">Pompeii and Herculaneum</title> is also a work of "the historian's record" in which the specificities of geography are evoked, even as the viewer may be overawed or even inspired to spiritual reflection. Both may cast light on what Iain McCalman has recently characterized as a "tension between the odious popularity of commercial reenactment and the respectable austerity of academic art" in the urban entertainments of the Romantic era (214). </p>
<p>	My point is that, even as the opposition of topographical and antiquarian imagery to "art" was confirmed in the early nineteenth century, the possibilities for a much more productive confusion of categories was being actively entertained, for personal, professional, and commercial reasons, with the sublime providing a means for legitimizing such departures.  If we revisit Fuseli's famously decisive comments on landscape and "map work" we can note that he in fact counts landscape among "negative subjects" which "owe what they can be to the Genius of the artist" (Baumgarten 127), a point which would have been made more emphatically in passages deleted from the original manuscript:
                  <quote>Our own school in this very branch has embodied scenes of nature so novel, real combinations so original or charming with so much taste equal Judgement &amp; powers of execution, that the transcript vanishes in the choice of Genius. Such is the display of oriental grandeur in ruins or still subsisting, such as the aweful scenery of Wales &amp; the romantic windings of our rivers . . . There are scenes of Nature in themselves so novel, with features so original, charming &amp; astonishing; real combinations so curious &amp; unusual, that nothing but a judicious Transcript is wanted, to impress us with all the effects of Genius. (qtd. in Baumgarten I.141-142nn)</quote>
                  There can be no reasonable doubt that Fuseli's identification of topography as a "kind of map work" was rightly interpreted at the time and latterly as suggesting a strongly hierarchical distinction between descriptive and imaginative landscape painting, to the extent that John Britton, no less, went into print (with the encouragement of J.M.W. Turner) to refute Fuseli's allegations against "representations of particular scenes" (from <title level="m">Fine Arts of the English School</title>, 1812; quoted and discussed in Smiles, <title level="m">Eye Witness</title>, 64-5). Nonetheless, the drafting of this passage at least makes room for a more nuanced position, one which would help explain Fuseli's known admiration of Turner, the artist who perhaps more than any other would exemplify the possibility that the recording of nature could also be sublime. Even with a critic as apparently stringent as Fuseli, topographical and imaginative landscape edge towards each other and blur together, most especially with regard to the antiquarian topics which could be read as sublime ("oriental grandeur in ruins . . . the aweful scenery of Wales"). </p>
<p>	Reconsidering Fuseli's comments, alongside Martin's images, may help lead us back into a richer understanding of the place of antiquarian imagery in the early nineteenth century, and beyond the art history of landscape into a consideration of the much more untidy and confusing historical genesis of <emph>heritage</emph>. From that perspective, the mobilization after the 1760s of the sublime as a conceptual framework demanding unreliable, unpredictably subjective reflections on sites, sights, and history may appear not (or not only) as a key moment in the emergence of a heroically dignified landscape art, but also as a challenge to the historical ascent of those disciplinary norms which would segregate the scientific from the imaginative, entertainment from scholarship. Such extravagant topography or bombastic antiquarianism as is evident in Martin's images under consideration here puts up obstacles to our sense of the "progress" of art and of knowledge in the early nineteenth century. Reflecting particularly on the history of the representation and interpretation of Avebury, David C. Harvey comments on "[s]mall heritages" and "the inevitable open-endedness of the everyday 'pieces' and 'performances' of heritage, which it is impossible to date or categorize—the ordinary, conscious and unconscious elaboration and repetition of cultural memory that has both history and prehistory, but which has no beginning or end" (33).  This might also lead us to emphasize the enduring interplay between scientific and imaginative antiquarianism. We could, then, trace a continuity between Britton's acknowledgement of "The mystic halo which enveloped it, tended rather to awaken than repress research," and Smiles's note, in his study of the image of British antiquity in Romanticism, that: 
            <quote>While investigating second hand book shops for various tomes relevant to this project it was not unusual to find serious studies such as Stuart Piggott's <title level="m">The Druids</title> (1968) and AL Owen's <title level="m">The Famous Druids</title> (1962) shelved under "occult" rather than "archaeology" or similarly sober classifications. Was this a bookseller's attempt to subvert the Druidic lunatic fringe by infiltrating works that debunked the romantic image, or was it an ironic indication that, where Druids are concerned, archaeology was subordinate to a more whimsical approach? (75)</quote>
            
            Thus, too, Harvey's highlighting of the "extreme 'relativism'" at play around Avebury as a physical site, with "the 'official' heritage story . . . competing with New Age interpretations of the site: the heritage of ley lines, mystical occurrences and spiritual healing." Such stark juxtapositions between the legitimate and the eccentric may be read only as the signs of confusion, or of a discipline in crisis, the decline of scientific knowledge, or some such. But the commercially-oriented antiquarianism of the early nineteenth century anticipated these juxtapositions and provided individuals like John Martin and John Britton—equally from barely lettered, economically vulnerable backgrounds—a route in and through metropolitan literary and artistic culture. At precisely those points where both landscape art and antiquarianism seem to be compromised, eccentric, or marginal—in the romantic enhancement of Avebury's image, or in the topographical specificity which is mobilized in support to a scene of outrageous blockbuster disaster directed towards a commercialised market for art—we might also discover opportunities for individual engagement and commercial exploitation which gave shape to a modern understanding of history. </p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">This article explores problematic relation between the local, the national, and the international in antiquarianism through a focus on the issue of place in antiquarian writings. It looks specifically at the argument that literature can best be understood in its original place of composition as articulated in the writings of Robert Wood. By shifting emphasis from Wood’s later writing on Homer to his first published work, <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> (1753), the article suggests that Wood is not a late entrant but an early contributor to the "media environment" of the mid-eighteenth century, an environment characterized by the belief that poetry originates in an early stage of society, that it is composed orally, that it expresses the local particularity of landscapes and national or tribal culture, and that it can properly be traced and recovered by ethnographic, first-hand engagement with its place of origin. That Wood's theory of ancient poetry echoes (and perhaps anticipates) the later work of Percy, Ritson, Scott and others underscores not the separation but the proximity and overlapping concerns of popular antiquarianism with other varieties of antiquarianism less invested in the particular traditions of the British Isles. Ultimately, the article raises the possibility that classical antiquarianism broadly understood, including its varieties more attuned to classical and not national cultures, could also bolster the creation of national literatures that we associate with Romanticism.</p>

<p>When scholars of British Romantic literature talk about antiquarianism, they generally refer to what Marilyn Butler describes as popular antiquarianism, "the study of British national culture: of English, Welsh, Gaelic, and Irish as vernacular languages, and of their oral as well as their written traditions" (328). For Butler the word "popular" firmly distinguishes the content of such antiquarianism from "classical, religious, and orientalist learning" (328). Similarly, Susan Manning suggests that "Neither academic nor metropolitan in origin, antiquarian activities were characteristically locale- and region-based" (46) and worked to solidify "a regionally based sense of cultural continuity" (47). And when Katie Trumpener argues that "English literature, so-called, constitutes itself in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries through the systematic imitation, appropriation, and political neutralization of antiquarian and nationalist literary developments in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales" (xi), it is largely such popular antiquarianism that she has in mind.</p>
<p>But antiquarianism broadly understood, including its varieties more attuned to classical and not national cultures, could, perhaps paradoxically, also bolster the creation of national literatures that we associate with Romanticism. Walter Scott, for example, suggested that Homer served what he called the "national muse" (7). Similarly, Anne Janowitz invokes the non-native landscape of John Dyer's <title level="m">The Ruins of Rome</title> (1740) to support her argument that "The ruin provides an historical provenance for the conception of the British nation as immemorially ancient," ratified by "a conflated representation of Britain as nature's inevitable product" (4). Building from Janowitz's insight, this essay takes up the problematic relation between the local, the national, and the international in antiquarianism through a focus on the issue of place in antiquarian writings. It looks specifically at the argument that literature can best be understood in its original place of composition. </p>
<p>Such a claim partakes in antiquarian debates about the meaning and location of culture and of poetry's place within culture, debates associated with Ossian and, especially, Homer that turn around what we now call orality and the status of oral poetics in relationship to cultural progress. Recent scholars, notably Maureen McLane and Laura Slatkin, have argued that these debates reflect "increased sensitivity to the historicity of poetry's several media" (703) and hence ground a "Historical Media Poetics" whose sophisticated arguments about the status of media like orality, writing, and print might also help us to reflect on our own media-saturated present.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
            On this point, see also McDowell, who argues that "Literary texts are a valuable—if notoriously tricky—register of contemporary awareness of media shift" (233).</note> In this way, antiquarian discourses become increasingly relevant to contemporary media theory. My argument here reflects these concerns but seeks less to articulate a Foucauldian archaeology of discourse and more specifically to unpack the conjunction between arguments for place and arguments for orality, both of which utilize ethnographic and experiential strategies. The focus will be on the work of Robert Wood, who makes one of the more prominent eighteenth-century arguments for Homer's orality. Wood has commonly been understood as part of a major reevaluation of Homer's poetry, what Paula McDowell describes as "a shift from a neoclassical approach, emphasizing what was universal and timeless, to a new interest in the specific historical circumstances affecting the production of works of art" (239). Such an approach grounds Wood's claim that "Homer could neither read nor write" (<title level="m">Homer</title> 248), an argument that has lately proven important for recent scholars interested in the history of orality and ideas of media shift. As a result, interest in Wood has largely focused on his last work, <title level="m">An Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer,</title> published in 1775 but circulated privately in 1767 and 1769. </p>
<p>My suggestion here, however, is that the groundwork and methodological approach for Wood's Homeric scholarship is more or less in place in his first published work, <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> (1753), in which Wood offers an account of literary interpretation emphasizing the relationship of literature to the place in which it was produced, what I am calling the situatedness of literature. The shift in emphasis has two significant implications for our understanding of antiquarianism. First, it means that Wood is not a late entrant but an early contributor to what McLane and Slatkin call the "media environment" of the mid-eighteenth century, an environment characterized by the belief that poetry originates in an early stage of society, that it is composed orally, that it expresses the local particularity of landscapes and national or tribal culture, and that it can properly be traced and recovered by ethnographic, first-hand engagement with its place of origin.  That Wood's theory of ancient poetry echoes (and perhaps anticipates) the later work of Thomas Percy, Joseph Ritson, Scott and others underscores not the separation but the proximity and overlapping concerns of popular antiquarianism with other varieties of antiquarianism less invested in the particular traditions of the British isles, with the important distinction, however, that Wood is less interested in orality per se and more in the material remains and landscapes of antiquity. </p>
<p>Second, the tendency of scholarly interest to focus on Wood's later Homeric scholarship at the expense of his earlier work on Palmyra suggests something about the difficulty and occasional opacity of much antiquarian publication. While the very title of <title level="m">An Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer</title> makes its subject plain,<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">Acknowledging, of course, the irony that a work making such strong case for Homer's <emph>lack</emph> of writing should have "Writings" yolked into its title by a posthumous editor.
            </note>
<title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title>, in contrast, is a hybrid volume, one that combines its interest in the ruins with an unusual generic mix of travel narrative, specimen book, archaeological record, reproduction of inscriptions, and treatise on how to read classical literature. The prominence of its measured engravings and the relative absence of Palmyra from the classical archive often work to displace interest in the work's prefatory material and hence to obscure the strong claims being made for its method of literary interpretation. This hybrid, I would suggest, is what makes <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> so contiguous with other antiquarian works and what often causes them to be neglected by scholars seeking a more straightforward or traditional genealogy for the sort of disciplinary inquiry that begins to emerge in the later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century, as Penelope Wilson has argued, "saw a steady growth in historical, topographical, and antiquarian interest in the ancient world" (272). At the very start of the century, for example, Joseph Addison prepared for his Italian travels by swotting up on classical authors that might be relevant for his journey. As he explains in the preface  to his <title level="m">Remarks on Several Parts of Italy, &amp;c. in the Years, 1701, 1702, 1703</title>, Addison took care <quote>particularly to consider the Several Passages of the Ancient Poets which have any relation to the Places or Curiosities that I met with; For before I entered on my Voyage I took care to refresh my Memory among Classic Authors, and to make such Collections out of them as I might afterwards have Occasion for. I must confess it was not one of the least Entertainments that I met with in Travelling, to examine these several Descriptions, as it were upon the Spot, and to compare the Natural Face of the Country with the Landskips that the Poets have given us of it. (n.p.)</quote>
                  In the travel narrative that follows the preface, Addison carefully notes correlations between ancient place names and modern variants, and he repeatedly cites classical authors to augment his own descriptions of Italian landscapes. His work shows how what was in the seventeenth century a largely text-based classical curriculum began to accommodate topographical experience as a helpful guide to the understanding of classical authors.  </p>
<p>What was for Addison in the early eighteenth century an invitation to consider classical texts "upon the spot" had become by the mid-eighteenth century an imperative for others. In his first published work, a series of folio engravings of the ancient city of Palmyra printed in 1753, Robert Wood insists that ancient texts can be better understood in the landscapes that produced them. As he puts it in <title level="a">Letter from the Publisher to the Reader,</title>,  "The life of Miltiades or Leonidas could never be read with so much pleasure, as on the plains of Marathon or at the streights of Thermopylae; the Iliad has new beauties on the banks of the Scamander, and the Odyssey is most pleasing in the countries where Ulysses traveled and Homer sung" (<title level="m">Palmyra</title> n. p.). If Addison took pleasure in comparing ancient descriptions with modern views, Wood's claim is much stronger, for he insists that the full aesthetic appreciation of classical texts, their capacity to deliver pleasure and "new beauties," can only be fully apprehended through what we might call first-hand, eyewitness experience. In such an account the proper understanding of ancient texts can only be arrived at by interpretive methods that are more than philological.  This theory of literary interpretation emphasizes the geographical situatedness of literature and the shaping influence of place, insisting upon travel as a means of achieving proper textual understanding. In her gloss on this theory, Trumpener links Wood's emphasis on the situatedness of literature to the "continuing touristic interest of literary sites" (78), and she further characterizes Wood as inaugurating "a new mode of literary tourism" (103). My suggestion, in contrast, is that Wood's argument introduces more than literary tourism and, furthermore, that his insistence on the situatedness of literature is part of a sophisticated interpretive methodology that emphasizes the specific historical circumstances—topographical and otherwise—that produce works of art. </p>
<p>Wood was a British traveler, politician, and member of the Society of Dilettanti who made two prolonged journeys through the Mediterranean world in the 1740s and 1750s. These travels resulted in three publications: <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title>, in 1753; <title level="m">The Ruins of Balbec</title>, in 1757; and, finally and most famously, the posthumous <title level="m">An Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer</title>, in 1775, where Wood claimed that Homer was an oral poet who could neither read nor write. Today, if Wood is remembered at all, it is largely for this idea of Homer's orality, a view marked by skepticism toward the received wisdom about Homer that places Wood in an interpretive tradition running from, say, Giambattista Vico to Friedrich August Wolf and beyond.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">For recent arguments about Wood and orality, see McLane and Slatkin; McDowell; Sachs.
               </note> While literary tourism may have been the result of Wood's work, the source of his claim for the importance of place—a hybrid volume devoted to a site that has only a minimal presence in ancient literature—is curious. What are we to make of this figure whom we associate with Greece and with Homer, who made his reputation with a publication showing the ruins of a Roman province in the middle of a desert? How can we make any connections between Wood's interest in Homer and the Greeks and a specimen book showcasing the architecture of late Imperial Rome? And, finally, what might these questions tell us about eighteenth-century antiquarianism and its relevance for Romanticism?</p>
<p>I should emphasize from the outset that this essay does not necessarily answer all of these questions. Posing them, however, reflects the frustrations of a literary scholar trained to make certain kinds of arguments in response to certain genres of texts yet when confronted with a work that doesn't in any way conform to these generic models; and this problem, further, underscores some of the general difficulties inherent in reading antiquarian texts. Like so many other antiquarian works, <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> is a hybrid text. It joins a series of more or less familiar genres into an unlikely generic mix—in this case travel narrative, specimen book, archaeological record, and treatise on how to read classical literature. Reading Wood's writing, one is tempted to make concrete arguments: Wood was a conjectural historian, Wood was a literary scholar obsessed with mimesis, Wood was the bold innovator of historicist methodologies for literary studies, and so on. Such claims would be vastly overstated, and they only make sense, furthermore, if we think of <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> as the coherent and unified work of a single author. But it is a fundamentally different kind of text, one that bears Wood's name as its author, but one that, like many other antiquarian texts, actually represents a diverse and sometimes competing series of agendas. These conflicting tendencies can make it difficult to recognize that the volume contains a sophisticated theory of poetic interpretation, one that pushes away from privileging an autonomous aesthetic in favor of a range of interests including the aesthetic but also encompassing the type of historical, cultural, patriotic, and philosophical values that we now recognize in antiquarian works.  Given this fact, in order to understand more fully Wood's emphasis on the need to experience classical literature in its place of composition—and the role of this claim within both <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> and Wood's larger, lifelong obsession with Homer—we need to think about the connection between Wood's insistence on the situatedness of literature and his far-ranging travels in the Mediterranean region from 1749-1751. </p>
<p>Wood first visited Greece in the 1740s when he traveled among the Agean islands and also to Syria and Egypt. 
               <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">
                  For information on Wood's life, I am indebted to Spencer and Constantine. Special thanks also to Paul Jackson, librarian at the Institute for Classical Studies in London, for allowing me access to the Wood papers there.
               </note> Some time after this, he settled in Rome, where he met the young and wealthy James Dawkins and the dilettante John Bouverie.  While walking from Rome to Naples to see classical ruins there, the three set upon the idea of exploring antiquities in the Mediterranean region. This, the voyage that made Wood's reputation, began in 1749 when, accompanied by Dawkins, Bouverie, and the Italian engraver/sculptor Giovanni Borra, Wood set out from Naples for the Troade. Though the men traveled together, each cultivated his own distinct interests, and this more than anything helps to explain many of the hybrid qualities of the publications that followed the voyage.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">
                  Dawkins focused on natural history, including fauna, flora, etc.; Bouverie observed monuments; while Wood's primary interest was in the topography of the sites visited and their inscriptions.</note> In both <title level="m">Palmyra</title> and <title level="m">Balbec,</title> Wood, like Addison before him, compares the statements of ancient geographers and modern travelers with the physical conditions as he found  them.</p>
<p>Travel in the East was certainly difficult, but because of the resources possessed by the travellers, the voyage has been described as a "scholar's dream" (Spencer 75). THE MEN had every feasible convenience including their own 160-ton ship, the SS <title level="m">Matilda</title>. Wood notes that this boat "brought from London a library, consisting chiefly of all the Greek historians and poets, some books of antiquities, and the best voyage writers..." (<title level="m">Palmyra,</title>
<title level="a">Publisher to Reader,</title> n.p.).  Again, we should note the particular emphasis on the Greeks, and not the Romans, even though the group chose to publish first on a Roman site. Their travels were certainly comprehensive, and in Wood's description, "We visited most of the islands of the Archipelago, part of Greece in Europe; the Asiatic and European coasts of the Hellespont, Propontis, and Bosphorus, as far as the Black Sea, most of the inland parts of Asia Minor, Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine, and Egypt" (<title level="m">Palmyra</title>, <title level="a">Publisher to Reader,</title> n.p.). In order to get to Palmyra and Balbec, which were at the time under the control of the Turkish empire, the men essentially had to hire a private army from the Aga of Hassia, "an escort of the Aga's best Arab horsemen, armed with guns and long pikes" (<title level="m">Palmyra</title> 33). It must have been a grand procession, and Wood later suggests that their caravan numbered two hunderd men with as many beasts for travel. After visiting Palmyra and Balbec, the the crew—minus Bouverie, who had died earlier in the tour—set out for Athens in May of 1751. There they assisted James Stuart and Nicholas Revett on the project which would become the <title level="m">Antiquities of Athens</title> (1762). </p>
<p>Following the tour, Wood returned home to prepare his two great folios, <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> (1753) and <title level="m">The Ruins of Balbec</title> (1757). After once more returning to the Continent as the tutor to the Duke of Bridgewater, Wood was given a position in public affairs when the reputation established by the Palmyra volume led William Pitt the Elder to make Wood Under-Secretary of State in 1756. Wood subsequently held various appointments through several changes in government and was a Member of Parliament from March 1761 until his death. The irony of Wood's being called to public service is that it left him little time to continue with his classical labors, his professed design to describe the insights gained from reading the <title level="m">Iliad</title> and the <title level="m">Odyssey</title> in the lands in which Homer wrote, and to produce a geographical description that mapped the ancient and present state of the Troade. A rough sketch of this work was proposed initially in a letter to the ailing Dawkins, likely written in 1755 when Wood was in Rome with Bridgewater; seven copies of this letter were privately printed in 1767, an enlarged an anonymous edition appeared in 1769, and, after Wood's death in 1771, the whole scheme was eventually edited by Jacob Bryant and published as <title level="m">An Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer</title> in 1775. </p>
<p>This brief chronology suggests that though ultimately published much later, Wood's theory of Homer was clearly developed in connection with the travel that resulted in the Palmyra publication, and needs to be seen as part and parcel of the same project. Wood's theory of how to read classical literature and his emphasis on its place of composition, in other words, begins with <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> and is later developed as  a sustained argument about Homer. The connection, however, is easy to overlook because <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> presents itself not as a theory of textual analysis but rather as a visual record of the material remains of antiquity, and a tension between text and image marks the presentation of the Palmyra volume and the interplay between its textual apparatus and the visual material that it frames.</p>
<p>
<title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title>, Wood's first published work and the tangible result of his Mediterranean tour, is an enormous volume that blends the verbal and the visual. It consists of an introductory <title level="a">Letter from the Publisher to the Reader,</title> followed by <title level="a">An Enquiry into the Ancient State of Palmyra,</title> a description of its present state, reproductions of and commentary on a number of inscriptions that the group found in and around Palmyra, and a brief description of the journey through the desert. In all, there are roughly 50 pages of text that precede a lavish set of fifty-seven measured engravings. </p>
<p>Looking at the Palmyra volume as a book and as a material object, the most immediately obvious fact is the prominence given to its engravings. <title level="m">Palmyra</title> seems first and foremost an architectural specimen book, and Wood emphasizes that "Architecture took up our chief attention" (<title level="m">Palmyra</title>, <title level="a">Publisher to the Reader,</title> n.p.). The large size and precise details of the plates tower over the prefatory material, and seem further distinguished by their careful reproduction of the scale, proportions, and setting of the ancient buildings.  As Wood explains, 
                  <quote>All lovers of [architecture] must be sensible that the measures of the antient buildings of Rome, by Monsieur Desgodetz, have been of the greatest use: We imagined that by attempting to follow the same method in those countries where architecture had its origin, or at least arrived at the highest degree of perfection it has ever attained, we might do service.</quote>
                  While most of the plates present measured drawings of Palmyra's architectural remains, the first image is most striking: a view from the north-east of the ruined city of Palmyra as it appeared to Wood in 1751, the plate folds out to the width of three elephant folio sheets (22 inches by 15 inches per sheet, or nearly 2 feet by 4 feet when fully extended).</p>

</figure>
<p>This kind of detailed engraving marks the volume's strong affiliation with the first generation of antiquarian plate books in the 1750s. This was the decade that included not only both of Wood's volumes, but also new work from France including Caylus's <title level="m">Recueil des Antiquités</title> (1752) and Leroy's engravings of Greece (1758); the first publication of Piranesi's <title level="m">Antichità Romane</title> (1756); and the original "grant proposal" that led to Stuart and Revett's <title level="m">Antiquities of Athens</title>. A self-consciously visual approach to antiquity distinguished these new antiquaries from their predecessors. While images had always been an integral part of the study of antiquity, these sophisticated engravings, along with the training provided by academies of art, gave a new impetus to the visual tradition.

               </note>
                  The clear place of <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> in this tradition of antiquarian plate books and the emphasis it places on the visual record of Palmyra is one reason why it is easy to overlook Wood's theory of reading. </p>
<p>A second reason is the inherent contradiction between a theory of reading that emphasizes place and a volume on an archaeological site that figures only minimally in the classical record. The quotation from Pliny's <title level="m">Natural History</title> that runs along the bottom of Plate One indicates that Palmyra is not entirely absent from classical literature, but the authors and historical events discussed in Wood's opening section on <title level="a">The Antient State of Palmyra</title> make clear that Palmyra is hardly the place one would go to learn what is to be gained from reading classical authors <foreign>in situ</foreign>. Furthermore, Wood's theory of culture (and his understanding of the relationship between works of art and the historical circumstances that produced them) is scattered throughout the numerous sections of prefatory material.  Nonetheless, <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title>—with its emphasis on the link between works of art and the historical circumstances of their production, with its insistence on the importance of eyewitness observation, and with its account of the engagement with Bedouin oral culture—contains the basis for Wood's theory of Homer.</p>
<p>The fundamental contribution to literary interpretation made by <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> is the suggestion that one needs to visit the remains of classical civilizations if one is ever to understand the writings they inspired. As Wood explains: 
                  <quote>Circumstances of climate and situation, otherwise trivial, become interesting from that connection with great men, and great actions, which history and poetry have given them. The life of Miltiades or Leonidas could never be read with so much pleasure, as on the plains of Marathon or at the streights of Thermopylae; the Iliad has new beauties on the banks of the Scamander, and the Odyssey is most pleasing in the countries where Ulysses travelled and Homer sung. [<title level="m">Palmyra</title>, <title level="a">Publisher to Reader,</title> n.p.]</quote>
                  This theory not only makes tourism a prerequisite for the appreciation of classical texts, but it also signifies a fundamental move away from neoclassical orthodoxies because it focuses our attention not on what is timeless about the classics, but on what is particular about them. Accordingly it encourages us to value classical authors for the mimetic faithfulness of their writing to the manners and conditions of their specific time and place (Constantine 66-84). Moreover, recognizing the link between the work of art and the geographical context that inspired it requires eyewitness experience; therefore, such a connection can only be appreciated by one who has visited the places described. In a comment that hints at a contradiction in this justification of his publication project, Wood elaborates:
                  <quote>The particular pleasure, it is true, which an imagination warmed upon the spot receives from those scenes of heroick actions, the traveller can only feel, nor is it to be communicated by description. But classical ground not only makes us always relish the poet, or historian more, but sometimes helps us to understand them better. Where we thought the present state of the country was the best comment on an antient author, we made our draftsman take a view, or make a plan of it. This sort of entertainment we extended to poetical geography, and spent a fortnight with great pleasure, in making a map of the Scamandrian plain, with Homer in our hands. [<title level="m">Palmyra</title>, <title level="a">Publisher to Reader,</title> n.p.]</quote>
                  In part the issue here is that Wood's reveling in poetical geography seems confined to the region associated with Homer and therefore to have little connection to the claims of the Palmyra volume itself. But there is also, when Wood notes that the pleasure experienced by the traveler is not "to be communicated by description," an allusion to a more fundamental problem, for one might legitimately question the purpose of a set of engravings that must by definition fail to capture the essential experience of place. The language of the passage, however, with its distinction between relishing and understanding literature, suggests a potential solution. To relish a poet or a historian has its linguistic origins in sensual experiences of scent and taste and implies an act of both sensual flavor and artistic appreciation, of combined physical and aesthetic pleasures.  As <title level="m">The Plan of an Academy for the better Cultivation, Improvement and Encouragement of Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, and the Arts of Design</title> (1755) puts it, "the more Attention we bestow upon the Arts, and the quicker Relish we acquire for them, the more enlarged the Province of Pleasure becomes" (v); similarly, in James Miller's comedy <title level="m">The Man of Taste</title> (1736), Maria tells her cousin Dorthea, "People of Taste and Sensibility have a higher Relish for Life" (18). Relish is a term of connoisseurship and applies to the active appreciation of material objects. A more philosophical concept like understanding, in contrast, might serve more sedentary, bookish readers. <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> attempts to accommodate both. </p>
<p>In the <title level="a">Journey through the Desart</title> [sic], for example, Wood describes the wonder of first approaching Palmyra:          
                  <quote>the hills opening discovered to us, all at once, the greatest quantity of ruins we had ever seen, all of white marble, and beyond them towards the Euphrates a flat waste, as far as the eye could reach, without any object that shewed either life or motion. It is scarce possible to imagine any thing more striking than this view: So great a number of Corinthian pillars, mixed with so little wall or solid building, afforded a most romantic variety of prospect. But the following plate will convey a juster idea of it than any description. (35)</quote>
         The distinction Wood makes here between the image represented on the plate and his "description" suggests that he means to limit description to the verbal account of an image. Such a distinction further implies that earlier, when Wood indicated the particular pleasure of classical scenes for "an imagination warmed upon the spot" and claimed that they could not be "communicated by description," he left open the possibility that sophisticated engravings, executed to a measured scale and proper perspective, might be able to convey a sense of place in the way that verbal description could not. And if this is the case, then Wood seeks to provide the users of the Palmyra volume with the experience of both relish and understanding through the book's combination of text and image. As the passage above indicates, the opening plate is meant to recapture for its viewers the astonishment at coming upon such a relatively undisturbed display of desert ruins. </p>
<p>This seems precisely the allure of Palmyra. Because its ruins have not been built over or repurposed (except insofar as the Bedouins had, at the time of Wood's visit, "about thirty [huts] in the court of the great temple" [37]), they lacked stratigraphy. As Wood notes, 
         <quote>It is the natural and common fate of cities to have their memory longer preserved than their ruins. Troy, Babylon, and Memphis are now known only from books, while there is not a stone left to mark their situation. But here we have two instances of considerable towns out-living any account of them. Our curiosity about these places is rather raised by what we <emph>see</emph> than what we read, and Balbeck and Palmyra are in a great measure left to tell their own story. (1, emphasis in original) </quote>
         The passage shows that Balbec and Palmyra are distinguished by the fullness of their material remains and their relative lack of presence in the written classical record. They are material and visual sites, places, as Wood notes, that we <emph>see</emph> rather than read about. The very absence of Palmyra and Balbec from the classical record, in other words,  is what attracts Wood and his travel companions to the site, and the lack of any substantial writing about the two towns means that material and physical ruins provide the predominant means to understand each site. But to publish a volume on each place puts them in the record. With their accurate measured engravings of Palmyra and Balbec, Wood and Dawkins become the preservers of the memory of antiquity. Their work makes Palmyra and Balbec timeless. </p>
<p>Moreover, since the plates create an imaginative experience for their viewer that replicates, or at least approximates, the physical experience of going to the site, they allow their viewers, according to Wood, to evaluate in a fresh and unbiased manner the relationship between a work of art—here the well-preserved architectural remains of Palmyra, unsullied by centuries of interpretive response—and the state of the society in which it was produced. This, ultimately, is the value of the Palmyra volume. Unlike Homer, whose reception bears the traces of previous interpreters and arguments, Palmyra can be reproduced in a manner that allows it to be relished <emph>and</emph> understood without travelling to the site, and, further, the method through which it can be appreciated can be seen more transparently in connection with a site that has not been built over and reinterpreted. As Wood asserts, "How far the taste and manner of the architecture may give any light into the age which produced it, our engravings will put in every person's power to judge for himself" (15). Wood firmly believes that the measured engravings of Palmyra reproduce the experience of the ruins to a degree sufficient to allow his readers to evaluate the relation between objects of cultural production and the age or state of the society in which they were produced. </p>
<p> This is certainly how some, most notably Edward Gibbon, responded to the images. In a footnote to the <title level="m">Decline and Fall</title>, Gibbon suggested that "every previous account is eclipsed by the magnificent description and drawings of MM Dawkins and Wood, who have transported into England the ruins of Palmyra and Ballbeck" (3:263). Two aspects of this comment are notable: first, Gibbon uses a visual metaphor—"<emph>eclipsed</emph>"—to describe his reaction, and, next, he suggests the visceral, physical response that the works produced: Dawkins and Wood have succeeded in transporting the ruins to England. While the pair did not, of course, physically move the ruins anywhere, their measured drawings, like Robert Adams's later volume on the palace of Diocletian (1764), would certainly have functioned as specimen books that allowed English architects to copy the proportions and motifs of imperial Roman architecture.</p>
<p>Wood's preservation of the memory of Palmyra and Balbec, his success at putting these sites into the classical record, meant that Palmyra had a cultural impact beyond its function as an architectural specimen book. Gavin Hamilton celebrated the accomplishments of Wood and Dawkins on canvas (<ref target="http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/H/3522/artist_name/Gavin%20Hamilton/record_id/22122" rend="new">
<title level="m">James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of Palmyra</title>, 1758</ref>). Further, James Grainger's ode <title level="a">Solitude</title> opens with a description of Palmyra based on Wood's volume, while Diderot's account of ruins in the Salon of 1767, as Jonah Siegel explains, derived from Wood's images and adaptations by Hubert Robert (Siegel 30-32). Palmyra's lack of stratigraphy made it an emblem of pure ruin, and in the widely circulated work of Volney, <title level="m">The Ruins of Empires</title> (1791), Palmyra becomes the point from which all lessons about the decline of empire are delivered. The frontispiece shows a view of Palmyra similar to the first plate of Wood's <title level="m">Ruins of Palmyra</title>, only it includes Volney in the scene as the focal point of the elevated perspective that makes the view possible. The late Imperial site that had largely been absent from the written record now stands as the epitome of ruin, the locus that, as the symbol of a fate to be avoided and not imitated, delivers a very different set of lessons from antiquity.</p>

<p>In his role as the preserver of an unrecorded antiquity, Wood might be compared to Thomas Percy and Joseph Ritson, among others, thus highlighting the link between popular and classical antiquarians. Percy's <title level="m">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</title> (1765), for example, shares with Wood's <title level="m">Ruins of Palmyra</title> an interest in the role of poetry in the early stages of society and a belief that this role changes as society progresses. Percy too sees poetry as the preserver of a long cultural memory. He insists that the earlier minstrel ballads written in Northern dialect are coincident with "the true spirit of chivalry" (xxii), and he repeatedly emphasizes how the poems, when collected, preserve and propagate ancestral memory, "rescuing from oblivion"  the "taste, genius, sentiments, and manners" of illustrious ancestors (xiv). Unlike Wood, Percy does not appeal to eyewitness experience; he bases his collection on archival research and credits the many friends, libraries, and individuals who shared their collections of printed ballads with him. Joseph Ritson, however, shares Wood's emphasis on ethnographic and experiential authority. As Ritson notes in his preface to <title level="m">Scotish Song in Two Volumes</title> (1794), he "made repeated visits to different parts of Scotland for the purpose of obtaining materials or information upon the subject" (ii). Such an appeal to ethnographic authority, as Maureen McLane notes, becomes an increasingly important form of poetic authority in the later eighteenth century, and "what had been a liability—a Scottish birth and upbringing—was now boldly announced as a credential, such that the English antiquarian had to find ways to compete" (72). Ritson's solution here might be understood to draw upon Wood's earlier appeal to first-hand experience and an emphasis on the interpretive understanding and "relish" that might be gained from contact with the original sites of poetic composition.  </p>
<p>These brief comparisons with Volnay, Percy, and Ritson suggest two trajectories for the later significance of <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title>: first, as an emblem of ruin and, second, as a contribution to increasingly sophisticated thinking about the relation between works of art and the cultural conditions of their production. This second trajectory contributes to that rejection of the aesthetic as an autonomous category, which we associate now with the late eighteenth-century ballad revival and which would be worked out in greater detail in Wood's theory of Homer's orality. </p>
<p>With this in mind, I want to speculate on the links between Wood's emphasis on poetic geography articulated in the prefatory material to the <title level="m">Ruins of Palmyra</title>, and his later publications on Homer. We have seen how <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> provides the basis for Wood's theory of the relation between cultural production and the stages of social development, a theory that he would later apply to Homer in elaborating his argument for Homeric orality. The recognition of the link between orality and earlier stages of social development, though, would not have been possible without the travel experience that led to the Palmyra volume. Much as later theorists of orality like Milman Parry and Alfred Lord visited cultures thought to be in an earlier state of social development to observe improvisational oral poetic performance,  Wood's description of his journey through the desert also suggests that Bedouin oral poetry may have influenced his thinking about Homer. Wood notes that among the Bedouins, "When the business of the day was over, coffee and a pipe of tobacco made their highest luxury, and while they indulged in this, sitting in a circle, one of the company entertained the rest with a song or story, the subject of love, or war, and the composition sometimes extemporary" (<title level="m">Palmyra</title> 35).</p>
<p>In Wood's final volume on Homer, attention is given not to images but to Wood's theory of literature. But Wood's comment from the Palmyra volume about how the architecture "gives light into the age which produced it" and his recognition of the extemporaneity of Bedouin oral composition provides us with an important link between Wood's work on Palmyra and his thinking on Homer. In both his preface to <title level="m">Palmyra</title> and the various incarnations of his writing on the <title level="m">Original Genius of Homer</title>, Wood suggests that the proper way to appreciate Homer—and by implication, all classical literature—is to recognize the close connection between the work, the place of composition, and the age or state of society that produced it. As he puts it: "A review of Homer's scene of action leads naturally to the times, when he lived" (<title level="m">Homer</title> iv). Wood, in all of his thinking about antiquity, is attempting to recreate a sense of past ages by two approaches: eyewitness experience and ethnography. The first utilizes the physical experience of classical landscapes, as we see most clearly when Wood insists on Homer's accuracy through a comparison of his own travel experiences and the conflict between Meneleus and Agamemnon over navigation routes in Book 3 of the <title level="m">Odyssey</title> (Homer 34-61). <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7">For a more full discussion of this episode, see Sachs, 2010, 134-35.
            </note>
</p>
<p>The second approach, which I am characterizing as ethnographic, suggests that the present native inhabitants of classical sites—especially those associated with the East, like Palmyra and the Troade—provide a present example of the manners of earlier ages of society. Certain comments in the <title level="m">Original Genius</title> reveal Wood the ethnographer most clearly.  After noting that the difficulty of reading Homer comes from the need to reconcile ourselves  "to usages and customs so very opposite to our own," Wood explains that "we found the manners of the Iliad still preserved in some parts of the East" (128). He continues, and in what Jim Porter has described as "a kind of Homeric ethnography on modern day Bedouins" (333), he likens the Bedouins found amidst the Palmyrene ruins to Hottentots and Cherokees. Subsequently, in a comparison of heroic and Bedouin manners, he notes how unimportant is one's word of honor. "Ulysses," he concludes, "would form a perfect model for those, who wish to make their way in [the desert] with security and respect" (140).  Moments like this suggest that Wood is a cultural comparativist working from a model of stadial development, which associates certain kinds of manners with certain stages of social development. They further mark his awareness of what we now call "uneven development," which creates the possibility of travelling to the past by visiting supposedly less developed native cultures. This is the same sort of logic, with its emphasis on the manners and cultural forms that accompany certain ages of society, that Wood uses to support his suggestion that Homer was an oral poet. </p>
<p>Wood consistently frames his appreciation for Homer by emphasizing his ability to provide a faithful, mimetic representation of the age in which he lived. Wood explains, 
         <quote>We shall confine our inquiry to Homer's Mimetic Powers for whether we consider him as a Geographer, Traveller, Historian, or Chronologer, whether his Religion and Mythology, his Manners and Customs, or his Language and Learning... in these several views his Imitation alone is the great object of our attention. We shall admit his antient title of Philosopher only as he is a painter." (vii)  </quote>
            This, then, suggests a further link between <title level="m">Original Genius</title> and <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title>, for just as in the earlier volume measured engraving attempted to replicate ancient ruins in exact detail to help viewers picture the original sight and to "give light into the age that produced them," Homer is praised for the most exact, mimetic representation of the age in which he lived. "[H]is great merit," Wood claims, "seems to be that of having transmitted to us a faithful transcript or...a correct abstract of human nature...which belonged to his period of society" (<title level="m">Homer</title> xiii). In both cases, in the actual experience of place that Wood emphasizes in <hi rend="italic">Original Genius</hi> and in viewing its mimetic, engraved representation in <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title>, what Wood values is partly the experience itself, but more emphatically it is the potential of experiences of visiting or viewing  to illuminate earlier ages of society and the value of their cultural production. </p>
<p>Wood's notion of both travel and images as an empirical test for Homer's accuracy and hence his literary merit helps to explain why an author preoccupied with Greece in general and Homer in particular would choose to publish initially on a late imperial Roman site, and Wood's emphasis on the link between the engravings of Palmyra and insights into the age that produced its architecture in <title level="m">The Ruins of Palmyra</title> underscores Wood's dominant interest in mimesis as a link between Palmyra and Homer. Wood's interest in reading classical texts in the landscapes in which they were produced—in what he calls "poetical geography," with its emphasis on ethnographic and experiential strategies that extend interpretive authority beyond more typical text-based approaches that we now call philology—can also be understood in relation to his use of mimesis as the primary factor in judging cultural production. Further, the close connections between Wood's earlier and later work detailed by this essay have implications for how we understand the relation between popular and classical antiquarianism. Recent scholarly interest in "popular antiquarianism" and a correspondent revival of interest in local ballad culture have helped us to recognize a historical media environment in the later eighteenth-century characterized by an understanding of the close connections between literary works and their historical and geographical contexts; by an awareness of the differences among orality, writing, and print; and by a belief that eyewitness experience can illuminate the meaning and originality of earlier literature. This essay's focus on Robert Wood has suggested that this environment has its roots not only in the revival of literary nationalism that we associate with Romanticism later in the century, but also in earlier antiquarian interest in the material remains of classical civilizations. </p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">The antiquarian project is based on the unbridgeable gap we know to divide the past from the present. The embarrassment it provokes is due in part to the necessary failure of all attempts to truly understand a lost era combining with the insight the attempt affords into the never fully dispassionate drives motivating the researches in the first place.  The articles in this volume illustrate the ways in which Romantic antiquarianism exists at a point of transition between the speculative regimen of an earlier era and the emergence of the period of licensed scientific research and accreditation we still inhabit.  As such they provide an opportunity for reflection on the passions underlying any manifestation of the desire to know, and on the gains and losses entailed in the emergence of an ostensibly dispassionate new scholarship.</p>

<p>At the home of a friend, some years back, while turning over the pages of a volume I was happy to see on his shelves, I came across an all-too-typical characterization of the term motivating this special issue: "The passionate reach of cultural institutions evidenced in these moments suggests that what is at stake in the arrangement of the past," the text declared in a passage I found marked by a reader, presumably my host, "is not <emph>mere antiquarianism</emph>, the turning over and charting of mute rubble." The fact that the historian I was visiting was an expert on seventeenth-century antiquarian circles made my eye pause over the marked lines in a text I myself had written with the special panic one has come to associate with the sense that it is too late for second thoughts, that faults in print can never be fully retracted (Siegel, <title level="m">Desire</title> 3). Certainly I had been right to note that the passionate relationships to antiquity manifested in the writings of Hazlitt, Keats, and other authors and artists were distinct from those typically expressed in the texts of antiquarians. Still, I found myself wondering in the home of my friend, the author of a study of the great Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Pereisc (1580-1635) and his broad international network of correspondents, as I have again at various times since, why I had felt compelled to use that particular formulation. "<emph>Mere</emph> antiquarianism"—the epithet has the flavor of an unexamined slander, the pushy demand that unknown interlocutors share in one's unexamined prejudice against something we would agree to call antiquarianism, a practice that, according to my younger self, involved nothing more complicated than the abject manipulation of unresponsive and uncommunicative debris. (And then, turning over and charting rubble that does not speak to one, is a characterization that hesitates unsteadily between being simply an uncharitable description and an allegory of impotent effort or unrequited passion, as though antiquarians were so many superannuated lovers courting a stony beloved utterly indifferent to their attentions.)  </p>
<p>	I cite a formulation I have found ever-more embarrassing with the passing of time because—as Noah Heringman and Crystal B. Lake helpfully lay out in their Introduction to this special issue—its terms are evidently symptomatic of more than my own youthful carelessness. Their account makes a thought-provoking stop at Nietzsche, who may have been my own forgotten influence (along with Walter Pater), but we can also look far more locally for the sources of the prejudice to which I gave voice. Indeed, with its cruel use of parentheses and italics the dictionary definition of "antiquary" quickly demonstrates the long-standing nature of the problem: "A student (usually a <emph>professed</emph> student), or collector, of antiquities." To the stigma of autodidacticism is added the fraud of self-accreditation (not a professor, but a self-professed student). And then the tension between collecting and studying is written into the definition because "student" and "collector" are not symmetrical terms. To study <emph>because</emph> one has collected things might simply be to apply a thin veneer of reason to disguise the uneven surface marked out by one's passion. To collect because one wants to study, on the other hand, approaches what we call the scientific method. The citations in the <title level="m">Oxford English Dictionary</title> are historically revealing: both of the occurrences of the term from before the eighteenth century are positive, while the ones from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries are characterized by patronizing irony:
            <quote>
               1587   A. Fleming et al. <title level="m">Holinshed's Chron.</title> (new ed.) III. Contin. 1272/1   It hath beene some question amongst the best antiquaries of our age, that, [etc.]<lb/>
               1602   W. Warner <title level="m">Epitome Hist. Eng.</title> in <title level="m">Albions Eng.</title> (rev. ed.) 351   Our learned and studious Antiquarie Master Camden.<lb/>
               1786   H. Walpole <title level="m">Vertue's Anecd. Painting</title> (ed. 4) I. iv. 134   We antiquaries, who hold every thing worth preserving, merely because it has been preserved.<lb/>
               1836   H. Smith <title level="m">Tin Trumpet</title> I. 37   Antiquary—Too often a collector of valuables that are worth nothing, and a recollector of all that Time has been glad to forget.
            </quote>
               It is a precipitous decline from "best" and "learned" and "studious," to those easy if amusing paradoxes that suggest not learning but obsession. The circular reasoning involved in preserving what has been preserved, the confusion of value with its opposite, the clinging on to what time itself is happy to cast into oblivion: these are characterizations appropriate for neurotics, not for the learned and studious—or perhaps they are the neuroses <emph>of</emph> the learned and studious.  </p>
<p>"Antiquarian<emph>ism</emph>" describes no downward trajectory of the sort "Antiquary" does, but that's because it begins its career late, and therefore at a pretty low point for reflection on the topic. From the late eighteenth century, when the termed gained currency, definitions do little in the way of identifying a serious human endeavor: "The profession or pursuits of the antiquarian; taste for, or devotion to, antiquities." <emph>Taste</emph> is, of course, the thing about which we cannot argue, and so it is immediately outside the pale of rational discourse; <emph>devotion</emph>, bears more than a suggestion of personal passion or even of an idiosyncratic idolatry. And, evidently, this is a use of <emph>profession</emph> far from the modern one. Then come the citations:
         <quote>
<emph>a</emph>1779   Bp. W. Warburton <title level="m">Lett.</title> No. 221 (T.)   I used to despise him for his antiquarianism.<lb/>
            1803   W. Taylor in <title level="m">Ann. Rev.</title> 1 439   He views the earth, neither through the telescope of antiquarianism, nor the microscope of topography.<lb/>
            1849   E. A. Freeman <title level="m">Hist. Archit.</title> 4   The first phase of ecclesiology was simple antiquarianism.
         </quote>
            A despicable practice that distances itself from the earth while pretending to try to view it more closely, a simple phase that must be left behind: instances such as these clearly demonstrate the long pedigree of the bias I evidenced so unreflectively in my own writing. Still, in the strands of evidence the <title level="m">OED</title> offers we find one bright thread in the words of Samuel Johnson, who understood the passions of thought better than most: 
            <quote>1778   Johnson <title level="m">Let.</title> 23 Apr. in J. Boswell <title level="m">Life Johnson</title> (1791) II. 219   A mere antiquarian is a rugged being.</quote>
            There is no space here to lay out the affection and irritation driving a statement, which has at its source a fairly well known contretemps described in Boswell's <title level="m">Life</title>, involving Thomas Percy, of the <title level="m">Reliques of Ancient Poetry</title> (1765), and Thomas Pennant, author of <title level="m">A Tour of Scotland in 1769</title> (1771; see also Campbell, this volume). I cite the passage only as a beautiful balancing of the minimizing <emph>mere</emph> with something more forceful, with a recognition of the ways in which "antiquarian" might describe an identity, not a mere practice, one in which we ought not to be surprised to find more uneven formations than those generally associated with the life of the mind.</p>
<p>	It bears saying that it is not uncommon for us to despise that upon which we rely the most, and that the <title level="m">Oxford English Dictionary</title> is itself a text always pushing away from its own antiquarian roots without being fully free of them—or at least not until fairly recently, when technology may well have automated and made dispassionate the process of rooting through vast amounts of material about which most people don't care. Still, what our dictionary reminds us, above all, is that when we say "Romantic Antiquarianism" we are not simply identifying a certain period in the long history of the field (profession, pursuit, or taste) of antiquarianism, so much as a crisis point in its development, one with important conceptual and emotional components.</p>
<p>The essays collected in this special issue suggest not only that, as Dr. Johnson proposed, "[a] <emph>mere antiquarian</emph> is a rugged being," certainly able to survive my thoughtless characterization, but also that in the <emph>mere</emph> nature of the category resides something of its power.  Standing on the other side of analysis, antiquarianism always has a quality of passion-driven study, and therefore of embarrassment. It is the thing itself, absent the reason that comes to justify it. In that sense it may be seen as the id of history, the passionate element that must be controlled and limited if the field is to make its way in the world.
            <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
               For a seminal account of the relationship between history and antiquarianism see Analdo Momigliano's <title level="a">Ancient History and the Antiquarian.</title> Pioneering recent work on the long history of antiquarianism and its cultural implications includes Peter Miller's <title level="m">Momigliano and Antiquarianism: Foundations of the Modern Cultural Sciences</title> and François Louis's and Peter Miller's <title level="m">Antiquarianism and Intellectual Life in Europe and China, 1500-1800</title>.
            </note>
            And yet, antiquarianism identifies the orientation that not only makes the objects of history matter at an affective level, but that also recognizes the force of the processes involved in coming to know that history. It is for this reason, or set of reasons, that this area of study is so fruitfully linked to the history of media or mediation in all of the articles in this issue. Indeed, several of the pieces testify to the embarrassment that is caused for a concept-driven field (or one that wishes to be conceptual), by too long a stop at the point of mediation. Whether the antiquarian surrounds himself with fakes or authentic objects, or—worse—with an undifferentiated combination of both, we wish he would want not to do so. We wish the antiquarian were gathering material in order to identify its status and make a claim about it, in order, in short, to answer the kinds of clear conceptual questions we like to believe motivate our own studies. It is embarrassing to think that heterogeneous and poorly-provenanced material is being assembled not in order to make an argument, but to create a home or even a self. Rosemary Hill's <title level="a">The Antiquary at Home</title> is evocative in its treatment of two kinds of antiquarian self-fashioning, on the one hand the personal reinvention through interior decoration entailed in the antiquarian spaces created by Walter Scott and the French artist E. H. Langlois, and on the bold self-creation of the Sobieski Stuarts, about whose life-long performance the word "fraud" seems at once so reasonable and so impoverished. The home of Langlois (himself evidently a relic of an earlier era), which became Rouen's museum of antiquities even as he lived there with his family, and Abbotsford, the farmhouse that became a personal fantasy space that then contributed to the story Scott told of himself: the combination of vulnerability and performance involved in the creation and dissemination of these spaces does not find an easy resolution in the modern imagination. But then, as Hill indicates, Scott himself never fully resolved the public role of the space he built for himself, his own writing suggesting ambivalence and even embarrassment about publicizing Abbotsford.
         </p>
<p>To recognize that an individual might organize his or her existence around things that are by our lights incoherent or inauthentic opens up questions that are always present in contemporary responses to Romantic antiquarianism: namely, what does it mean to call something coherent or authentic? Needless to say, the topics are of particular interest because modern accounts of the values of authenticity and coherence are directly traceable to Romantic forebears. The analyses of Campbell and Sachs are particularly interesting because of the ways their authors acknowledge their own uncertainty as to how best to respond to the heterogeneous or hybrid genres in which antiquarian material is typically relayed to the public. When Sachs describes "[t]he frustrations of a literary scholar trained to make certain kinds of arguments in response to certain genres of texts yet when confronted with a work that doesn't in any way conform to these generic models," he is addressing a feeling evident in many of the essays in this volume, as critics attempt to understand forms of knowledge distribution that we now know were fated to fail both as models and as modes of instruction because of the combined boldness and ignorance of their creators (Sachs 9). It makes the interpretative value of the frustration or shock all the richer when it is recognized as a phenomenon caused by the encounter of modern expectations with material not made to meet those expectations. In that sense the productive shock depends on the very drives that shape antiquarianism itself, on our own desire to find meaning in what might otherwise be so much indistinguishable debris from the past. 
         </p>
<p>
            Wood's <title level="m">Ruins of Palmyra</title> (1753), the epochal volume addressed in Sachs's article, was an international success: it offered images that were adapted in verse, in the visual arts, and in architecture for decades to come, in England and abroad; its influence on Volney's <title level="m">Ruines</title> (1791) and on its illustrations is quite open. The fact that the work was a blend of historical and literary speculation, travel memoir, and illustration evidently presented no problems of style, form, or decorum in its day. In a related vein, one suspects the miscellaneous quality of <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>, the periodical in which Timothy Campbell finds traces of Pennant's description of the guillotine, was the least of the challenges that racy rag presented to its original readers. When Campbell writes of <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s "dizzying mix of aesthetics, politics, sovereignty, sex, and costume," perhaps the most interesting question to ask is why and in what sense we find dizzying something that in its own day was close to conventional (Campbell 16). Campbell's account of the circulation of Pennant's description of the sources of the guillotine in Scottish culture compellingly demonstrates that authors and readers in earlier periods were notably more comfortable working with fragments than later critics have proved to be.</p>
<p>
            What belongs in a newspaper or a magazine, we might ask, or on a website or a news channel? That the eighteenth-century found a new term for a published miscellany in "Magazine," a word originally meaning a space devoted to <emph>storage</emph>, should serve to remind us just how much we tend to impose conceptual coherence on publications that are, in fact, always heterogeneous. Antiquarianism is about filling in a space between what you have discovered and what you know or believe to be the case. We are comfortable with some ways of filling those gaps, but less so with others. As I have begun to suggest, all of the essays in this issue are thoughtfully responsive to the challenge for the modern scholar of antiquarian form, and as such they open the door for us to think about the analytical force of our own discomforts. To this day a visitor to the Sir John Soane Museum in London finds a blend of what we might call authentic material (an Egyptian sarcophagus, and so on) and what we would be prone to call fakes (say casts of the Apollo Belvedere and other statues). The fact that Blake probably never saw the Portland Vase he illustrated for Darwin's <title level="m">Botanic Garden</title> passed without comment in his own day, but it provokes discussion today. In that sense, the modern commitment to what we believe to be the unique evidentiary force of authentic monuments is far more complete than it ever was in the Romantic era. As Sam Smiles's piece thoughtfully demonstrates, it is worth dwelling on the nuanced nature of the making and reception of reproduction in the period. Smiles notes that "The antiquarian image . . . is best understood as a crystallization of cognitive assumptions about the object" (Smiles 13). Using distinctions drawn from the semiotics of Peirce, he suggests that even the most indexical mode of meaning-making in the illustration of antiquarian material always trends towards the symbolic: "I propose that antiquarian illustration can be classified for the most part as predominantly iconic but is often, despite the illustrator's best efforts, tilted towards the symbolic" (Smiles 8). I take this claim to imply that even the most apparently straightforward illustration, or the most concretely conceived reproductions (say a cast of a fragment of the Bayeux tapestry), offered in its day far more than information.</p>
<p>
            Lovers, children, and the founders of churches cling with special passion to simulacra and to objects made sacred by association. To encounter these materials from a standpoint outside the emotional universe in which they are prized is to become witness to something profound, atavistic, and frequently embarrassing. The passion of the connoisseur shares qualities with these kinds of affections, but adds a further confusion for the outside viewer. While relics or memorials will tend to be validated by their exclusive or limited nature, antiquarianism is characterized not by its commitment to the single and precious, but to the accumulation of multiple instances. One provisional description of Romantic antiquarianism might be that it is the sensibility of the cabinet of curiosities just at the rise of the age of museums. Hill's claim, in <title level="a">Antiquary at Home,</title> that "[p]ublic museums, university departments, and government bodies were taking over the territory that had been opened up by the antiquarianism of the previous two generations" is a little premature. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, the public museums and university departments that could take over these territories were not yet in existence, though the sensibilities that would make them possible certainly were coming into being.
            <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">The development of the nation's premier museum of antiquities is worth citing to illustrate the slow development of institutions.  Though the British Museum was founded in 1753, its collection of antiquities was modest, and access was difficult for most of the eighteenth century.  The Department of Antiquities expanded rapidly in the nineteenth century, after its foundation in 1807, and went through various administrative vicissitudes. In 1860, it was divided into three new departments: Greek and Roman Antiquities, Coins and Medals, and Oriental Antiquities.  The Department of British and Medieval Antiquities and Ethnography was only established 1866. (The Musée National du Moyen Age [or Musée Cluny] had been founded in Paris in 1843.) On the development of the museum in the period, see my <title level="m">Emergence of the Modern Museum.</title> University Departments were even slower to emerge in the fields that took over from antiquarianism.
            </note> From the late eighteenth century forward, culture finds itself subjected to the pressure of ever increasing quantities of antiquities, and the problems they presented were not simply numerical but conceptual: the wide range of sources of antiquities was not liable to systematic organization. While the amount of material with which culture currently deals has evidently not lessened, what we have lost is the sense that any system might subsume all of the material that comes to hand. But, of course, not feeling one has a problem is not the same as not having a problem, and neither can be confused with having actually solved a problem. As these essays show, the interest of Romantic antiquarianism resides in its unresolved nature, the way in which projects in this era stand between an emerging scientific consensus and a number of more provisional strategies for arranging and diffusing knowledge that depend on or provoke an affective charge often denied or submerged in later approaches.</p>
<p>
            Aside from the modern embarrassment about a passion for the past insufficiently matured into conceptualization, another intriguing contradiction for the modern student is the play between classical and local sources of interest. Jonathan Sachs puts Wood's speculations on Homer of 1775 (<title level="m">An Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer</title>, published in 1775, but circulated privately in 1767 and 1769) in relation to his earlier and, in many ways, more culturally resonant work on Palmyra of 1753. Sachs begins from the deceptively simple and openly retrospective question that might be crudely summarized as, Why Palmyra, given that it does not matter to us?  But, as his essay demonstrates, the source of the mystery is the poverty of our own historical interests and (therefore) of our accounts of the passions and interests of earlier periods. When we see eighteenth-century antiquarians poring over provincial Roman work (of the sort to be found in Palmyra) for signs of classical achievement, or studying copies of vases, or even etchings of vases made from simulacra of vases, we may be tempted to identify a failure to care about the original. But to look at the matter from this point of view is to allow our own vision to be obscured by the haze of an aura which later eras (including our own) have projected around those parts of the past they have valued most. The modern relationship to the copy emerged after a slow and uneven process of intellectual refinement that took much of the nineteenth century to bring about. And so, when Erasmus Darwin needed an illustration of the Portland Vase for his <title level="m">Botanical Garden</title>, Blake produced a copy not from the original, but probably from a copy made by Wedgewood, and likely with some reference to some earlier engravings. Brylowe reviews the complex transmission of the Portland Vase, an excellent demonstration of the extent to which not seeing the thing in itself is in fact  <emph>characteristic</emph> of the period's relationship to art. In the process she also illustrates the sophisticated ways in which classical antiquities could be made to support nationalist aspirations.  After all, it is Wedgewoods's achievement in pottery that provides the occasion for the treatment of the Vase in Darwin's poem.
         </p>
<p>Sachs astutely identifies the suggestion in Wood "that one needs to visit the remains of classical civilization if one is ever to understand the writings they produced" (Sachs 18) as putting into question a long tradition (still in a way current) of understanding the Classics as universal texts—infinitely amenable to comprehension no matter the circumstances. While this observation is entirely true from a modern point of view, it is far less clear how much this contradiction could have been recognized as such in its own day. Gibbon described Wood and Dawkins as having transported the ruins of Palmyra and Balbec to England, which seems so absurd a notion to us that it might makes us reflect on the history of mediation itself. What makes something feel accessible by culture? The step taken by one individual onto lunar soil may conceivably be described as a "giant leap for mankind."  And yet, to this day only around a dozen people have actually disturbed the dusty surface of the moon. The emergence of photographs of the earth seen in its entirety, a small side-benefit of the space program, was an epochal event in its own way, one celebrated by the placement of one of those photographs on the cover of <title level="m">The Whole Earth Catalogue</title>, an attempt to suggest that the whole world was available to be known, and even that a sense of the whole was a vital political development. <title level="m">Google Earth</title>, on the other hand, which appears to make every corner of our planet available in detail, for that very reason risks making the world feel utterly inconceivable as a whole. There is, in short, a power in partial knowledge. </p>
<p>Many of the essays capture the ways in which visual representations, even those apparently intended to capture monuments with accuracy, come to be valorized by the romance they manage to project. Myrone is particularly interesting on the double challenge of antiquarianism not just before its concerns were taken over by more scientific fields, but when it could still imagine itself as having a role in the popular imagination. Writing on the overlap in prejudices about topography and about antiquarians, he captures nicely the ways in which John Britton saw his own scholarly researches to have been motivated by an original fascination with the mystery of the location suggested by some of the more speculative explanations on the topic, writing of Avebury that "[t]he mystic halo which enveloped it, tended rather to awaken than repress research" (Myrone 9). </p>
<p>Among the particular strengths on which Romantic antiquarians could build was the long tradition of antiquarianism itself. In that sense, antiquarianism was <emph>not</emph> born from the French Revolution, though it was fated to be utterly changed by a number of developments we associate with that world-historical phenomenon. The intellectual and institutional relationship between the violence of the Revolution and the emergence of Gothic taste is well established.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
            A useful source on the topic and its broader context is Stephen Bann's <title level="m">The Clothing of Clio: A Study of the Representation of History in Nineteenth-Century Britain and France</title>.
            </note> The figure of Eustache-Hyacinthe Langlois, the artist living in the ruined building that became a museum discussed by Hill, himself a kind of relic of the Ancien Régime, is just one colorful instance of the ways in which historical trauma made it possible to see fragments as at once belonging to a lost past and as intimately connected to one's own culture. To witness the creation of significant ruins, to participate in the cultural dislocations entailed in the revolution and its aftermath—these were both lived experiences shaping the nostalgia typical of the post-revolutionary historical sensibility. (Bann 19-22). And then, the emergence of a mass audience for material that had been the preoccupation of a widespread but relatively small group often devoted to fairly obscure researches was bound to affect the mediation and reception of a field.  This is a topic laid out with sophistication and nuance in all of the pieces in this collection, but which Ina Ferris addresses most directly in her account of the ways in which Romantic antiquarians "increasingly turned into public authors" (Ferris 2). Topographers, sublime painters, wood engravers, popular compilers: these offered so many formal modalities for representing the knowledge of antiquarian material to a broader public. And, while the drives to reach out are directly connected to the emergence of more specialized fields such as a more technical history, or archeology, the developments have neither congruent aims nor analogous outcomes. We may remember here the great failure of antiquarianism in British letters, that of Edward Casaubon and his fruitless search for the key to all mythologies, described in the most important attempt to capture in a novel the period just before the coming of the first Reform Bill and the trend towards a vastly enfranchised public which it inaugurated. And <title level="m">Middlemarch</title> is more than satiric in its treatment of the challenge of antiquity, of course, featuring—in its representation of Dorothea in Rome—one of the most poignant representations of the crisis liable to be provoked by the unmediated encounter with the past. </p>
<p>At its heart, the antiquarian project is based on the unbridgeable gap we know to divide the past from the present. We may trace the embarrassment antiquarianism sometimes provokes not only to the inevitable failures of all attempts to understand intimately a lost era, but more compellingly to the insight these failures give us into the drives that motivate such attempts in the first place.  If the modern tendency has been to fill in the space between a lost past and an uncertain present with what is often thought of as disinterested scientific research, this does not mean we have moved beyond the fundamental challenges motivating earlier attempts to overcome the gap. As these papers illustrate so splendidly, Romantic antiquarianism—because of its position at the point of transition between the speculative regimen of an earlier era and the emergence of the period of licensed scientific research and accreditation we still inhabit—provides a wonderful opportunity to reflect on the passions underlying all desires to know, and on the gains and losses entailed in the emergence of a dispassionate new scholarship. </p>

<p>The recovery of Ireland's historic past was a project undertaken by numerous scholars and artists from the mid-eighteenth century onwards, recording traditional poetry and music as well as antiquities, both pagan and Christian. With respect to these last, it was not until the nineteenth century that sustained fieldwork and scholarship began to put that material history on firm foundations. These researches were widely regarded as restoring its rightful dignity to Irish history, and they resonated with those supporters of Irish nationalism, such as Thomas Davis (1814-45) who, in the pages of <title level="j">The Nation</title>, recommended Irish antiquities and historical subjects to Irish painters (<title level="m">Literary and Historical Essays</title> 153-172). Irish antiquarian scholarship at mid-century was prosecuted with the same rigor as its equivalents elsewhere and was not overtly politicized, but it came to fruition in a highly volatile situation. This essay is not intended to situate that scholarship in a political climacteric, or at least not to do so directly. Instead it pays attention to an approach that seeks to be as disinterested as possible, providing (visual) information of unimpeachable objectivity.</p>
<p>In the preface to his <title level="m">Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</title> (1845), the Irish artist and antiquarian George Petrie introduced his readers to its illustrations in the following terms:
               <quote>It will be seen that they make but slight pretensions to the character of works of art. Where no fine writing was attempted, showy illustrations, got up with a view to popular effect, and leading to an almost necessary sacrifice of truthfulness, would be very little in harmony. For their accuracy, however, I can fearlessly pledge myself. This has been the point attended to above all others, and of which the absence of all affectation of freedom of handling, or forcible effect, will give abundant evidence. They may be considered as quotations from our ancient monuments, made with the same anxious desire for rigid accuracy, as those supplied from literary and other sources in the text; and though slighter or more attractive sketches might have sufficiently answered my purpose, they would not have been sufficient to gratify my desire to preserve trustworthy memorials of monuments now rapidly passing away. (Petrie ix-x)</quote>
               Petrie's endorsement offers an opportunity for further reflection, for the declaration it makes about the purpose of illustration in archaeological surveys is not only historically specific, revealing something about the assumptions current in antiquarian circles in the nineteenth century. It can also prompt us to think more widely about the nature of archaeological illustration in its various modes. </p>
<p>	Although Petrie is discussed in what follows as an exemplar of a wider tendency, some rehearsal of his professional life will help to situate his remarks in their historical context. Born in 1790, the son of a Scottish portrait painter recently settled in Dublin, Petrie trained initially as an artist and secured his early reputation by providing landscape sketches for engaving in topographical works, notably Thomas Cromwell's <title level="m">Excursions through Ireland</title> (1820) and James Norris Brewer's <title level="m">Beauties of Ireland</title> (1825). As a painter in watercolor he exhibited regularly at the Royal Hibernian Academy and was one of the key artists who developed the idea of the Romantic landscape in Ireland from the 1830s to the 1850s. It is not known precisely when Petrie's scholarly interest in antiquities began, but from the 1820s he was actively concerned with early Irish history and was an important contributor to the activities of the Royal Irish Academy, the learned society founded in 1785 to promote Irish historical, scientific, and literary studies. The Royal Irish Academy was also the repository of the national collection of antiquities, whose study was an important prerequisite for the scholarly reassessment of Irish cultural achievement, and Petrie was instrumental in the acquisition of highly important early manuscripts and metalwork for the collection. From 1833 to 1844 he was head of the Topographical Department of the Irish Ordnance Survey, charged with recording Irish antiquities, and he also edited two popular antiquarian magazines, the <title level="j">Dublin Penny Journal</title> (1832-36) and  the <title level="j">Irish Penny Journal</title> (1840-41). His important contributions to the collection of traditional Irish music were published as <title level="m">The Ancient Music of Ireland</title> (1855). Petrie's scholarship set high standards for the prosecution of historical and antiquarian research, and he has justly been called the father of Irish archaeology. His  essay <title level="a">On the Origin and Uses of the Round Towers of Ireland</title> (1833) was awarded the gold medal and a £50 prize from the Royal Irish Academy. It was regarded as  ground-breaking and won a bigger audience when republished in <title level="m">The Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</title>.</p>
<p>	The fact that Petrie and many of his contemporaries turned to woodcut engravings is significant, for the mid-nineteenth century was the heyday of the woodcut print whose technique facilitated the production of large illustrated surveys. In comparison with engravings on steel, woodcuts took relatively little time to make, and because they used a relief process they could be placed in the press among the type, rather than needing to be printed separately, as was the case with intaglio prints. This allowed publishers to incorporate illustrations quite cheaply and so run less of a commercial risk than was the case with engravings. It also meant that many more illustrations could be supplied; the <title level="m">Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</title>, with 256 of them, obviously benefitted from that circumstance.</p>
<p>	Petrie's illustrator, George A. Hanlon, had the task of taking Petrie's field sketches and rendering them as woodcut engravings without any sacrifice of the accuracy Petrie had invested in them. Hanlon's life and career are not as well documented as Petrie's. He was born circa 1814 and was a student in the Royal Dublin Society's Drawing School in 1830. He  provided woodcut  illustrations for a variety of topographical, antiquarian, scientific, and literary works in the 1840s and 1850s, including William Wilde's <title level="m">The Beauties of the Boyne</title> (1849), William Wakeman's <title level="m">Archæologia Hibernica</title> (1848) and William Wilde's <title level="m">Descriptive Catalogue of the Antiquities ... in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy</title> (1857). He won prizes awarded by the Royal Irish Art Union for wood engraving in 1844 (for architectural views after Petrie) and again in 1846. His work with antiquities seems to have been the mainstay of his career in Ireland and the 1849-50 audit of the Royal Irish Academy records payments to him of £41 "on account of woodcuts."<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" place="foot" n="1"> Appendix No. IX: Account of the Royal Irish Academy, for Audit, from 1st April, 1849, to 31st March, 1850, in <title level="m">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy</title> (1836-1869), Vol. 4, (1847-1850), p. cxxvi. He shared his Dublin address (Bedford House, Rathgar) with Charles Hanlon, elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1844.</note> Hanlon achieved intellectual acknowledgement of his contribution to historical research, for by 1854 he had become a member of the Kilkenny and South-East of Ireland Archaeological Society (<title level="m">Proceedings and Transactions</title> 8).</p>
<p>In Petrie's words (quoted above), Hanlon had engraved the designs "with an anxious fidelity" and Thomas Davis' review of the <title level="m">Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</title> was full of praise for his efforts: "The work is crowded with illustrations drawn with wonderful accuracy, and engraved in a style which proves that Mr. O'Hanlon [sic], the engraver, has become so proficient as hardly to have a superior in wood-cutting" (<title level="m">Round Towers</title> 107). These encomia do not, however, allow the modern reader to apprehend precisely what it is that Hanlon's images convey. Contemporary wood engravers could produce images of considerable refinement and complexity, as seen for example in the work issuing from Josiah Whymper's establishment in London, but for the most part Hanlon's images are shorn of all that virtuosity of line and tone. Only the handful of them that adopt a topographical procedure begin to approach it; the majority of them are deliberately prosaic. Now Petrie's text advances a view on Hanlon's illustration which bears on all this. As we have seen, he declares that "they make but slight pretensions to the character of works of art." They are not "showy," they have no "affectation of freedom of handling, or forcible effect," and they are not especially attractive; instead, they are "accurate", "trustworthy" and "may be considered as quotations". This last statement is the nub of it, for Petrie makes a claim here that puts forward the possibility of an unmediated image, as true to its original as a selection of text copied from a manuscript. </p>
<p>	The analogy is, however, a loose one. Accurate quotation from a text is possible because the only thing that might impede it would be physical damage to the original source, serious enough to make a word or letter impossible to decipher with confidence. Once damage is ruled out, it is of little consequence to the reader's understanding how the quotation is presented on the page. As long as it is legible, it doesn't matter that handwriting has become type or that one typeface or font has been substituted for another; when it comes to the transmission of a string of words, the choice of communicative vehicle is irrelevant. This is not, of course, to ignore the fact that the practice of editorial work may raise further questions about the corruption of the text, nor does it imply that it is possible simply though inspection to determine the meaning of a textual fragment, but it is to point out that the syntactic organization of a text is not affected by its being rendered in another script. With visual representation, however, the choice is crucial. Illustration is always and inevitably an act of interpretation where every decision about technique and materials acts as a form of editorial redaction that inevitably compromises the possibility of quotation.</p>
<p>If antiquarian representation as quotation is a problematic concept, it may perhaps be better illuminated with reference to the three cardinal distinctions drawn in Charles Sanders Peirce's semiotic system: index (where the signifier is directly connected to the signified), icon (where the signifier resembles the signified), and symbol (where the signifier's connection to what is signified is arbitrary or conventional). Peirce is clear that his definitions of semiosis refer to "modes of relationship" between sign vehicles (words, images, etc.) on the one hand and their referents on the other and that these modes are not mutually exclusive; signification may involve a combination of all these different forms of semiotic register.  Using his definitions, antiquarian illustration can be classified for the most part as predominantly iconic, but it is often, despite the illustrator's best efforts, tilted towards the symbolic. And this is so by virtue of the modes of depiction that all archaeological illustrations deploy. The recognition of the coded nature of archaeological illustration has long been understood. It can be found, for example, in remarks made by Stuart Piggott, who took a cue from Ernst Gombrich to write about the symbolic nature of visual communication in archaeology,  "the agreed code of conventions" employed by its illustrators that is informative only to those trained in its use (Piggott 165).<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" place="foot" n="2"> Piggott refers to Gombrich's <title level="m">Art and Illusion</title>, published in 1956.</note> Piggott's concern was primarily with the visual language of professional archaeology, but as a scholar of archaeological draftsmanship of the previous three hundred years he was aware that all forms of representation are artificial, even if the coding is so taken for granted that we cease to pay attention to it. Hanlon and his fellow nineteenth-century illustrators were necessarily bound by arbitrary and conventional modes of signification.</p>
<p>Petrie's notion of an illustration that can be classed as a quotation can be usefully investigated from Peirce's perspective. Before the advent of photography, the only representation that came close to working strictly in the sense Petrie claims was a cast or mold, which in Peirce's semiotic system would be classed as an indexical sign (where the signifier is directly connected to the signified). Needless to say, a cast that bids to offer a simulacrum of the original has to be colored and accurate coloration, if attempted at all, raises a whole new set of historical and technical problems; but in terms of its size and its  textural, formal, and iconographical data, a cast is normally as reliable as any "quotation", in the sense Petrie intended. As an example, we might consider the plaster cast of part of the Bayeux tapestry taken by Charles Alfred Stothard in 1816-17 and hand-colored by him. The cast supplemented Stothard's work at Bayeux for the Society of Antiquaries and probably helped him refine his visual record of the tapestry, which resulted in two engravings. Both of them were engraved by James Basire, Jr. The first was derived from Stothard's initial survey of the tapestry. Stothard took this back to Bayeux and colored it on the spot. The second, published in <title level="m">Vetusta Monumenta</title> (1819-22), shows a more exact rendering of the appearance of the tapestry, including details such as the stitching and variations in the disposition and color of the script.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" place="foot" n="3">

<p>Casts or molds of carved stone constitute a comparable case. The idea of taking casts to reproduce sculpture is first recorded in 1540, when the artists Francesco Primaticcio and Jacopo Vignola made molds of Roman sculpture and took them back to France to be cast in bronze for François I at Fontainebleau (MacGregor 76, 89). Thereafter, the taking of casts from sculpture spread widely throughout Europe. Cast collections initially comprised copies of classical sculpture and, from the eighteenth century, some of them included copies of Renaissance works as well. From at least the 1830s, a few examples of medieval sculpture were added to some cast collections, as with that of the École des Beaux Arts in Paris. As their remit widened, cast collections brought together simulations of sculpture and architecture in a panorama of human achievement. A good example is the Architectural Museum, established in London in 1851 by the architect George Gilbert Scott and his associates. Its cast collection was designed to become the core of a national museum of architecture (Bottoms 115-139). The Fine Arts courts on display at the Crystal Palace from the mid-1850s were much more ambitious, displaying casts and architectural ensembles from ancient Egypt to the present.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" place="foot" n="4"> See Jan Piggott <title level="m">Palace of the People: The Crystal Palace at Sydenham 1854-1936</title>,  London: C Hurst &amp; Co, 2004; Stephanie Moser <title level="m">Designing Antiquity Owen Jones, Ancient Egypt and the Crystal Palace</title>, New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2012.</note> The most long-lived such collection was the South Kensington Museum's Architectural Courts which opened in October 1873 (Bilbey 182-185).<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" place="foot" n="5"> This collection included casts of ornamental art that had been assembled from 1841 by the Government School of Design and were first displayed at Marlborough House in 1852 and also the architectural casts that had been prepared in the 1830s to guide the carvers working on the new Houses of Parliament. </note>  As the Crystal Palace example shows, the taking of casts from Irish monuments was coeval with these developments.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn6" place="foot" n="6"> In the Irish vestibule, casts from the churches of Freshford, Co. Kilkenny, and Rahan, Tullamore, Co. Offaly were on display from 1854. These were first shown in Dublin at the Great Industrial Exhibition (1853). See Samuel Phillips  <title level="m">Guide to the Crystal Palace and Park</title> (London, 1854).</note> The pioneer for this kind of reproduction was Henry O'Neill who exhibited casts of High Crosses at the Dublin International Industrial Exhibition in 1853 (Sproule).  His example was followed by Colonel G.T. Plunkett, Director of the Dublin Museum of Science and Art, who commissioned the cast reproduction of a number of Irish artifacts, including carvings from Newgrange and a number of High Crosses, between 1898 and 1907.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" place="foot" n="7"> The casting of the High Cross at Monasterboice was controversial, with complaints made about its scraping with metal implements to remove the lichen. See <title level="j">Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland</title>, vol. viii, 1898, pp.264-66 and vol. ix, 1899, pp.68-71.</note>
</p>
<p>The antiquary John Westwood took advantage of O'Neill's work to make rubbings from the casts on display and used the information so derived to amend J. D. Chambers' recent (1848) account of the iconography of the smaller Monasterboice cross.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" place="foot" n="8"> Published in <title level="j">The Ecclesiologist</title>, October, 1848. Chambers was a Fellow of Oriel College and Treasurer of the Ecclesiological Society.</note> Here then we have a case where the transmission from original to copy was so accurate as to allow new hypotheses to be advanced. In a letter he sent to the Royal Irish Academy in 1854 Westwood recommended that rubbings be taken of all Ireland's carved and inscribed monuments, to form a record of them before they were further damaged or destroyed, citing the example of the Reverend Charles Graves' rubbings from ogham stones.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" place="foot" n="9"> Letter dated 6 April, 1854; read 8 May 1854, <title level="j">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy</title>, vol. vi, 1853-7, pp. 77-80.  The Rev. Charles Graves was one of many scholars working to record ogham stones. Sir Samuel Fergusson's <title level="m">Ogham Inscriptions in Ireland, Wales and Scotland</title> (Edinburgh: David Davis, 1887) collated the information so gathered, although Fergusson found paper molds more reliable than rubbings for this work (<title level="a">Preface,</title> pp. vi-vii).
            </note>
</p>
<p>In Peircean terms a rubbing, like a mold, is also indexical, for the representation is produced by direct contact with its subject and traces what lies beneath the paper, but unlike a mold it cannot so easily be considered a "quotation." It shares the mold's limitation of translating one medium into another and likewise its inability to copy color automatically but, more damagingly,  it makes a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object and uses graphic marks to render a sculpted surface. But the rubbing is a good limit case to begin the exploration of modes in the imaging process. What a rubbing produces is an edited image, where the original object has been purged of all that is not essential to its apprehension. Or, rather, the rubbing hypostatizes our cognitive approach to the object, our intellectual as opposed to our sensual apprehension of it. </p>
<p>Effectively, the rubbing process distills from the monument a representation that is rich in information and treats as unnecessary distractions the visual and material qualities that suffuse the original. And this process of distillation is always present in antiquarian illustration, too. The antiquarian image, in other words, is best understood as a crystallization of cognitive assumptions about the object. But these assumptions are not uniform, and decisions made about where an object's significance lies—what aspect of it is most revealing and therefore requires visual capturing—may contain a number of motives.  The illustrator's choice of medium, technique, and presentation is likewise a mode of signification; the same object becomes transmuted under the impress of its different treatments. The question that arises from this is the extent to which the illustration resembles the object under scrutiny and what, in this context, we should take "resemble" to mean. For example, we readily accept two-dimensional and scaled presentations of  three-dimensional objects. Likewise, we accept that an illustration is not necessarily required to provide a facsimile presentation of all surface details. In these and related cases, the question of resemblance is settled by the discursive context which controls the production and consumption of the image. Depending on that context, the same feature may constitute significant evidence or be an adventitious distraction from the object's correct presentation.  It follows that if both motive and method affect the process of producing the image, it is certainly arguable that our designation of an illustration as faithfully resembling its original is as much a judgment about the illustrator's understanding of the conventions of visual recording in the specific circumstances of making the image as it is a judgment about accuracy in an absolute sense. Resemble, with its connotations of mediation, should not be confused with replicate.</p>
<p>In Peirce's system, because illustrations resemble their originals they are iconic even when their pictorial language is highly conventional (Harthshorne, Weiss, and Burke 279). Nevertheless, the question we need to ask is, what balance is struck between index, icon, and symbol in antiquarian illustration? As already indicated, the antiquarian image is often more symbolic than we might think and operates diagrammatically, for the adoption of an agreed or conventional usage pushes the illustration, no matter how naturalistic it appears, into the realm of the symbolic. Indeed it might be claimed that the diagram is essentially what the good antiquarian image has to be. No matter that they may use naturalistic conventions, the point of most antiquarian images is to display data that others may wish to analyze. In many presentations this requires the purging of unnecessary visual information. This is not, however, a remark that holds good for all antiquarian images—many of which contain, on this measure, superfluous detail—and so opens them to criticism informed by progressivist and teleological understandings of the transition from antiquarian to archaeological approaches in the study of the past. The analysis offered here is not intended to buttress that position, which ignores the specific protocols that affected the production of antiquarian images in different circumstances. What it does highlight, however, is the implicit logic of the idea that the antiquarian image is ineluctably a purveyor of information; this is what led Petrie to his declaration and his insistence on the rectitude of his illustrations.  </p>
<p>Sometimes, the beauty of the objects and the skill of the illustrator militate against this desideratum. The kinds of records made by skilled artists working in watercolor, especially those employed by the Society of Antiquaries or engaged by topographical and antiquarian publishers, demonstrate the extent to which accurate recording could find an accommodation with the aesthetic quality of fine art production. The engravings made from them were correspondingly rich in detail and vied with the best efforts of fine artists.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn10" place="foot" n="10"> See, for example, <ref target="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/SoA_images/detail.cfm?object=703" rend="new">James Basire's watercolor drawing of the Ribchester Helmet</ref>, made for the Society of Antiquaries in 1799. For an example of high quality work suitable for commercial publication, see Frederick Mackenzie's watercolor <title level="a">The South Ambulatory, Westminster Abbey</title> (1811; Tate). </note> With woodcut illustrations, however, the original drawings from which they mostly derive do not typically exhibit the fine art qualities a connoisseur of the time would recognize. Instead, the drawings tend to be efficient functional records, and the woodcut medium used to publish them encouraged a more straightforward treatment, with no distraction from color, limited tonal variety, and a predominantly linear style.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn11" place="foot" n="11"> See, for example, J. Lewis André <title level="a">Antiquarian Notes on the Rose</title>
<title level="j">Archaeological Journal</title> vol. lii, 1895, pp. 207-21.</note> A typical antiquarian woodcut emphasizes what the author wants the reader to notice, and what looks like a straightforward copy of the original motif is, in fact (and necessarily), a discriminating and focused vision.  </p>
<p>How, then, should we investigate Hanlon's illustrations? Can we reconcile Petrie's description of them as "quotations" with the selective, linear, and tendentious process that, I have suggested, is the antiquarian's customary approach to image production? To answer this question we can compare the woodcuts Hanlon supplied for Petrie and those he supplied for Wakeman and try to establish the different modes of illustration employed in those books. Although Hanlon's work for Petrie was much more extensive than it was for Wakeman (256 cuts as opposed to 91), the woodcuts share many characteristics.  One obvious explanation is that Hanlon's training encouraged him to use woodcuts in a particular way, but it would be wrong, I think, to give his technique too determinate a role. Petrie and Wakeman were both capable artists in their own right and Hanlon was given the job of working from sketches they had made in the field.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn12" place="foot" n="12"> Wakeman also made use of sketches of Bishop's Island by Robert Gabbett of Limerick  Wakeman, <title level="m">Archæologia Hibernica</title>, Preface, p. X); Petrie used some material supplied by Gabriel Beranger (Petrie, <title level="m">Ecclesiastical Architecture</title> p. 264).</note> Wakeman states merely that George Hanlon is "an artist of whose excellence as an engraver it is unnecessary here to speak" (Wakeman, x). And when Petrie refers to Hanlon's "anxious fidelity" he means fidelity to Petrie's original drawings, themselves made with an "anxious desire for rigid accuracy." So if the appearance of these illustrations is similar, and if their placement on the page follows the same pattern, this is not because their executant woodcutter's personality as engraver and designer was dictating the process; it is because the visual language of antiquarianism, its mode of discourse, was common to all three of the men involved.</p>

</figure>
<p>That singular expression, "mode of discourse," is apt insofar as anyone turning the pages of these books would not detect major differences in style from image to image; the overarching visual language is, to that extent, consistent. But there are, nevertheless, different approaches adopted for three different classes of image, and these may be graded nearer to or further away from Petrie's idea of  "quotation" from the original object. There are a few images which are essentially diagrams, either showing sections of architecture or comparative arrays of artifacts (Fig. 1). With these may be grouped those illustrations inserted into the text to substantiate a point in visual terms, but which do not attempt to engage the reader aesthetically, and although not diagrams per se, they do operate diagrammatically. Petrie's more generous provision of illustrations allows him to include much more of this kind of material than does Wakeman, and this profusion of visual examples helps anchor his argument throughout.  There is a further class of illustration that makes use of a properly three-dimensional representation but only displays that fragment of it which is necessary for the point made in the text (Fig. 2).

               Most of these are economical and practical to a degree, supporting a line of argument, but the addition of superfluous detail in some of them shows a willingness to go beyond the strictest needs of scholarship.</p>

<p>Distinguished from these woodcuts, however, are the vignette illustrations of prehistoric and medieval structures, which Petrie always lists as "views" (Fig. 3). By and large, all of these vignette illustrations are visually composed, they make full use of light and shade to articulate the object in question, and they include some of its landscape surroundings. The visual language here is tinged with the picturesque idiom one finds in contemporary illustrated tours, and in some cases these vignettes are indistinguishable from their equivalents in a book of picturesque beauties.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn13" place="foot" n="13"> Compare the illustrations in G.N. Wright <title level="m">Ireland Illustrated</title> (London, 1829-32) and N. P. Willis, J. Stirling Coyne and W.H. Bartlett <title level="m">The Scenery and Antiquities of Ireland</title> (1841).</note> The view format is where the idea of accurate "quotation" is at its weakest, for the antiquarian image cannot now distinguish itself from better established habits of visual engagement. The representation is too rich to be assimilated as a demonstration of a point, and its abundance of detail frustrates cognitive clarity. In these cases the spectator's customary aesthetic approach threatens to overwhelm the author's scholarly concerns. Here, surely, Hanlon's woodcuts evince more than "slight pretensions to the character of works of art": they are relatively "showy," and they do include "freedom of handling, or forcible effect," precisely the qualities Petrie claimed to have banished from the book.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn14" place="foot" n="14"> The visual language in the vignette of the larger tower at Clonmacnoise, for example, can be sharply distinguished from the diagrammatic account of masonry shown on the opposite page. (See Petrie, <title level="m">Ecclesiastical Architecture</title>, pp. 412-3.) This vignette is clearly related to Petrie's 1838 watercolor <title level="a">The Last Circuit of Pilgrims at Clonmacnoise</title> (National Gallery of Ireland) and brings to mind his declaration that in the watercolor his wish was "to produce an Irish picture somewhat historical in its object and poetical in its sentiment." See William Stokes, <title level="m">The Life and Labours in Art and Archaeology of George Petrie</title>, London: Longmans, Greene &amp; Co., 1868, p. 15.</note> In these picturesque vignettes, the paramount need for accuracy has given way to other desiderata.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to concentrate solely on these modes of presentation without considering wider contexts, given that image-making is both internally and externally differentiated from the overall visual matrix in which it operates. The circulation of images of Irish antiquity was not restricted to the antiquarian enterprise. Indeed, through their proselytizing for the preservation of Irish antiquities, Petrie, Wakeman, and others were fuelling a tourist interest in such remains and, beyond that, were binding Irish antiquities into a dignified historical narrative with implications that Irish nationalists were keen to develop. It is not entirely surprising, therefore, that occasionally the antiquarian and the picturesque domains of image-making overlap. Looking back over 150 years, we might regard the more picturesque images as compromising Petrie's claim of "quotation" and so detracting from the usefulness of the text from a scholarly point of view. After all, by the 1840s there existed a variety of illustrated antiquarian studies that paid scant heed to the picturesque and found their readership primarily in learned circles. But with respect to Irish antiquities and the urgent need to protect them from destruction, a text bereft of all aesthetic pleasure would have missed its chance to gain a large readership. By using copious amounts of woodcuts and including a variety of visual devices Petrie and Wakeman had an opportunity to disseminate sound antiquarian research very widely and help in the construction of a valid history of Ireland, a shared patrimony. In that sense, quotation could perhaps be accompanied by exhortation.</p>
