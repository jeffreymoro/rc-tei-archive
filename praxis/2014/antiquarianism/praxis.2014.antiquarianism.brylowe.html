            <p class="noCount">Counterintuitively, Josiah Wedgwood's Staffordshire-made clay replicas of the acclaimed
               ancient Roman glass vessel known to Britons as the Portland Vase exceeded the cultural
               authority of the Vase itself. The Wedgwood copies were celebrated as national treasures,
               extolled in paint and poem, and a copy remains on exhibit in the British Museum. Both
               Benjamin West's painting <em>Manufactory Giving Support to Industry</em> (1791) and Erasmus Darwin's <em>The Botanic Garden</em> (1791), which includes illustrations of the Vase by William Blake, offered tribute
               to Wedgwood’s copies. Wedgwood's achievement was not merely a technological or aesthetic
               triumph. He also managed to harness competing discourses held by classical antiquarians
               and Royal Academicians regarding the nature and status of the copy.</p>

               <h2><span class="head"> </span></h2>
               <p>The mediation of antique vases was part of a larger project that domesticated Greek
                  and Roman classicism so that it could be claimed as part of English heritage. The
                  Portland Vase serves as a useful example of Romantic-era management of antiquity as
                  both economic and cultural capital, and it points to a multifaceted mediation of ancient
                  artifacts that crosses and complicates the categories of art and craft. While it is
                  true that reproduction has produced an aura of originality around the ancient Portland
                  Vase, a priceless Roman artifact housed in the British Museum, there was a time in
                  the 1790s when the original had less cultural authority than its copies. In fact,
                  the copies had so much authority that they were taken up by artists, who preferred
                  them to the original Vase. Raymond Williams argued that the movement from individual
                  to institutionalized patronage of the arts occurred concomitantly with the professionalization
                  of cultural producers. Terms like "artist," "artisan," and "craftsman," according
                  to Williams, came to signify the ways in which made objects were mediated through
                  the market, their institutional status, their means of production, and their intended
                  or perceived purpose (44-52). Taking up this unstable relationship between art and
                  craft, I want to consider the Wedgwood copies of the Portland Vase as well as two
                  instances where Wedgwood's factory-made copies were celebrated in genres that can
                  comfortably be described as "high" art—or at least genres we agree are not craft.
                  Those examples are Erasmus Darwin's inclusion of the Vase in his poem <em>The Botanic Garden</em> and Benjamin West's oil-on-paper study for <em>Manufactory Giving Support to Industry</em>. Both Darwin's poem and West's painting are dated 1791, the year after Wedgwood first
                  displayed his jasperware copies of the Portland Vase. There are several reasons Darwin
                  and West's artistic tributes prefer native copies over the Roman original. Foremost,
                  the copies declare English genius. Josiah Wedgwood invented and perfected a clay process
                  he named "jasperware," which was well suited for the imitation of cameo glass—but
                  the copies served the added function of domesticating the Continental Other, of making
                  the distant past into a consumable product of the present.</p>
               <p>More to Williams' point, the inclusion of his copies of the Vase in these works of
                  art points to Wedgwood's ability to leverage competing institutions whose missions
                  were to promote contemporary art on the one hand and antiquity on the other. London
                  artists struggled for legitimacy and market share, and classical antiquarians were
                  often also art collectors and connoisseurs. The classical antiquarians who sought
                  to guide artists' taste through publications like those funded by the Society of Dilettanti
                  were also likely collectors of the art they "encouraged." English artists maintained
                  a complex and sometimes vexed relationship to collectors, who were accused of preferring
                  the old over the new. William Hogarth acknowledged this tension in several satiric
                  prints, including his 1761 <a class="new" href="http://metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/90038629?rpp=20%26pg=1%26ao=on%26ft=etching%26what=Etchings%26who=William+Hogarth%26pos=3"><em>Time Smoking A Picture</em></a>, in which Time, having lost his usual robe, looks rather like a fleshed-out angel
                  of Death. This Father Time sits on broken antique statuary, his smoke varnishing an
                  Old Master painting into obscure ruin as his sickle pierces the canvas. While most
                  English artists genuinely shared a taste for classical art, they needed collectors
                  to support them by purchasing contemporary, native artwork. Practically, this meant
                  that both artists and antiquarians had a stake in saying what counted as art. Pierre
                  Bourdieu has argued that competing producers of fine art "consecrate and underscore
                  critical differences" in order to highlight their own theory of taste; but I want
                  to show that Wedgwood's apotheosis occurred because he minimized the differences between
                  the theories of copying put forth by antiquarians and artists (Bourdieu 51, 65).</p>

                  <p>Before it was known as the Portland Vase, the so-called "Barberini Vase" was a tourist
                     destination, and the Vase has been included in antiquarian accounts of classical antiques
                     since the late sixteenth century (Jenkins and Sloan 187). The Barberini family, whose
                     fabulous art collection was housed in a family palazzo designed by Bernini and completed
                     in 1633, owned the Vase from the year 1626, three years after Maffeo Barberini was
                     named Pope Urban VIII, to somewhere around 1780, when Donna Cordelia Barberini-Colonna
                     sold it to a Scotsman to pay off her gambling debts. Over the course of the seventeenth
                     and early eighteenth centuries, the Palazzo Barberini was a frequent stop for British
                     Grand Tourists visiting Rome (Walker 21). However, seeing the Vase in person was not
                     a prerequisite for writing about it. The antiquarian Pierre d'Hancarville was author
                     of the tremendously influential <em>Antiquités Etrusques, Grecques, et Romaines tirées du Cabinet de M. Hamilton</em> (hereafter <em>AEGR</em>), which lavishly displayed the collection of Sir William Hamilton, who would eventually
                     bring the Vase to London. Volume II of <em>AEGR</em>, brought out in 1770, acknowledges the Vase's fame, confirms the prevailing notion
                     that it was a funerary urn containing the ashes of the Emperor Severus, and takes
                     note of its unique composition: "it is a sort of paste of two coats of colours, of
                     which, one detatching itself from the other, by the difference of its tint, is worked
                     with the turn, in the same manner as the finest Cameos" (2:74). The passage goes on
                     to say the Vase is housed in the Palazzo Farnese, not the Palazzo Barberini, suggesting
                     that either d'Hancarville had confused its location or that the Vase had already been
                     moved as a result of Barberini family insolvency. Hamilton did not apparently see
                     the Vase until a decade later, after Donna Cordelia had sold it to James Byres, the
                     aforementioned Scottish antiques dealer (Jenkins and Sloan 187). Nevertheless, he
                     would have been aware of the Vase through numerous antiquarian publications.

                     </div> Hamilton was the English Envoy to the Court of Naples from 1764 to 1800. His acquisition
                     of the Portland Vase sometime in 1782 was probably profit-driven, motivated by the
                     expense of his collecting and publishing efforts. He seems to have acquired the Vase
                     on a £1000 bond with a 5% interest rate, suggesting he must have planned to dispose
                     of it with relative haste (Jenkins and Sloan 187). Hamilton's speculation clearly
                     paid off; by January of 1784 it was in the hands of the Duchess of Portland, who bought
                     it for 1800 guineas.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Hamilton's collection, the publication of <em>AEGR</em>, and his location in Naples consolidated his authority on matters of antiquarian
                     taste, and he was interested in encouraging English artists and artisans to take up
                     classical design in contemporary production. D'Hancarville warns artists away from
                     simply copying the style of their masters, urging them instead to attend to the principles
                     of classical art. The introduction to the first volume of <em>AEGR</em> explains that part of the book's purpose is to serve as a collection of superior models
                     "in order that the Artist who would INVENT in the same stile, or only COPY the monuments
                     which appeared to him worthy of copied may do so with as much truth and precision
                     as if he had the Originals themselves in his possession" (1: vi). And indeed, engravings
                     from the work served as models for contemporary paintings.

                              Sleeping in the Garden. The two images are reproduced in the introduction the Taschen
                              edition of AEGR 32-33 and in Siegel 51-53.</span></div>
                     </div> However, d'Hancarville made sure readers understood it was not only painters he and
                     Hamilton had in mind. The text goes on to assert: <span class="quote">‘[W]e make an agreable [<em>sic.</em>] present to our Manufacturers of earthen ware and China, and to those who make vases
                        in silver, copper, glass, marble &amp;c. Having employed much more time in working than
                        in reflexion, and being besides in great want of models, they will be very glad to
                        find here more than two hundred forms, the greatest part of which are absolutely new
                        to them.... (1: xx)’</span> The arrogant tone of the introduction, especially in statements like those quoted
                     above, makes it easy to see how artists and artisans might complain of antiquarian
                     interference in matters of their own professional authority. As organizations like
                     the Society of Dilettanti and later the Committee of Taste, which included the outspoken
                     antiquarian Richard Payne Knight after 1802, claimed to know art better than institutionally
                     sanctioned fine artists did, authority over matters of taste was a source of conflict.

                              to the Arts in England, which articulates the problem in terms of the relative craftiness
                              of Italian dealers in antiquity vis-à-vis the foolishness of British collectors (75).</span></div>

               </div>
               <p>Josiah Wedgwood was less interested in arbitrating taste than he was in ensuring he
                  was on the right side of it; a businessman who wanted to produce and profit on the
                  sale of pots, he recognized Hamilton's importance and his authority on matters of
                  taste. Wedgwood was said to have his own problems with fine artists, and in a letter
                  dated 13 September 1769 he complained of their "coxcombical manners" and said he "would
                  rather Man for Man have to do with a shop of Potters than Painters" (120). Wedgwood's
                  library was filled with antiquarian publications, and he had London connections that
                  offered access to engraved proofs of <em>AEGR</em> well before the volumes were brought out (Irwin, 
                  “Design”
                  289). In fact, Wedgwood's letters offer evidence that English fine artists <em>did</em> compete with antiquarian prints. In 1776, he wrote to his business partner in London
                  attempting to cancel an expensive commission to John Flaxman, suggesting that engravings
                  of ancient gems might serve as acceptable models for "little more than five shillings"
                  (Irwin, 
                  “Design”
                  289). Under Hamilton's influence, Wedgwood had gone so far as to name the Staffordshire
                  works he began construction on in 1768 
                  “Etruria,”
                  in honor of the pots Hamilton collected, which were thought to be of ancient Etruscan
                  origin.</p>
               <p>As far as the Portland Vase was concerned, Hamilton maintained his economic and cultural
                  interest by retaining the right to display it at the Society of Antiquaries and even
                  to copy it, despite its sale to the Duchess of Portland. Though the Vase was no longer
                  his, he nevertheless commissioned Cipriani to make drawings that were subsequently
                  made into <a class="new" href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/system_pages/beta_collection_introduction/beta_collection_object_details/beta_collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=763256%26objectId=3136411%26partId=1">copperplates by Francesco Bartolozzi</a> (Wills 197). The prints were published by John Boydell, who in 1786 was still in
                  Cheapside but was already advancing his scheme for the Shakspeare Gallery that would
                  move his expanded operations to Pall Mall. The Society of Antiquaries noted in its
                  minutes of 11 March 1784 that "having been for many Years in the possession of that
                  Noble [Barberini] Family &amp; considered by them, &amp; all Travellers of Taste &amp; Judgement,
                  as a Cimelium of extraordinary Curiosity &amp; Value," it was presented to them by Hamilton
                  with no indication that he was not the owner of it (qtd. Wills 198). Thus the Vase
                  accrued <em>English</em> cultural capital as it was remarked upon by important institutional arbiters of taste
                  at both the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Academy.</p>
               <p>The president of the Royal Academy, Sir Joshua Reynolds, also endorsed the Vase before
                  Josiah Wedgwood's involvement with it. After the Duchess had secretly owned it for
                  but a short time, she died. Upon her death, the contents of her extensive collection
                  were put up for auction. The Vase was purchased by the Duke of Portland, the Duchess's
                  third son. Horace Walpole wrote, "In August of 1786 Sir Joshua spent a few days at
                  Bulstrode with the Duke of Portland, whose adviser he seems to have been in his purchase
                  of the famous Vase for a thousand pounds" (qtd. in Wills 201). In fact, the sum of
                  purchase was somewhat more than Walpole indicates, but Reynolds' authority did encourage
                  the Duke to keep the Vase in the family—and it would be Reynolds as well as Hamilton
                  on whom Josiah Wedgwood would rest his own authority as he transformed the Vase from
                  a singular work of fine art into a reproduced commodity. Its success went beyond the
                  quality of the copy. Wedgwood's ability to garner high-profile endorsements from both
                  antiquarians and the institutionally sanctioned London art world put him in an excellent
                  position before work on the copies ever began.</p>
               <p>More generally, Wedgwood used both the whims of domestic fashion and export markets
                  to expand his name and business. Marx might have been thinking of Wedgwood when he
                  noted that industrialization stimulated the creation of new markets as well as "more
                  thorough-going exploitation of the old ones" (478). Josiah Wedgwood was acutely attentive
                  to the taste of the consumers he served, and as early as the 1770s, he recognized
                  that overproduction called for a larger market in order to sell existing stock: "&amp;
                  nothing but a foreign market ... will ever keep [our stock] within a tolerable bounds"
                  (qtd. in McKendrick, 
                  “Marketing”
                  426). He had initially made a name for himself making creamware, which was to be split
                  off into his lines of "useful" wares, as opposed to the "ornamental" wares that his
                  partner Thomas Bentley, a cloth manufacturer with a classical education, encouraged
                  Wedgwood to develop. Wedgwood's letters indicate his deference to Bentley in matters
                  of taste. In one particularly telling example, Wedgwood points out his dependence
                  on Bentley's knowledge of Continental and Antique fashions. In September of 1769,
                  he wrote: <span class="quote">‘If you continue to write such letters as the last [detailing classical fashions]
                     there is no saying where our improvements will stop. I read it over, &amp; over again,

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wedgwood was willing to be directed, but he also understood how to use his relationship
                     to Hamilton. As he was negotiating access to the Portland Vase, he also instructed
                     Bentley to show wares Hamilton "&amp; a few other Connoisieurs not only to have their
                     advice but to have the advantage of their puffing them ... as they will, by being
                     consulted, and flatter'd agreeably, as you know how, consider themselves as sort of

                     “Marketing”
                      414). Wedgwood's genius lay partly in this deference, partly in his brilliant ability
                     to exploit what he learned, and partly in his capacity for applying scientific experiment
                     to the process of manufacture. Jasper was the only real invention of Josiah Wedgwood
                     in terms of clay composition, and he worked for years perfecting it (Buten 139).

                  <p>Wedgwood wasted no time in congratulating the Duke of Portland in his acquisition
                     of his vase at auction. Three days after the sale, 10 June 1786, Wedgwood and the
                     Duke had drawn up an agreement whereby Wedgwood borrowed both the Vase and a glass
                     cameo from the same auction lot in order to produce accurate copies (Mankowitz 20).
                     Wedgwood understood what he had. Later on the 24<span class="sup">th</span> of June, Wedgwood wrote a very long letter to Hamilton.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> In the letter, he explained that he had begun "to count how many different ways the
                     vase itself may be copied to suit the tastes, the wants &amp; purses of different purchasers,"
                     explaining that he could envision making cheap, all-white biscuit copies for artists,
                     copies with a painted blue background for middle-class collectors, and polished jasperware
                     copies for the richest collectors. At the same time, he was acutely aware of costs,
                     worrying to Hamilton that it would take a team of the best engravers and modelers,
                     who would have to be bought out of their current employments—and it would cost "£5000
                     for the execution of such a vase, supposing our best artists capable of the work."
                     In the end, he used his own labor and the labor of the modelers already employed by
                     the factory, and by 1790 he had garnered twelve subscriptions, which helped defray
                     some of the costs (Mankowitz 31).</p>

                  <p>In the same letter of 24 June, he also asked for advice in terms of improving what
                     he saw as imperfections in the Vase. Perhaps Wedgwood saw in <em>AEGR</em> what Hamilton himself could not. Hamilton's book had promised accuracy, but in the
                     process of translating three-dimensional artifacts onto engravings on paper, it idealized
                     ancient vases into neoclassical versions of themselves (Coltman). These inaccuracies
                     were not ungoverned error. Rather, accuracy was mediated through a network of the
                     visual materials produced in contemporary antiquarian publications, which on the whole
                     represent what we might think of as a "way of seeing" that idealized and remade the
                     antique.

                     </div> Wedgwood, in keeping with <em>AEGR</em>'s prescription to manufacturers, had initially tried to copy the Vase from prints.
                     Upon access to the original, he acknowledged the significant gap between antiquarian
                     engravings and the real artifact: <span class="quote">‘When first I engaged in this work I had Montfaucon only to copy, I proceeded with
                        spirit, and sufficient assurance that I should be able to equal, or excel if permitted,
                        that copy of the vase; but now that I can indulge myself with full and repeated examinations
                        of the original work itself, my crest is much fallen, and I should scarcely muster
                        sufficient resolution to proceed if I had not, too precipitately perhaps, pledged
                        my self to many of my friends to attempt it in the best manner I am able. Being so
                        pledged, I must proceed, but shall stop at certain points till I am favored with your
                        kind advice and assistance. (Mankowitz 22)’</span> Wedgwood's initial reliance on paper vases and his crestfallen reaction at seeing
                     the original tells us first that he was aware of the commercial potenital in the Barberini
                     Vase before it came to London—but more importantly, it registers the gap between the
                     usual procedure of copying from copies and the unmediated confrontation with what
                     Keats in his 1816 Ode would call the "unravished bride," the unmediated Vase, with
                     all its unyielding meaning.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In turn, manufacturers were not simply copying antiquity from prints; they sought
                  to further improve upon it. Moreover, Wedgwood saw it as his purview to improve the
                  taste of consumers as much as Hamilton had improved the taste of manufacturers. Nevertheless,
                  in reply Hamilton wrote: "You are very right in there being some little defects in
                  the drawing; however, it would be dangerous to touch that, but I should highly approve
                  of your restoring in your copies what has been damaged by the hands of time" (qtd.
                  in Wills 201). This exchange demonstrates not only that Wedgwood deferred to authority
                  on matters of taste but that Hamilton could not see that antiquarian engravings irrevocably
                  changed what they mediated or that his own publications were as guilty of inaccuracy
                  as were the English artists whose work they sought to guide. </p>
               <p>At the same time, of course, London artists also sought to guide and improve the taste
                  of the nation. Joshua Reynolds' annual addresses to students of the Royal Academy
                  were published as his widely read <span style="font-style:italic">Discourses on Art</span>. He wrote in his very first Discourse, delivered 2 January 1769 as the inaugural
                  lecture of the newly founded Royal Academy, that the fine artists of his new institution
                  would, by virtue of their own superior taste, serve "the inferior ends" of manufactures
                  while remaining above the commercial fray (13). While Discourse I is clearly less
                  directive than <em>AEGR</em>'s introduction when it comes to "our Manufacturers of earthen ware and China," its
                  tone regarding the inferiority of the commodified goods is consistent. Professional
                  artists and their institutions assumed their superiority over the manufacturers as
                  comfortably as the antiquarians did over them. Whatever Wedgwood may have thought
                  of these "coxcombical manners," he negotiated the situation with his usual deference
                  and finesse.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The genesis of Wedgwood's question to Hamilton is suggested by Reynolds' sixth Discourse,
                     he argues that artists should both copy from antiquity and labor to improve upon their
                     subjects: "He who borrows an idea from an ancient ... can hardly be charged with plagiarism
                     ... But an artist should not be contented with this only; he should endeavor to improve
                     what he is appropriating for his own work" (107).

                              of copying and improvement, largely in the context of interior design, and she argues
                              that Reynolds' claims in Discourse VI form the theoretical justification for artists'
                              and artisans' copies of antique designs.</span></div>
                     </div> While d'Hancarville and Hamilton were telling artists to steer clear of their masters'
                     prejudices and return to the principles of the ancients, those very masters, Reynolds
                     among them, were advising artists to take the ancients as a starting point, and to
                     improve upon them by remaking them based on the modern principles presented in the <em>Discourses</em>. Wedgwood's philosophy on copying deftly incorporated Reynolds's position while citing
                     Hamilton as its source. As Wedgwood explained on 28 June 1789 to Erasmus Darwin: <span class="quote">‘I only pretend to have attempted to copy the fine antique forms, but not with absolute
                        servility. I have endeavored to preserve the stile and spirit or if you please the
                        elegant simplicity of the antique forms, and so doing to introduce all the variety
                        I was able, and this Sir W. Hamilton assures me I may venture to do, and that is the
                        true way of copying the antique. (<em>Letters</em> 307)’</span> On 15 June 1790, Reynolds wrote of the fifteenth copy of the Vase, which he examined
                     personally, "I can venture to declare it a correct and faithful imitation, both in
                     regard to general effect, and the most minute detail of the parts."
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>As cited in Mankowitz, who also notes that the accuracy of Wedgwood's copy was endorsed
                              by "The Duke of Portland himself, The Earl of Leicester, President of the Society
                              for Antiquaries, and Sir Joseph Banks, Bt., ... the respected President of the Royal
                              Society" (35). </span></div>
                     </div> Wedgwood's hybrid marketing technique owed more to the London art world than to its
                     mere endorsement of his product. Wedgwood by this time had begun to mark his pottery
                     and issue descriptive catalogues as well, which was unusual for a manufacturer (Buten
                     9). These catalogues link him to the art field in both their physical appearance and
                     their size, and, perhaps more importantly, in the way they connected the object described
                     in the printed catalogue to a metropolitan gallery space where those objects were
                     on display (in this case Wedgwood's Soho showroom). These ties to fine art, in turn,
                     strengthened the legitimacy of his Portland Vase copies.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Like Boydell, another great cultural entrepreneur of the 1790s, Wedgwood used a combination
                  of print advertisement, ticket sales, and catalogues to generate excitement and anticipation
                  over an end product that took years to produce. Boydell, a London Alderman, was the
                  proprietor of the Pall Mall Shakspeare Gallery, which commissioned paintings for display
                  in the gallery and sold engraved facsimiles of those paintings. Just as Boydell printed
                  catalogues and sold subscriptions to his high-profile engravings of scenes taken from
                  Shakespeare, so Wedgwood sold subscriptions to his early Portland Vase copies, used
                  gallery-style showrooms, and printed catalogues.</p>
               <p>The analogy between Wedgwood and Boydell is worth pursuing in this instance, since
                  both trafficked on the fame of an original to sell copies. Whereas Boydell's engravers
                  contemporary painted canvasses onto copper, Wedgwood transformed ancient artifacts
                  into contemporary jasperware. Their tactics were strikingly similar—and so were their
                  overreachings. Wedgwood garnered twenty subscriptions for his first edition of the
                  Portland Vase with a final price between thirty and fifty guineas each (Keynes 248).
                  As early as 1786, he had planned the subscriptions, as he wrote to Hamilton: <span class="quote">‘Several gentlemen have urged me to make my copies of the vase by subscription, and
                     have honored me with their names for that purpose; but I tell them, and with great
                     truth, that I am extremely diffident of my ability to perform the task they kindly
                     impose on me; and that they shall be perfectly at liberty, when they see the copies,
                     to take or refuse them; and on these terms I accept of subscriptions, chiefly to regulate
                     the time of delivering out the copies, in rotation, according to the dates on which
                     they honor me with their names. (<em>Letters</em> 296)’</span> In spite of the technical and aesthetic success Wedgwood ultimately achieved, half
                  the subscribers chose not to take the copy they had agreed to pay for (Keynes 248).
                  As with the Boydell Shakspeare Gallery, subscriptions served to drum up public interest,
                  inasmuch as prominent members of society signed on and subscription lists were widely
                  circulated, but in the final analysis they failed to bring about financial success.
                  In spite of their fame and acclaim, both the Shakspeare Gallery and the Wedgwood Portland
                  Vase copies were ultimately financial failures, although as public spectacles celebrating
                  the possibilities of commercial art, both were tremendously successful. Although both
                  Boydell's and Wedgwood's designs for a financial payoff may have been thwarted, neither
                  man's firm was ruined by his venture. Alderman Boydell died around the same time his
                  Shakspeare Gallery stock was sold off by lottery, but the firm went on with his nephew
                  Josiah Boydell at the helm. In Wedgwood's case, the fame of the undertaking and the
                  invention of jasperware far outweighed the fact that so few copies of the Portland
                  Vase actually sold. The popularity of the Portland Vase generated traffic in Wedgwood
                  showrooms, which multiplied across London and the Continent.</p>
               <p>Ultimately, Wedgwood copies of the Portland Vase upstaged the Vase itself, demonstrating
                  Wedgwood's success in doing precisely what engravers of the Romantic period could
                  not quite manage: producing the notion that a reproduced, manufactured product that
                  many hands had labored to produce was worthy of the consecrated status of art object.
                  Boydell's attempts to transform English engravers into household names went only as
                  far as William Woolett, who engraved an incredibly successful print of West's <em>Death of General Wolf</em> for Boydell before he opened the Shakspeare Gallery (Bruntjen 36). It is likely that
                  his success at making Woolett a household name planted a seed of the Shakspeare Gallery,
                  a gallery that sold English Engravings of English paintings on specially made English
                  paper. However, the idea that an engraver might be as much an artist as a painter
                  did not sit well with painters, who (with the notable exception of Benjamin West)
                  regularly blocked engravers' attempts at full membership in the Royal Academy over
                  the course of the Romantic period. English pots, made of English clay, however, didn't
                  have to compete with living artists and their ideas about originality. In copying
                  the antique, Wedgwood did not compete with any living artist; he was free to scoop
                  up his native clay and make from it a new body, cast from the ancient legacy of this
                  Roman vessel.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">* * *</span></h2>
               <p>Josiah Wedgwood made his friend Erasmus Darwin a present of the first perfected copy
                  of the Portland Vase (Keynes 248). In turn, some seventy-seven lines of Canto II of
                  Darwin's 
                  “The Economy of Vegetation”
                  are devoted to ceramics, with a view to celebrating Wedgwood as the culmination of
                  some two millennia of the art form's development. The Canto, addressed to the elemental
                  Gnomes of Earth, mentions "Portland's mystic urn" in the context of a list of Wedgwood's
                  accomplishments, and it also refers readers to a four-page endnote, which interprets
                  the images on the surfaces of the Vase as depicting the Eleusinian mysteries. As a
                  whole, Darwin's second Canto celebrates various geologic discoveries and phenomena,
                  including the section that narrates the development of pottery from China to Etruria
                  to Wedgwood's Stoke-on-Trent works. The Gnomes: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">[P]leased on WEDGWOOD ray your partial smile,</div>

               <p> With such an endorsement from the spirits of the earth, Wedgwood's "bold Cameo speaks"
                  and his "soft Intaglio thinks" (310). Wedgwood, "Friend of Art," that he is, has the
                  authority to copy "the fine forms on PORTLAND'S mystic urn" (313, 320). The Vase's
                  decorations are ekphrastically described in lines 321-340, but the copy is given far
                  more imaginative space than is the original. After all, there is no mention of a Roman
                  artist or even a cameo glass body. The Gnomes of this Canto are concerned with Chinese,
                  then Italian, then English <em>clay</em>—but never Roman glass.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Darwin evidently felt that a visual representation of the Vase was important enough
                     to delay publication of his <em>Botanic Garden</em> until his publisher, Joseph Johnson, could supply engravings of it (Brooks 152). Darwin
                     had wanted to include the engravings Hamilton had commissioned when it was initially
                     brought to London. Perhaps it was natural that Darwin would have thought of Bartolozzi's
                     recently made Portland Vase engravings as he wrote his poem, but Hamilton held the
                     copyright on Bartolozzi's engravings, so Johnson had no choice but to hire someone
                     to re-engrave the Vase. There is no evidence that his employee, William Blake, who
                     Johnson assured Darwin was "certainly capable of making an exact copy of the vase,"
                     ever actually examined the original (qtd. in Keynes 251).

                              to the original Vase (e.g., Bentley 108). Some sources simply leave ambiguity, but
                              some do suggest Blake did have access to it (e.g., Brooks 152). However, Brooks misattributes
                              Bartolozzi's engraving of the Vase as Blake's of 1791. It seems unlikely given Blake's
                              relatively low professional status that he would have been given access to it, and
                              even less likely that, given the gossip surrounding the Vase's movements and visitors,
                              that if he had been given access there would be no mention of it. Moreover, it was
                              …</span></div>
                     </div> Blake certainly did ask to see Bartolozzi's engravings, however, in July of 1791,
                     when Blake began work on new versions of the illustrations (Keynes 251). Both Blake's
                     pictures and Darwin's poem relied on prints, textual analyses and Wedgwood copies—copies
                     of copies, cycled over again through the "Mill &amp; Machine" of English presses.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Blake's illustrations of the compartments look enough like Bartolozzi's to suggest
                     that Bartolozzi was probably Blake's only source. One notable difference between Bartolozzi's
                     1786 engravings and Blake's copies of them is the introduction of fig leaves, which
                     must have been Johnson's emendation. Darwin himself would have been perfectly happy
                     to use Cipriani's designs, which, of course, contained fully nude male figures. In
                     1786, the Vase, which had been on display at the Society of Antiquaries and was now
                     the recent acquisition of the Duke of Portland, was an antiquarian art object; but
                     reading audiences were a more diverse lot than the connoisseurs who might have been
                     expected to purchase a folio of expensive prints. Johnson's care in protecting readers
                     from visual indelicacy shrewdly anticipates a more widescale practice of "improving"
                     classical antiquity to make it palatable for an array of British readers.

                     </div> Such a practice was sanctioned by Reynolds' authorization, in the <em>Discourses</em>, to improve upon ancient designs, and this particular improvement was a wise decision,
                     given the number of editions the book went through.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In Darwin's note, the ekphrastic description of the Vase contains no information that
                  could not be gleaned from the engravings. Using a teleological narrative that starts
                  in ancient China and arrives at Britannia's Etruria, Darwin implies that Wedgwood
                  represents the apex of pottery's technological development. In case the verse leaves
                  any doubt in readers' minds about what he means, Darwin includes this footnote: <span class="quote">‘In real stones, or in paste or soft coloured glass, many pieces of exquisite workmanship
                     were produced by the antients. Basso-relievos of various sizes were made in coarse
                     brown earth of one colour; but of the improved kind of two or more colours, and of
                     a true porcelain texture, none were made by the ancients, nor attempted, I believe
                     by the moderns, before those of Mr. Wedgwood's manufactory. (89)’</span> In fact, Wedgwood is mentioned in three of the four substantive footnotes in Section
                  VI of Canto II, which also includes an interleaved engraving of two of Wedgwood's
                  commemorative medallions. Darwin's puffery certainly afforded Wedgwood public exposure:
                  <em>The Botanic Garden</em> went through several editions over the course of the Romantic period in London, Derby,
                  Dublin, and New York; a French translation appeared in 1799, a Portugese in 1803,
                  and a German translation was brought out in 1810.</p>
               <p>In Darwin's long footnote that interprets the Vase's designs, Josiah Wedgwood himself—not
                  Hamilton or any of Wedgwood's carefully selected Portland Vase endorsers—is positioned
                  as the expert on the artifact. Contrary to positions taken by antiquarians or fine
                  artists, Darwin finds the pinnacle of aesthetic perfection in neither in ancient classical
                  artifacts nor in native fine art. It is extraordinary that Wedgwood could have accomplished
                  such a feat, but in Darwin's poem, the manufactured craft object has more cultural
                  credibility than the work of art. In a striking example of the Benjaminian formula,
                  Wedgwood's reproductions not only disrupt the authority of the original work of art—they
                  supplant it.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>A painting by Benjamin West further demonstrates that Wedgwood's Portland Vase copies
                     achieved consecration in the London art world. As they do in Darwin's poetry, Wedgwood's
                     copies of the Portland Vase occupy a central place in West's painting. David Irwin
                     goes so far as to suggest that it is "presumably Josiah Wedgwood's first copy" of
                     the Vase that appears in the painting, which would make it a representation of the
                     very copy he presented to Darwin (<em>Neoclassicism</em> 173). In 1787, West was commissioned to paint designs to be used as decorations on
                     the drawing room ceiling of the Queen's Lodge at Windsor. The Royal family had chosen
                     the site of Queen Anne's lodging for their new residence, and the Queen's Lodge was
                     the primary Royal Residence until it was razed after the death of both George III
                     and Charlotte (Loftie 38). West's ceiling designs were executed by a German decorator
                     named G.L. Haas, who had invented a sort of sand-art technique "to which no name ha[d]
                     yet been applied" at the time the ceilings were put up (<em>Windsor</em> 119). It involved gluing colored marble dust to canvas or board and apparently had
                     "all the force and effect of the best oil painting" (<em>Windsor</em> 119). Haas later took out newspaper advertisements calling his "entire new-invented"
                     technique "marmot-tinto," and he mounted an exhibit at the rooms at 19 Great-Pulteney
                     Street on 14 February of 1791.

                     </div> According to a contemporary guidebook, <em>The Windsor Guide</em>, "The Ceiling consists of several subjects. In the centre, in an oval, is genius

                     riches, depicted by emblematical figures in the different vocations, with the symbols
                     of several sciences" (119). In 1787, when West received the commission for the ceiling
                     designs, the Portland Vase copies were not yet been complete. It is impossible to
                     know exactly what the designs looked like, but West either changed his sketch to include
                     the Portland Vase copy, or he produced a second one after the fact.</p>

               <p>West's oil-on-paper sketch related to Haas's ceiling design, which bears the longer
                  name <em>Etruria or Manufactory Giving Support to Industry</em>; the sketch is known simply as <em>British Manufactory; A Sketch</em> or sometimes as <em>Etruria</em>. Suggestive of the designs on the Vase, the central vignette depicts two allegorical
                  female figures draped and dressed in classical garb as well as two naked boys, one
                  a cherub. The boys are handing up a Wedgwood copy as well as a rolled paper, presumably
                  a plan or paper model, to the seated figure of Industry, who is busily at work on
                  a jasperware vase. Behind her, Manufactory holds a wheat-colored drapery into which
                  a ceramic platter is nestled. At Industry's feet, various earthenware plates and vases
                  are piled. Behind her, other scenes taken from the British textile industry fill the
                  oval frame.</p>
               <p>Although the sketch included the Portland Vase, the ceiling probably did not, since
                  the date of the sketch is well after the date of the ceiling (Helmut Von Effra and
                  Allen Staley 412). <em>The Windsor Guide</em> reports that the ceiling was "affixed up" early in 1789, two years before the sketch
                  is dated. That West changed his painting in the first place indicates the importance
                  and status of the Portland Vase copies. The ceilings in the Queen's Lodge were left
                  to Hass, a mere decorator who appears to have only exhibited once, in a rented room
                  at Golden Square. West's sketch, by contrast, was exhibited in the consecrated space
                  of Somerset House. It is striking that the relationship of West's original vis-à-vis
                  Hass's decorative copy is so radically different from the Vase's status as an object
                  copied by Wedgwood, a craftsman known for producing decorative arts. It is even possible
                  that West changed the design to include the Portland Vase as a response to Haas's
                  exhibition, which went up just a few months before the Royal Academy's annual exhibition.
                  If true, it serves to highlight the way Reynolds's directives regarding painterly
                  improvement on originals might have been deployed to maintain a hierarchy where fine
                  art trumps decorative craftwork.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In any event, the sketch was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1791 under the title <em>British Manufactory; A Sketch</em>. Before 1791, Etruria might have occupied the central spot in the ceiling medallion
                     because of a sort of pun: Wedgwood had renamed his creamware "Queen's Ware" in 1765
                     when George III named him "Potter to the Queen," so decorations for the so-called
                     Queen's Lodge might well have put the Queen's Potter in the center of the design.

                              damaged, because the King wished to see them (as cited in von Effra and Staley 412).

                     </div> However, after 1791, Wedgwood's successful copies of the Portland Vase gave West a
                     more specific reason to place Wedgwood front and center. The same year, West also
                     exhibited <em>British Commerce; A Sketch</em> and indeed most of West's exhibited work in the years before and after 1791 suggest
                     that he was producing allegorical designs celebrating British industry and trade (Graves
                     215). Taken as a whole, these sketches, designed to be reproduced on a large scale,
                     are reminiscent of James Barry's designs for the Great Hall of the Society of Arts,
                     Manufactures and Commerce. West's <em>British Manufactory</em>, if it does not exactly reference, certainly trafficks in the same imagery as Barry's
                     depiction of British commerce and manufacture in that series of paintings.</p>

                     happily achieved" (Society of Arts iii, iv). Although the paintings had been completed
                     and placed in the Great Room in 1783, they were contemporary news. West was adapting
                     Barry's visual celebration of the manufactures just as Barry was finishing up his
                     prints and distributing them to subscribers.

                     </div> The year 1791 saw first Haas's exhibition, then Barry's print, then West's sketch.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In May, Barry finished the engraving of his fourth Great Room frieze, <a class="new" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/barry-the-thames-or-the-triumph-of-navigation-t03785"><em>Commerce or the Triumph of the Thames</em></a>. The bottom right of Barry's picture is crowded with "Nereids," who carry "several
                  articles of our manufactures and commerce of Manchester, Birmingham, &amp;c." (Barry,
                  <em>Account</em> 61). In Barry's description of the picture, he explains: <span class="quote">‘[I]f those Nereids appear more sportive than industrious, and others still more wanton
                     than sportive, the Picture has more variety and I am sorry to add the greater resemblance
                     to the truth; for it must be allowed that if through the means of an extensive commerce,
                     we are furnished with incentives to ingenuity and industry, this ingenuity and industry
                     is but too frequently found to be employed in the procuring and fabricating such commercial
                     matters as are subversive to the very foundations of virtue and happiness. Our females...are
                     totally shamefully, and cruelly neglected, in the appropriation of trades and employments;
                     this is a source of infinite and most extensive mischief.... (<em>Account</em> 61-2)’</span> Barry quickly moves on from this bit of social commentary, claiming that he has treated
                  a serious subject lightly (<em>Account</em> 62). In this context, it is interesting that in place of sportive, wanton nymphs,
                  West offers the portrait of a somber female Industry. Wedgwood had been apprenticing
                  girls since the 1770s, so that by the early 1790s a small but significant portion
                  of Etruria's labor force was made up of women (McKendrick, 
                  “Discipline”
                  38). Records indicate that all together Wedgwood employed 278 men, women, and children
                  in 1790, each with a specific, repetitive task (McKendrick, 
                  “Discipline”
                  33). Where Barry offers nudity, West provides a subject fully clothed in classical
                  sandals, a sleeved peplos with a blue drapery, and a blue cecryphalus, or headband.
                  Where Barry offers water nymphs and wanton sport, West presents Industry employed
                  in decorating jasperware—the recently made most-famous example of English manufactory.</p>
               <p>West's vignettes toward the back of the painting also offer utopic settings of industrial
                  labor, wherein men, women and children appear perfectly at ease in their textile-making
                  employments. However, Etruria and its most famous ware remain the central focus. The
                  vase Industry is employed at painting has not been identified (von Effra and Staley
                  412). While West may not have had a specific Wedgwood vase in mind, the general shape
                  of the vase, a kind of lidded amphora, does suggest a reference to <em>Triumph of the Thames</em>, which includes an ormolu amphora depicted in the bottom right of Barry's painting.
                  Ormolu was a famous Birmingham production, pioneered by Mathew Boulton. Even as Barry
                  proposed his Great Room paintings, the fashion for the Frenchified ormolu was waning,
                  and Wedgwood's friend had moved on to minting coins (Uglow 416)—but in the post-1789
                  political climate vases like the one in Barry's painting were even less popular. The
                  invention of jasperware and the success of the Wedgwood copies of the Portland Vase
                  ensured that Josiah Wedgwood, with his prejudice against "<em>French &amp; Frippery</em>" and wares "<em>cover'd with ornament,</em>" gained supremacy over Matthew Boulton as the manufacturer most representative of
                  dominant English taste.</p>

An example of contemporary labor vignettes." class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>The painting portrays Industry <span class="foreign">in medias res</span>, before she has had a chance to take up the drawings or the Vase that the rather
                  buff <span class="foreign">putto</span> hands up to her. Industry and her allegorical support staff are depicted in classical
                  garb, in keeping with Reynolds' dictate in Discourse X that modern dress is to be
                  avoided "[h]owever agreeable it might be to the Antiquary's principles of equity and
                  gratitude" (187). Allegory combines with achievement to elevate Wedgwood's works above
                  the backgrounded labor vignettes, which are rendered in the more typical fashion.
                  West's textile vignettes resemble those in books like Pyne's <em>Microcosm, or, a Picturesque Delineation of the Arts, Agriculture, Manufactures &amp;c.</em>, which certainly valorizes English manufactory but does so in a conventional visual
                  genre. The Portland Vase copy is in the possession of the <span class="foreign">putti</span> who sit on the factory floor at Industry's feet, at once celebrating the Vase’s classical
                  origin at the same time it celebrates a contemporary achievement of mythic proportions.
                  As with Barry's depiction of Commerce, the sea and the English cliffs are vaguely
                  visible in the background, suggesting again that this English vase, worked by English
                  hands and made from English earth, is worthy of reverence.</p>

                  <p>Throughout this paper I have been speaking of Wedgwood as if he were the sole designer
                     and copier of the Portland Vase. Of course he was not. Just as West had a workshop
                     filled with unnamed assistants—whom Blake, writing in the margins of Reynolds' <em>Discourses</em>, derisively called "journeymen"—so Wedgwood employed modelers and mold-makers who
                     assisted him with the perfection of his jasperware copies. In our current moment,
                     the arts find themselves under intense political, economic and institutional scrutiny.
                     In the U.S., public arts funding came to the forefront of the 2012 presidential election
                     when the Republican candidate said he would stop funding the National Endowment for
                     the Arts. Under the current administration, funding continues a trend of decline.

                              6 August 2012, but it was repeated many times from August through November. Some information
                              on the general trend of public arts funding is available here.</span></div>
                     </div> At the same time, the economic value of "consecrated" art objects is in no danger.
                     The international art market continues to increase as the wealthy invest and trade
                     billions of dollars per year in commoditized objects of art and antiquity (Goodwin
                     1). The situation invites us to consider the attribution of value to art objects,
                     how value is created, and who produces it. Wedgwood's ability to smooth the facets
                     of factory production into a single end product bearing his name was new. However,
                     I think his ability to leverage factory production at the same time that he brought
                     together competing modes of institutional meaning was nothing short of remarkable.
                     Highly liminal, these objects were produced in a factory; they were distributed, like
                     prints or books, by subscription; they were displayed and catalogued like painting
                     or sculpture. They were a financial failure wrapped in aesthetic success.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The Portland Vase and its Wedgwood copies undoubtedly served to prop up each other's
                  aesthetic and economic value. Sir William's initial willingness to pay such an extravagant
                  sum for the Barberini Vase and the subsequent buzz the Vase generated in London made
                  Wedgwood's project a viable way to gain attention for his new invention. To this day,
                  jasperware remains Wedgwood's best-known product. After the response to the Portland
                  Vase copies, the factory could not resist making cheaper replicas to commercialize
                  its aesthetic triumph. While Josiah's "original" copies were aesthetic achievements
                  celebrated in the realm of high art, the factory went on to produce what Wolf Mankowitz
                  described as "a moulded biscuit apology," onto which dark paint was applied to mimic
                  the bas-relief appearance of jasperware (18). He goes on: <span class="quote">‘The particular characteristic of the 1839 copy is, however, the triumph of Victorian
                     morality which it embodies. In it the figures, naked and austere in the original vase,
                     are draped 'in the Greek manner', with a scrupulousness of which the Prince Consort
                     himself would have approved. (18)’</span> Blake's fig-leaf-decked illustrations, which predate the Wedgwood company's Greek
                  drapery by a half century, suggest that the urge to clean up the classical was Romantic
                  rather than Victorian. Wedgwood's worry that copying the Vase would cost the enormous
                  sum of £5000 in artists' labor was not far off—but Wedgwood's legacy of cheap nineteenth-century
                  reproductions proved popular and more than made up for the expense of producing the
                  first copies. It was only a matter of time before this triumph of technological innovation,
                  marketing, and nationalism was subjected to three-dimensional mechanical reproduction.
                  Since 1841, the factory has produced copies of various size and in various shades
                  of blue. The consecration conferred upon the first copies by Reynolds, Hamilton, Darwin,
                  and West made subsequent copies economically inevitable. As Wedgwood had imagined
                  in his June 1786 letter to Hamilton, the Vase could indeed be "copied to suit the
                  tastes, the wants &amp; purses of different purchasers." Today, it will cost the average
                  citizen a quick trip to ebay and around forty dollars to obtain a pale blue, genital-free
                  Portland-Vase Christmas ornament; but patrons of the British Museum gift shop can
                  purchase made-to-order Wedgwood factory reproductions of the Portland Vase for the
                  exact sum of £5000.</p>

               and European Old Masters and English artists can be found in Hogarth. Another good
               Romantic example is James Barry's 1775 <em>Inquiry into the Real and Imaginary Obstructions to the Arts in England</em>, which articulates the problem in terms of the relative craftiness of Italian dealers
               in antiquity vis-à-vis the foolishness of British collectors (75).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Jasper's capacity for color change allowed it to fit the tastes of any number of patrons
               and consumers, who could purchase pottery that matched the architectural designs they
               had chosen for their homes' interiors. Because the neoclassical aesthetic was not
               interested in the literal rendition of classical images, the combination of form and
               color were vital in decorative motifs of Robert Adam and his imitators (Buten 139).
               Jasper, with its bas-relief technique, takes up the fashion of interior design perpetuated
               after the 1760s, when wainscoting fell out of fashion in favor of ornamental plasterwork.
               Wedgewood intended for architects to use jasperware plaques in their neoclassical
               interiors but was unsuccessful in influencing them to the extent that they had influenced
               him, as he notes in a letter to his partner Bentley in 1779 that it is "really unfortunate
               in the introduction of our jasper into the public notice, that we could not prevail
               upon the architects to be the godfathers of our child." </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               to the original Vase (e.g., Bentley 108). Some sources simply leave ambiguity, but
               some do suggest Blake did have access to it (e.g., Brooks 152). However, Brooks misattributes
               Bartolozzi's engraving of the Vase as Blake's of 1791. It seems unlikely given Blake's
               relatively low professional status that he would have been given access to it, and
               even less likely that, given the gossip surrounding the Vase's movements and visitors,
               that if he had been given access there would be no mention of it. Moreover, it was
               convention for professional engravers to work from copies, and that kind of conventional
               work is less worthy of mention. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
