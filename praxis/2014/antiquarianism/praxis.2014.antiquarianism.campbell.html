            <p class="noCount">In this essay, Campbell traces the peculiar re-circulations of Thomas Pennant's 1770s
               antiquarian description of an archaic Scottish proto-guillotine. These re-circulations
               culminated in a late-Romantic fantasy that Pennant's antiquarian labors had brought
               the modern, French guillotine to life. But even in the 1790s moment of the French
               Revolution, as the fashionable periodical <em>The Bon Ton Magazine</em> makes most remarkably clear, Pennant's prose was mediating the British encounter
               with the French guillotine in extraordinary ways. As an encapsulation of the antiquarian
               enterprise, the episode illuminates how the antiquarian fragment (liberated from an
               originary context) always threatened to belong to new times in uncontrollable ways,
               and so generated an illicit kind of temporal belonging more familiarly ascribed to
               fashion's recursive cycles. Campbell turns from the re-circulations of Pennant to
               the fiction of Walter Scott, where a prominent and simultaneous address of antiquarian
               fragments and fashionable dress aimed to mitigate precisely the kind of dangers on
               view in Pennant's unwitting resurrection of the guillotine. Scott's Waverley Novels
               finally bind fashions and antiquities to their respective times of origin, but the
               novels nevertheless remain in the shadow of Pennant's old guillotine.</p>

               <p>In this essay I trace a Romantic-era alignment between the procedures of fashion culture
                  and the methods of a noteworthy antiquary. I center this discussion around an extraordinary
                  micro-episode in print in 1793 (at the verge of the Reign of Terror), when the <em>Bon Ton Magazine, or Microscope of Fashion and Folly</em> radically repurposed Thomas Pennant's 1772 prose description of an ancient British
                  implement of capital punishment. By transposing Pennant's antiquarian account into
                  the eventful present moment, the <em>Bon Ton Magazine</em> transformed this commentary into a fully adequate dispatch on the ultra-modern guillotine—the
                  signature emblem of the ostensibly unprecedented violence of the French Revolution.
                  This remarkable event in print, I argue, suggests how fashion's characteristic recyclings
                  of past artifacts for present purposes (and fashion's consequent liberations of the
                  objects of its desire from their original contexts) also disclosed destabilizing qualities
                  of the antiquarian enterprise itself. For if in some ways the rise of fashion was
                  adding new danger to antiquarian practice (by putting antiquarian findings to fashion's
                  own purposes), in other ways fashion only exposed dangers that were always inherent
                  in the ways antiquarians managed their objects. While Barrett Kalter calls our attention
                  to the pronounced, contemporaneous sense that the "past was not so much retrieved
                  as manufactured in the present, and therefore artificial," in this essay I emphasize
                  the complexity that an object like the guillotine represents for such an ethos, as
                  the sort of retrieval that is much more evidently a dangerous repetition than the
                  kind of conspicuous artifice that could be readily distinguished from the past in
                  its authenticity (12).</p>
               <p>I begin with a retrospective view that will ultimately set the stage for Pennant's
                  reemergence in the <em>Bon Ton Magazine</em> in 1793—namely the more distant scrutiny, <span class="foreign">circa</span> 1840, of the consequences of Pennant's recovery of these British proto-guillotines.
                  At the later moment both the <em>Quarterly Review</em> and <em>The Court and Lady's Magazine</em> broach a causal link between Pennant's antiquarian labors and the arrival of the
                  guillotine in revolutionary France, with the implication that Pennant's recirculation
                  of the archaic in some sense elicits Dr. Guillotin's infamous engine. These later
                  accounts are striking in their own right; but I further insist, in ways these accounts
                  do not countenance, on the specific revelations of Pennant's adoption within print
                  fashion at the original moment of revolution. The strongest implication of the <em>Bon Ton Magazine</em>'s appropriation of Pennant's description, and of the mode of exuberant deformation
                  that prevails in the magazine even amidst the extremity of regicide, is that such
                  bald commingling of ancient and modern is rather more characteristic of the age than
                  deviant, more central than marginal, due to an increasingly general susceptibility
                  to fashion's ways of knowing. In essence what happens to Pennant's prose description
                  in print (via fashion) manifests the structure or form of what actually happened in
                  the world with the instrument. Just as the <em>Bon Ton</em> silently set Pennant's somewhat dusty prose at the unfolding, world-historical scene
                  of regicide, so revolutionary France quietly recast his object-artifacts as distinctively
                  novel emanations of modernity.</p>
               <p>I proceed from this particular episode toward an account of its larger stakes by suggesting
                  how a renewed, fashion-driven appreciation for antiquarianism's dangerous liberations
                  deeply shapes Walter Scott's iconic redefinition of the figure of the antiquary in
                  his novel of that title. Here, in a novel where the threat of imminent invasion by
                  French Revolutionary forces (that is, history so-called) never quite materializes,
                  the present itself also never quite obtains as an ontologically distinct location.
                  Rather, in <em>The Antiquary</em> old dress fashions stubbornly persist in ways that point us to the essential ground
                  of Scott's revision of Pennant and his ilk. But while the comic mode of <em>The Antiquary</em> works to stabilize the relics of the past alongside recently obsolete fashions, and
                  persons—so that all these categories speak their time of origin or impressionability
                  with the same, steady persistence—I will also consider how the shadows of Pennant's
                  instruments of execution continue to haunt the long series of Waverley Novels to come.</p>

                  <p>In a review essay published in the <em>Quarterly Review</em> in December 1843, and subsequently revised and published in its own right as <em>The History of the Guillotine</em> (1853), John Wilson Croker consolidated a recent flurry of interest in the guillotine's
                     origins with a diagnosis of the peculiar kind of historiographical problem the French
                     Revolution posed.

                              this essay.</span></div>
                     </div> The "effects of [the] protracted system of Terror" that prevailed, Croker pronounces,
                     have not "yet passed away," for this system "poisoned in its passage the very sources
                     of history." These corrupted historical sources, moreover, continued to impose even
                     on the posterity of Croker's subsequent day, which therefore labored under precisely
                     the "same delusions" the system had "imposed on its contemporaries" (1). Most noteworthy
                     are these sources' unspoken elisions. "It is the fashion," for instance, "to call
                     the <em>Moniteur</em> the best history of the Revolution, and its pages are universally appealed to as indisputable
                     authority," yet the newspaper startlingly omits mention of the regicide of Louis XVI
                     in the issue that appears on the day following the execution (2).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Le Moniteur Universel was the leading newspaper of the time in France and sometime

                     </div> In this context, Croker observes, the question of the early history of the guillotine
                     is a representatively "strange obscurity," for "Little or nothing was to be found"
                     in the "leading journals of the time" "as to when and where this formidable engine
                     made its first appearance, by what law it was sanctioned, and who were the earliest
                     of that innumerable series of victims who perished by it" (4).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Croker's assertion of the inadequacy of official history in this moment has self-conscious
                  historiographical critique in mind. In calling attention to the discursive obscurity
                  around the guillotine, he moves beyond a generalized horror over the Revolution's
                  excesses to paint the broader moment as in need of the special skills of the antiquarian.
                  It is especially "strange," Croker notes, that "persons calling themselves <em>historians</em>—whose attention might have been excited, not merely by the novelty of the machine,
                  but by the moral and legal questions which led to the invention, and by the terrible,
                  the gigantic consequences which followed its adoption—take little or no notice of
                  it" (4). Croker's subjects, it seems, are those the historian has overlooked. And
                  in the example he posits of one particularly revealing narrative of the regicide itself,
                  it is an incapacity to attend to the remarkable machine with sufficient, material
                  precision that elides the essential historical spirit of the event. As Croker reports
                  with frustration, this historian's inadequate "words, 'the descending axe terminated
                  his existence' [...]—there having been no preceding allusion to any machine—would
                  have equally described that of Charles I [in England in 1649]" (6). For Croker, the
                  "poisoned" sources of ordinary historiography remake the epoch into the opaque sort
                  of terrain that had always necessitated antiquarians' outsized dependence upon what
                  might be learned from objects and artifacts, and from these objects' reinsertion in
                  historical narrative that was otherwise inadequate.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Insecure about its own distance from the French Revolutionary moment, Croker's history
                     admits of an uneasy mixture of national pride and anxiety in unveiling the English
                     and Scottish antecedents of the machine that defined the Revolution's excesses. He
                     enfolds the <em>Report on the Mode of Decollation</em> that "M. Louis" offered to the Legislative Assembly in France as part of the process
                     of devising the French machine. Louis, Croker notes, points directly to an English
                     precedent for the instrument while making no mention of the soon infamous Dr. Guillotin
                     himself.

                              and precise task of cleanly severing the vertebral column and the imperfect skill
                              of human executioners, "there is no certainty but in an invariable mechanism, of which
                              the force and effect can be regulated and directed. This is the mode adopted in England"
                              (Croker 30, emphasis in original).</span></div>

                        when he was only a plagiary; and it seems very strange how so general an opinion should
                        have prevailed as to the <em>novelty</em> of the invention, when we find M. Louis, in the very first distinct description of
                        the machine, representing it as one <em>already known in England</em>—indeed, his expressions seem to imply [a misconception] that it was then actually
                        and habitually in use amongst us [....] If M. Louis had inquired a little farther,
                        he would have found not only that the implement was not in general use in England,
                        but had not been used for near 150 years in the small district [of Halifax] where
                        it belonged. (34)’</span> This revelation, both of the machine's liability to "plagiarism" and of Louis's failure
                     to register the English machine's present obsolescence—or, to distinguish properly
                     between <em>knowledge</em> of the machine in England and ongoing <em>use</em> thereof (in the way a robust past-present distinction would require)—then prompts
                     Croker's extended recapitulation of Pennant's own detailed description of the earlier
                     British instruments of execution. For Croker, the instability of the distinction between
                     knowledge and use is precisely what is at issue with regard to Pennant's account,
                     for Croker emphasizes how, at the dawn of the French Revolution, the ancient British
                     machines had been "recalled to public attention" in Pennant's "then so recent work"

                        is condemned for stealing a horse, or a cow, the string is tied to the beast, which
                        on being whipped, pulls out the peg, and becomes the executioner. (700) ’</span> The direct link between the machines is the sixteenth-century Scottish Regent James
                     Douglas, Earl of Morton, the tragic figure who "took a model of [the Gibbet] as he
                     passed through Halifax"; introduced it to Scotland; and then "at length suffered by
                     it himself" (700). Notably, the narrative of Pennant's <em>Tour</em> concluded with this description of Halifax and its distinctive "machine of death,"
                     and so the tour's very sequence grants the episode a kind of formal privilege and
                     prominence. At the same time, the precise content of Pennant's description of the
                     Edinburgh machine, as I will show, is all the more significant because it was so often
                     repeated. Croker and others like him directly interpolated the descriptive passage
                     again and again within their own accounts of the French guillotine.

               <p>Croker himself concedes in the end that Dr. Guillotin himself, "foolish" as he was,
                  "probably knew nothing" about the English precedents; and Croker dutifully outlines
                  a wider series of Continental precedents to the guillotine beyond the British examples
                  Pennant had named (34). The summary lesson of all these precedents, however, remains
                  the oddity of the guillotine's genuine air of novelty in France: "We conclude from
                  all this that this mode of execution was common on the Continent in the sixteenth
                  and seventeenth centuries; and yet had passed into such entire desuetude and oblivion
                  as to have appeared as a perfect novelty when produced by Dr. Guillotin" (46). Striking
                  here, though not explicitly articulated by Croker, is the extraordinary symmetry of
                  Pennant's recently "recall[ing] the machine to public attention" and the quality of
                  "perfect novelty" the machine nevertheless embodied, as if there is a latent correspondence
                  between "perfect novelty" and at least one mode of antiquarian recovery. The "oblivion"
                  of living or popular memory, in other words, seems precisely the avenue through which
                  the archaic form resurrected by antiquarian enterprise can conduce to the "appearance"
                  of novelty (which in Croker's ambiguous phrasing might equally point to false appearances
                  or to a genuinely sudden, impactful coming into being).</p>

                  <p>Within the <em>Court and Lady's Magazine</em> for May 1840, an essay nearly contemporaneous with Croker's likewise brought the British
                     prehistory of the guillotine to life while making a more unapologetic case for a direct
                     line of influence between the Halifax Gibbet, the Scottish Maiden, and the later guillotine.

                     “The Maiden and the Guillotine”
                      dramatically underscores the scandal of this tale of origins: "Sceptical, as the reader
                     may probably be upon the accuracy of this fact, it is nevertheless quite true! –the
                     Guillotine is a machine of English invention, the use of which (singularly enough)
                     was well known during the reign of Queen Elizabeth [...]" (429). Moreover, "The machine
                     invented by Halifax law, was not [...] destined to remain within the limits of a narrow
                     provincial district, but, at a later day to cross the sea and reach Paris by the somewhat
                     circuitous route of Scotland" (431). The <em>Court and Lady's</em> account, which closely resembles Croker's four years later, evinces a similar reliance
                     upon Pennant's antiquarian descriptions (again quoted at length) but dwells more intently
                     upon the specific power of Pennant's reanimation of the old machine: <span class="quote">‘When Pennant visited Edinburgh, the Halifax machine had [...] entirely disappeared
                        from the public eye. The sole trace of its existence in that city was a model of large
                        dimensions, preserved in one of the halls of the ancient parliament house. <em>This model had become nothing more than a mere object of curiosity—a vestige of antiquity,
                           in the eyes of a new generation</em>; and as the national pride was not interested in its preservation, it fell subsequently
                        into private hands, and is now, we believe, to be seen in the Museum of the Society
                        of Scottish Antiquaries. <em>Pennant was evidently able to examine it in its minutest detail, and he comprehended
                           all its mechanism with peculiar sagacity</em>, as will be seen by the description which we have previously given in his words.
                        (433, my emphasis)’</span> In the intricate comprehension of "mechanism" that marks Pennant's description, we
                     are to understand, one can observe the kind of antiquarian operation that restores
                     the object of the past to the living "public eye" and also shapes its future course.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>For my purposes here, I am more committed to the force of this fantasy of Pennant's
                     authorship of the guillotine than to its objective historical accuracy, but I do wish
                     to emphasize the particular qualities of Pennant's modes of observation that seemed
                     to lend themselves to such speculation. At the original moment of the <em>Tour of Scotland</em>, Pennant's first readers already identified the qualities that made his writing especially
                     expropriable. Samuel Johnson, for instance, observed in praise that Pennant was "the
                     best traveller I ever read; he observes more <em>things</em> than anyone else does" (Boswell 3:56, my emphasis). For the <em>London Magazine</em> in the same moment, Pennant "communicat[ed] to the world, the knowledge of their country
                     in its present state" alongside "ancient customs and manners, and various antiquities,
                     scarcely known before" (
                     “Impartial Review,”
                      337). The latter assessment makes clear how Pennant's proliferating "things" are set
                     loose in the world as part of a motley assortment of present knowledge, ancient customs,
                     and "various" antiquities, the last of which do not properly belong to those "customs
                     and manners" with which we might expect to align them. James Boswell detected in Pennant
                     a similarly paratactic habit of collection, but Boswell also understood this habit
                     to be a serious detriment: Pennant "traversed a wide extent of country in such haste,
                     that he could put together only <em>curt, frittered fragments of his own</em>" (3:56). Pennant is a "writer, who at best treats merely of superficial objects,
                     and shews no philosophical investigation of character and manners," and who likewise
                     borrows far too much from the real understanding of those local experts who assisted
                     him (3:56).

                     consequence—has the power to transform objects like the Maiden from mere "curiosities"
                     into things with a life of their own. Such new life depends not so much upon a reanimating
                     context, or the "character and manners" of a place (in Boswell's terms), as upon the
                     intrinsic "mechanism" of the objects that (in the <em>Court and Lady's Magazine</em>'s terms) Pennant sagaciously discerned.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. Fashioning the King's Death</span></h2>
               <p>From the distant perspective of the <em>Quarterly Review</em> and the <em>Court and Lady's Magazine,</em> Pennant's consequences for the French Revolution seemed at once evident in retrospect
                  and diffusely unavailable to the original moment, which had labored under the delusion
                  of the guillotine's novelty. But the striking case of the <em>Bon Ton Magazine</em> episode turns this perspective on its head. Here, the pages of fashion quite readily
                  register the peculiarly mobile quality of Pennant's object descriptions in real time,
                  with their own kind of distance. Admittedly, the <em>Bon Ton</em> seems in many ways an unlikely candidate for the kind of perceptiveness I am describing.
                  In Paul-Gabriel Boucé's summation, the magazine is the most prominent of a set of
                  periodicals ("predecessors to <em>Playboy</em>") that "thrive[d] on the sexual content" of trials for criminal conversation and
                  on the "obscene prints" they produced to accompany such tales (Wagner 132). In more
                  pornographic moments, the <em>Bon Ton</em> shuttles between graphic tales of lesbianism (and "the art of <em>tribade</em>") and voyeuristic sadism, as in the "old debilitated Croesus, of Broad-street" who
                  arranges with the mistresses of two boarding schools to observe unseen as girls are
                  "flogged upon their bare posteriors" (April 1792: 56-57). But the remarkable quality
                  of the <em>Bon Ton</em>'s exceptionally abandoned pages is that even those moments that would seem like genuine
                  irruptions of the precipitous events of revolution finally bear out fashion's resiliently
                  prurient and promiscuous capacity to traffic in such events on its own terms.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The <em>Bon Ton</em>'s strange modulations of the rush of history via its own peculiar priorities and
                     procedures is nowhere more evident than in a seemingly straightforward dispatch on
                     the execution of Louis XVI in the issue for January 1793. As the 
                     “Epitome of the Times”
                      for the issue reports in a brief, fashion-saturated shorthand, the French monarch
                     "pulled off his stock, coat and waistcoat, and, with his neck and breast bare, ascended
                     the scaffold with intrepidity, and undaunted fortitude; (it was only 20 minutes after
                     ten o'clock) he wore a clean shirt and stock, white waistcoat, black Florentine silk
                     breeches, black silk stockings, and his shoes were tied with black silk strings" (444).
                     Notably, the outsized proportion of dress description in the abbreviated 
                     “Epitome”
                      functions as a hook for the next month's issue of the <em>Bon Ton</em>, where this passage plays a diminished role amidst a more extended narrative of the
                     execution (but presumably continues to serve as a primary anchor of readers' attention).
                     At the same time, the passage is lifted directly from the <em>Lady's Magazine</em>, the leading fashion publication of the moment that was interpellating respectable
                     female consumers rather antithetical to the libertine, male audience of the <em>Bon Ton</em>. Commenting on the original context of just this passage in the <em>Lady's Magazine</em>, Mary Poovey notes the absence of comparable attention to dress in the contemporaneous
                     account of the execution in the <em>Gentleman's Magazine</em>; this gaze for Poovey thus instances women's relegation to a private sphere of "polite
                     conversation" and "sensual" concern rather than rational political judgment (16-18).

                              But the more fundamental deformation of the king's execution via fashion in the Bon
                              Ton Magazine, in its libertine, masculine address, speaks of a more unruly and asocial

                     to the larger circumstances, the <em>Bon Ton</em>'s disproportionate attention to dress at the very moment of regicide gleefully disrupts
                     such a project, by making of the fashionable objects this history precipitated the

                     was fundamental to imagining the monarchy and its sovereign expression of the social
                     life of the moment. A prototypical issue of the <em>Bon Ton</em> for June 1791, for instance, relayed reports on the celebration of George III's birthday
                     earlier in the same month. The King "appeared in a <em>chocolate</em> coloured silk tabby coat, richly spangled all over with silver spangles, and embroidered
                     on the seams; the waistcoat was of white silk, ornamented in the same manner [...]";
                     the Queen appeared "in a train of white and silver, with a petticoat of the same,
                     richly embroidered" together with brilliant jewels and "ornaments of silver and foils";
                     and the Princess "Was in a rich silver silk body and train, a petticoat richly embroidered
                     with silver spangles and pink convolves, with a loose drapery of green and silver
                     in folds on the corners of the hoop, which had a new and beautiful effect" (141-143).

                              from the singular costumes of the royal family to the larger crowd: "The gentlemen's
                              dresses were generally of dark tea green, and chocolate coloured silk, or dark stripes,

                     </div> Against this backdrop, the <em>Bon Ton</em>'s plagiarized account of Louis XVI's wardrobe takes on a distinctly perverse valence.
                     Even the ostensibly straight reporting on Louis XVI's execution, in other words, makes
                     the scene a grotesque rehearsal of the ubiquitous print fashion scene of the royal
                     ball and of its characteristic mode of description: the "white waistcoat" of Louis
                     XVI is a macabre reflection of George III at the birthday celebration (in his own
                     "white silk" waistcoat). Likewise, a subsequent report in the <em>Bon Ton</em> for September 1792, on the new fashions of the gentlemen of France, sardonically pointed
                     to garments "<em>spotted</em> with a mixture, called the blood of their countrymen—<span class="foreign">Sans Culottes</span>" (285, my emphasis). The satire most directly puns on the account of the ladies'
                     petticoats in 1791 (and others garments like theirs) which are "spotted with white
                     foil."

               <p>My concern, then, is not with the <em>Bon Ton</em>'s abiding plagiarism as such but rather with its fashion-informed mode of appropriation,
                  whereby the objects and events that come within its purview are powerfully recontextualized
                  or remade. This mode is once again borne out in the magazine's adoption of Pennant's
                  guillotine description. The aforementioned issue of the <em>Bon Ton</em> for February 1793 (which expands the initial passages on Louis XVI's dress into a
                  fuller narrative, the 
                  “Authentic Particulars of the Last Moments of Louis XVI”
                  ), also turns its attention to the guillotine itself, as an object worthy of visual
                  and verbal attention in its own right. Added to the narrative of the king's execution

                  and which takes its name of Guillotine from that of the person who brought it into
                  use." The footnote further references a plate included with the magazine and then
                  repeats Pennant's familiar prose ("It is in the form of a painter's easel, and about
                  ten feet high [...]," etc.)—but does so with acknowledgement neither of Pennant himself,
                  nor of the different machine Pennant was actually describing, so that his prose becomes
                  a kind of fabricated on-the-spot reporting.</p>

                     to see the guillotine: <span class="quote">‘I did not see the execution, because, as the hour is never specified, I might have
                        waited for many hours in a crowd, from which there is no extricating one's self. I
                        was there immediately after, and saw the machine, which was just going to be taken
                        away. I went into a coffee-house and made a drawing, which is here engraven. It is

                     British and French machines (i.e., in Scotland the seemingly same machine "is termed"
                     a maiden) but then subsequently, in a footnote, detailing Pennant's "long account
                     of <em>such a machine</em>," in a phrase that will not quite admit equivalence (32, my emphasis). In the <em>Bon Ton</em>, then, the shift from this analogizing language ("such a machine") to the direct
                     application of Pennant's description to the guillotine itself is all the more striking
                     because the provenance of Pennant's description (its original applicability to an

                  the image also suggests how such distant scrutiny was being sustained from the start
                  by the distance built into Pennant's prose description. The diagrammatic qualities
                  of the image, particularly evident in the more schematic window to the lower left,
                  suggest functional attributes of the blade and stock but also lend them an air of
                  geometric regularity that pushes our sense of the machine's "Form" toward a perversely
                  aesthetic appreciation, one that is further sustained by the architectural regularity
                  of the perfectly centered guillotine's rectilinear form. Likewise, the jarring qualities
                  of the king's floating head (which the perspective has visually separated from his
                  body even before the blade falls) and of the clashing diagonals of background scene
                  (which echo the machine's form in non-representational ways that compete with the
                  scene's narrative meaning) offer the scene as a visual conundrum as much as an obvious
                  occasion for sentiment. Far from signaling the exceptionality of regicide, the unreal
                  qualities of this image are fully consonant with a more overt, visual conjuring of
                  aesthetic dissonance in the <em>Bon Ton</em> in 1792 (and again in 1795), an illustration entitled

               <p>In this context, the contingent qualities of Pennant's own mediation of the object
                  come to the fore—most especially the conspicuously aesthetic qualities of his description,
                  which were to some extent elicited by intrinsic qualities of the Maiden but that were
                  also enhanced by Pennant's particular practice of antiquarianism. The image Croker

                              of Gilpin's Observations in 1782) seems dismissive of the complexity of the enterprise
                              of Pennant's second tour, all the more when the illustrations and manifold antique
                              ruins are considered (42).</span></div>
                     </div> Pennant's second tour of Scotland was a noteworthy departure from his first tour in
                     benefiting from the talents of Moses Griffiths, Pennant's "servant and an 'able artist'
                     who produced the many sketches later published as engravings" (Pennant xvi). The odd
                     way in which Griffiths's visual-aesthetic appropriations of Scotland aligned with
                     the "easel" shape of the antique guillotine suggests an added element of the Maiden's
                     interest for Pennant as well as the peculiar "framing" of history the device of the
                     Maiden might conjure as a result. At the same time, as Eric Slauter has shown with
                     particular reference to the early American context, governments of the age were increasingly
                     seen to be aesthetic projects, "works of art," meant to be materialized, in turn,
                     in artful form.

               <h2><span class="head">III. Scott's Maidens</span></h2>
               <p>I now turn from the story I have reprised so far, in which Pennant's resurrection
                  of the antique Scottish Maiden played a role in the emergence of the French guillotine,
                  to what I will suggest is Walter Scott's extended (and perhaps counter-aestheticizing)
                  response to this story. I begin by registering the remarkable ways in which Pennant's
                  encounter with the Maiden anticipated the form or structure of Scott's <em>Waverley</em> itself. Most concretely, perhaps, Croker emphasizes how "Near thirty years prior
                  to Pennant's publication, the execution of the Scotch lords for the Rebellion of 1745
                  by the axe and block seems to have recalled the obsolete <em>Maiden</em> to notice" (38). Croker points specifically to the <em>London Magazine</em> for April 1747, which mentions a (seemingly abandoned) plan to execute Simon Lord
                  Fraser of Lovat by means of "an Engine [...] like that called <em>the Maiden</em>" (153), and which contains illustrations both of Fraser's execution by axe and block
                  and of the Maiden itself, "as anciently used in Scotland for beheading traitors" (187).
                  In this way, the living local memory and material preservation that enabled Pennant
                  to scrutinize the Maiden in 1772 were extended effects of the Jacobite rising of 1745-1746
                  that became the subject of Scott's novel.</p>
               <p>In another sense, Pennant's counterintuitive account of the Maiden upheld it as an
                  ambiguous icon of progress; it was not a surviving token of archaic brutality but
                  a relatively recent improvisation in response to the growing pains of commercial proto-modernity.
                  Pennant reports the conjecture (which he describes as "very probable") that the Halifax
                  Gibbet arose at a moment when the woolen manufactures—now thriving in Pennant's day—first
                  "began to gain strength." The spectacle of justice the Gibbet created was intended
                  to moderate the "lawless set" who inhabited the "wild country around," and whose Highlander-like
                  "depredations on the cloth-tenters might [otherwise have] soon stifle[d] the efforts
                  of infant industry" (Pennant 699). Such a prehistory of textile production bears an
                  inevitable relevance to the dress-driven art of Scott and the taste he created; and
                  indeed in its 1840 account, the <em>Court and Lady's Magazine</em> cannot resist translating Pennant's sparer fable of commercialization into a more
                  enticingly concrete image of primitive retail exhibition and its temptations: Halifax's
                  "hilly environs were daily seen speckled with pieces of cloth of all colours, suspended
                  from tenters' poles. This display of valuable stuffs was unfortunately beheld by other
                  eyes than those of the honest chapmen of the cloth-market" (430). As such a scene
                  might suggest, and as the <em>Court and Lady's Magazine</em> put it explicitly, the Maiden was itself a kind of prolepsis for the English commercial
                  ingenuity of the eighteenth century. That is, the guillotine's early arrival in Halifax
                  "proceeded from the same mechanical genius, which, in our own days, has given birth
                  to the wonder-working <em>Spinning Jennies</em>" (429).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The actual history of the Maiden also converges with the fictional landscape Scott
                     created in quite direct ways. <em>The Heart of Mid-Lothian</em> (1818), for instance, is Scott's most extensive meditation on the problem of state
                     execution under the broad dispensation of public interest (and in this case, without
                     proof of crime). The unfortunate Effie Deans, whose newborn child is missing, stands
                     to lose her life for the crime of infanticide; for the law deems her constructively
                     guilty by virtue of her previous silence about her pregnancy. Effie's sister Jeanie
                     ultimately saves her by obtaining a pardon in a royal audience facilitated by the
                     Duke of Argyle. In part Argyle's assistance is consistent with his status in the novel
                     as Scott's great hero of moderation in the period (as an accommodating Presbyterian
                     who "Soar[ed] above the petty distinctions of faction" and softened the tensions between
                     Scotland and England [344]). But Jeanie's solicitation of his aid also directly invokes
                     the memory of the Duke's "unfortunate" grandfather and great-grandfather (350).

                              of the bearer (and his family and friends) in times of need. In the same moment she
                              is remarkably described as dressed "in the style of Scottish maidens of her own class"

                     on the Maiden itself, in 1685 and 1661, respectively. The present Duke's valorization
                     of modernity, then, as well as his heightened sympathy for Jeanie, bear the special
                     weight of the memory of the Maiden's operation. And if <em>The Heart of Mid-Lothian</em> itself is perhaps Scott's most eloquent intimation of the Maiden's legacy, the machine's
                     fateful operation is similarly implicated in works like <em>A Legend of Montrose</em> (1819), which features Argyle's aforementioned great-grandfather, and both <em>The Abbot</em> (1820) and <em>The Monastery</em> (1820), where James Douglas, Earl of Morton (who had carried the Maiden from Halifax

                     general proximity to Scott through their mutual work for the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, but also in the particular pages of Croker's <em>History of the Guillotine</em>. Croker's history directly cites Scott's <em>Tales of a Grandfather</em> (as collected in Scott's <em>Complete Prose Works</em> in 1836) as the source for his most gleaming anecdote on the ancient victims of the
                     Maiden: the moment when the doomed Earl of Argyle in 1685 had "pressed his lips on

                              own Stories Selected from the History of England (1822), which Scott found overly
                              condescending to child readers.</span></div>
                     </div> At this moment in the <em>Tales of a Grandfather</em>, Scott himself had likewise interrupted his recounting of the execution of Argyle
                     to cite Pennant's description of the Maiden in a lengthy footnote ("in the form of
                     a painter's easel," and so on, once again) and to identify it explicitly as "an instrument
                     resembling the Guillotine of modern France" (280-281). If Pennant had unwittingly
                     circulated the guillotine within actual history in the 1790s, Scott was likely at
                     the root of the late re-appreciation of the British origins of the instrument by way
                     of Pennant's work, as reflected in both Croker's history and <em>The Court and Lady's Magazine</em> in the years to come.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In Scott's carefully chosen wording, the nature of the relation between the Maiden
                     that Pennant described and the French guillotine is "resemblance," which subtly but
                     tellingly consigns each machine to its own moment. In a way that emphasizes how Scott's
                     construction of this relationship (as resemblance) was not inevitable, the <em>Court and Lady's Magazine</em> figuratively construed the same relationship as one of direct, material continuity.
                     Having traced the Maiden's route from Halifax to Edinburgh to Paris, the <em>Court and Lady's</em> pauses to "behold [in the guillotine] the rotten and disjointed members of the Halifax <em>Maiden</em> collected together again after so long a desuetude—the old fragments cramped and repieced,
                     and after complete restoration of all parts and a fresh coat of paint, given forth
                     to the world as a <em>discovery</em> made by French philosophy!" (433). The insistent troping of the guillotine as an archaic
                     object lurking only just beneath the thinnest of restorative veneers reads like an
                     especially fearful accounting of the logic of fashion that treated the past as a reservoir
                     of forms—and so indeed reconstituted old models as new by infusing them with all the
                     allure of novelty and presence.

                              "old fragments" from Halifax are not so unlike the "curt, frittered fragments" that
                              Boswell had accused Pennant of producing in print, to be passed off as new in the
                              Bon Ton.</span></div>
                     </div> Scott's opposing insistence on (mere) resemblance, finally, is part and parcel of
                     his fictions' larger project to insist that the true time of origin of historical
                     objects will out—that artifacts and styles alike may often resemble but never quite
                     recur.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In foregrounding the work Scott did to assign archaic or obsolete objects more fixedly
                  to their times of provenance—and in emphasizing that he did so with the peculiar aid
                  of fashion—the remainder of my essay means to intervene in recent debates about the
                  status of the residual in the Romantic moment, when the ominousness of the category
                  seemed far more menacing a problem than it had for Pennant himself. I especially have
                  in mind what Ina Ferris, in the best recent consideration of the problem, calls "the
                  time of the remnant." Ferris rightly draws our attention to a series of persons and
                  objects in Scott whose remnancy "generates a curiously insubstantial existence in
                  the present"; and she describes a special, Romantic genre of the remnant tale, which
                  "retains at its core an experience of disconnection from present energies" (475).
                  In turning to <em>The Antiquary</em> in light of my preceding discussion of the troublingly unbounded objects harvested
                  by the antiquarian enterprise, I want to fill out the range of possibilities for remnancy
                  in Scott by considering the ways in which remnancy might best be thought as a normative,
                  rather than an exceptional, state. That is to say, in part, that the "experience of
                  disconnection from present energies" that Ferris describes is as frequently and as
                  characteristically conjured by Scott's manifold presentations of outdated dress as
                  it is in the more evidently historical disconnections Ferris foregrounds.</p>
               <p>In the broadest terms, Scott's antiquary haunts the supposed distinctness of the temporal
                  present with a reminder that attachment to the moment at hand might not be so different
                  from the antiquary's ostensibly aberrant attachment to a favored moment from the past.
                  Ferris herself underscores the distinctness of <em>The Antiquary</em>, as a text that "enfolds all manner of remnants in a generous model of community,"
                  in what she sees as a contrast to less harmonious Waverley Novels (475). But that
                  otherwise useful formulation of "community" obscures how much the <em>present</em>, in any strong sense, is displaced by that very different, and not so obviously temporal,
                  conception of unity. If Scott's fiction is instrumental in creating a sense of "connect[ion]
                  to the energy of historical process" (in Ferris's terms), Scott is equally a theorist
                  of enduring provenances (for persons and for objects), of determinations by former
                  moments that are much more compelling than the weak sort of synchronic coincidence
                  that tends to characterize any given "now" (476). "Historical context" on this view
                  may be nothing more than the weak collective product of the idiosyncratic temporal
                  attachments of persons (to many times)—and thus a space wherein historical affiliations
                  rather than determinations may come to the fore.</p>
               <p>Ferris's account of remnancy is emblematic of how, in contrast to the way I want to
                  think about Scott, recent secondary work on the antiquarian enterprise has tended
                  to bifurcate the historical specimen between the categories of the "fragment" (which
                  persists as an isolated or residual entity fully cut off from the present) and the
                  "forgery," literal or otherwise (which despite a pretense to pastness finally belongs,
                  in one way or another, fully to the present). But at the literary epicenter of the
                  figure of the antiquary, Scott himself is precisely interested to <em>stage</em> this fragment/forgery division. As a character, Jonathan Oldbuck at least rhetorically
                  presumes a hard and fast division between past and present, classical antiquity and
                  modern times. But Oldbuck's refraction in the person of his sister Griselda points
                  to the fuller complexity the novel has in mind from the start. During the young hero
                  Lovel's initial encounter with her at the threshold of Oldbuck's estate of Monkbarns,
                  Griselda first appears (in the novel's setting of 1794) as the living embodiment of
                  1770: "The elderly lady rustled in silks and satins, and bore upon her head a structure
                  resembling the fashion in the ladies' memorandum-book for the year 1770—a superb piece
                  of architecture—not much less than a modern Gothic castle, of which the curls might
                  represent the turrets, the black pins the <span class="foreign">chevaux de frize</span>, and the lappets the banners"; likewise, "An antique flowered silk gown graced the
                  extraordinary person to whom belonged this unparalleled <span class="foreign">tête</span>," along with "triple blond ruffles" at the elbows, "gloves of a bright vermillion
                  color," and "a short silk cloak, thrown in easy negligence over her shoulders"; and
                  when Lovel pays his respects he is "answered by the prolonged curtsey of 1760" (57-58).
                  As an antique <em>person</em> who takes on the qualities of styles prevailing in the various days of her own making,
                  Griselda's way of adhering to time more closely resembles the lives of objects than
                  the fates of the written texts or dematerialized spaces of historical encounter (e.g.,
                  just-discernible traces of Roman-era earthworks in the landscape) that Oldbuck tends
                  to privilege. And if Griselda's seemingly eccentric perpetuation of the past sets
                  the tone for the novel, it finally appears not so much in contrast as in parallel
                  to "the fashion of the day" that adorns Oldbuck's niece, Maria (58); to the "old-fashioned
                  barbering" of Jacob Caxon upon the three wigs still being worn in the parish (48);
                  and to the "ornaments in the taste of a former and distant period" that furnish the
                  foreboding Glenallan House (273). Griselda's dress is the template for the novel's
                  proliferation and preservation of times other than antiquity and the present.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the last instance, through the French invasion that famously never comes, <em>The Antiquary</em> spoofs the very possibility that presentness could emerge in a strong sense. In retrospect,
                     the novel's most genuine moment of urgency is the clockwork tide best observed via
                     the Fairport Almanack's catalogue of the sea's repetitive motion. (An unusually high
                     tide threatens to sweep the unsuspecting Sir Arthur Wardour and his daughter, Isabella,
                     out to sea.)

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>On this scene and its larger relevance, see Richard Maxwell, who suggests that Oldbuck
                              knows "the rules of time and its periodic inundations" (452). </span></div>
                     </div> Crucially, the merely calendrical succession of the tides directly displaces the aspiration
                     to cohesive, cultural presentness embodied within the fashionable women's "pocket
                     almanack" of Oldbuck's niece, which would have carried precisely such information
                     as the "dress of the year," in prose description and in visual illustration of the
                     latest styles. Struck with the urgency of the moment, Oldbuck flings this pocket almanac
                     aside to consult the other volume so denominated. ("An almanack! an almanack! [...]
                     not that bauble!" he cries [69].) Maria's ostensibly current pocket book, like her
                     attachment to the "fashion of the day" (58) (as registered within the almanac as well
                     as on her person), has no more essential connection to the urgent situation at hand
                     than does the "ladies memorandum book for the year 1770" (57) that continues to guide
                     Griselda's headdress style.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Scott, whom literary history largely continues to see as the architect of historical
                  presentness, is in a different way a projector of the present's impossibility. In
                  the many times of Monkbarns, Scott recasts the antiquarian idea as the negative image
                  of modernity's naïve faith in a unified present (or moment, or episteme, or crisis)
                  different in kind from the past. Scott's antiquarian counter-vision animates historical
                  specimens but refuses either to relegate or conscript them—and so refuses to concede
                  the ontological privilege of a present that, like all other moments, can finally bear
                  on human existence only insofar as it is called, or loved, or loathed into being by
                  its custodians. A longer perspective on the antiquarian enterprise, then, begins to
                  suggest how modern historical fiction is built against a backdrop of fashion's rival
                  relation to the cultural archive. And as a deep response to Pennant's mobile guillotines,
                  Scott's historical fiction takes shape, in part, through a complex refusal to allow
                  fashions to be present again. </p>

               But the more fundamental deformation of the king's execution via fashion in the <em>Bon Ton Magazine</em>, in its libertine, masculine address, speaks of a more unruly and asocial side of
               fashion (213, 215).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">In this issue the <em>Bon Ton</em>'s dress description also indicates how fashion-seeking puts special pressure on questions
               of representativeness, especially as the focus moves from the singular costumes of
               the royal family to the larger crowd: "The gentlemen's dresses were generally of dark
               tea green, and chocolate coloured silk, or dark stripes, with white silk waistcoats,
               spangled, embroidered, or tamboured"; and "The ladies mostly wore white crape petticoats,
               spangled, and spotted with white foil, corn flowers, and other fancy flowers [...];"The
               ladies' bodies and trains were chiefly of crape or striped gauze, trimmed with silver
               fringe [...] The fashionable colour for ribbons was decidedly purple; a great many
               lilacs were also displayed [...] The caps were principally trimmed with rich blond
               lace [...]. The caps in general were rather low and broad; they were mostly of white
               or coloured crape, suitable to the dresses, ornamented with artificial flowers [...].
               The hair was almost universally dressed in curls." The language of trend-spotting,
               and its promise to convey what is "generally," "mostly," "chiefly," "decidedly," or
               "principally" characteristic amidst a wider set of possibilities, bears a clear resemblance
               to sifting for more properly historical signs of the times (141-143).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
