               <p>The recovery of Ireland's historic past was a project undertaken by numerous scholars
                  and artists from the mid-eighteenth century onwards, recording traditional poetry
                  and music as well as antiquities, both pagan and Christian. With respect to these
                  last, it was not until the nineteenth century that sustained fieldwork and scholarship
                  began to put that material history on firm foundations. These researches were widely
                  regarded as restoring its rightful dignity to Irish history, and they resonated with
                  those supporters of Irish nationalism, such as Thomas Davis (1814-45) who, in the
                  pages of <em>The Nation</em>, recommended Irish antiquities and historical subjects to Irish painters (<em>Literary and Historical Essays</em> 153-172). Irish antiquarian scholarship at mid-century was prosecuted with the same
                  rigor as its equivalents elsewhere and was not overtly politicized, but it came to
                  fruition in a highly volatile situation. This essay is not intended to situate that
                  scholarship in a political climacteric, or at least not to do so directly. Instead
                  it pays attention to an approach that seeks to be as disinterested as possible, providing
                  (visual) information of unimpeachable objectivity.</p>
               <p>In the preface to his <em>Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</em> (1845), the Irish artist and antiquarian George Petrie introduced his readers to
                  its illustrations in the following terms: <span class="quote">‘It will be seen that they make but slight pretensions to the character of works of
                     art. Where no fine writing was attempted, showy illustrations, got up with a view
                     to popular effect, and leading to an almost necessary sacrifice of truthfulness, would
                     be very little in harmony. For their accuracy, however, I can fearlessly pledge myself.
                     This has been the point attended to above all others, and of which the absence of
                     all affectation of freedom of handling, or forcible effect, will give abundant evidence.
                     They may be considered as quotations from our ancient monuments, made with the same
                     anxious desire for rigid accuracy, as those supplied from literary and other sources
                     in the text; and though slighter or more attractive sketches might have sufficiently
                     answered my purpose, they would not have been sufficient to gratify my desire to preserve
                     trustworthy memorials of monuments now rapidly passing away. (Petrie ix-x)’</span> Petrie's endorsement offers an opportunity for further reflection, for the declaration
                  it makes about the purpose of illustration in archaeological surveys is not only historically
                  specific, revealing something about the assumptions current in antiquarian circles
                  in the nineteenth century. It can also prompt us to think more widely about the nature
                  of archaeological illustration in its various modes.</p>
               <p>Although Petrie is discussed in what follows as an exemplar of a wider tendency, some
                  rehearsal of his professional life will help to situate his remarks in their historical
                  context. Born in 1790, the son of a Scottish portrait painter recently settled in
                  Dublin, Petrie trained initially as an artist and secured his early reputation by
                  providing landscape sketches for engaving in topographical works, notably Thomas Cromwell's
                  <em>Excursions through Ireland</em> (1820) and James Norris Brewer's <em>Beauties of Ireland</em> (1825). As a painter in watercolor he exhibited regularly at the Royal Hibernian
                  Academy and was one of the key artists who developed the idea of the Romantic landscape
                  in Ireland from the 1830s to the 1850s. It is not known precisely when Petrie's scholarly
                  interest in antiquities began, but from the 1820s he was actively concerned with early
                  Irish history and was an important contributor to the activities of the Royal Irish
                  Academy, the learned society founded in 1785 to promote Irish historical, scientific,
                  and literary studies. The Royal Irish Academy was also the repository of the national
                  collection of antiquities, whose study was an important prerequisite for the scholarly
                  reassessment of Irish cultural achievement, and Petrie was instrumental in the acquisition
                  of highly important early manuscripts and metalwork for the collection. From 1833
                  to 1844 he was head of the Topographical Department of the Irish Ordnance Survey,
                  charged with recording Irish antiquities, and he also edited two popular antiquarian
                  magazines, the <em>Dublin Penny Journal</em> (1832-36) and the <em>Irish Penny Journal</em> (1840-41). His important contributions to the collection of traditional Irish music
                  were published as <em>The Ancient Music of Ireland</em> (1855). Petrie's scholarship set high standards for the prosecution of historical
                  and antiquarian research, and he has justly been called the father of Irish archaeology.
                  His essay 
                  “On the Origin and Uses of the Round Towers of Ireland”
                  (1833) was awarded the gold medal and a £50 prize from the Royal Irish Academy. It
                  was regarded as ground-breaking and won a bigger audience when republished in <em>The Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</em>.</p>
               <p>The fact that Petrie and many of his contemporaries turned to woodcut engravings is
                  significant, for the mid-nineteenth century was the heyday of the woodcut print whose
                  technique facilitated the production of large illustrated surveys. In comparison with
                  engravings on steel, woodcuts took relatively little time to make, and because they
                  used a relief process they could be placed in the press among the type, rather than
                  needing to be printed separately, as was the case with intaglio prints. This allowed
                  publishers to incorporate illustrations quite cheaply and so run less of a commercial
                  risk than was the case with engravings. It also meant that many more illustrations
                  could be supplied; the <em>Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</em>, with 256 of them, obviously benefitted from that circumstance.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Petrie's illustrator, George A. Hanlon, had the task of taking Petrie's field sketches
                     and rendering them as woodcut engravings without any sacrifice of the accuracy Petrie
                     had invested in them. Hanlon's life and career are not as well documented as Petrie's.
                     He was born circa 1814 and was a student in the Royal Dublin Society's Drawing School
                     in 1830. He provided woodcut illustrations for a variety of topographical, antiquarian,
                     scientific, and literary works in the 1840s and 1850s, including William Wilde's <em>The Beauties of the Boyne</em> (1849), William Wakeman's <em>Archæologia Hibernica</em> (1848) and William Wilde's <em>Descriptive Catalogue of the Antiquities ... in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy</em> (1857). He won prizes awarded by the Royal Irish Art Union for wood engraving in 1844
                     (for architectural views after Petrie) and again in 1846. His work with antiquities
                     seems to have been the mainstay of his career in Ireland and the 1849-50 audit of
                     the Royal Irish Academy records payments to him of £41 "on account of woodcuts."

                              Charles Hanlon, elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1844.</span></div>
                     </div> Hanlon achieved intellectual acknowledgement of his contribution to historical research,
                     for by 1854 he had become a member of the Kilkenny and South-East of Ireland Archaeological
                     Society (<em>Proceedings and Transactions</em> 8).</p>
               </div>
               <p>In Petrie's words (quoted above), Hanlon had engraved the designs "with an anxious
                  fidelity" and Thomas Davis' review of the <em>Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</em> was full of praise for his efforts: "The work is crowded with illustrations drawn
                  with wonderful accuracy, and engraved in a style which proves that Mr. O'Hanlon [sic],
                  the engraver, has become so proficient as hardly to have a superior in wood-cutting"
                  (<em>Round Towers</em> 107). These encomia do not, however, allow the modern reader to apprehend precisely
                  what it is that Hanlon's images convey. Contemporary wood engravers could produce
                  images of considerable refinement and complexity, as seen for example in the work
                  issuing from Josiah Whymper's establishment in London, but for the most part Hanlon's
                  images are shorn of all that virtuosity of line and tone. Only the handful of them
                  that adopt a topographical procedure begin to approach it; the majority of them are
                  deliberately prosaic. Now Petrie's text advances a view on Hanlon's illustration which
                  bears on all this. As we have seen, he declares that "they make but slight pretensions
                  to the character of works of art." They are not "showy," they have no "affectation
                  of freedom of handling, or forcible effect," and they are not especially attractive;
                  instead, they are "accurate", "trustworthy" and "may be considered as quotations".
                  This last statement is the nub of it, for Petrie makes a claim here that puts forward
                  the possibility of an unmediated image, as true to its original as a selection of
                  text copied from a manuscript.</p>
               <p>The analogy is, however, a loose one. Accurate quotation from a text is possible because
                  the only thing that might impede it would be physical damage to the original source,
                  serious enough to make a word or letter impossible to decipher with confidence. Once
                  damage is ruled out, it is of little consequence to the reader's understanding how
                  the quotation is presented on the page. As long as it is legible, it doesn't matter
                  that handwriting has become type or that one typeface or font has been substituted
                  for another; when it comes to the transmission of a string of words, the choice of
                  communicative vehicle is irrelevant. This is not, of course, to ignore the fact that
                  the practice of editorial work may raise further questions about the corruption of
                  the text, nor does it imply that it is possible simply though inspection to determine
                  the meaning of a textual fragment, but it is to point out that the syntactic organization
                  of a text is not affected by its being rendered in another script. With visual representation,
                  however, the choice is crucial. Illustration is always and inevitably an act of interpretation
                  where every decision about technique and materials acts as a form of editorial redaction
                  that inevitably compromises the possibility of quotation.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>If antiquarian representation as quotation is a problematic concept, it may perhaps
                     be better illuminated with reference to the three cardinal distinctions drawn in Charles
                     Sanders Peirce's semiotic system: index (where the signifier is directly connected
                     to the signified), icon (where the signifier resembles the signified), and symbol
                     (where the signifier's connection to what is signified is arbitrary or conventional).
                     Peirce is clear that his definitions of semiosis refer to "modes of relationship"
                     between sign vehicles (words, images, etc.) on the one hand and their referents on
                     the other and that these modes are not mutually exclusive; signification may involve
                     a combination of all these different forms of semiotic register. Using his definitions,
                     antiquarian illustration can be classified for the most part as predominantly iconic,
                     but it is often, despite the illustrator's best efforts, tilted towards the symbolic.
                     And this is so by virtue of the modes of depiction that all archaeological illustrations
                     deploy. The recognition of the coded nature of archaeological illustration has long
                     been understood. It can be found, for example, in remarks made by Stuart Piggott,
                     who took a cue from Ernst Gombrich to write about the symbolic nature of visual communication
                     in archaeology, "the agreed code of conventions" employed by its illustrators that
                     is informative only to those trained in its use (Piggott 165).

                     </div> Piggott's concern was primarily with the visual language of professional archaeology,
                     but as a scholar of archaeological draftsmanship of the previous three hundred years
                     he was aware that all forms of representation are artificial, even if the coding is
                     so taken for granted that we cease to pay attention to it. Hanlon and his fellow nineteenth-century
                     illustrators were necessarily bound by arbitrary and conventional modes of signification.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Petrie's notion of an illustration that can be classed as a quotation can be usefully
                     investigated from Peirce's perspective. Before the advent of photography, the only
                     representation that came close to working strictly in the sense Petrie claims was
                     a cast or mold, which in Peirce's semiotic system would be classed as an indexical
                     sign (where the signifier is directly connected to the signified). Needless to say,
                     a cast that bids to offer a simulacrum of the original has to be colored and accurate
                     coloration, if attempted at all, raises a whole new set of historical and technical
                     problems; but in terms of its size and its textural, formal, and iconographical data,
                     a cast is normally as reliable as any "quotation", in the sense Petrie intended. As
                     an example, we might consider the plaster cast of part of the Bayeux tapestry taken
                     by Charles Alfred Stothard in 1816-17 and hand-colored by him. The cast supplemented
                     Stothard's work at Bayeux for the Society of Antiquaries and probably helped him refine
                     his visual record of the tapestry, which resulted in two engravings. Both of them
                     were engraved by James Basire, Jr. The first was derived from Stothard's initial survey
                     of the tapestry. Stothard took this back to Bayeux and colored it on the spot. The
                     second, published in <em>Vetusta Monumenta</em> (1819-22), shows a more exact rendering of the appearance of the tapestry, including
                     details such as the stitching and variations in the disposition and color of the script.

                     to reproduce sculpture is first recorded in 1540, when the artists Francesco Primaticcio
                     and Jacopo Vignola made molds of Roman sculpture and took them back to France to be
                     cast in bronze for François I at Fontainebleau (MacGregor 76, 89). Thereafter, the
                     taking of casts from sculpture spread widely throughout Europe. Cast collections initially
                     comprised copies of classical sculpture and, from the eighteenth century, some of
                     them included copies of Renaissance works as well. From at least the 1830s, a few
                     examples of medieval sculpture were added to some cast collections, as with that of
                     the École des Beaux Arts in Paris. As their remit widened, cast collections brought
                     together simulations of sculpture and architecture in a panorama of human achievement.
                     A good example is the Architectural Museum, established in London in 1851 by the architect
                     George Gilbert Scott and his associates. Its cast collection was designed to become
                     the core of a national museum of architecture (Bottoms 115-139). The Fine Arts courts
                     on display at the Crystal Palace from the mid-1850s were much more ambitious, displaying
                     casts and architectural ensembles from ancient Egypt to the present.

                              to record ogham stones. Sir Samuel Fergusson's Ogham Inscriptions in Ireland, Wales

                              although Fergusson found paper molds more reliable than rubbings for this work (
                              “Preface,”

               </div>
               <p>In Peircean terms a rubbing, like a mold, is also indexical, for the representation
                  is produced by direct contact with its subject and traces what lies beneath the paper,
                  but unlike a mold it cannot so easily be considered a "quotation." It shares the mold's
                  limitation of translating one medium into another and likewise its inability to copy
                  color automatically but, more damagingly, it makes a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional
                  object and uses graphic marks to render a sculpted surface. But the rubbing is a good
                  limit case to begin the exploration of modes in the imaging process. What a rubbing
                  produces is an edited image, where the original object has been purged of all that
                  is not essential to its apprehension. Or, rather, the rubbing hypostatizes our cognitive
                  approach to the object, our intellectual as opposed to our sensual apprehension of
                  it. </p>
               <p>Effectively, the rubbing process distills from the monument a representation that
                  is rich in information and treats as unnecessary distractions the visual and material
                  qualities that suffuse the original. And this process of distillation is always present
                  in antiquarian illustration, too. The antiquarian image, in other words, is best understood
                  as a crystallization of cognitive assumptions about the object. But these assumptions
                  are not uniform, and decisions made about where an object's significance lies—what
                  aspect of it is most revealing and therefore requires visual capturing—may contain
                  a number of motives. The illustrator's choice of medium, technique, and presentation
                  is likewise a mode of signification; the same object becomes transmuted under the
                  impress of its different treatments. The question that arises from this is the extent
                  to which the illustration resembles the object under scrutiny and what, in this context,
                  we should take "resemble" to mean. For example, we readily accept two-dimensional
                  and scaled presentations of three-dimensional objects. Likewise, we accept that an
                  illustration is not necessarily required to provide a facsimile presentation of all
                  surface details. In these and related cases, the question of resemblance is settled
                  by the discursive context which controls the production and consumption of the image.
                  Depending on that context, the same feature may constitute significant evidence or
                  be an adventitious distraction from the object's correct presentation. It follows
                  that if both motive and method affect the process of producing the image, it is certainly
                  arguable that our designation of an illustration as faithfully resembling its original
                  is as much a judgment about the illustrator's understanding of the conventions of
                  visual recording in the specific circumstances of making the image as it is a judgment
                  about accuracy in an absolute sense. Resemble, with its connotations of mediation,
                  should not be confused with replicate.</p>
               <p>In Peirce's system, because illustrations resemble their originals they are iconic
                  even when their pictorial language is highly conventional (Harthshorne, Weiss, and
                  Burke 279). Nevertheless, the question we need to ask is, what balance is struck between
                  index, icon, and symbol in antiquarian illustration? As already indicated, the antiquarian
                  image is often more symbolic than we might think and operates diagrammatically, for
                  the adoption of an agreed or conventional usage pushes the illustration, no matter
                  how naturalistic it appears, into the realm of the symbolic. Indeed it might be claimed
                  that the diagram is essentially what the good antiquarian image has to be. No matter
                  that they may use naturalistic conventions, the point of most antiquarian images is
                  to display data that others may wish to analyze. In many presentations this requires
                  the purging of unnecessary visual information. This is not, however, a remark that
                  holds good for all antiquarian images—many of which contain, on this measure, superfluous
                  detail—and so opens them to criticism informed by progressivist and teleological understandings
                  of the transition from antiquarian to archaeological approaches in the study of the
                  past. The analysis offered here is not intended to buttress that position, which ignores
                  the specific protocols that affected the production of antiquarian images in different
                  circumstances. What it does highlight, however, is the implicit logic of the idea
                  that the antiquarian image is ineluctably a purveyor of information; this is what
                  led Petrie to his declaration and his insistence on the rectitude of his illustrations.

                  <p>Sometimes, the beauty of the objects and the skill of the illustrator militate against
                     this desideratum. The kinds of records made by skilled artists working in watercolor,

                  <p>How, then, should we investigate Hanlon's illustrations? Can we reconcile Petrie's
                     description of them as "quotations" with the selective, linear, and tendentious process
                     that, I have suggested, is the antiquarian's customary approach to image production?
                     To answer this question we can compare the woodcuts Hanlon supplied for Petrie and
                     those he supplied for Wakeman and try to establish the different modes of illustration
                     employed in those books. Although Hanlon's work for Petrie was much more extensive
                     than it was for Wakeman (256 cuts as opposed to 91), the woodcuts share many characteristics.
                     One obvious explanation is that Hanlon's training encouraged him to use woodcuts in
                     a particular way, but it would be wrong, I think, to give his technique too determinate
                     a role. Petrie and Wakeman were both capable artists in their own right and Hanlon
                     was given the job of working from sketches they had made in the field.

                     "anxious fidelity" he means fidelity to Petrie's original drawings, themselves made
                     with an "anxious desire for rigid accuracy." So if the appearance of these illustrations
                     is similar, and if their placement on the page follows the same pattern, this is not
                     because their executant woodcutter's personality as engraver and designer was dictating
                     the process; it is because the visual language of antiquarianism, its mode of discourse,
                     was common to all three of the men involved.</p>

               <p>That singular expression, "mode of discourse," is apt insofar as anyone turning the
                  pages of these books would not detect major differences in style from image to image;
                  the overarching visual language is, to that extent, consistent. But there are, nevertheless,
                  different approaches adopted for three different classes of image, and these may be
                  graded nearer to or further away from Petrie's idea of "quotation" from the original
                  object. There are a few images which are essentially diagrams, either showing sections
                  of architecture or comparative arrays of artifacts (Fig. 1). With these may be grouped
                  those illustrations inserted into the text to substantiate a point in visual terms,
                  but which do not attempt to engage the reader aesthetically, and although not diagrams
                  per se, they do operate diagrammatically. Petrie's more generous provision of illustrations
                  allows him to include much more of this kind of material than does Wakeman, and this
                  profusion of visual examples helps anchor his argument throughout. There is a further
                  class of illustration that makes use of a properly three-dimensional representation
                  but only displays that fragment of it which is necessary for the point made in the
                  text (Fig. 2). </p>

               <p> Most of these are economical and practical to a degree, supporting a line of argument,

                  <p>Distinguished from these woodcuts, however, are the vignette illustrations of prehistoric
                     and medieval structures, which Petrie always lists as "views" (Fig. 3). By and large,
                     all of these vignette illustrations are visually composed, they make full use of light
                     and shade to articulate the object in question, and they include some of its landscape
                     surroundings. The visual language here is tinged with the picturesque idiom one finds
                     in contemporary illustrated tours, and in some cases these vignettes are indistinguishable
                     from their equivalents in a book of picturesque beauties.

                     </div> The view format is where the idea of accurate "quotation" is at its weakest, for the
                     antiquarian image cannot now distinguish itself from better established habits of
                     visual engagement. The representation is too rich to be assimilated as a demonstration
                     of a point, and its abundance of detail frustrates cognitive clarity. In these cases
                     the spectator's customary aesthetic approach threatens to overwhelm the author's scholarly
                     concerns. Here, surely, Hanlon's woodcuts evince more than "slight pretensions to
                     the character of works of art": they are relatively "showy," and they do include "freedom
                     of handling, or forcible effect," precisely the qualities Petrie claimed to have banished
                     from the book.

                              opposite page. (See Petrie, Ecclesiastical Architecture, pp. 412-3.) This vignette
                              is clearly related to Petrie's 1838 watercolor 
                              “The Last Circuit of Pilgrims at Clonmacnoise”
                              (National Gallery of Ireland) and brings to mind his declaration that in the watercolor
                              his wish was "to produce an Irish picture somewhat historical in its object and poetical
                              in its sentiment." See William Stokes, The Life and Labours i…</span></div>
                     </div> In these picturesque vignettes, the paramount need for accuracy has given way to other
                     desiderata.</p>
               </div>
               <p>It would be a mistake to concentrate solely on these modes of presentation without
                  considering wider contexts, given that image-making is both internally and externally
                  differentiated from the overall visual matrix in which it operates. The circulation
                  of images of Irish antiquity was not restricted to the antiquarian enterprise. Indeed,
                  through their proselytizing for the preservation of Irish antiquities, Petrie, Wakeman,
                  and others were fuelling a tourist interest in such remains and, beyond that, were
                  binding Irish antiquities into a dignified historical narrative with implications
                  that Irish nationalists were keen to develop. It is not entirely surprising, therefore,
                  that occasionally the antiquarian and the picturesque domains of image-making overlap.
                  Looking back over 150 years, we might regard the more picturesque images as compromising
                  Petrie's claim of "quotation" and so detracting from the usefulness of the text from
                  a scholarly point of view. After all, by the 1840s there existed a variety of illustrated
                  antiquarian studies that paid scant heed to the picturesque and found their readership
                  primarily in learned circles. But with respect to Irish antiquities and the urgent
                  need to protect them from destruction, a text bereft of all aesthetic pleasure would
                  have missed its chance to gain a large readership. By using copious amounts of woodcuts
                  and including a variety of visual devices Petrie and Wakeman had an opportunity to
                  disseminate sound antiquarian research very widely and help in the construction of
                  a valid history of Ireland, a shared patrimony. In that sense, quotation could perhaps
                  be accompanied by exhortation.</p>
