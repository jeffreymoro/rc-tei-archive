            <p class="noCount">Historical writing on landscape painting in 18th and 19th century Britain has often
               been guided by a distinction between topography and the Sublime. The sharp line thus
               drawn between the routine and the exceptional, the plain and the imaginative, the
               derided and the elevated, matches that drawn between antiquarianism and the modern
               discipline of history. By exploring two images by the nineteenth century artist John
               Martin which defy or confuse these various distinctions, this essay seeks to complicate
               our sense of landscape painting’s history and its relationship with topography and
               antiquarian image-making.</p>

               <p>The opposition between topographical and imaginative landscape imagery has structured
                  the understanding of landscape art in important ways over the last two centuries,
                  in much the same way that the opposition between antiquarianism and historical writing
                  has helped structure historiography (see Momigliano; Myrone and Peltz; Phillips 1996).
                  Moreover, these two oppositions are not merely related by resemblance, but have actively
                  influenced each other and interacted: topographical interests have often given rise
                  to antiquarian research, antiquarian research has led to the creation of topographical
                  imagery, and, insofar as topographical images so often contain and even focus on ruins
                  and monuments as well as the worked, bounded, and otherwise historically marked landscape,
                  they have served as pre-eminent antiquarian resources. Indeed, antiquarianism itself
                  might even be defined as a historical practice by the special status it lends visual
                  images as a form of evidence. The distinction between (and complaint against) the
                  topographical has often also mobilized the prejudices (social as well as strictly
                  intellectual) against antiquaries. The classic statement of such an opposition was
                  contained in Henry Fuseli's Fourth Lecture on Painting as Professor of that art at
                  the Royal Academy (first delivered 1804), in a passage which has been quoted repeatedly
                  in recent scholarship as a means of illuminating the deepened antipathy towards topographical
                  representation from an increasingly powerful metropolitan fine art establishment (see
                  Myrone 2009, 57; Daniels and Bonehill 2012, 178): <span class="quote">‘To portrait painting, thus circumscribed [as "a kind of family kalendar" (sic)] we
                     subjoin, as the last branch of uninteresting subjects, the kind of landscape which
                     is entirely occupied with the tame delineation of a given spot; an enumeration of
                     hill and dale, clumps of trees, shrubs, water, meadows, cottages, and houses, what
                     is commonly called Views. These, if not assisted by nature, dictated by taste, or
                     chosen for character, may delight the owner of the acres they enclose, the inhabitants
                     of the spot, perhaps the antiquary or the traveller, but to every other eye they are
                     little more than topography. The landscape of Titian, of Mola, or Salvator, of the
                     Poussins, Claude, Rubens, Elzheimer, Rembrandt, and Wilson, spurns all relation with
                     this kind of map-work. (qtd. in Baumgarten Vol. I, 141)’</span> The images that would, then, satisfy "the antiquary or the traveller" appear almost
                  inevitably to fall short of the status of art, or at least art of any intellectual
                  or aesthetic ambition. These oppositions, between "map-work" and "art" so defined—oppositions
                  generally assumed to be immediately self-evident and irrefutable—continue to operate
                  with axiomatic force in much curatorial and art historical practice. As John Barrell
                  asserts in his damning critique of the recent exhibition <em>Constable, Gainsborough, Turner and the Making of Landscape</em> (Royal Academy of Arts, London 2012-13), the historical narrative which arises from
                  such a division underlies the most conventional story of landscape painting in Britain.
                  In Barrell's view, this was simply re-stated, uncritically, by the exhibition, for
                  it told (as he quotes the exhibition booklet): <span class="quote">‘how there was in the 18th century a variety of landscape called "topography," sometimes
                     "strict topography," which was committed to "the accurate recording of particular
                     places." The exhibition includes several such pictures, watercolors by Sandby, Michael
                     Angelo Rooker and others, beautiful but somehow small-minded, limited in their ambition,
                     we are invited to believe. Eventually, however, in the early 19th century, topographical
                     art was transcended by something infinitely more serious and more powerful, a sublime
                     style of painting that sought to represent the "grandeur of nature", and to produce
                     in us "feelings of awe, fear or horror." This new landscape art, exemplified primarily
                     by Turner, could also see through mere "particular places" to show us something that
                     transcended all particularity, and which in this exhibition goes by such names as
                     "British landscape scenery in its own right," or "nature itself."’</span></p>
               <p>The narrative laid out here has some uncanny (and telling) similarities to that which
                  can be told about the rise of "history" and "archaeology" in the nineteenth century
                  in opposition to, and replacing, antiquarianism: the minute and trivial being displaced
                  by the grand and firm, the small-minded by the expansive, the cold and distant by
                  the urgent and engaged. We should be alert to the reflexiveness of such a position
                  in the early nineteenth century—this division was one of the ways the "British School"
                  of art was knowingly defined (see Phillips 2003)—and such an account of landscape
                  art, appearing though it has at a major London exhibition venue, and enduring as it
                  does in some popular and scholarly publishing and broadcasting, has been challenged
                  repeatedly over the last thirty years or more, which fact must help explain the note
                  of exasperation apparent in Barrell's polemic. Accounts of landscape imagery that
                  propose it can "only" or "simply" represent the truth of the natural world have long
                  been under scrutiny while landscape painting has been a primary focus of progressive
                  scholarship in art history and visual culture studies. Clearly, this has been part
                  of a much larger critique of visual representation which embraces antiquarian image-making
                  as well as high art: as Stephanie Moser and Sam Smiles have asserted in introducing
                  a collection of essays around archaeological imaging: "We now routinely accept that
                  no pictorial device can be a transparent illustration of the world, but instead deploys
                  technical devices, formal conventions, and ideological assumptions to orchestrate
                  meaning" (1). With reference to British landscape art more particularly, we have witnessed
                  a highly concentrated and hugely influential chain of scholarly contributions which,
                  in the 1980s and early 1990s, reshaped British art history at large: John Barrell's
                  seminal <em>The Dark Side of the Landscape</em> (1980), David Solkin's <em>Richard Wilson: The Landscape of Reaction</em> (1982), and Michael Rosenthal's <em>Constable: The Painter and his Landscape</em> (1983), followed by Ann Bermingham's <em>Landscape and Ideology</em> (1989), Andrew Hemingway's <em>Landscape Imagery and Urban Culture in Early Nineteenth-Century Britain</em> (1992) and Kay Dian Kriz's <em>The Idea of the English Landscape Painter</em> (1997), as well as numerous articles and chapters by these authors and others. Where
                  these mainly focused on oil painting and reproductive prints, even more recently Andrew
                  Kennedy, Stephen Daniels, John Bonehill (2009), and others have also subjected topographical
                  and antiquarian landscape imagery to serious critical scrutiny. Topographical imagery
                  is being actively rehabilitated as part of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century visual
                  culture, with the insistence that "topography should be analysed in relation to larger
                  structures of knowledge and value and the changing technologies and communication
                  systems of this nascent consumer society" (Myrone 
                  “The Monarch,”
                  57). The heroic narratives which suggested that antiquarianism was simply superseded
                  by modern historical and archaeological methods in the nineteenth century have given
                  way to accounts which are more localized in their concerns and more ready to acknowledge
                  the sympathies, paradoxes, and continuities apparent in the emergence of modern disciplinary
                  formations in the practice of history (see Myrone and Peltz, Smiles and Moser; Arnold
                  and Bending; Pearce and Nurse, <span class="foreign">et al</span>.).</p>
               <p>Here I want to address two images which can be positioned productively in the nexus
                  of imaginative and topographical landscape imaging, art, and antiquarianism, in order
                  further to complicate and revise our understanding of these purported divisions: John
                  Martin's drawing of Avebury, imagined in its purportedly original state (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.wiltshireheritagecollections.org.uk/index.asp?page=item&amp;mwsquery=%7BIdentity">drawn circa 1815-22, published as an engraving in 1825, and housed at the Wiltshire
                     Heritage Museum</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="number%7D=%7BDZSWS:1982.3270%7D">drawn circa 1815-22, published as an engraving in 1825, and housed at the Wiltshire
                     Heritage Museum</a>) and his large oil painting, <a class="new" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/martin-the-destruction-of-pompei-and-herculaneum-n00793"><em>The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</em></a> (completed and exhibited for the first time in 1822; now in the collection of Tate,
                  London). Martin has been only an awkward presence in the history of landscape painting,
                  either too extravagant or too prosaic. Either way, his work has appeared too far detached
                  from the moderated naturalism which purportedly defines the national school to qualify
                  him as a "master". Situating these very different images in relation to the poles
                  of imaginative and topographical image-making, and in the context of "Romantic Visuality"
                  as an inherently unstable and shifting phenomenon, should expose a more complex and
                  even unclear situation than commentators like Fuseli, or even his critics, would seem
                  to allow.</p>
               <p>Both images could readily be considered in the context of much wider visual cultures
                  around the sites concerned, and there is an existing literature around the imaging
                  of Avebury (and of ancient British monuments) and of Pompeii and Herculaneum in the
                  early nineteenth century. We could, very usefully, analyze these images without any
                  reference to their authorship for what they might tell us about the topographical
                  and artistic interpretation of these key historical locations at a moment at which
                  the virtues and possibilities of landscape representation were being so thoroughly
                  explored and overhauled. My intention here, though, is rather more modest and localized
                  and focuses more on the ways we may read these images in relation to the professional
                  positioning of Martin and Britton. Without wanting to revert to a naively biographical
                  form of art-historical interpretation, I would nonetheless insist that this approach
                  may help us to further appreciate the strategic (which is not to say necessarily self-conscious)
                  value attached to antiquarianism and topography as they may have been deployed in
                  the rapidly shifting social terrains of early nineteenth-century metropolitan culture,
                  a cultural <em>field</em> in the full sense (as defined by struggle between its members over their respective
                  virtues, values, and rights) (see Bourdieu).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The first work under consideration, Martin's sepia-tinted drawing of the ancient monument
                     of Avebury, was prepared for publication as a print for the belated third volume of
                     the topographer John Britton's <em>Beauties of Wiltshire</em> (1801-1825). Martin's design, based—so we are told via the inscription of the published
                     print reproducing the image in Britton's book—on a sketch by Britton himself, is described
                     in a footnote: <span class="quote">‘The annexed view has been drawn for the purpose of conveying to a stranger some idea
                        of this Temple in its primeval state. It professes to shew the whole from an imaginary
                        station, about one mile north of the circles. Near the foreground is a cromlech (still
                        remaining, but fallen,) with stones surrounding it; and the very skilful artist who
                        made the drawing, has indicated an immense procession of ancient Britons, presumed
                        to be in the act of performing some funeral ceremony. (276-77n)’</span> The drawing is undated, but the reproductive print's inscription gives a publication
                     date of August 1, 1824. It seems reasonable to assume that Martin would have produced
                     it between 1822 and 1824, when he was already at work for Britton producing topographical
                     designs of William Beckford's Fonthill Abbey (also in Wiltshire) and a drawing of
                     Wells Cathedral for another Britton publication, and when too he was part of the same
                     social circle in London (confirmed as a short-lived Pot Luck Club which, besides Britton
                     and Martin, included William Jerdan, Alaric A. Watts and others.

                              British art and associated with current "Neo-Romanticism" (letter of 5 February 1948,

                     </div> By the date of the publication of the print, Martin had already produced and exhibited
                     the several large paintings of biblical epics and historical disasters on which his
                     reputation was to rest: <em>Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still</em> (1816; National Gallery of Art, Washington), <em>The Fall of Babylon</em> (1819; private collection, Europe), <em>Belshazzar's Feast</em> (1821; private collection, England) and <em>The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</em> (1822; Tate), addressed below; he had also launched the series of hugely original
                     mezzotint illustrations of Milton's <em>Paradise Lost</em> which secured him even wider fame. Martin's historical reputation (or infamy) has
                     rested on these images, readily interpreted as extravagantly imaginative and wildly
                     detached from any sort of tamely antiquarian and topographical impulses.</p>
               </div>
               <p>By almost any criteria, traditional opinions about Martin's <em>Avebury</em> may be allowed to stand, insofar as they establish that this drawing and the resulting
                  small print may not be of primary historical interest in relation to his life and
                  career, to landscape imagery in the early nineteenth century, or perhaps even to the
                  history of the illustration of that site. (Recent accounts generally overlook Britton's
                  publication and Martin's drawing in favour of William Stukeley's earlier and more
                  prominent contributions to archaeological scholarship.) But without wanting wilfully
                  to overturn received opinion or attempting to elevate this drawing to an art-historical
                  standing it is unlikely to bear, I am suggesting that Martin's Avebury nonetheless
                  helps illuminate something of the disorderly, "predisciplinary" energies surrounding
                  antiquarian image-making in the early years of the nineteenth century (see Calè and
                  Craciun). These allowed for a closer interaction than we might anticipate—given accepted
                  scholarly wisdom—between commercial self-interest and public virtue, between antiquarianism
                  and modernity, and between art and its others. In particular, we can point to parallel
                  investments (perhaps over-investments) on the parts of Britton and Martin in an apparently
                  paradoxical kind of sublime or imaginative antiquarianism which promised these authors
                  social and financial remuneration.</p>
               <p>The prehistoric site of Avebury had fascinated antiquaries throughout the seventeenth
                  and eighteenth centuries. Britton's text documented the many, various theories and
                  suggestions that had been made about the remains, maintaining a skeptical view towards
                  all of these. With its panoramic perspective and orderly presentation of both the
                  site and the ancient Britons themselves, Martin's picture reflects the more positive
                  view at that time of primitive British society as essentially benign, decorous, and
                  only vaguely mystical. Sam Smiles in his important survey of Romantic images of ancient
                  Britons identifies this as helping exemplify the "benign image of Druidic worship"
                  which became dominant by the early nineteenth century: <span class="quote">‘All is decorous and ordered, the vast crowds move forward with the solemn pageantry
                     appropriate for religious ceremonial. It takes little more than a moment's contemplation
                     to note that the success of this image lies in its complete avoidance of any descriptive
                     detail. The figures are on such a minute scale that the rites which accompany this
                     funeral cannot be specified; all we are left with is a vague sense of religiosity
                     conveyed by the disciplined patterns of the celebrants. (<em>Image of Antiquity</em> 86)’</span> The point is especially clear when Martin's image is compared to <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3434306&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=The+Druid%27s+Sacrifice">William Overand Geller's <em>The Druid's Sacrifice</em></a> (1833), paradoxically "almost a caricature of Martin at his most apocalyptic" where
                  Stonehenge is presented as the site of "savage tumult, whipped on by Druid instigation
                  to an emotional climax with the broody, bloody circles" (Smiles, <em>Image</em> 96).</p>
               <p>Britton's interpretation (tentative as it was, as we will see) was that the site was
                  for "sepulchral" rather than "sacrificial" purposes. He did, though, emphatically
                  reject the "<em>visionary</em> theories" about the site forwarded most famously by William Stukeley (1687-1765),
                  and most recently by Henry Browne (1769-1839), the model-maker and custodian of Stonehenge.
                  Although Britton took the opportunity to praise Browne's models of Stonehenge and
                  Avebury ("almost faultless") and went so far as to propose a subscription scheme to
                  initiate a museum space to show them (of which more below), he dismissed as merely
                  fanciful his projection of religious or spiritual qualities onto the landscape and
                  the proposal of an antediluvian vintage for the monuments (<em>Beauties of Wiltshire</em>, Vol. 3, 304-5, 305n). But this maneuver is not simply the eschewal of an imaginative
                  or emotional involvement with antiquity in favour of a scientific objectivity which
                  we would associate, definitively, with modern disciplinary stances (of archaeology).
                  Britton's position is worth laying out in full: <span class="quote">‘Having thus briefly noticed the opinions and theories of different authors, who have
                     written on this obscure and unauthenticated subject, I would readily offer an opinion
                     of my own, if I could found it on authority—or if I could adduce any thing like historical
                     or demonstrative evidence; but when neither of these can be obtained—when all is vague,
                     dark, and inscrutable—I cannot help regarding it as arrogant to pronounce a decided
                     opinion, or advance an argument with pertinacity. Otherwise, like Stukeley and his
                     partisans, I could easily contend that the monument at Avebury was a dragontium temple—that
                     the figure, form, and involutions of a coiled serpent, were clearly to be traced—that
                     it could not have been formed by any other class of persons than the Druids—that Druidism
                     was the only system of religion in the island one thousand years before Christ—and
                     that in this place Druidical worship was periodically performed, sacrifices made,
                     and pagan rites and ceremonies observed. On these points there is ample scope for
                     argument, or rather animadversion; and certain minds can readily be brought to yield
                     all their credence to such theories. To the hypotheses of Pinkerton and Maculloch
                     it is equally easy to yield assent; for it is equally easy in either to find a certain
                     style of argument, and to assign certain plausible reasons; but neither the one or
                     the other—neither the antediluvian nor the Roman origin—can be proved by the evidence
                     of authentic history, nor yet by logical demonstration. Hence every one may indulge
                     in speculation and conjecture, and every one <em>amuse himself</em> in forming theories, which it would be impossible to establish, either by fact or
                     argument. (<em>Beauties</em>, Vol. 3, 305-6)’</span> Britton seems here to be "having his cake and eating it". He runs through the rather
                  enticing, even thrilling, theories of earlier writers, yet dismisses them as mere
                  speculation. In his later 
                  “Brief Accounts with Illustrations of Ancient Barrows and of the Druidical Temples
                  of Avebury and Stonehenge”
                  Britton acknowledged his own early fascination with "These vast, mysterious, and marvellous
                  relics of distant ages," stating of Avenbury that "The mystic halo which enveloped
                  it, tended rather to awaken than repress research" (<em>Autobiography</em>, Vol. 3, 49): <span class="quote">‘At first, and for many years, I was harassed, and indeed distressed, by the theoretical
                     opinions and visionary speculations of authors, who had written about the Druids and
                     their monuments; and I was often tempted to relinquish the pursuit, in despair of
                     ever arriving at any thing like proof, or rational evidence. . . .The futile theories
                     of Borlase, King, Waltire, Browne, and many others, respecting rock-basins, sacrificial
                     altars, ante-diluvian monuments, and temples for serpent-worship, not only excited
                     doubt and discredit, but also regret that the patience and philosophy of readers should
                     be so taxed and tantalized with the apparent learning and credulity of writers. (<em>Autobiography</em>, Vol. 3, 50)’</span> Britton claims, therefore, "I deemed it advisable to limit myself to matters of fact,
                  to plain descriptions of the monuments as they now appear, with such intimations for
                  their pristine state and purposes, as common sense and reasonable deduction would
                  warrant" (<em>Autobiography</em>, Vol. 3, 50).</p>
               <p>Yet where would we place Martin's design in relation to the "matters of fact" favored
                  by Britton? As far as we can tell his image shows a "sepulchral" use of the site,
                  or at least there are no signs of the sort of crowd agitation and atmospheric frenzy
                  which artists and writers were wont to introduce into their suggestions of "sacrificial"
                  activities. In fact, as Smiles implies, it is really quite hard to tell what is going
                  on: we are made witness to a placid procession of no evident purpose. And yet, neither
                  is this a bare record of known facts, but a projection of the historical appearance
                  of a site which (as successive antiquarians down to Britton had recorded) had been
                  greatly transformed by time and human interventions. The great procession of of ancient
                  Britons snaking through the scenery is pure speculation, and if it introduces a sense
                  of scale it does so in an unnecessarily elaborate way. And, finally, to judge from
                  the surviving evidence, Britton himself was a perfectly capable artist who had already
                  executed a series of drawings and watercolors of Avebury, one of which provided the
                  source material for Martin. There must have been an expectation that Martin would
                  add something to Britton's design; but it was not accuracy, nor an added level of
                  finish. (Britton's drawing, dated 1815, is considerably more finished and colored).
                  </p>
               <p>Arguably, what Martin brought must be what the pioneering fossil-hunter Gideon Mantell
                  was later to term "magic" when he referred to his engagement of the artist in the
                  task of illustrating his treatise on prehistoric creatures (Mantell, Vol. 1, 369)
                  or what we might, in this context and evoking Britton's own words, call a "mystic
                  halo." His presence, as an artist now well-established in the public imagination as
                  a painter of the extraordinary and sublime, offers a note of extravagance which the
                  relative restraint of the actual image does not mitigate completely. Notwithstanding
                  his rhetorical appeal to "rational evidence," Britton was very ready to go down the
                  route of optical entertainment and explore the potential for what we might now term
                  "Gothic Technologies" (see Miles 2005; Baugh 2007). Britton's remarkable, tailor-made
                  "Celtic Cabinet" (now housed at Devizes Museum)—which he designed for a collector
                  but later displayed in his own collection—literally showcases watercolors and models,
                  and features "a glazed shade at the top, of four various tints of glass, to display,
                  under so many different effects" replicas of Stonehenge (<em>Autobiography</em>,161; see Chippendale; Evans 151-2). With this piece, Britton invited the viewer to
                  look at a scale replica of "Nature" quite literally through the "stained glass" that
                  Coleridge had perceived as intruding into John Martin's painterly vision (Woodring
                  1:152). Following up on the suggestion he made in a footnote in Volume III of the
                  <em>Beauties of Wiltshire</em>, Britton went so far as to announce his plans for a Druidical Antiquarian Company:
                  <span class="quote">‘In the present age of Joint Stock Companies, or stock-jobbing bubbles, we can scarcely
                     use the word, "Company" without exciting suspicion and almost dread. It is employed
                     here merely jocosely, not with a view of continuing it, should the suggestions now
                     offered obtain the sanction of a sufficient number of gentlemen to carry them into
                     effect. It may be proper to remark, that I have meditated on a novel plan for exhibiting
                     models, pictures to be elucidated by lectures. This plan would combine something of
                     the principles of the Cosmorama, Diorama, Panorama, and Eidophusicon; and I am persuaded
                     that a very interesting exhibition might be formed of Celtic or Druidical Antiquities,
                     whereby amusement and instruction might be united and where "fools who came to scoff"
                     would stay and muse. (Britton 
                     “[Letter]”
                     511)’</span> Perhaps in an earlier age Britton's allusion to "amusement" could readily be taken
                  as referring only to the possibility of private entertainment, a softening of the
                  hard task of intellectual labor undertaken in the library. Elsewhere Britton articulated
                  such a role for illustration and artifact (writing in 1840, by which time the terminology
                  around the discipline of archaeology was taking on its modern meanings): "As the florist
                  and the botanist have their <span class="foreign">hortus siccus</span>, to preserve, and renew, to the eye and mind, the forms and hues of flowers and plants,
                  so has the archaeologist his casts, models, drawings, and engravings, of rare and
                  interesting antiquities" (<em>Autobiography</em>, 333). But early nineteenth-century metropolitan culture offered quite another context
                  for antiquarian knowledge, one characterized, as James Chandler and Kevin Gilmartin
                  have recently observed, by "[b]lurred boundaries and conflicting cultural imperatives"
                  (35).</p>
               <p>From the work of historians of science on the Royal Society, particularly Steven Shapin,
                  we are now familiar with the idea that the discourse of scientific scrutiny and validation
                  which became such a force in the intellectual field from the late seventeenth century
                  also marked out the socially-defined boundaries around formal knowledge: the rhetoric
                  of disinterest, universality, and inclusion also disguised social exclusions. But
                  Britton was writing in the context of a rapidly developing urban culture of entertainment,
                  one that undermined previous generations' disciplining and policing of knowledge.
                  Reviewing the third volume of Britton's <em>Beauties</em>, <em>The Monthly Review</em> noted in its description of Avebury that "though a curiosity of unparalleled interest
                  according to the testimony of every antiquary, [it] is little known to the general
                  body of tourists" (
                  “Britton's <em>Beauties</em>”
                  258). Britton himself was, or became, conscious of a frank democratization of knowledge
                  that commercialization made possible: <span class="quote">‘When I commenced my Topographical career, at the end of the last century, it should
                     be remembered, that most of the books I could refer to, or regard as models, were
                     of the class described by Mr [Richard] Gough; and that the great mass of the people
                     were besotted in ignorance and consequent superstition, whilst the highest orders
                     were generally immersed in partizanship and political ambition. The rich kept aloof
                     from and shunned the poor, whilst the latter regarded the former as severe and cruel
                     taskmasters. Hence discord and contention ensued, and hence arose those hatreds and
                     animosities which became manifested in the insurrections and rebellions of America,
                     France and Ireland. Though these national convulsions were terrific and lamentable
                     at their respective epochs, we may derive from them the consolation of knowing and
                     enjoying the enlightenment and amenity of sentiment which belong to the present philosophical
                     age. In the current state of Topography and Archaeology, we witness the effect of
                     this spirit—the progress of mind and sentiment. (<em>Autobiography</em>, Vol. 3, 334)’</span> The potential legitimacy and socially transformative value of enjoying historical
                  and architectural speculations as a form of amusement, without the hope of securing
                  absolute scholarly truths, seems key to the way Martin himself expected his art to
                  be appreciated and, accordingly, how he expected to be accepted as an artist of importance.
                  Writing a few years later of his artistic recreations of the lost cities of Nineveh
                  and Babylon, he pointed to a similar belief in the right to poetic license on the
                  part of the painter, which need not, however, lead to sheer visionary invention or
                  simple fancy: <span class="quote">‘The mighty cities of Nineveh and Babylon have long since passed away, and, till lately,
                     the traveller hath sought in vain for the spot where their dust reposed. The accounts
                     of their greatness and splendour, handed down to us by the historians, may have been
                     exaggerated; but, where strict truth is not essential, the mind is content to find
                     delight in the contemplation of the grand and the marvellous. Into the solemn obscure
                     of antiquity we look without demanding, or even expecting, the clear day-light of
                     truth. Seen through the mist of ages, the <em>great</em> becomes <em>gigantic</em>, the <em>wonderful</em> swells into the <em>sublime</em>, and we do not start back in derision of the mighty shadows. (<em>Fall of Nineveh</em> 5)’</span> Martin thus rehashes a Burkean position on the amplifying effects of temporal and
                  physical distance: a sublime which is old and/or distant may be more readily admired,
                  may be more sublime. Martin's panoramic view of the Avebury landscape, with its primitive
                  architecture stretching back into the limitless distance and its vast multitude in
                  snaking procession conveying a nearly incomprehensible sense of scale, conforms to
                  this free (but not undisciplined) pursuit of the "grand and the marvelous". The sublime
                  thus proves itself as a kind of loop-hole or blind-spot within Romantic-period artistic
                  and historical discourse, allowing for the possibility of an emotional and sensory
                  engagement with the visual which may in turn facilitate social change and commercial
                  advantage. Yet there were, clearly, risks involved here as well, as the critical reception
                  of Martin's work makes most vividly evident.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Although Martin does not figure in Britton's autobiography, nor was Britton noticed

                              for the "arduous labors, and great success in advancing art and architecture" of the
                              topographer while seeking to acquire plates from him to complete his collection of
                              his works (letters from Martin to Britton, Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections
                              La.II.426 and La.II.648). Britton, meanwhile, once wrote privately: "Of Martin'…</span></div>
                     </div> This may only point to an amicable connection and mutual regard in the context of
                     a densely networked community of metropolitan cultural producers. But the social trajectories
                     of the two men also have some close parallels. Both were born in what they themselves
                     termed "humble" circumstances, in locations physically isolated from the centers of
                     literate culture. Martin was born in Haydon Bridge, in Northumbria, in a small cottage,
                     with a father of no fixed occupation, and despite having received some elementary
                     formal education was sent into an apprenticeship as a coachpainter. Britton grew up
                     in "a rude and truly illiterate village . . . I do not recollect that I ever beheld
                     a newspaper before the age of fifteen, nor did I ever hear of a magazine, review,
                     or any book, but a few novels, which my elder sister occasionally obtained from the
                     neighbouring town of Chippenham" (<em>Beauties</em>, Vol. 3, 16). Both, too, had family connections which connected them to the higher
                     echelons of society. Martin's mother descended from landowners, though the family
                     had come down in the world considerably. In Britton's family there was "talk of 'great
                     relations'" and he admitted, intriguingly, that "these vague, undefined, and probably
                     exaggerated stories, excited a little wonder, and some share of vanity" (<em>Beauties</em>, Vol. 3, 14). Both Britton and Martin moved to the metropolis and engaged in a range
                     of activities to make ends meet, bringing both of them into immediate contact with
                     the burgeoning culture of optical entertainment. (Martin worked as a glass painter;
                     Britton at one point helped operate a version of P.J. de Loutherbourg's famous moving-images
                     show, the Eidophusikon.) We may want to account for all this as mere coincidence.
                     But if we follow Ralph O'Connor's full consideration of the social profiles of a network
                     of fossil hunters and geological exhibitors in the early nineteenth century, we might
                     recognize that there were some more widely shared personal experiences and social
                     destinies which must have helped shape their activities. Martin was closely linked
                     professionally and personally with several of the scientific popularizers given as
                     examples by O'Connor, men from unprivileged backgrounds who tended towards "simultaneously
                     cultivating and repudiating 'vulgar' sensationalism," reflecting their desire for
                     commercial success and their (perhaps competing) social and intellectual ambitions.
                     Like the work of these men in publicizing their scientific discoveries, Martin tended
                     to waver between outright sensationalism and a strenuous attention to detail. His
                     paintings and mezzotints may often be big and spectacular, but he went to great lengths
                     to tell viewers that they were based on a close reading of historical, geographical,
                     and poetic source materials in the illustrated pamphlets he issued to accompany these
                     works. As O'Connor has discussed at length, Martin's pamphlets deserve to be treated
                     as complex documents in their own right, drawing together scholarly, poetic, and imaginative
                     materials and in so doing articulating an unsteady fusion of entertainment, commercialism,
                     and didacticism. O'Connor's account alerts us to the way that while the images may
                     seem to amount to a sort of instantaneously satisfying spectacle, the accompanying
                     texts direct us to take our time, to consider, reflect, and even study, thus articulating
                     a decided tension between sensationalism and intellectual seriousness.</p>
               </div>
               <p>One of O'Connor's examples is William Bullock, whose Egyptian Hall was the premier
                  or at least the most prominent museum space in the early nineteenth century, where
                  "edification was inseparable from theatricality" (37-8). Which brings us to <a class="new" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/martin-the-destruction-of-pompei-and-herculaneum-n00793">Martin's <em>Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</em></a>, first exhibited as the centerpiece of his one-man show at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly,
                  London, which opened with a private viewing at the end of March 1822 and remained
                  open until the end of July. While the drawing of <em>Avebury</em> is a topographical design for an antiquarian publication which has a certain sublime
                  enhancement, <em>The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</em> is very obviously a sublime entertainment which, nonetheless, participates in a topographical
                  and antiquarian viewing dynamic.</p>
               <p>The Egyptian Hall had previously been the venue for a series of successful art exhibitions
                  focused on spectacular works, such as Haydon's <em>Christ's Triumphant Entry into Jerusalem</em>, shown in 1820, Théodore Gericault's <em>The Raft of the Medusa</em> in 1820 and James Ward's vast allegory of Waterloo in 1821. Martin's show ran alongside
                  a program of varied entertainments, including an exhibition on Lapland featuring actual
                  Laplanders in full costume with a sleigh and live reindeer, before a panoramic backdrop
                  (January 15-April 4), the annual exhibition of the Society of Painters in Watercolour
                  (April 23-June 29), 
                  “The Terror of India”
                  , featuring a gigantic snake and other terrifying animals (from late July), and the
                  
                  “African Museum of Natural History”
                  (from October) (see Costeloe). The exhibition was accompanied by a 31-page pamphlet,
                  which was dominated by a lengthy description of the painting (No.1 in the catalogue
                  and taking up 25 pages) and a line etching providing a key to the important people
                  and buildings in the cities and itemizing some thirty-two geographical, figural, and
                  architectural points of interest ("The Villa Suburbina . . . Granary wherein were
                  found measures with false bottoms . . . The Gate of Nola . . . Pliny embracing his
                  friend Pomponianus . . . The Sea agitated by the earthquake, and retiring..."). The
                  other twenty-four catalogued items were paintings and drawings also by Martin. These
                  included some of the small topographical paintings and watercolors from earlier in
                  his career; the large <em>Fall of Babylon</em>, which was illustrated in an etched key with a briefer note of "Historical Accounts"
                  "strictly attended to" in producing the painting and, as No. 26 
                  “Plan of the Country, shewing the situation of the Cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum;
                  also the portion of the country included in the picture No. 1”
                  (<em>Pompeii</em>). Martin was able to refer to Edwin Atherstone's recent poem on the theme, and to
                  Sir William Gell's and Joseph Gandy's scholarly work <em>Pompeiana</em> (1817–19) to elucidate his presentation of the disaster. He was particularly at pains
                  to insist upon the correct "scale of proportion" he had applied in representing the
                  scene from the elevated position of Stabiae, and appears to have included as part
                  of the exhibition, besides the map listed as No. 26, further supporting topographical,
                  cartographical, and antiquarian materials for visitors to consult: <span class="quote">‘The elevation of the foreground, in which the principal figures are seen, is three
                     hundred and forty-eight feet above the level of the sea; an elevation, according to
                     the statement of the most intelligent travellers, more than sufficient to enable the
                     spectator to take into view every city, within the angle of vision represented in
                     this picture.’</span> <span class="quote">‘For further explanation of this part, the reader is referred to the maps and plans
                     which are in the exhibition room; and which shew the attention that has been given
                     to place every known object in its true situation, according to the best authorities.
                     (<em>Pompeii</em>, 24)’</span> A correspondent in the <em>Literary Gazette</em>, who had criticisms about the painting itself, noted that "Diagrams carefully drawn,
                  and laid down on the table, opposite the picture, may lead to the understanding of
                  it in a geographical point of view" (April 27, 1822).</p>
               <p>The painting was promoted in advertisements as "the most extraordinary production
                  of the pencil that has ever appeared in this or any other country" (<em>Morning Chronicle</em>, March 29, 1822). The fact that Martin chose to make the painting the centerpiece
                  of an exhibition that followed immediately after the huge popular successes of <em>Joshua</em> and <em>Belshazzar's Feast</em> is in itself telling, of course. Other commentators were hardly less enthusiastic
                  in their praise. <em>Ackermann's Repository</em> claimed that: <span class="quote">‘It is a powerful address to the imagination, and upon a subject which enabled the
                     artist to indulge the full latitude of his conceptions. The blue lightening has a
                     vigorous effect, and saves the picture from the absolute tyranny of a scarlet tone.
                     The horror of the scene is much increased by the destruction of shipping from the
                     receding and agitation of the sea. The total helplessness of man is shown in the various
                     and ineffectual efforts of human beings vainly endeavouring to escape from the general
                     calamity. Mr. Martin has adhered to the historian's record of the catastrophe, which
                     realised all the horror which the most vivid fancy could paint. (301)’</span> The <em>Examiner</em> (April 7, 1822) acknowledged some faults with the painting, but proposed that "the
                  work is more complete than any previously painted by this Artist."</p>
               <p>In many ways John Martin's <em>Avebury</em> and <em>Destruction of Pompeii and Hercualenuem</em> occupy separate ends of a spectrum of landscape imagery. <em>Avebury</em> is a relatively modestly-sized graphic work, attending to the archaeological record
                  in its presentation of a "benign" landscape scene and destined for the relatively
                  rarefied context of antiquarian research, albeit as it was transforming into "tourism"
                  as we might now understand it. <em>The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</em> sits at the most extravagant and outlandish end of imaginative landscape painting,
                  with its catastrophic theme, emphatic coloring, and display of the sublime so over-emphatic
                  it exceeded the bounds of acceptable taste (and moved, as many contemporary critics
                  complained, beyond the realm of painting into the phantasmagorical). If traditional
                  criteria were crudely applied, we would have a vivid illustration of the poles of
                  mere topography or "map work" and imaginative landscape. But both works unsettle that
                  opposition. <em>Avebury</em> is a work of imagination, making visible the "mystic halo" surrounding the site that
                  drew Britton into his researches, even as he struggled with his skepticism and towards
                  rationalism. <em>Pompeii and Herculaneum</em> is also a work of "the historian's record" in which the specificities of geography
                  are evoked, even as the viewer may be overawed or even inspired to spiritual reflection.
                  Both may cast light on what Iain McCalman has recently characterized as a "tension
                  between the odious popularity of commercial reenactment and the respectable austerity
                  of academic art" in the urban entertainments of the Romantic era (214).</p>
               <p>My point is that, even as the opposition of topographical and antiquarian imagery
                  to "art" was confirmed in the early nineteenth century, the possibilities for a much
                  more productive confusion of categories was being actively entertained, for personal,
                  professional, and commercial reasons, with the sublime providing a means for legitimizing
                  such departures. If we revisit Fuseli's famously decisive comments on landscape and
                  "map work" we can note that he in fact counts landscape among "negative subjects"
                  which "owe what they can be to the Genius of the artist" (Baumgarten 127), a point
                  which would have been made more emphatically in passages deleted from the original
                  manuscript: <span class="quote">‘Our own school in this very branch has embodied scenes of nature so novel, real combinations
                     so original or charming with so much taste equal Judgement &amp; powers of execution,
                     that the transcript vanishes in the choice of Genius. Such is the display of oriental
                     grandeur in ruins or still subsisting, such as the aweful scenery of Wales &amp; the romantic
                     windings of our rivers . . . There are scenes of Nature in themselves so novel, with
                     features so original, charming &amp; astonishing; real combinations so curious &amp; unusual,
                     that nothing but a judicious Transcript is wanted, to impress us with all the effects
                     of Genius. (qtd. in Baumgarten I.141-142nn)’</span> There can be no reasonable doubt that Fuseli's identification of topography as a
                  "kind of map work" was rightly interpreted at the time and latterly as suggesting
                  a strongly hierarchical distinction between descriptive and imaginative landscape
                  painting, to the extent that John Britton, no less, went into print (with the encouragement
                  of J.M.W. Turner) to refute Fuseli's allegations against "representations of particular
                  scenes" (from <em>Fine Arts of the English School</em>, 1812; quoted and discussed in Smiles, <em>Eye Witness</em>, 64-5). Nonetheless, the drafting of this passage at least makes room for a more
                  nuanced position, one which would help explain Fuseli's known admiration of Turner,
                  the artist who perhaps more than any other would exemplify the possibility that the
                  recording of nature could also be sublime. Even with a critic as apparently stringent
                  as Fuseli, topographical and imaginative landscape edge towards each other and blur
                  together, most especially with regard to the antiquarian topics which could be read
                  as sublime ("oriental grandeur in ruins . . . the aweful scenery of Wales").</p>
               <p>Reconsidering Fuseli's comments, alongside Martin's images, may help lead us back
                  into a richer understanding of the place of antiquarian imagery in the early nineteenth
                  century, and beyond the art history of landscape into a consideration of the much
                  more untidy and confusing historical genesis of <em>heritage</em>. From that perspective, the mobilization after the 1760s of the sublime as a conceptual
                  framework demanding unreliable, unpredictably subjective reflections on sites, sights,
                  and history may appear not (or not only) as a key moment in the emergence of a heroically
                  dignified landscape art, but also as a challenge to the historical ascent of those
                  disciplinary norms which would segregate the scientific from the imaginative, entertainment
                  from scholarship. Such extravagant topography or bombastic antiquarianism as is evident
                  in Martin's images under consideration here puts up obstacles to our sense of the
                  "progress" of art and of knowledge in the early nineteenth century. Reflecting particularly
                  on the history of the representation and interpretation of Avebury, David C. Harvey
                  comments on "[s]mall heritages" and "the inevitable open-endedness of the everyday
                  'pieces' and 'performances' of heritage, which it is impossible to date or categorize—the
                  ordinary, conscious and unconscious elaboration and repetition of cultural memory
                  that has both history and prehistory, but which has no beginning or end" (33). This
                  might also lead us to emphasize the enduring interplay between scientific and imaginative
                  antiquarianism. We could, then, trace a continuity between Britton's acknowledgement
                  of "The mystic halo which enveloped it, tended rather to awaken than repress research,"
                  and Smiles's note, in his study of the image of British antiquity in Romanticism,
                  that: <span class="quote">‘While investigating second hand book shops for various tomes relevant to this project
                     it was not unusual to find serious studies such as Stuart Piggott's <em>The Druids</em> (1968) and AL Owen's <em>The Famous Druids</em> (1962) shelved under "occult" rather than "archaeology" or similarly sober classifications.
                     Was this a bookseller's attempt to subvert the Druidic lunatic fringe by infiltrating
                     works that debunked the romantic image, or was it an ironic indication that, where
                     Druids are concerned, archaeology was subordinate to a more whimsical approach? (75)’</span> Thus, too, Harvey's highlighting of the "extreme 'relativism'" at play around Avebury
                  as a physical site, with "the 'official' heritage story . . . competing with New Age
                  interpretations of the site: the heritage of ley lines, mystical occurrences and spiritual
                  healing." Such stark juxtapositions between the legitimate and the eccentric may be
                  read only as the signs of confusion, or of a discipline in crisis, the decline of
                  scientific knowledge, or some such. But the commercially-oriented antiquarianism of
                  the early nineteenth century anticipated these juxtapositions and provided individuals
                  like John Martin and John Britton—equally from barely lettered, economically vulnerable
                  backgrounds—a route in and through metropolitan literary and artistic culture. At
                  precisely those points where both landscape art and antiquarianism seem to be compromised,
                  eccentric, or marginal—in the romantic enhancement of Avebury's image, or in the topographical
                  specificity which is mobilized in support to a scene of outrageous blockbuster disaster
                  directed towards a commercialised market for art—we might also discover opportunities
                  for individual engagement and commercial exploitation which gave shape to a modern
                  understanding of history.</p>

               an introductory autobiographical statement detailing everything else he had done since,
               as a form of apology to the reader</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">News that the illustrations to the prospective third volume would include one showing
               "the immense Druidical Temple of Avebury" was in print in 1815 (<em>New Monthly Magazine</em>, 4: 1815, 423), and this may indicate that Martin was already engaged on the project.
               A watercolor by Britton showing Avebury from the north corresponds with Martin's drawing
               in some general respects but suggests a lower viewpoint and a different angle. This
               is dated to as early as 1815 (following an inscription on the back of the support)
               (Wiltshire Heritage Museum; see Hatchwell, no.8). Other related drawings of Avebury
               by Britton (in the same collection) are dated from 1805 to 1821.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">It was not noted in Mary Pendered's pioneering biographical study of 1923, nor even
               in Thomas Balston's thorough and still-important monograph of 1947, nor in the catalogue
               listing of drawings prepared independently by the poet Ruthven Todd earlier in the
               1940s (Todd), nor in the listing of illustrations by Martin which Todd passed to Balston
               (Todd and Balston). The drawing was only brought to Balston's attention in 1948 by
               the poet Geoffrey Grigson who, tellingly, was a pioneering writer on the sublime in
               British art and associated with current "Neo-Romanticism" (letter of 5 February 1948,
               private collection). Grigson himself was to write about Avebury in the context of
               illustrated country guides aimed at latter-day antiquarian adventurers: <em>The Wiltshire Book</em> (1957) and <em>Wiltshire: An Introduction</em> (1963). The romantic vision of primitive England presented by Martin's design certainly
               chimes with the new interest in prehistoric remains current among several modern British
               visual artists, particularly Paul Nash; (see Haycock, 54-8 and Smiles, 
               “Equivalents”
               ). Balston planned a new edition of his monograph; although this never emerged, he
               prepared a note in manuscript prompted by Grigson's information, dismissing the drawing
               as "rather a diagram than a work of art." The design was noticed in Christopher Johnstone's
               brief survey of Martin's art (Johnstone 18) but overlooked in William Feaver's full
               monograph of 1975 (a book which has exercised considerable influence over subsequent
               commentaries on the artist). More recently, the print was discussed and illustrated
               in Sam Smiles's <em>Ancient Britons and the Romantic Imagination</em> (1994), and both print and drawing were displayed as part of the recent Tate Britain
               exhibition <em>John Martin: Apocalypse</em> (2011-12), although only in the context of a range of materials dating from the early
               stages of Martin's professional career and intended thereby to illustrate the range
               of often rather prosaic artistic work undertaken by him before his reputation became
               established (Myrone <em>John Martin</em>, cat. nos. 18-19).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Both were part of a short-lived convivial club, The Pot Luck Club, in London in the
               early 1820s and had numerous friends in common. In 1837 they were planning to share
               a coach to a <em>conversazione</em>, and as late as 1849 Martin wrote expressing his huge admiration for the "arduous
               labors, and great success in advancing art and architecture" of the topographer while
               seeking to acquire plates from him to complete his collection of his works (letters
               from Martin to Britton, Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections La.II.426
               and La.II.648). Britton, meanwhile, once wrote privately: "Of Martin's genius no one
               ever thought more highly—more devotedly—than myself—I have often written and spoken
               his praises" (qtd. in Todd and Balston, f.36).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
