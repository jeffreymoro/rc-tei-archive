            <p class="noCount">In their Introduction to <em>Romantic Antiquarianism</em>, Noah Heringman and Crystal B. Lake survey the history of antiquarianism and theorize
               its practices, concluding with an overview of the seven essays in this volume. Paying
               particular attention to antiquarianism in popular culture, Heringman and Lake seek
               to redress the critical tendency to isolate antiquarianism as an amateurish fad, an
               eccentric pastime of interest to only a few specialists, or a discourse concerned
               primarily with documents and texts. Instead, Heringman and Lake position antiquarianism
               as an embodied practice in which ancient objects themselves exerted a powerful influence
               on the process and products of knowledge work. Increasingly specialized study of periods
               and types of objects shaped the networks that linked antiquaries, engravers, and publishers
               with a public eager to experience in detail the customs and manners or material culture
               of the past. The introduction places a special emphasis on remediation as a rubric
               for understanding how antiquarian practices informed the circulation of ancient and
               medieval objects and their representations in the Romantic period.</p>

               <p>To enthusiastic antiquaries and their publics in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
                  an object of antiquity presented itself as the romantic object par excellence: democratic,
                  evocative, historically rooted yet ever present, at once the product and the producer
                  of creative imagination. Romantic antiquarianism levels distinctions between the learned
                  and popular reception of ancient objects and texts, between historical narrative and
                  empirical research, form and content, discourse and material culture. The Romantic
                  refusal to distinguish between discourse and material culture, though lamented by
                  modern histories of antiquarianism, reflects the transformation of antiquarian practice
                  by artists, popularizers, novelists, and poets in the Romantic period. Readers, collectors,
                  tourists, and exhibition-goers across Europe became more interested in consuming antiquities
                  than in mocking antiquaries. This volume, accordingly, sets out to challenge both
                  the comic stereotype of the antiquary, powerfully reinforced by no less an antiquary
                  than Sir Walter Scott, and the historiography that has insisted on separating the
                  literary and material practices of antiquarianism. The embodied practice of Romantic
                  antiquarianism, as the following essays show, promoted a convergence of antiquarian
                  scholarship and imaginative empathy by way of remediation: popular antiquaries such
                  as Robert Wood, Thomas Pennant, Josiah Wedgwood, Joseph Strutt, John Britton, and
                  John Martin collected, displayed, illustrated, and reconstructed antiquities ranging
                  from Pompeian artifacts to Anglo-Saxon costume to the Portland Vase, transcending
                  the early modern distinction between history and antiquities. These learned spectacles
                  preceded and in some ways anticipated the modern distinction between the historical
                  disciplines and the popular culture of heritage.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is in large part the popularity of antiquarianism that distinguishes the Romantic
                     from the Enlightenment project of making sense of history's lost and found objects.
                     The Society of Antiquaries (London), though far from inclusive in its composition
                     in this period, reflects the larger trend: from nearly three hundred members in 1770,
                     the rolls increased to nearly eight hundred by 1820 (Pearce 147). At the same time,
                     artifacts were no longer confined to private cabinets of curiosity. The British Museum
                     opened its doors to the public in 1757, yet its strict rules for admission meant that
                     many other repositories of antiquities had a claim on the money and attention of the
                     curious. Richard Altick reports that a tourist from Birmingham complained about the
                     way he was "hackneyed through the rooms with violence" and "came away completely disappointed"
                     from the museum in 1784 (qtd. in Altick 27). Don Saltero's—a coffeehouse where over
                     1,000 objects ranging from old coins to old books to specimens of antique fashion,
                     jewelry, and armor were on display by 1790—proved both more instructive and entertaining.
                     At Don Saltero's, the man from Birmingham reported that he had at least been "furnished
                     ... with a book, explaining every article in the collection," and that he had the
                     leisure to "take [his] own time, and entertain [himself]." Don Saltero's was far from
                     being the only alternative to the British Museum. The Tower of London proved to be
                     a popular tourist attraction for viewing regal and military antiquities (and the last
                     of the urban "wonders" catalogued in the "fond imagination" of Wordsworth's boyhood)
                     (Wordsworth, <em>Prelude</em> 232).

                     natural history specimens alongside antiquities. Lever also donated objects to Dr.
                     Greene's museum at Lichfield, and artifacts from Greene's were later purchased by
                     William Bullock, who likely incorporated them into his Egyptian Hall at Piccadilly.</p>

                  <p>Antiquities circulated between curators and impresarios and jostled for prominence
                     in auctions and lotteries. In other words, artifacts and their custodians, along with
                     a host of other social actants, established new configurations of agency at a highly
                     visible nexus between matters of archaeological fact and matters of aesthetic concern—as
                     Bruno Latour might put it.

                     </div> Robert Aguirre, Ralph O'Connor, and Edward Ziter are among the many scholars who (following
                     in Altick's wake) have explored Romantic-era public exhibitions and spectacles in
                     recent years, particularly in the contexts of science and colonialism.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                              well as a strong connection between time travel and the geological past that is especially
                              relevant here.</span></div>
                     </div> Yet none of these accounts fully recognize the antiquarian framework that provided
                     much of the cohesion among these spectacles. Popular entertainments from Robert Barker's
                     Panorama to Philip James de Loutherbourg's Eidophusikon also illustrate the vogue
                     for sentimental immersion in historical scenes. Although de Loutherbourg remains most
                     well known for his pre-cinematic projections of scenes from Milton or shipwrecks,
                     he cut his teeth by designing spectacular models and scenery for the revival of James
                     Thomson's <em>The Masque of Alfred</em> (1773), based on the antiquary Thomas Bicknell's biography of the Anglo-Saxon monarch.
                     Likewise, de Loutherbourg provided the scenery for the pantomime <em>Omai, or A Trip Round the World</em> in 1785, which was celebrated for its "exact representations" of the artifacts brought
                     back from the Pacific by the antiquary-naturalist Joseph Banks. Thus situated, this
                     volume recovers numerous antiquarian spaces, ranging from domestic interiors to panoramic
                     landscapes; it recovers not only antiquarianism's intricate discourses, but also its
                     objects and their agencies.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The profusion of antiquities shows that Don Saltero was just one of many new tastemakers
                     who claimed the right to decide what counts as an ancient artifact. Our emphasis on
                     remediation seeks to account for the power of some old things to demand new recognition
                     as antiquities, as well as the power of representations to transform or displace the
                     things themselves. That is to say, antiquaries and their publics responded to agential
                     qualities in objects, much as Wordsworth did in his account of "the life of things,"
                     or Keats in describing the feeling of dislocation caused by "these wonders" from the
                     Parthenon.

                     </div> For example, the ruins of Palmyra, though previously known as remains of an obscure
                     Roman outpost, were newly infused with classic grandeur by Robert Wood's <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em>, as Jonathan Sachs argues in his contribution to this volume. Similarly, Thora Brylowe's
                     essay shows how an ancient object such as the Portland Vase could be not only repurposed,
                     but also recycled as the prototype for a Wedgewood commodity and even displaced as
                     the site of cultural prestige. In both cases, we see the appropriation of ancient
                     objects—predating European national cultures—for a British public by way of a transnational
                     antiquarian traffic. Rosemary Hill's essay on antiquarian interior design recovers
                     another set of British and French tactics for domesticating antiquities, while Martin
                     Myrone's contribution explores the suggestive juxtaposition of a native ancient site
                     (Avebury) with a classical one (Pompeii) in the painterly <span class="foreign">oeuvre</span> of John Martin. Ina Ferris's essay on medieval costume and Timothy Campbell's on the
                     guillotine both uncover new dimensions of the antiquarian recycling and repurposing
                     of image and text. Sam Smiles's concluding essay points out the mid-nineteenth-century
                     moment in which the strategic relationship between ancient objects and antiquarian
                     illustration was explicitly theorized. In short, the essays in this volume integrate
                     art history, book history, and literary scholarship in an effort to do adequate justice
                     to these complex dynamics of images, texts, artifacts, and time.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Much recent work on popular antiquarianism has focused on recovering the verbal artifacts
                  and print culture associated with this cluster of predisciplines and its expanding
                  subject matter. Stephen Bending has documented the proliferation of increasingly affordable
                  antiquarian books, tellingly promoted by the antiquary Francis Grose in his declaration
                  that "every man is naturally an antiquarian" (qtd. in Bending 100). Grose, often remembered
                  for commissioning Robert Burns's 
                  “Tam O'Shanter”
                  for his <em>Antiquities of Scotland</em> (1791-1797), also appears as a central figure in Marilyn Butler's influential essay,
                  
                  “Antiquarianism (Popular).”
                  Butler begins her discussion of popular antiquarianism with the "vernacular languages"
                  of the British Isles and focuses primarily on textual and archival work by Joseph
                  Ritson, John Brand, and other popular antiquaries. Traditionally associated with "fictions
                  and fakes" dating back to Macpherson and Chatterton, Romantic antiquarianism is still
                  understood by literary scholars primarily in terms of textual transmission. Recent
                  studies by Katie Trumpener, Margaret Russett (quoted here), Maureen McLane, and others
                  have recovered the richness and complexity of literary practices formerly dismissed
                  as imitation, forgery, or "improvement" of traditional material; one recent collection,
                  <em>Romanticism and Popular Culture</em> (Connell and Leask), explores the political ramifications of these revivals of popular
                  tradition.</p>
               <p>Popular antiquities, however, extended well beyond the literary and oral tradition
                  to social customs and material culture, as Butler herself notes and as many of the
                  essays in this volume demonstrate more fully. Grose, for example, was not only a popularizer
                  with his eye on the print market, but also a connoisseur and a collector with deep
                  investments in the antiquities he surveyed and depicted in his works. Recent critical
                  emphasis on texts and literary antiquarianism may, in fact, have contributed indirectly
                  to the marginal status of the antiquarian object in some accounts of Romanticism.
                  In their efforts to reclaim the textual work of antiquarianism, critics have allowed
                  antiquarianism's material cultures to languish in the "<span class="foreign">mare magnum</span> of miscellaneous trumpery" and popular spectacle (Scott 32). This paradox becomes
                  clear by contrast to archaeological and art historical discussions, in which Romantic
                  antiquarianism often carries a different set of connotations. Stuart Piggott, who
                  did so much to reclaim antiquarianism as proto-archaeology, rejected its Romantic
                  phase because, in his view, the Baconian approach to material culture established
                  by earlier antiquaries became corrupted in this era of "Gothick romance . . . and
                  mystical Druidry" (120). Some sense of this incongruity lingers in Martin Myrone's
                  2007 account of the "fissure" between "antiquarian exactitude" and "aesthetic pleasure"
                  (113).</p>
               <p>The double bind of "Romantic antiquarianism" is part of a much longer history of questioning
                  antiquarianism's principles and practices; antiquarianism has been under regular satirical
                  scrutiny since the sixteenth century. According to Joseph Levine, the "interest in
                  antiquities advanced by slow degrees in England in the sixteenth century," challenging
                  longstanding assumptions about the relationship between class and connoisseurship
                  (116). British antiquities in particular appeared initially as a poor substitute for
                  the classical legacy valorized by the grammar school curriculum and the Grand Tour.
                  British coins, inscriptions, sepulchers, and weapons—especially those left to languish
                  undiscovered by gentlemen departing on the Grand Tour—promised to provide new opportunities
                  for establishing authority over taste and history. As Levine notes, however, "the
                  very success of the antiquary provoked criticism and concern, especially perhaps in
                  those who felt the danger of the new interests to the polite attainments of the gentleman"
                  (117). Although the concerns persisted, a vast array of antiquarian pursuits was on
                  offer by the early nineteenth century. These ranged from polite to impolite, from
                  classical and cosmopolitan to domestic and nativist, and from learned to popular,
                  driven by artifacts as much as texts. </p>
               <p>As early as 1628, the antiquary was derided by John Earle as "one that hath that unnaturall
                  disease" for "old things" (qtd. in Levine 117). This image of the antiquary as an
                  eccentric who loved old things just because they were old things persisted through
                  the eighteenth and into the nineteenth century, finding its apotheosis in Nietzsche's
                  obtuse curator of the "the household utensils of our ancestors" (20). Where historians
                  like David Hume and Edward Gibbon charted grand narratives of nations and empires,
                  antiquaries like John Woodward and Samuel Pegge were thought to have buried themselves
                  in the most pedantic depths of the archive—not only in documents, but also in images
                  and above all in artifacts. Not quite a connoisseur, then, and not quite a historian,
                  the antiquary lingered somewhere in between, acquiring, classifying, and explicating
                  "old things." </p>
               <p>In spite of these obstinate questionings of "unscientific" antiquarianism, recent
                  scholarship has done much to recover its intellectual contributions. This volume seeks
                  both to extend this map of antiquarian variety and vitality and to historicize the
                  negative stereotype. It is important to recognize that Ossian and the new national
                  antiquities influenced not just literary taste but also antiquarian scholarship, as
                  suggested by the elaborate defense of Chatterton's Rowley poems mounted by Jeremiah
                  Milles, President of the Society of Antiquaries, in 1782. But more archaeologically-minded
                  antiquaries such as Richard Gough reacted against literary antiquarianism as well
                  as against the aesthetic enthusiasm associated with the cult of Ossian. The empirical
                  study of antiquities developed in tandem with natural history, under the aegis of
                  naturalist-antiquaries including Sir William Hamilton, Sir Joseph Banks, and their
                  legions of knowledge workers, to open new spaces of classical and nonclassical antiquity.

                  <p>Nonetheless, the eighteenth-century pursuit of natural history and antiquities remained
                     associated with pseudoscience and Ossianic mythmaking, an increasingly inaccurate
                     association reinforced by Scott in <em>The Antiquary</em>. Scott, himself an antiquary who made his career as a collector and fabricator of
                     Scottish national antiquities, looked back in this 1816 novel on antiquarian practice
                     in the 1790s. In Jonathan Oldbuck, the novel's eponymous scholarly amateur, Scott
                     created a lasting popular image of the antiquary that obscured—as Rosemary Sweet has
                     shown—the variety and the influence of antiquarian practice, as well as the empirical
                     rigor of many of its forms. (The essays by Campbell and Hill in this volume shed new
                     light on Oldbuck as well.) In an essay contrasting Oldbuck with Gough, Sweet focuses
                     on the study of postclassical British antiquities, certainly a more dominant pursuit
                     by the 1790s than Oldbuck's obsession with Roman Britain. In her <em>Antiquaries</em>, she presents a broader view of the collaborative antiquarian networks, including
                     correspondence networks, which are present in the novel, and many others, which are
                     not: popularizing enterprises, provincial societies, and research networks that increasingly
                     enabled the participation of middle-class men and, sometimes, women.

                              historical study of British antiquarianism in 50 years. Antiquaries ably surveys,

                              (309-44), and women antiquaries (69-79). The issue of women antiquaries is especially
                              salient in light of Scott's novel's half-ironic misogyny. On women antiquaries, see

               <p>The satirical tradition behind Scott's character is a major legacy that continued
                  to inform the practice and public perception of antiquarianism well into the nineteenth
                  century. As Sweet points out in her contrast between the real and the fictional antiquary,
                  Oldbuck is based on a "stock caricature" that can be traced back into the sixteenth
                  century—to Earle's "unnaturall disease" and beyond. The satirical tradition, however,
                  sheds light on the wider field of knowledge work because it captures the class connotations
                  attaching to connoisseurship, as exemplified in Thomas Shadwell's farce <em>The Virtuoso</em> (1676) and in long-running conflicts over the terms "virtuoso" and "connoisseur"
                  themselves, terms increasingly reclaimed and put to new social uses in the Romantic
                  period (Hamblyn 183-84).</p>
               <p>Scott's narrative, though indebted to the satirical tradition, nevertheless offers
                  a kind of thick description of Romantic antiquarian practice by way of Oldbuck as
                  well as a second antiquarian figure, the swindler Herman Dousterswivel. The main thing
                  lacking in Scott's portrayal is the institutional context in which both natural history
                  and antiquarianism were practiced in the late eighteenth century. Rudolf Erich Raspe,
                  for example, long considered the real-life counterpart for Dousterswivel, was involved
                  with both the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and Daines Barrington (perhaps a better
                  analogue for Oldbuck than Gough is) was a pillar of both societies. In fact, one-third
                  of the fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London in the late eighteenth century
                  were also fellows of the Royal Society, including Thomas Pennant and Owen Manning,
                  who are featured in the essays by Campbell and Hill (respectively) in this volume.
                  These institutions did not replace wealthy amateurism and patronage but decisively
                  shaped the forms that they took, creating opportunities for independent knowledge
                  work by gradually transforming the humanist model of patronage and facilitating access
                  to print. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It may be in part Scott's own professional bias—coupled with his habitual mock-humility
                     concerning antiquarian pursuits, including his own involvement with the Society of
                     Antiquaries of Scotland—that leads him to occlude these institutional aspects of the
                     antiquarian scene, and in any case the absence of this context serves the novel's
                     narrative of class conflict. Antiquarianism here looks frivolous next to the serious
                     business of earning money, and by dabbling with an avocation formerly associated with
                     aristocratic virtuosi, Scott's antiquary figures the legitimacy of a newly ascendant
                     class. Oldbuck, descended from a family of printers, is a better antiquary than the
                     proud, aristocratic Wardour, and morally sounder than the Catholic baron Glenallan,
                     but like them he is fiercely provincial, leaving Edinburgh behind with a curse at
                     the beginning of the novel. Scott might nonetheless have made him a corresponding
                     member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, if not the London society, a historically
                     likely scenario for the 1790s.

                              to his transformation of the Society of Antiquaries along archaeological lines. Dousterswivel's
                              employer, Sir Arthur Wardour, is at best a patron of science, while his rival Oldbuck
                              conducts his own knowledge work, after fashion, by employing native informants such
                              as the Mucklebackits. Yet in spite of his occasional fieldwork, Oldbuck remains tethered
                              to the legacy of mythmaking and pseudoscience because of his interests in projects
                              such as the Caledoniad and the Ossian debate.</span></div>
                     </div> The success of Scott's whole literary brand depended on this somewhat disingenuous
                     characterization of the antiquary, as indicated by the pervasive mock antiquarian
                     tone in the paratexts of his novels, a tone that surfaces in both versions of <em>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</em> (1802, 1830) as well. Scott's works succeeded by lubricating the "repulsive dryness
                     of mere antiquity," as "Laurence Templeton" calls it in the Dedicatory Epistle to <em>Ivanhoe</em>. ("Templeton" is only one of the antiquarian personae used by Scott; here "Templeton"
                     apologizes somewhat ambivalently to "Jonas Dryasdust," another of Scott's personae.)

               <p>Despite his frivolity, Oldbuck at times displays antiquarian skills in the field in
                  incidents that Scott supports with real citations from antiquarian authors such as
                  Thomas Percy and John Brand. Wardour lacks these skills, but in fact the institutional
                  setting of the learned society provided a venue in which aristocratic connoisseurs,
                  too, learned to transcend the limitations of an elite education to develop empirical
                  and collaborative methods. According to Susan Pearce, "two of the most striking things
                  about this period [1770-1820] at the Society [of Antiquaries] are how the members
                  managed to set the agenda for much future work, and how they succeeded in developing
                  the fundamental methods through which information could be offered for evaluation"
                  (153). In particular, "the idea of the corpus of a particular group of archaeological
                  objects began to appear," and five of the research areas outlined at that time "are
                  still returned to again and again." These innovations required ambition not only among
                  knowledge workers but also on the part of their university-educated patrons, who may
                  have seen natural history and antiquities as shadow professions standing in for the
                  career in divinity, law, or medicine that their financial independence made unnecessary.
                  Finally, as Hill notes in her essay in this volume, the Society of Antiquaries ushered
                  in an era of public antiquarianism through such high-profile debates as the <span class="foreign">quérelle de Wyatt</span> concerning historically unsound alterations in Salisbury Cathedral.</p>
               <p>The metropolitan learned societies favored the creation of monumental learned works
                  on antiquities, such as Robert Wood's <em>Ruins of Palmyra</em> (see Sachs, this volume) and Hamilton and d'Hancarville's <em>Collection of Etruscan, Greek, and Roman Antiquities</em> (see Brylowe, this volume). These privately funded works existed in dialogue with
                  the learned journals and other publication series sponsored by the societies themselves.
                  They were expensive projects that employed laborers, draftsmen, engravers, specialized
                  printers, and other contributors, but they flourished in a literary marketplace that
                  also produced many cheaper publications, including popularizing and ancillary works.
                  More independent workers, such as Joseph Strutt (see Ferris, this volume) and John
                  Britton (see Myrone, this volume) used this literary marketplace to produce their
                  own publications, and often the same publishers produced both kinds of works. Publications
                  more closely associated with the Society of Antiquaries, including the long-running
                  scholarly serials <em>Vetusta Monumenta</em> (from 1747) and <em>Archaeologia</em> (from 1771) used the same printers, engravers, and editorial procedures, often drawing
                  on the same research networks, while others gave more authority to self-taught antiquaries
                  and illustrators such as Strutt and George Hanlon (see Smiles, this volume).</p>
               <p>The Romantic publicity surrounding antiquities produced an unprecedented democracy
                  of the antiquarian object, for the liminal spaces between the connoisseur and the
                  historian teemed with intellectual, representational, and commercial possibilities.
                  Newly available for spectacular consumption, antiquities found themselves delicately
                  poised between sentiment and scholarship. Ancient artifacts offered audiences the
                  opportunity to fashion excursions around and in the material and conceptual gaps in
                  the historical record evoked by antiquities. These excursions could take on diverse
                  forms and meanings. As Jacques Rancière writes in the context of public performances
                  and museums, "there are only ever individuals plotting their own paths in the forest
                  of things, acts and signs that confront or surround them. The collective power shared
                  by spectators does not stem from the fact that they are members of a collective body
                  or from some specific form of interactivity. It is the power each of them has to translate
                  what she perceives in her own way" (17). Rancière's "equality of intelligence" would
                  be too utopian a reading of the unruly spectacle and mythmaking traditionally associated
                  with antiquarianism.  At the same time, his formulation of the agency that can inhere
                  in collective, material experiences aptly expresses the half-suppressed modernity
                  of Romantic antiquarianism.</p>
               <p>As the essays in this volume suggest, spectacle and myth-making are only half the
                  story. In various ways, all the essays restore lost connections between artifacts,
                  texts, and antiquaries, and all attend particularly to the visual remediations of
                  antiquity. Through the efforts of popular antiquaries (in several senses of this capacious
                  term) such as Hanlon, Strutt, Pennant, the Sobieski Stuarts, Wedgwood, Wood, Britton,
                  and Martin, and in spite of cultural antipathy toward the figure of the antiquary—or
                  even partly because of it, since it established the antiquary, famous for working
                  in eccentric isolation, in the public sphere—antiquarianism captured the public imagination
                  while it also continued to develop as a field of study. In fact, one of the salient
                  features of Romantic antiquarianism is the unique way in which it advanced Enlightenment
                  ideals of scientific history while incorporating more fully the aesthetics of the
                  sublime and of sentimental identification, producing new forms of historical empathy. 
                  Precisely in its refusal to distinguish between text and material culture, Romantic
                  antiquarianism functions as a historiographical mode that exists simultaneously as
                  science and art, history and literature.  It offers multiple avenues for exploring
                  Romantic subjectivities in their relation to material culture. Blake insists that
                  "Mental things alone are real"; antiquarianism begs to differ, insisting that ancient
                  objects demand recognition, that they are perfectly commensurate as scientific specimens
                  and as quasi-agential aesthetic subjects.</p>
               <p>Surely no other objects in Romantic culture hover quite as perfectly between the "invention
                  of history" and the "end of history," in W.J.T. Mitchell's phrasing, as the artifacts
                  of Romantic antiquarianism (173). For Mitchell, two new concepts emerged at the turn
                  of the nineteenth century: the fossil and the totem. These correlate to an emerging
                  distinction between the natural and the cultural, as the natural finds its fullest
                  expression in a deep, ecological record (the fossil) and the cultural in manmade,
                  handmade objects (the totem). For Mitchell, the fossil points to a "system of natural
                  signs;" the totem points to signs of the human (177). These will transform into the
                  disciplinary practices of paleontology and anthropology, respectively. For Mitchell,
                  though, the Romantic era is a brief but poignant moment in which these two things,
                  the fossil and the totem, are not yet fully separate entities, physically or conceptually.
                  Rather, a dialectic exists between the two, as "the desire to secure an intimate communion
                  with nature itself is a form of totemism," and the "inevitable defeat of this desire
                  is named by the fossil" (183). Mitchell concludes, then, that Romanticism is defined
                  by its constant return to the notion that "just when we think that things are safely
                  dead, fossilized, petrified, or confined to the past, they rise from their graves
                  of natural extinction and cultural obsolescence" (183). Thus, the "life of things"
                  that Wordsworth sees into is also configured as a death, just as the "structure of
                  feeling" that would define the Modern against the Romantic (and vice versa) would
                  entail both the invention and the end of history.</p>
               <p>When examined from a cultural-historical perspective, Mitchell's high road between
                  the fossil and the totem may be seen to run through a landscape of antiquarian artifacts.
                  Wordsworth, after all, sees into the life and death of things at Tintern Abbey, a
                  historical site of longstanding interest to antiquaries. And Blake began as an apprentice
                  to the antiquarian engraver, James Basire.  In the Romantic period, antiquarian artifacts
                  refused to fit neatly into distinctions between material culture and discourse, past
                  and present, nature and culture.  An object of antiquity elicits imaginative speculations
                  that expose the gaps between objects and knowledge, even as they seek to close them.
                  To say that a miniature guillotine, or a ceramic imitation of the Portland Vase, or
                  the ruins of Palmyra, or an engraving "faithfully copied" from medieval decorations,
                  is "the Romantic object par excellence," is to collapse distinctions that structure
                  our understanding of such objects today.  Reopening the field from which these distinctions
                  emerged permits us to recognize antiquarianism's "miscellaneous trumpery" as a living
                  stream of history, a stream newly open to intellectual navigation by an eager public,
                  by antiquarian collectors and illustrators, and by Romantic writers. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is tempting to designate the variety of antiquarian discourses by calling them
                     "antiquarianisms," but the real diversity is to be found among the practitioners and
                     the objects they studied—ancient or new, real or fabricated. Our singular title, Romantic
                     Antiquarianism, reflects the underlying methodological and epistemological common
                     ground shared by a surprisingly wide range of antiquaries, a common ground we must
                     now struggle to recognize.  As a disciplinary umbrella term, antiquarianism accommodated
                     connoisseurs, artisans, scholars, tourists, and hack writers in their pursuit of the
                     most disparate objects.  It is not enough merely to insist, with Bruno Latour, that
                     these "objects too have agency" (63-86). Jane Bennett and other theorists associated
                     with the new materialism have presented a complex array of agential and quasi-agential
                     properties in matter that could be usefully tested against the objects of antiquarian
                     study—especially given its original proximity to natural history.

                     a more subtle dynamic of "durablity," "extension," and "force": "there might exist
                     many metaphysical shades between [actants'] full causality and [their] sheer inexistence"

                     Latour's paradigm helps to establish the vital middle ground between artifacts and
                     antiquaries that the following essays make visible. These theoretical considerations—intended,
                     as in any introduction, to frame the larger issue and not to pre-empt the chapters
                     to follow—account for some of the contemporary resonance of Romantic antiquarianism
                     and suggest that it is precisely the fetishism with which the antiquaries were charged,
                     their "unhealthy" fascination with objects, that makes them contemporary.</p>

               <p>In 
                  “Extravagant Topography and Sublime Antiquarianism: John Martin, John Britton, Avebury
                  and Pompeii,”
                  Martin Myrone examines two works produced by John Martin (a drawing of Avebury and
                  <em>The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum</em>, a large oil painting completed in 1822), in order to refocus the antiquarian sublime
                  and invite us to reconsider the disciplinary borders between history and art. Fuseli
                  famously suggested that the kinds of topographical images that appealed to "the antiquary
                  or the traveller" disappointed the artist (Fuseli, qtd. in Myrone 1). If this would
                  seemingly sound the death knell of antiquarianism as it ceded primacy of place to
                  either the archaeology of the nineteenth century or a more august history of art,
                  Myrone finds otherwise. For Martin, who collaborated with the antiquary John Britton,
                  antiquarian ways of seeing proved particularly aesthetically and commercially fruitful.
                  Specifically, Myrone argues that Martin's drawing of Avebury, which was engraved for
                  Britton's <em>The Beauties of Wiltshire</em>, operates as a "predisciplinary" work of art. Martin's drawing is at once an aesthetic
                  production and an argument that correlates with Britton's antiquarian finding that
                  Avebury was a sepulchral rather than a sacrificial site in ancient Britain. Additionally,
                  Martin's reputation as a painter brought an element of the sublime to hover around
                  the image, enhancing both its popular and aesthetic appeal. This process is mirrored
                  in reverse in Martin's much larger and much more famous <em>The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum.</em> Martin's careful readings and contextualizations of these images make it clear that
                  Romantic antiquarianism worked simultaneously as legitimate history and as aesthetics,
                  deftly mobilizing the sublime in order to navigate a shifting economy of scholarly
                  and artistic labor and consumption.</p>
               <p>Our second essay, Jonathan Sachs's 
                  “Poetical Geography: The Place of the Antiquarian and the Situatedness of Literature,”
                  traces an earlier stage of the rediscovery of ancient sites. The antiquary Robert
                  Wood, inspired by Homer, set out on a tour of Mediterranean sites in 1749, at the
                  end of a decade which had seen the first publication on Avebury (by William Stukeley
                  in 1743) and the first glimmering of the rediscovery of Pompeii (1748). Yet as Sachs
                  points out, when Wood published the first fruit of his travels, <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> (1753), he chose to focus on a less ancient and better-preserved provincial outpost
                  barely mentioned in classical literature. Sachs raises important questions relating
                  to the contradiction between Wood's literary project of reading Homer <span class="foreign">in situ</span> and his seemingly anachronistic choice of a late Imperial Roman site to illustrate
                  it. The answers turn out to have broad implications for Romantic literature, because
                  Wood shares a close attention to the place of oral composition and to local stages
                  of society with Percy, Ritson, Scott, and other antiquaries associated with the ballad
                  and Romantic revivals. Examining the large and elegant folio engravings that make
                  up <em>Palmyra</em> and its sequel together with their loosely related text on Homer and other matters,
                  Sachs shows that the engravings of these pristine sites gave readers a better idea
                  than maps or descriptions could give of the experience of discovering antiquity through
                  place. This approach "makes Palmyra . . . timeless," Sachs argues, insisting that
                  the plate book form was essential to the conception of Wood's theory of oral composition
                  in Homer, fully developed in his later <em>Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer</em> (1775). Sachs's essay makes a welcome contribution to the project of recapturing
                  classical, British, popular, and other strands of antiquarianism as one organic whole.</p>
               <p>Thora Brylowe shows how British copies of classical antiquities like the Portland
                  Vase came to be seen as objects with more cultural capital than the originals on which
                  they were based, in her essay, 
                  “Antiquity by Design: Remediating the Portland Vase.”
                  For Brylowe, the famous vase existed at a nexus of competing discourses and ideologies;
                  it was at once a rare antiquarian artifact, a specimen of high art, an object of appropriation,
                  a fetishized commodity, and a product of changing tastes and economy. Brylowe's essay
                  explores the various remediations of the vase, especially those that coalesce around
                  Josiah Wedgewood. She reveals the vase to be much more than an antique object moved
                  from a private collection to a prominent place as a rarefied specimen in the British
                  Museum. Faithfully imitative descriptions and copies of the vase gave way to "improved"
                  engravings. Soon, versions of the vase were featured in paintings, interior designs,
                  and, importantly, narratives in which the vase indexed both British taste and the
                  rise of the nation's manufacturing industry. For Brylowe, then, antiquarianism functioned
                  as a means not only for understanding the past but for reshaping present tastes and
                  the practices of consumption.</p>
               <p>In 
                  “The Antiquary at Home,”
                  Rosemary Hill examines the "personal narratives through objects" that were expressed
                  in Romantic, antiquarian interior design in Britain and in France. Hill begins by
                  considering the idea of the antiquarian interior. Paintings by Bonington and Cooke
                  alongside Scott's influential depiction of Jonathan Oldbuck's rooms in <em>The Antiquary</em> insist that the antiquarian interior is a hodgepodge of objects, especially especially
                  armor, papers, and carved wood; their crowded, haphazard arrangement in a dark room
                  bespeaks the antiquary's eccentricity and isolation. Hill finds, however, that the
                  reality of the antiquarian interior did not always match its depiction in either prose
                  or visual materials. The designs used by antiquaries at home ran the gamut from "scepticism
                  to enthusiasm" (Hill 13). John Britton, for example, published a description of his
                  home that emphasized his middle-class credentials and the scientific rigor of his
                  antiquarian pursuits. The Sobieski brothers, however, were more wildly extravagant
                  in their performance of design. For the Sobieski brothers, the settings in which they
                  lived were designed to express their identities, sometimes as characters from a Sir
                  Walter Scott novel, other times as supposed descendants of Charles Edward Stuart (The
                  Young Pretender). Hill shows that there was a wide array of uses to which antiquarian
                  interiors could be put, illustrating the leveling force of popular antiquarianism
                  and forging new links between fiction and history, representation and fact. However,
                  Hill argues, as the nineteenth century went on, the opportunities for using the antiquarian
                  interior in these diverse ways diminished: private collections were reconstituted
                  in museums, and history and archaeology took on formal, disciplinary shape.</p>
               <p>Timothy Campbell's 
                  “Pennant's Guillotine and Scott's Antiquary: The Romantic End of the Present”
                  traces the history of an antiquarian "micro-episode," in which the antiquary Thomas
                  Pennant's 1772 description of proto-guillotines—
                  “The Maiden”
                  and its predecessor 
                  “The Halifax Gibbet”
                  —are resurrected in reports on the French Revolution. Campbell follows a fascinating
                  trail of "recyclings," as Pennant's antiquarian prose finds new purpose in the January
                  1793 issue of <em>The Bon Ton Magazine, or Microscope of Fashion and Folly</em>. Although the <em>Bon Ton</em> regularly featured a brief news report entitled 
                  “Epitome of the Times,”
                  it devoted most of its pages to more overtly licentious and fashionable content. (When
                  it reported on the execution of Louis XVI, it initially focused its attention on his
                  wardrobe.) Yet the <em>Bon Ton</em> goes on in its next issue to consider the method of his execution, lifting verbatim
                  from Pennant's description of an entirely different machine made in an entirely different
                  context. For Campbell, this is a paradigmatic moment. Pennant's prose would go on
                  to find further appropriation in Sir Walter Scott's <em>The Heart of Mid-Lothian</em> (1818) and <em>A Legend of Montrose</em>, (1819) as well as in mid-nineteenth-century accounts of the guillotine and the Revolution.
                  Contradictory imperatives lurk underneath all of these appropriations, and, as Campbell
                  suggests, they reveal antiquarianism and its objects to be complex configurations
                  of the present as much as the past.</p>
               <p>Ina Ferris suggests that Romantic antiquarianism performed the important cultural
                  work of moving history out of the archive and into the public sphere. Her 
                  “Unhinging the Past: Joseph Strutt and the Antiquarian Poetics of the Piece”
                  argues that the increasing popularity of antiquarian research depended on antiquarianism's
                  new interest in illustration. These illustrations reflected not only an antiquarian
                  interest in the meticulously accurate documentation of domestic objects that revealed
                  a history of everyday practices, but also a continued "documentary bias" that repurposed
                  textual, archival material from sources like the British Museum. Importantly, Ferris
                  finds that a poetic ethos mediates between the antiquaries' illustrations and the
                  archive, an ethos that differs somewhat from the literary antiquarianism that traditionally
                  has concerned scholars of Romanticism. Ferris examines, for example, Strutt's depictions
                  of ancient garments in works like <em>A Complete View of the Dress and Habits of the People of England</em> (1796-99) and <em>Sports and Pastimes of the People of England</em> (1801). These works, she argues, maintained the premise that Strutt's engravings
                  were completely authentic copies of ancient objects. Yet Strutt's grouping and arrangement
                  of the figures allowed for creative interpretation. Such a methodology allowed Strutt
                  to accommodate what Ferris terms a "readerly eye" and to shift the fragmentary nature
                  of Romantic forms of reading that "define[d] the past as at once an interiorized and
                  externalized object in relation to the modern subject."</p>
               <p>This volume concludes with Sam Smiles's 
                  “Discursive Modes in the Antiquarian Image: Irish Antiquities in the 1840s.”
                  Smiles takes up the story of popular illustrated works at a point when wood engraving,
                  in a refined modern form unavailable to Strutt, made it less costly to publish abundantly-illustrated
                  antiquarian works. The major Irish antiquary and popularizer George Petrie pointed
                  out that this technique made high-quality illustrations much more accessible, leveling
                  one of the distinctions between learned and popular works. In the preface to his <em>Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</em> (1845), Petrie offers a bold literary analogy between the highly accurate woodcuts
                  in the book and faithful quotations from ancient texts. Taking Petrie's homage to
                  his illustrator, George Hanlon, as his prompt, Smiles surveys the rapidly expanding
                  field of antiquarian illustration to test Petrie's analogy. C. S. Peirce's semiotic
                  system of index, icon, and symbol provides Smiles with a typology that facilitates
                  critical analysis and differentiation of the antiquaries' broad claims to depict monuments
                  with "rigid accuracy." In fact, the success of Petrie's and similar nineteenth-century
                  works depended, Smiles shows, on a repertoire of visual documentation ranging from
                  diagram to fragment to view, a repertoire that diverged, by degrees, from accuracy
                  in the direction of art. In the case of Irish antiquities, the visual appeal of the
                  more picturesque of these images—Petrie's and other protests notwithstanding—helped
                  to secure (in addition to a wide readership) the dignity of Irish history and antiquities
                  in a nationalist context.</p>
               <p>This volume concludes, then, with a precise vocabulary of the "visual language of
                  antiquarianism" under investigation throughout the sequence of essays. If, as Smiles
                  concludes, no antiquarian image attains fully to iconic status, this principle also
                  applies historically to the dynamic succession of differing versions of the past.
                  From the mid-eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth, the electric diffusion of antiquarianism
                  through popular print and visual media and a wide variety of genres led to an accumulation
                  that was less like dust and more like humus. The living, luxuriant tangle of Romantic,
                  modern, and postmodern ideas about the past is hardly imaginable without it. </p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Wordsworth expands this particular reference from half a line in 1805 (VII.135) to
               six lines in 1850 (VII.136-41). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">O'Connor offers a particularly sophisticated account of popularization (10-13) as
               well as a strong connection between time travel and the geological past that is especially
               relevant here.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">In the 2001 essay, Sweet presented the career of Gough as a corrective to Scott's
               fictional antiquary, and her subsequent <em>Antiquaries</em> provided the first substantial historical study of British antiquarianism in 50 years.
               <em>Antiquaries</em> ably surveys, among other relevant topics, antiquarian correspondence networks (60-69),
               popularization (309-44), and women antiquaries (69-79). The issue of women antiquaries
               is especially salient in light of Scott's novel's half-ironic misogyny. On women antiquaries,
               see further Catalani and Pearce, 
               “Particular Thanks.”
               </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Gough's large network of provincial correspondents, such as Samuel Pegge, was crucial
               to his transformation of the Society of Antiquaries along archaeological lines. Dousterswivel's
               employer, Sir Arthur Wardour, is at best a patron of science, while his rival Oldbuck
               conducts his own knowledge work, after fashion, by employing native informants such
               as the Mucklebackits. Yet in spite of his occasional fieldwork, Oldbuck remains tethered
               to the legacy of mythmaking and pseudoscience because of his interests in projects
               such as the <em>Caledoniad</em> and the Ossian debate.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">On Scott and antiquarianism, see, among others, Ferris, <em>Gender and Literary Authority in the <em>Waverley</em> Novels</em>. The Dedicatory Epistle to <em>Ivanhoe</em> stands as perhaps Scott's own most trenchant analysis of the problem or opportunity
               of popular antiquarianism.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">In addition to Bennett's <em>Vital Materialism</em>, see Coole and Frost, and, in a more literary vein, Harman and Calè.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Latour continues in a poetical vein: "As if some damning curse had been cast onto
               things, they remain asleep like the servants of some enchanted castle. Yet as soon
               as they are freed from the spell, they start shuddering, stretching, and muttering.
               They begin to swarm in all directions, shaking the other human actors, waking them
               out of their dogmatic sleep" (73). For Bennett's response to Latour, see Bennett viii-ix
               and 94-104. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
