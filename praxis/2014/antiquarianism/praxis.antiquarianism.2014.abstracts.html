                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">In their Introduction to <em>Romantic Antiquarianism</em>, Noah Heringman and Crystal B. Lake survey the history of antiquarianism and theorize
                  its practices, concluding with an overview of the seven essays in this volume. Paying
                  particular attention to antiquarianism in popular culture, Heringman and Lake seek
                  to redress the critical tendency to isolate antiquarianism as an amateurish fad, an
                  eccentric pastime of interest to only a few specialists, or a discourse concerned
                  primarily with documents and texts. Instead, Heringman and Lake position antiquarianism
                  as an embodied practice in which ancient objects themselves exerted a powerful influence
                  on the process and products of knowledge work. Increasingly specialized study of periods
                  and types of objects shaped the networks that linked antiquaries, engravers, and publishers
                  with a public eager to experience in detail the customs and manners or material culture
                  of the past. The introduction places a special emphasis on remediation as a rubric
                  for understanding how antiquarian practices informed the circulation of ancient and
                  medieval objects and their representations in the Romantic period.</p>

                     “Extravagant Topography and Sublime Antiquarianism: John Martin, John Britton, Avebury,

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Historical writing on landscape painting in 18th and 19th century Britain has often
                  been guided by a distinction between topography and the Sublime. The sharp line thus
                  drawn between the routine and the exceptional, the plain and the imaginative, the
                  derided and the elevated, matches that drawn between antiquarianism and the modern
                  discipline of history. By exploring two images by the nineteenth century artist John
                  Martin which defy or confuse these various distinctions, this essay seeks to complicate
                  our sense of landscape painting’s history and its relationship with topography and
                  antiquarian image-making.</p>

                     “Poetical Geography: The Place of the Antiquarian and the Situatedness of Literature”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This article explores problematic relation between the local, the national, and the
                  international in antiquarianism through a focus on the issue of place in antiquarian
                  writings. It looks specifically at the argument that literature can best be understood
                  in its original place of composition as articulated in the writings of Robert Wood.
                  By shifting emphasis from Wood’s later writing on Homer to his first published work,
                  <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> (1753), the article suggests that Wood is not a late entrant but an early contributor
                  to the "media environment" of the mid-eighteenth century, an environment characterized
                  by the belief that poetry originates in an early stage of society, that it is composed
                  orally, that it expresses the local particularity of landscapes and national or tribal
                  culture, and that it can properly be traced and recovered by ethnographic, first-hand
                  engagement with its place of origin. That Wood's theory of ancient poetry echoes (and
                  perhaps anticipates) the later work of Percy, Ritson, Scott and others underscores
                  not the separation but the proximity and overlapping concerns of popular antiquarianism
                  with other varieties of antiquarianism less invested in the particular traditions
                  of the British Isles. Ultimately, the article raises the possibility that classical
                  antiquarianism broadly understood, including its varieties more attuned to classical
                  and not national cultures, could also bolster the creation of national literatures
                  that we associate with Romanticism.</p>

               <p class="noCount">Counterintuitively, Josiah Wedgwood's Staffordshire-made clay replicas of the acclaimed
                  ancient Roman glass vessel known to Britons as the Portland Vase exceeded the cultural
                  authority of the Vase itself. The Wedgwood copies were celebrated as national treasures,
                  extolled in paint and poem, and a copy remains on exhibit in the British Museum. Both
                  Benjamin West's painting <em>Manufactory Giving Support to Industry</em> (1791) and Erasmus Darwin's <em>The Botanic Garden</em> (1791), which includes illustrations of the Vase by William Blake, offered tribute
                  to Wedgwood’s copies. Wedgwood's achievement was not merely a technological or aesthetic
                  triumph. He also managed to harness competing discourses held by classical antiquarians
                  and Royal Academicians regarding the nature and status of the copy.</p>

               <p class="noCount">Between 1789 and 1851 antiquarianism blossomed. One of its more notable manifestations
                  was the creation of "Romantic interiors," rooms, houses, even occasionally churches,
                  which expressed the dynamic relationship with the past that characterised the period.
                  In these spaces the personality of the creator was expressed through objects. Past
                  and present were elided and rearranged for imaginative effect. Though not unknown,
                  in the earlier eighteenth century such creations were rare; by the mid-nineteenth
                  century the Romantic interior was an accepted style of interior decoration. This article
                  considers some examples.</p>

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">In this essay, Campbell traces the peculiar re-circulations of Thomas Pennant's 1770s
                  antiquarian description of an archaic Scottish proto-guillotine. These re-circulations
                  culminated in a late-Romantic fantasy that Pennant's antiquarian labors had brought
                  the modern, French guillotine to life. But even in the 1790s moment of the French
                  Revolution, as the fashionable periodical <em>The Bon Ton Magazine</em> makes most remarkably clear, Pennant's prose was mediating the British encounter
                  with the French guillotine in extraordinary ways. As an encapsulation of the antiquarian
                  enterprise, the episode illuminates how the antiquarian fragment (liberated from an
                  originary context) always threatened to belong to new times in uncontrollable ways,
                  and so generated an illicit kind of temporal belonging more familiarly ascribed to
                  fashion's recursive cycles. Campbell turns from the re-circulations of Pennant to
                  the fiction of Walter Scott, where a prominent and simultaneous address of antiquarian
                  fragments and fashionable dress aimed to mitigate precisely the kind of dangers on
                  view in Pennant's unwitting resurrection of the guillotine. Scott's Waverley Novels
                  finally bind fashions and antiquities to their respective times of origin, but the
                  novels nevertheless remain in the shadow of Pennant's old guillotine.</p>

               <p class="noCount">The Irish artist and antiquarian George Petrie's publication <em>The Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</em> (1845) refers to its illustrations by George Hanlon as exemplary instances of accuracy
                  and truthfulness, very different in kind to picturesque depictions. Petrie's statement
                  prompts further thoughts about the function of archaeological/antiquarian illustration
                  and the possibility of its attaining the standard Petrie endorses. Charles Sanders
                  Peirce's semiotic system (index, icon, and symbol) is drawn on to refine understandings
                  of this imagery and to underline the coded nature of visual communication.</p>

               <p class="noCount">The antiquarian project is based on the unbridgeable gap we know to divide the past
                  from the present. The embarrassment it provokes is due in part to the necessary failures
                  of all attempts to truly understand a lost era combining with the insight the attempt
                  affords into the never fully dispassionate drives motivating the researches in the
                  first place. The articles in this volume illustrate the ways in which Romantic antiquarianism
                  exists at a point of transition between the speculative regimen of an earlier era
                  and the emergence of the period of licensed scientific research and accreditation
                  we still inhabit. As such they provide an opportunity for reflection on the passions
                  underlying any manifestation of the desire to know, and on the gains and losses entailed
                  in the emergence of an ostensibly dispassionate new scholarship.</p>
