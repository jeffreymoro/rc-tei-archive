            <p class="noCount">The antiquarian project is based on the unbridgeable gap we know to divide the past
               from the present. The embarrassment it provokes is due in part to the necessary failure
               of all attempts to truly understand a lost era combining with the insight the attempt
               affords into the never fully dispassionate drives motivating the researches in the
               first place. The articles in this volume illustrate the ways in which Romantic antiquarianism
               exists at a point of transition between the speculative regimen of an earlier era
               and the emergence of the period of licensed scientific research and accreditation
               we still inhabit. As such they provide an opportunity for reflection on the passions
               underlying any manifestation of the desire to know, and on the gains and losses entailed
               in the emergence of an ostensibly dispassionate new scholarship.</p>

               <h2><span class="head"> </span></h2>
               <p>At the home of a friend, some years back, while turning over the pages of a volume
                  I was happy to see on his shelves, I came across an all-too-typical characterization
                  of the term motivating this special issue: "The passionate reach of cultural institutions
                  evidenced in these moments suggests that what is at stake in the arrangement of the
                  past," the text declared in a passage I found marked by a reader, presumably my host,
                  "is not <em>mere antiquarianism</em>, the turning over and charting of mute rubble." The fact that the historian I was
                  visiting was an expert on seventeenth-century antiquarian circles made my eye pause
                  over the marked lines in a text I myself had written with the special panic one has
                  come to associate with the sense that it is too late for second thoughts, that faults
                  in print can never be fully retracted (Siegel, <em>Desire</em> 3). Certainly I had been right to note that the passionate relationships to antiquity
                  manifested in the writings of Hazlitt, Keats, and other authors and artists were distinct
                  from those typically expressed in the texts of antiquarians. Still, I found myself
                  wondering in the home of my friend, the author of a study of the great Nicolas-Claude
                  Fabri de Pereisc (1580-1635) and his broad international network of correspondents,
                  as I have again at various times since, why I had felt compelled to use that particular
                  formulation. "<em>Mere</em> antiquarianism"—the epithet has the flavor of an unexamined slander, the pushy demand
                  that unknown interlocutors share in one's unexamined prejudice against something we
                  would agree to call antiquarianism, a practice that, according to my younger self,
                  involved nothing more complicated than the abject manipulation of unresponsive and
                  uncommunicative debris. (And then, turning over and charting rubble that does not
                  speak to one, is a characterization that hesitates unsteadily between being simply
                  an uncharitable description and an allegory of impotent effort or unrequited passion,
                  as though antiquarians were so many superannuated lovers courting a stony beloved
                  utterly indifferent to their attentions.)</p>
               <p>I cite a formulation I have found ever-more embarrassing with the passing of time
                  because—as Noah Heringman and Crystal B. Lake helpfully lay out in their Introduction
                  to this special issue—its terms are evidently symptomatic of more than my own youthful
                  carelessness. Their account makes a thought-provoking stop at Nietzsche, who may have
                  been my own forgotten influence (along with Walter Pater), but we can also look far
                  more locally for the sources of the prejudice to which I gave voice. Indeed, with
                  its cruel use of parentheses and italics the dictionary definition of "antiquary"
                  quickly demonstrates the long-standing nature of the problem: "A student (usually
                  a <em>professed</em> student), or collector, of antiquities." To the stigma of autodidacticism is added
                  the fraud of self-accreditation (not a professor, but a self-professed student). And
                  then the tension between collecting and studying is written into the definition because
                  "student" and "collector" are not symmetrical terms. To study <em>because</em> one has collected things might simply be to apply a thin veneer of reason to disguise
                  the uneven surface marked out by one's passion. To collect because one wants to study,
                  on the other hand, approaches what we call the scientific method. The citations in
                  the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> are historically revealing: both of the occurrences of the term from before the eighteenth
                  century are positive, while the ones from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
                  centuries are characterized by patronizing irony: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">1587   A. Fleming et al. <em>Holinshed's Chron.</em> (new ed.) III. Contin. 1272/1   It hath beene some question amongst the best antiquaries
                  of our age, that, [etc.]<br/> 1602   W. Warner <em>Epitome Hist. Eng.</em> in <em>Albions Eng.</em> (rev. ed.) 351   Our learned and studious Antiquarie Master Camden.<br/> 1786   H. Walpole <em>Vertue's Anecd.

                  because it has been preserved.<br/> 1836   H. Smith <em>Tin Trumpet</em> I. 37   Antiquary—Too often a collector of valuables that are worth nothing, and
                  a recollector of all that Time has been glad to forget.</blockquote>
               <p> It is a precipitous decline from "best" and "learned" and "studious," to those easy
                  if amusing paradoxes that suggest not learning but obsession. The circular reasoning
                  involved in preserving what has been preserved, the confusion of value with its opposite,
                  the clinging on to what time itself is happy to cast into oblivion: these are characterizations
                  appropriate for neurotics, not for the learned and studious—or perhaps they are the
                  neuroses <em>of</em> the learned and studious.</p>
               <p>"Antiquarian<em>ism</em>" describes no downward trajectory of the sort "Antiquary" does, but that's because
                  it begins its career late, and therefore at a pretty low point for reflection on the
                  topic. From the late eighteenth century, when the termed gained currency, definitions
                  do little in the way of identifying a serious human endeavor: "The profession or pursuits
                  of the antiquarian; taste for, or devotion to, antiquities." <em>Taste</em> is, of course, the thing about which we cannot argue, and so it is immediately outside
                  the pale of rational discourse; <em>devotion</em>, bears more than a suggestion of personal passion or even of an idiosyncratic idolatry.
                  And, evidently, this is a use of <em>profession</em> far from the modern one. Then come the citations: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote"><em>a</em>1779   Bp. W. Warburton <em>Lett.</em> No. 221 (T.)   I used to despise him for his antiquarianism.<br/> 1803   W. Taylor in <em>Ann. Rev.</em> 1 439   He views the earth, neither through the telescope of antiquarianism, nor
                  the microscope of topography.<br/> 1849   E. A. Freeman <em>Hist. Archit.</em> 4   The first phase of ecclesiology was simple antiquarianism.</blockquote>
               <p> A despicable practice that distances itself from the earth while pretending to try
                  to view it more closely, a simple phase that must be left behind: instances such as
                  these clearly demonstrate the long pedigree of the bias I evidenced so unreflectively
                  in my own writing. Still, in the strands of evidence the <em>OED</em> offers we find one bright thread in the words of Samuel Johnson, who understood the
                  passions of thought better than most: <span class="quote">‘1778   Johnson <em>Let.</em> 23 Apr. in J. Boswell <em>Life Johnson</em> (1791) II. 219   A mere antiquarian is a rugged being.’</span> There is no space here to lay out the affection and irritation driving a statement,
                  which has at its source a fairly well known contretemps described in Boswell's <em>Life</em>, involving Thomas Percy, of the <em>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</em> (1765), and Thomas Pennant, author of <em>A Tour of Scotland in 1769</em> (1771; see also Campbell, this volume). I cite the passage only as a beautiful balancing
                  of the minimizing <em>mere</em> with something more forceful, with a recognition of the ways in which "antiquarian"
                  might describe an identity, not a mere practice, one in which we ought not to be surprised
                  to find more uneven formations than those generally associated with the life of the
                  mind.</p>
               <p>It bears saying that it is not uncommon for us to despise that upon which we rely
                  the most, and that the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> is itself a text always pushing away from its own antiquarian roots without being
                  fully free of them—or at least not until fairly recently, when technology may well
                  have automated and made dispassionate the process of rooting through vast amounts
                  of material about which most people don't care. Still, what our dictionary reminds
                  us, above all, is that when we say "Romantic Antiquarianism" we are not simply identifying
                  a certain period in the long history of the field (profession, pursuit, or taste)
                  of antiquarianism, so much as a crisis point in its development, one with important
                  conceptual and emotional components.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The essays collected in this special issue suggest not only that, as Dr. Johnson proposed,
                     "[a] <em>mere antiquarian</em> is a rugged being," certainly able to survive my thoughtless characterization, but
                     also that in the <em>mere</em> nature of the category resides something of its power. Standing on the other side
                     of analysis, antiquarianism always has a quality of passion-driven study, and therefore
                     of embarrassment. It is the thing itself, absent the reason that comes to justify
                     it. In that sense it may be seen as the id of history, the passionate element that
                     must be controlled and limited if the field is to make its way in the world.

                     </div> And yet, antiquarianism identifies the orientation that not only makes the objects
                     of history matter at an affective level, but that also recognizes the force of the
                     processes involved in coming to know that history. It is for this reason, or set of
                     reasons, that this area of study is so fruitfully linked to the history of media or
                     mediation in all of the articles in this issue. Indeed, several of the pieces testify
                     to the embarrassment that is caused for a concept-driven field (or one that wishes
                     to be conceptual), by too long a stop at the point of mediation. Whether the antiquarian
                     surrounds himself with fakes or authentic objects, or—worse—with an undifferentiated
                     combination of both, we wish he would want not to do so. We wish the antiquarian were
                     gathering material in order to identify its status and make a claim about it, in order,
                     in short, to answer the kinds of clear conceptual questions we like to believe motivate
                     our own studies. It is embarrassing to think that heterogeneous and poorly-provenanced
                     material is being assembled not in order to make an argument, but to create a home
                     or even a self. Rosemary Hill's 
                     “The Antiquary at Home”
                      is evocative in its treatment of two kinds of antiquarian self-fashioning, on the
                     one hand the personal reinvention through interior decoration entailed in the antiquarian
                     spaces created by Walter Scott and the French artist E. H. Langlois, and on the bold
                     self-creation of the Sobieski Stuarts, about whose life-long performance the word
                     "fraud" seems at once so reasonable and so impoverished. The home of Langlois (himself
                     evidently a relic of an earlier era), which became Rouen's museum of antiquities even
                     as he lived there with his family, and Abbotsford, the farmhouse that became a personal
                     fantasy space that then contributed to the story Scott told of himself: the combination
                     of vulnerability and performance involved in the creation and dissemination of these
                     spaces does not find an easy resolution in the modern imagination. But then, as Hill
                     indicates, Scott himself never fully resolved the public role of the space he built
                     for himself, his own writing suggesting ambivalence and even embarrassment about publicizing
                     Abbotsford.</p>
               </div>
               <p>To recognize that an individual might organize his or her existence around things
                  that are by our lights incoherent or inauthentic opens up questions that are always
                  present in contemporary responses to Romantic antiquarianism: namely, what does it
                  mean to call something coherent or authentic? Needless to say, the topics are of particular
                  interest because modern accounts of the values of authenticity and coherence are directly
                  traceable to Romantic forebears. The analyses of Campbell and Sachs are particularly
                  interesting because of the ways their authors acknowledge their own uncertainty as
                  to how best to respond to the heterogeneous or hybrid genres in which antiquarian
                  material is typically relayed to the public. When Sachs describes "[t]he frustrations
                  of a literary scholar trained to make certain kinds of arguments in response to certain
                  genres of texts yet when confronted with a work that doesn't in any way conform to
                  these generic models," he is addressing a feeling evident in many of the essays in
                  this volume, as critics attempt to understand forms of knowledge distribution that
                  we now know were fated to fail both as models and as modes of instruction because
                  of the combined boldness and ignorance of their creators (Sachs 9). It makes the interpretative
                  value of the frustration or shock all the richer when it is recognized as a phenomenon
                  caused by the encounter of modern expectations with material not made to meet those
                  expectations. In that sense the productive shock depends on the very drives that shape
                  antiquarianism itself, on our own desire to find meaning in what might otherwise be
                  so much indistinguishable debris from the past. </p>
               <p>Wood's <em>Ruins of Palmyra</em> (1753), the epochal volume addressed in Sachs's article, was an international success:
                  it offered images that were adapted in verse, in the visual arts, and in architecture
                  for decades to come, in England and abroad; its influence on Volney's <em>Ruines</em> (1791) and on its illustrations is quite open. The fact that the work was a blend
                  of historical and literary speculation, travel memoir, and illustration evidently
                  presented no problems of style, form, or decorum in its day. In a related vein, one
                  suspects the miscellaneous quality of <em>Bon Ton</em>, the periodical in which Timothy Campbell finds traces of Pennant's description of
                  the guillotine, was the least of the challenges that racy rag presented to its original
                  readers. When Campbell writes of <em>Bon Ton</em>'s "dizzying mix of aesthetics, politics, sovereignty, sex, and costume," perhaps
                  the most interesting question to ask is why and in what sense we find dizzying something
                  that in its own day was close to conventional (Campbell 16). Campbell's account of
                  the circulation of Pennant's description of the sources of the guillotine in Scottish
                  culture compellingly demonstrates that authors and readers in earlier periods were
                  notably more comfortable working with fragments than later critics have proved to
                  be.</p>
               <p>What belongs in a newspaper or a magazine, we might ask, or on a website or a news
                  channel? That the eighteenth-century found a new term for a published miscellany in
                  "Magazine," a word originally meaning a space devoted to <em>storage</em>, should serve to remind us just how much we tend to impose conceptual coherence on
                  publications that are, in fact, always heterogeneous. Antiquarianism is about filling
                  in a space between what you have discovered and what you know or believe to be the
                  case. We are comfortable with some ways of filling those gaps, but less so with others.
                  As I have begun to suggest, all of the essays in this issue are thoughtfully responsive
                  to the challenge for the modern scholar of antiquarian form, and as such they open
                  the door for us to think about the analytical force of our own discomforts. To this
                  day a visitor to the Sir John Soane Museum in London finds a blend of what we might
                  call authentic material (an Egyptian sarcophagus, and so on) and what we would be
                  prone to call fakes (say casts of the Apollo Belvedere and other statues). The fact
                  that Blake probably never saw the Portland Vase he illustrated for Darwin's <em>Botanic Garden</em> passed without comment in his own day, but it provokes discussion today. In that
                  sense, the modern commitment to what we believe to be the unique evidentiary force
                  of authentic monuments is far more complete than it ever was in the Romantic era.
                  As Sam Smiles's piece thoughtfully demonstrates, it is worth dwelling on the nuanced
                  nature of the making and reception of reproduction in the period. Smiles notes that
                  "The antiquarian image . . . is best understood as a crystallization of cognitive
                  assumptions about the object" (Smiles 13). Using distinctions drawn from the semiotics
                  of Peirce, he suggests that even the most indexical mode of meaning-making in the
                  illustration of antiquarian material always trends towards the symbolic: "I propose
                  that antiquarian illustration can be classified for the most part as predominantly
                  iconic but is often, despite the illustrator's best efforts, tilted towards the symbolic"
                  (Smiles 8). I take this claim to imply that even the most apparently straightforward
                  illustration, or the most concretely conceived reproductions (say a cast of a fragment
                  of the Bayeux tapestry), offered in its day far more than information.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Lovers, children, and the founders of churches cling with special passion to simulacra
                     and to objects made sacred by association. To encounter these materials from a standpoint
                     outside the emotional universe in which they are prized is to become witness to something
                     profound, atavistic, and frequently embarrassing. The passion of the connoisseur shares
                     qualities with these kinds of affections, but adds a further confusion for the outside
                     viewer. While relics or memorials will tend to be validated by their exclusive or
                     limited nature, antiquarianism is characterized not by its commitment to the single
                     and precious, but to the accumulation of multiple instances. One provisional description
                     of Romantic antiquarianism might be that it is the sensibility of the cabinet of curiosities
                     just at the rise of the age of museums. Hill's claim, in 
                     “Antiquary at Home,”
                      that "[p]ublic museums, university departments, and government bodies were taking
                     over the territory that had been opened up by the antiquarianism of the previous two
                     generations" is a little premature. In the early decades of the nineteenth century,
                     the public museums and university departments that could take over these territories
                     were not yet in existence, though the sensibilities that would make them possible
                     certainly were coming into being.

                     </div> From the late eighteenth century forward, culture finds itself subjected to the pressure
                     of ever increasing quantities of antiquities, and the problems they presented were
                     not simply numerical but conceptual: the wide range of sources of antiquities was
                     not liable to systematic organization. While the amount of material with which culture
                     currently deals has evidently not lessened, what we have lost is the sense that any
                     system might subsume all of the material that comes to hand. But, of course, not feeling
                     one has a problem is not the same as not having a problem, and neither can be confused
                     with having actually solved a problem. As these essays show, the interest of Romantic
                     antiquarianism resides in its unresolved nature, the way in which projects in this
                     era stand between an emerging scientific consensus and a number of more provisional
                     strategies for arranging and diffusing knowledge that depend on or provoke an affective
                     charge often denied or submerged in later approaches.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Aside from the modern embarrassment about a passion for the past insufficiently matured
                  into conceptualization, another intriguing contradiction for the modern student is
                  the play between classical and local sources of interest. Jonathan Sachs puts Wood's
                  speculations on Homer of 1775 (<em>An Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer</em>, published in 1775, but circulated privately in 1767 and 1769) in relation to his
                  earlier and, in many ways, more culturally resonant work on Palmyra of 1753. Sachs
                  begins from the deceptively simple and openly retrospective question that might be
                  crudely summarized as, Why Palmyra, given that it does not matter to us? But, as his
                  essay demonstrates, the source of the mystery is the poverty of our own historical
                  interests and (therefore) of our accounts of the passions and interests of earlier
                  periods. When we see eighteenth-century antiquarians poring over provincial Roman
                  work (of the sort to be found in Palmyra) for signs of classical achievement, or studying
                  copies of vases, or even etchings of vases made from simulacra of vases, we may be
                  tempted to identify a failure to care about the original. But to look at the matter
                  from this point of view is to allow our own vision to be obscured by the haze of an
                  aura which later eras (including our own) have projected around those parts of the
                  past they have valued most. The modern relationship to the copy emerged after a slow
                  and uneven process of intellectual refinement that took much of the nineteenth century
                  to bring about. And so, when Erasmus Darwin needed an illustration of the Portland
                  Vase for his <em>Botanical Garden</em>, Blake produced a copy not from the original, but probably from a copy made by Wedgewood,
                  and likely with some reference to some earlier engravings. Brylowe reviews the complex
                  transmission of the Portland Vase, an excellent demonstration of the extent to which
                  not seeing the thing in itself is in fact <em>characteristic</em> of the period's relationship to art. In the process she also illustrates the sophisticated
                  ways in which classical antiquities could be made to support nationalist aspirations.
                  After all, it is Wedgewoods's achievement in pottery that provides the occasion for
                  the treatment of the Vase in Darwin's poem.</p>
               <p>Sachs astutely identifies the suggestion in Wood "that one needs to visit the remains
                  of classical civilization if one is ever to understand the writings they produced"
                  (Sachs 18) as putting into question a long tradition (still in a way current) of understanding
                  the Classics as universal texts—infinitely amenable to comprehension no matter the
                  circumstances. While this observation is entirely true from a modern point of view,
                  it is far less clear how much this contradiction could have been recognized as such
                  in its own day. Gibbon described Wood and Dawkins as having transported the ruins
                  of Palmyra and Balbec to England, which seems so absurd a notion to us that it might
                  makes us reflect on the history of mediation itself. What makes something feel accessible
                  by culture? The step taken by one individual onto lunar soil may conceivably be described
                  as a "giant leap for mankind." And yet, to this day only around a dozen people have
                  actually disturbed the dusty surface of the moon. The emergence of photographs of
                  the earth seen in its entirety, a small side-benefit of the space program, was an
                  epochal event in its own way, one celebrated by the placement of one of those photographs
                  on the cover of <em>The Whole Earth Catalogue</em>, an attempt to suggest that the whole world was available to be known, and even that
                  a sense of the whole was a vital political development. <em>Google Earth</em>, on the other hand, which appears to make every corner of our planet available in
                  detail, for that very reason risks making the world feel utterly inconceivable as
                  a whole. There is, in short, a power in partial knowledge.</p>
               <p>Many of the essays capture the ways in which visual representations, even those apparently
                  intended to capture monuments with accuracy, come to be valorized by the romance they
                  manage to project. Myrone is particularly interesting on the double challenge of antiquarianism
                  not just before its concerns were taken over by more scientific fields, but when it
                  could still imagine itself as having a role in the popular imagination. Writing on
                  the overlap in prejudices about topography and about antiquarians, he captures nicely
                  the ways in which John Britton saw his own scholarly researches to have been motivated
                  by an original fascination with the mystery of the location suggested by some of the
                  more speculative explanations on the topic, writing of Avebury that "[t]he mystic
                  halo which enveloped it, tended rather to awaken than repress research" (Myrone 9).

                  <p>Among the particular strengths on which Romantic antiquarians could build was the
                     long tradition of antiquarianism itself. In that sense, antiquarianism was <em>not</em> born from the French Revolution, though it was fated to be utterly changed by a number
                     of developments we associate with that world-historical phenomenon. The intellectual
                     and institutional relationship between the violence of the Revolution and the emergence
                     of Gothic taste is well established.

                     </div> The figure of Eustache-Hyacinthe Langlois, the artist living in the ruined building
                     that became a museum discussed by Hill, himself a kind of relic of the Ancien Régime,
                     is just one colorful instance of the ways in which historical trauma made it possible
                     to see fragments as at once belonging to a lost past and as intimately connected to
                     one's own culture. To witness the creation of significant ruins, to participate in
                     the cultural dislocations entailed in the revolution and its aftermath—these were
                     both lived experiences shaping the nostalgia typical of the post-revolutionary historical
                     sensibility. (Bann 19-22). And then, the emergence of a mass audience for material
                     that had been the preoccupation of a widespread but relatively small group often devoted
                     to fairly obscure researches was bound to affect the mediation and reception of a
                     field. This is a topic laid out with sophistication and nuance in all of the pieces
                     in this collection, but which Ina Ferris addresses most directly in her account of
                     the ways in which Romantic antiquarians "increasingly turned into public authors"
                     (Ferris 2). Topographers, sublime painters, wood engravers, popular compilers: these
                     offered so many formal modalities for representing the knowledge of antiquarian material
                     to a broader public. And, while the drives to reach out are directly connected to
                     the emergence of more specialized fields such as a more technical history, or archeology,
                     the developments have neither congruent aims nor analogous outcomes. We may remember
                     here the great failure of antiquarianism in British letters, that of Edward Casaubon
                     and his fruitless search for the key to all mythologies, described in the most important
                     attempt to capture in a novel the period just before the coming of the first Reform
                     Bill and the trend towards a vastly enfranchised public which it inaugurated. And <em>Middlemarch</em> is more than satiric in its treatment of the challenge of antiquity, of course, featuring—in
                     its representation of Dorothea in Rome—one of the most poignant representations of
                     the crisis liable to be provoked by the unmediated encounter with the past.</p>
               </div>
               <p>At its heart, the antiquarian project is based on the unbridgeable gap we know to
                  divide the past from the present. We may trace the embarrassment antiquarianism sometimes
                  provokes not only to the inevitable failures of all attempts to understand intimately
                  a lost era, but more compellingly to the insight these failures give us into the drives
                  that motivate such attempts in the first place. If the modern tendency has been to
                  fill in the space between a lost past and an uncertain present with what is often
                  thought of as disinterested scientific research, this does not mean we have moved
                  beyond the fundamental challenges motivating earlier attempts to overcome the gap.
                  As these papers illustrate so splendidly, Romantic antiquarianism—because of its position
                  at the point of transition between the speculative regimen of an earlier era and the
                  emergence of the period of licensed scientific research and accreditation we still
                  inhabit—provides a wonderful opportunity to reflect on the passions underlying all
                  desires to know, and on the gains and losses entailed in the emergence of a dispassionate
                  new scholarship. </p>
