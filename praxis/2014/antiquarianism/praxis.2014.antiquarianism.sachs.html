            <p class="noCount">This article explores problematic relation between the local, the national, and the
               international in antiquarianism through a focus on the issue of place in antiquarian
               writings. It looks specifically at the argument that literature can best be understood
               in its original place of composition as articulated in the writings of Robert Wood.
               By shifting emphasis from Wood’s later writing on Homer to his first published work,
               <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> (1753), the article suggests that Wood is not a late entrant but an early contributor
               to the "media environment" of the mid-eighteenth century, an environment characterized
               by the belief that poetry originates in an early stage of society, that it is composed
               orally, that it expresses the local particularity of landscapes and national or tribal
               culture, and that it can properly be traced and recovered by ethnographic, first-hand
               engagement with its place of origin. That Wood's theory of ancient poetry echoes (and
               perhaps anticipates) the later work of Percy, Ritson, Scott and others underscores
               not the separation but the proximity and overlapping concerns of popular antiquarianism
               with other varieties of antiquarianism less invested in the particular traditions
               of the British Isles. Ultimately, the article raises the possibility that classical
               antiquarianism broadly understood, including its varieties more attuned to classical
               and not national cultures, could also bolster the creation of national literatures
               that we associate with Romanticism.</p>

               <h2><span class="head"> </span></h2>
               <p>When scholars of British Romantic literature talk about antiquarianism, they generally
                  refer to what Marilyn Butler describes as popular antiquarianism, "the study of British
                  national culture: of English, Welsh, Gaelic, and Irish as vernacular languages, and
                  of their oral as well as their written traditions" (328). For Butler the word "popular"
                  firmly distinguishes the content of such antiquarianism from "classical, religious,
                  and orientalist learning" (328). Similarly, Susan Manning suggests that "Neither academic
                  nor metropolitan in origin, antiquarian activities were characteristically locale-
                  and region-based" (46) and worked to solidify "a regionally based sense of cultural
                  continuity" (47). And when Katie Trumpener argues that "English literature, so-called,
                  constitutes itself in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries through the
                  systematic imitation, appropriation, and political neutralization of antiquarian and
                  nationalist literary developments in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales" (xi), it is largely
                  such popular antiquarianism that she has in mind.</p>
               <p>But antiquarianism broadly understood, including its varieties more attuned to classical
                  and not national cultures, could, perhaps paradoxically, also bolster the creation
                  of national literatures that we associate with Romanticism. Walter Scott, for example,
                  suggested that Homer served what he called the "national muse" (7). Similarly, Anne
                  Janowitz invokes the non-native landscape of John Dyer's <em>The Ruins of Rome</em> (1740) to support her argument that "The ruin provides an historical provenance for
                  the conception of the British nation as immemorially ancient," ratified by "a conflated
                  representation of Britain as nature's inevitable product" (4). Building from Janowitz's
                  insight, this essay takes up the problematic relation between the local, the national,
                  and the international in antiquarianism through a focus on the issue of place in antiquarian
                  writings. It looks specifically at the argument that literature can best be understood
                  in its original place of composition.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Such a claim partakes in antiquarian debates about the meaning and location of culture
                     and of poetry's place within culture, debates associated with Ossian and, especially,
                     Homer that turn around what we now call orality and the status of oral poetics in
                     relationship to cultural progress. Recent scholars, notably Maureen McLane and Laura
                     Slatkin, have argued that these debates reflect "increased sensitivity to the historicity
                     of poetry's several media" (703) and hence ground a "Historical Media Poetics" whose
                     sophisticated arguments about the status of media like orality, writing, and print
                     might also help us to reflect on our own media-saturated present.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>On this point, see also McDowell, who argues that "Literary texts are a valuable—if
                              notoriously tricky—register of contemporary awareness of media shift" (233).</span></div>
                     </div> In this way, antiquarian discourses become increasingly relevant to contemporary media
                     theory. My argument here reflects these concerns but seeks less to articulate a Foucauldian
                     archaeology of discourse and more specifically to unpack the conjunction between arguments
                     for place and arguments for orality, both of which utilize ethnographic and experiential
                     strategies. The focus will be on the work of Robert Wood, who makes one of the more
                     prominent eighteenth-century arguments for Homer's orality. Wood has commonly been
                     understood as part of a major reevaluation of Homer's poetry, what Paula McDowell
                     describes as "a shift from a neoclassical approach, emphasizing what was universal
                     and timeless, to a new interest in the specific historical circumstances affecting
                     the production of works of art" (239). Such an approach grounds Wood's claim that
                     "Homer could neither read nor write" (<em>Homer</em> 248), an argument that has lately proven important for recent scholars interested
                     in the history of orality and ideas of media shift. As a result, interest in Wood
                     has largely focused on his last work, <em>An Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer,</em> published in 1775 but circulated privately in 1767 and 1769.</p>
               </div>
               <p>My suggestion here, however, is that the groundwork and methodological approach for
                  Wood's Homeric scholarship is more or less in place in his first published work, <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> (1753), in which Wood offers an account of literary interpretation emphasizing the
                  relationship of literature to the place in which it was produced, what I am calling
                  the situatedness of literature. The shift in emphasis has two significant implications
                  for our understanding of antiquarianism. First, it means that Wood is not a late entrant
                  but an early contributor to what McLane and Slatkin call the "media environment" of
                  the mid-eighteenth century, an environment characterized by the belief that poetry
                  originates in an early stage of society, that it is composed orally, that it expresses
                  the local particularity of landscapes and national or tribal culture, and that it
                  can properly be traced and recovered by ethnographic, first-hand engagement with its
                  place of origin. That Wood's theory of ancient poetry echoes (and perhaps anticipates)
                  the later work of Thomas Percy, Joseph Ritson, Scott and others underscores not the
                  separation but the proximity and overlapping concerns of popular antiquarianism with
                  other varieties of antiquarianism less invested in the particular traditions of the
                  British isles, with the important distinction, however, that Wood is less interested
                  in orality per se and more in the material remains and landscapes of antiquity.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Second, the tendency of scholarly interest to focus on Wood's later Homeric scholarship
                     at the expense of his earlier work on Palmyra suggests something about the difficulty
                     and occasional opacity of much antiquarian publication. While the very title of <em>An Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer</em> makes its subject plain,
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Acknowledging, of course, the irony that a work making such strong case for Homer's
                              lack of writing should have "Writings" yolked into its title by a posthumous editor.</span></div>
                     </div> <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em>, in contrast, is a hybrid volume, one that combines its interest in the ruins with
                     an unusual generic mix of travel narrative, specimen book, archaeological record,
                     reproduction of inscriptions, and treatise on how to read classical literature. The
                     prominence of its measured engravings and the relative absence of Palmyra from the
                     classical archive often work to displace interest in the work's prefatory material
                     and hence to obscure the strong claims being made for its method of literary interpretation.
                     This hybrid, I would suggest, is what makes <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> so contiguous with other antiquarian works and what often causes them to be neglected
                     by scholars seeking a more straightforward or traditional genealogy for the sort of
                     disciplinary inquiry that begins to emerge in the later eighteenth and nineteenth
                     centuries.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The eighteenth century, as Penelope Wilson has argued, "saw a steady growth in historical,
                  topographical, and antiquarian interest in the ancient world" (272). At the very start
                  of the century, for example, Joseph Addison prepared for his Italian travels by swotting
                  up on classical authors that might be relevant for his journey. As he explains in
                  the preface to his <em>Remarks on Several Parts of Italy, &amp;c. in the Years, 1701, 1702, 1703</em>, Addison took care <span class="quote">‘particularly to consider the Several Passages of the Ancient Poets which have any
                     relation to the Places or Curiosities that I met with; For before I entered on my
                     Voyage I took care to refresh my Memory among Classic Authors, and to make such Collections
                     out of them as I might afterwards have Occasion for. I must confess it was not one
                     of the least Entertainments that I met with in Travelling, to examine these several
                     Descriptions, as it were upon the Spot, and to compare the Natural Face of the Country
                     with the Landskips that the Poets have given us of it. (n.p.)’</span> In the travel narrative that follows the preface, Addison carefully notes correlations
                  between ancient place names and modern variants, and he repeatedly cites classical
                  authors to augment his own descriptions of Italian landscapes. His work shows how
                  what was in the seventeenth century a largely text-based classical curriculum began
                  to accommodate topographical experience as a helpful guide to the understanding of
                  classical authors.</p>
               <p>What was for Addison in the early eighteenth century an invitation to consider classical
                  texts "upon the spot" had become by the mid-eighteenth century an imperative for others.
                  In his first published work, a series of folio engravings of the ancient city of Palmyra
                  printed in 1753, Robert Wood insists that ancient texts can be better understood in
                  the landscapes that produced them. As he puts it in 
                  “Letter from the Publisher to the Reader,”
                  , "The life of Miltiades or Leonidas could never be read with so much pleasure, as
                  on the plains of Marathon or at the streights of Thermopylae; the Iliad has new beauties
                  on the banks of the Scamander, and the Odyssey is most pleasing in the countries where
                  Ulysses traveled and Homer sung" (<em>Palmyra</em> n. p.). If Addison took pleasure in comparing ancient descriptions with modern views,
                  Wood's claim is much stronger, for he insists that the full aesthetic appreciation
                  of classical texts, their capacity to deliver pleasure and "new beauties," can only
                  be fully apprehended through what we might call first-hand, eyewitness experience.
                  In such an account the proper understanding of ancient texts can only be arrived at
                  by interpretive methods that are more than philological. This theory of literary interpretation
                  emphasizes the geographical situatedness of literature and the shaping influence of
                  place, insisting upon travel as a means of achieving proper textual understanding.
                  In her gloss on this theory, Trumpener links Wood's emphasis on the situatedness of
                  literature to the "continuing touristic interest of literary sites" (78), and she
                  further characterizes Wood as inaugurating "a new mode of literary tourism" (103).
                  My suggestion, in contrast, is that Wood's argument introduces more than literary
                  tourism and, furthermore, that his insistence on the situatedness of literature is
                  part of a sophisticated interpretive methodology that emphasizes the specific historical
                  circumstances—topographical and otherwise—that produce works of art.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wood was a British traveler, politician, and member of the Society of Dilettanti who
                     made two prolonged journeys through the Mediterranean world in the 1740s and 1750s.
                     These travels resulted in three publications: <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em>, in 1753; <em>The Ruins of Balbec</em>, in 1757; and, finally and most famously, the posthumous <em>An Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer</em>, in 1775, where Wood claimed that Homer was an oral poet who could neither read nor
                     write. Today, if Wood is remembered at all, it is largely for this idea of Homer's
                     orality, a view marked by skepticism toward the received wisdom about Homer that places
                     Wood in an interpretive tradition running from, say, Giambattista Vico to Friedrich
                     August Wolf and beyond.

                              </span></div>
                     </div> While literary tourism may have been the result of Wood's work, the source of his
                     claim for the importance of place—a hybrid volume devoted to a site that has only
                     a minimal presence in ancient literature—is curious. What are we to make of this figure
                     whom we associate with Greece and with Homer, who made his reputation with a publication
                     showing the ruins of a Roman province in the middle of a desert? How can we make any
                     connections between Wood's interest in Homer and the Greeks and a specimen book showcasing
                     the architecture of late Imperial Rome? And, finally, what might these questions tell
                     us about eighteenth-century antiquarianism and its relevance for Romanticism?</p>
               </div>
               <p>I should emphasize from the outset that this essay does not necessarily answer all
                  of these questions. Posing them, however, reflects the frustrations of a literary
                  scholar trained to make certain kinds of arguments in response to certain genres of
                  texts yet when confronted with a work that doesn't in any way conform to these generic
                  models; and this problem, further, underscores some of the general difficulties inherent
                  in reading antiquarian texts. Like so many other antiquarian works, <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> is a hybrid text. It joins a series of more or less familiar genres into an unlikely
                  generic mix—in this case travel narrative, specimen book, archaeological record, and
                  treatise on how to read classical literature. Reading Wood's writing, one is tempted
                  to make concrete arguments: Wood was a conjectural historian, Wood was a literary
                  scholar obsessed with mimesis, Wood was the bold innovator of historicist methodologies
                  for literary studies, and so on. Such claims would be vastly overstated, and they
                  only make sense, furthermore, if we think of <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> as the coherent and unified work of a single author. But it is a fundamentally different
                  kind of text, one that bears Wood's name as its author, but one that, like many other
                  antiquarian texts, actually represents a diverse and sometimes competing series of
                  agendas. These conflicting tendencies can make it difficult to recognize that the
                  volume contains a sophisticated theory of poetic interpretation, one that pushes away
                  from privileging an autonomous aesthetic in favor of a range of interests including
                  the aesthetic but also encompassing the type of historical, cultural, patriotic, and
                  philosophical values that we now recognize in antiquarian works. Given this fact,
                  in order to understand more fully Wood's emphasis on the need to experience classical
                  literature in its place of composition—and the role of this claim within both <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> and Wood's larger, lifelong obsession with Homer—we need to think about the connection
                  between Wood's insistence on the situatedness of literature and his far-ranging travels
                  in the Mediterranean region from 1749-1751.</p>

                  <p>Wood first visited Greece in the 1740s when he traveled among the Agean islands and
                     also to Syria and Egypt.

                     </div> Some time after this, he settled in Rome, where he met the young and wealthy James
                     Dawkins and the dilettante John Bouverie. While walking from Rome to Naples to see
                     classical ruins there, the three set upon the idea of exploring antiquities in the
                     Mediterranean region. This, the voyage that made Wood's reputation, began in 1749
                     when, accompanied by Dawkins, Bouverie, and the Italian engraver/sculptor Giovanni
                     Borra, Wood set out from Naples for the Troade. Though the men traveled together,
                     each cultivated his own distinct interests, and this more than anything helps to explain
                     many of the hybrid qualities of the publications that followed the voyage.

                     </div> In both <em>Palmyra</em> and <em>Balbec,</em> Wood, like Addison before him, compares the statements of ancient geographers and
                     modern travelers with the physical conditions as he found them.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Travel in the East was certainly difficult, but because of the resources possessed
                  by the travellers, the voyage has been described as a "scholar's dream" (Spencer 75).
                  THE MEN had every feasible convenience including their own 160-ton ship, the SS <em>Matilda</em>. Wood notes that this boat "brought from London a library, consisting chiefly of
                  all the Greek historians and poets, some books of antiquities, and the best voyage
                  writers..." (<em>Palmyra,</em> 
                  “Publisher to Reader,”
                  n.p.). Again, we should note the particular emphasis on the Greeks, and not the Romans,
                  even though the group chose to publish first on a Roman site. Their travels were certainly
                  comprehensive, and in Wood's description, "We visited most of the islands of the Archipelago,
                  part of Greece in Europe; the Asiatic and European coasts of the Hellespont, Propontis,
                  and Bosphorus, as far as the Black Sea, most of the inland parts of Asia Minor, Syria,
                  Phoenicia, Palestine, and Egypt" (<em>Palmyra</em>, 
                  “Publisher to Reader,”
                  n.p.). In order to get to Palmyra and Balbec, which were at the time under the control
                  of the Turkish empire, the men essentially had to hire a private army from the Aga
                  of Hassia, "an escort of the Aga's best Arab horsemen, armed with guns and long pikes"
                  (<em>Palmyra</em> 33). It must have been a grand procession, and Wood later suggests that their caravan
                  numbered two hunderd men with as many beasts for travel. After visiting Palmyra and
                  Balbec, the the crew—minus Bouverie, who had died earlier in the tour—set out for
                  Athens in May of 1751. There they assisted James Stuart and Nicholas Revett on the
                  project which would become the <em>Antiquities of Athens</em> (1762).</p>
               <p>Following the tour, Wood returned home to prepare his two great folios, <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> (1753) and <em>The Ruins of Balbec</em> (1757). After once more returning to the Continent as the tutor to the Duke of Bridgewater,
                  Wood was given a position in public affairs when the reputation established by the
                  Palmyra volume led William Pitt the Elder to make Wood Under-Secretary of State in
                  1756. Wood subsequently held various appointments through several changes in government
                  and was a Member of Parliament from March 1761 until his death. The irony of Wood's
                  being called to public service is that it left him little time to continue with his
                  classical labors, his professed design to describe the insights gained from reading
                  the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em> in the lands in which Homer wrote, and to produce a geographical description that
                  mapped the ancient and present state of the Troade. A rough sketch of this work was
                  proposed initially in a letter to the ailing Dawkins, likely written in 1755 when
                  Wood was in Rome with Bridgewater; seven copies of this letter were privately printed
                  in 1767, an enlarged an anonymous edition appeared in 1769, and, after Wood's death
                  in 1771, the whole scheme was eventually edited by Jacob Bryant and published as <em>An Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer</em> in 1775.</p>
               <p>This brief chronology suggests that though ultimately published much later, Wood's
                  theory of Homer was clearly developed in connection with the travel that resulted
                  in the Palmyra publication, and needs to be seen as part and parcel of the same project.
                  Wood's theory of how to read classical literature and his emphasis on its place of
                  composition, in other words, begins with <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> and is later developed as a sustained argument about Homer. The connection, however,
                  is easy to overlook because <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> presents itself not as a theory of textual analysis but rather as a visual record
                  of the material remains of antiquity, and a tension between text and image marks the
                  presentation of the Palmyra volume and the interplay between its textual apparatus
                  and the visual material that it frames.</p>
               <p><em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em>, Wood's first published work and the tangible result of his Mediterranean tour, is
                  an enormous volume that blends the verbal and the visual. It consists of an introductory
                  
                  “Letter from the Publisher to the Reader,”
                  followed by 
                  “An Enquiry into the Ancient State of Palmyra,”
                  a description of its present state, reproductions of and commentary on a number of
                  inscriptions that the group found in and around Palmyra, and a brief description of
                  the journey through the desert. In all, there are roughly 50 pages of text that precede
                  a lavish set of fifty-seven measured engravings.</p>
               <p>Looking at the Palmyra volume as a book and as a material object, the most immediately
                  obvious fact is the prominence given to its engravings. <em>Palmyra</em> seems first and foremost an architectural specimen book, and Wood emphasizes that
                  "Architecture took up our chief attention" (<em>Palmyra</em>, 
                  “Publisher to the Reader,”
                  n.p.). The large size and precise details of the plates tower over the prefatory material,
                  and seem further distinguished by their careful reproduction of the scale, proportions,
                  and setting of the ancient buildings. As Wood explains, <span class="quote">‘All lovers of [architecture] must be sensible that the measures of the antient buildings
                     of Rome, by Monsieur Desgodetz, have been of the greatest use: We imagined that by
                     attempting to follow the same method in those countries where architecture had its
                     origin, or at least arrived at the highest degree of perfection it has ever attained,
                     we might do service.’</span> While most of the plates present measured drawings of Palmyra's architectural remains,
                  the first image is most striking: a view from the north-east of the ruined city of
                  Palmyra as it appeared to Wood in 1751, the plate folds out to the width of three
                  elephant folio sheets (22 inches by 15 inches per sheet, or nearly 2 feet by 4 feet
                  when fully extended).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This kind of detailed engraving marks the volume's strong affiliation with the first
                     generation of antiquarian plate books in the 1750s. This was the decade that included
                     not only both of Wood's volumes, but also new work from France including Caylus's <em>Recueil des Antiquités</em> (1752) and Leroy's engravings of Greece (1758); the first publication of Piranesi's <em>Antichità Romane</em> (1756); and the original "grant proposal" that led to Stuart and Revett's <em>Antiquities of Athens</em>. A self-consciously visual approach to antiquity distinguished these new antiquaries
                     from their predecessors. While images had always been an integral part of the study
                     of antiquity, these sophisticated engravings, along with the training provided by
                     academies of art, gave a new impetus to the visual tradition.

                     </div> The clear place of <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> in this tradition of antiquarian plate books and the emphasis it places on the visual
                     record of Palmyra is one reason why it is easy to overlook Wood's theory of reading.</p>
               </div>
               <p>A second reason is the inherent contradiction between a theory of reading that emphasizes
                  place and a volume on an archaeological site that figures only minimally in the classical
                  record. The quotation from Pliny's <em>Natural History</em> that runs along the bottom of Plate One indicates that Palmyra is not entirely absent
                  from classical literature, but the authors and historical events discussed in Wood's
                  opening section on 
                  “The Antient State of Palmyra”
                  make clear that Palmyra is hardly the place one would go to learn what is to be gained
                  from reading classical authors <span class="foreign">in situ</span>. Furthermore, Wood's theory of culture (and his understanding of the relationship
                  between works of art and the historical circumstances that produced them) is scattered
                  throughout the numerous sections of prefatory material. Nonetheless, <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em>—with its emphasis on the link between works of art and the historical circumstances
                  of their production, with its insistence on the importance of eyewitness observation,
                  and with its account of the engagement with Bedouin oral culture—contains the basis
                  for Wood's theory of Homer.</p>
               <p>The fundamental contribution to literary interpretation made by <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> is the suggestion that one needs to visit the remains of classical civilizations
                  if one is ever to understand the writings they inspired. As Wood explains: <span class="quote">‘Circumstances of climate and situation, otherwise trivial, become interesting from
                     that connection with great men, and great actions, which history and poetry have given
                     them. The life of Miltiades or Leonidas could never be read with so much pleasure,
                     as on the plains of Marathon or at the streights of Thermopylae; the Iliad has new
                     beauties on the banks of the Scamander, and the Odyssey is most pleasing in the countries
                     where Ulysses travelled and Homer sung. [<em>Palmyra</em>, 
                     “Publisher to Reader,”
                     n.p.]’</span> This theory not only makes tourism a prerequisite for the appreciation of classical
                  texts, but it also signifies a fundamental move away from neoclassical orthodoxies
                  because it focuses our attention not on what is timeless about the classics, but on
                  what is particular about them. Accordingly it encourages us to value classical authors
                  for the mimetic faithfulness of their writing to the manners and conditions of their
                  specific time and place (Constantine 66-84). Moreover, recognizing the link between
                  the work of art and the geographical context that inspired it requires eyewitness
                  experience; therefore, such a connection can only be appreciated by one who has visited
                  the places described. In a comment that hints at a contradiction in this justification
                  of his publication project, Wood elaborates: <span class="quote">‘The particular pleasure, it is true, which an imagination warmed upon the spot receives
                     from those scenes of heroick actions, the traveller can only feel, nor is it to be
                     communicated by description. But classical ground not only makes us always relish
                     the poet, or historian more, but sometimes helps us to understand them better. Where
                     we thought the present state of the country was the best comment on an antient author,
                     we made our draftsman take a view, or make a plan of it. This sort of entertainment
                     we extended to poetical geography, and spent a fortnight with great pleasure, in making
                     a map of the Scamandrian plain, with Homer in our hands. [<em>Palmyra</em>, 
                     “Publisher to Reader,”
                     n.p.]’</span> In part the issue here is that Wood's reveling in poetical geography seems confined
                  to the region associated with Homer and therefore to have little connection to the
                  claims of the Palmyra volume itself. But there is also, when Wood notes that the pleasure
                  experienced by the traveler is not "to be communicated by description," an allusion
                  to a more fundamental problem, for one might legitimately question the purpose of
                  a set of engravings that must by definition fail to capture the essential experience
                  of place. The language of the passage, however, with its distinction between relishing
                  and understanding literature, suggests a potential solution. To relish a poet or a
                  historian has its linguistic origins in sensual experiences of scent and taste and
                  implies an act of both sensual flavor and artistic appreciation, of combined physical
                  and aesthetic pleasures. As <em>The Plan of an Academy for the better Cultivation, Improvement and Encouragement of
                     Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, and the Arts of Design</em> (1755) puts it, "the more Attention we bestow upon the Arts, and the quicker Relish
                  we acquire for them, the more enlarged the Province of Pleasure becomes" (v); similarly,
                  in James Miller's comedy <em>The Man of Taste</em> (1736), Maria tells her cousin Dorthea, "People of Taste and Sensibility have a higher
                  Relish for Life" (18). Relish is a term of connoisseurship and applies to the active
                  appreciation of material objects. A more philosophical concept like understanding,
                  in contrast, might serve more sedentary, bookish readers. <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> attempts to accommodate both.</p>
               <p>In the 
                  “Journey through the Desart”
                  [sic], for example, Wood describes the wonder of first approaching Palmyra: <span class="quote">‘the hills opening discovered to us, all at once, the greatest quantity of ruins we
                     had ever seen, all of white marble, and beyond them towards the Euphrates a flat waste,
                     as far as the eye could reach, without any object that shewed either life or motion.
                     It is scarce possible to imagine any thing more striking than this view: So great
                     a number of Corinthian pillars, mixed with so little wall or solid building, afforded
                     a most romantic variety of prospect. But the following plate will convey a juster
                     idea of it than any description. (35)’</span> The distinction Wood makes here between the image represented on the plate and his
                  "description" suggests that he means to limit description to the verbal account of
                  an image. Such a distinction further implies that earlier, when Wood indicated the
                  particular pleasure of classical scenes for "an imagination warmed upon the spot"
                  and claimed that they could not be "communicated by description," he left open the
                  possibility that sophisticated engravings, executed to a measured scale and proper
                  perspective, might be able to convey a sense of place in the way that verbal description
                  could not. And if this is the case, then Wood seeks to provide the users of the Palmyra
                  volume with the experience of both relish and understanding through the book's combination
                  of text and image. As the passage above indicates, the opening plate is meant to recapture
                  for its viewers the astonishment at coming upon such a relatively undisturbed display
                  of desert ruins.</p>
               <p>This seems precisely the allure of Palmyra. Because its ruins have not been built
                  over or repurposed (except insofar as the Bedouins had, at the time of Wood's visit,
                  "about thirty [huts] in the court of the great temple" [37]), they lacked stratigraphy.
                  As Wood notes, <span class="quote">‘It is the natural and common fate of cities to have their memory longer preserved
                     than their ruins. Troy, Babylon, and Memphis are now known only from books, while
                     there is not a stone left to mark their situation. But here we have two instances
                     of considerable towns out-living any account of them. Our curiosity about these places
                     is rather raised by what we <em>see</em> than what we read, and Balbeck and Palmyra are in a great measure left to tell their
                     own story. (1, emphasis in original)’</span> The passage shows that Balbec and Palmyra are distinguished by the fullness of their
                  material remains and their relative lack of presence in the written classical record.
                  They are material and visual sites, places, as Wood notes, that we <em>see</em> rather than read about. The very absence of Palmyra and Balbec from the classical
                  record, in other words, is what attracts Wood and his travel companions to the site,
                  and the lack of any substantial writing about the two towns means that material and
                  physical ruins provide the predominant means to understand each site. But to publish
                  a volume on each place puts them in the record. With their accurate measured engravings
                  of Palmyra and Balbec, Wood and Dawkins become the preservers of the memory of antiquity.
                  Their work makes Palmyra and Balbec timeless.</p>
               <p>Moreover, since the plates create an imaginative experience for their viewer that
                  replicates, or at least approximates, the physical experience of going to the site,
                  they allow their viewers, according to Wood, to evaluate in a fresh and unbiased manner
                  the relationship between a work of art—here the well-preserved architectural remains
                  of Palmyra, unsullied by centuries of interpretive response—and the state of the society
                  in which it was produced. This, ultimately, is the value of the Palmyra volume. Unlike
                  Homer, whose reception bears the traces of previous interpreters and arguments, Palmyra
                  can be reproduced in a manner that allows it to be relished <em>and</em> understood without travelling to the site, and, further, the method through which
                  it can be appreciated can be seen more transparently in connection with a site that
                  has not been built over and reinterpreted. As Wood asserts, "How far the taste and
                  manner of the architecture may give any light into the age which produced it, our
                  engravings will put in every person's power to judge for himself" (15). Wood firmly
                  believes that the measured engravings of Palmyra reproduce the experience of the ruins
                  to a degree sufficient to allow his readers to evaluate the relation between objects
                  of cultural production and the age or state of the society in which they were produced.</p>
               <p>This is certainly how some, most notably Edward Gibbon, responded to the images. In
                  a footnote to the <em>Decline and Fall</em>, Gibbon suggested that "every previous account is eclipsed by the magnificent description
                  and drawings of MM Dawkins and Wood, who have transported into England the ruins of
                  Palmyra and Ballbeck" (3:263). Two aspects of this comment are notable: first, Gibbon
                  uses a visual metaphor—"<em>eclipsed</em>"—to describe his reaction, and, next, he suggests the visceral, physical response
                  that the works produced: Dawkins and Wood have succeeded in transporting the ruins
                  to England. While the pair did not, of course, physically move the ruins anywhere,
                  their measured drawings, like Robert Adams's later volume on the palace of Diocletian
                  (1764), would certainly have functioned as specimen books that allowed English architects
                  to copy the proportions and motifs of imperial Roman architecture.</p>
               <p>Wood's preservation of the memory of Palmyra and Balbec, his success at putting these
                  sites into the classical record, meant that Palmyra had a cultural impact beyond its
                  function as an architectural specimen book. Gavin Hamilton celebrated the accomplishments
                  of Wood and Dawkins on canvas (<a class="new" href="http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/H/3522/artist_name/Gavin%20Hamilton/record_id/22122"><em>James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of Palmyra</em>, 1758</a>). Further, James Grainger's ode 
                  “Solitude”
                  opens with a description of Palmyra based on Wood's volume, while Diderot's account
                  of ruins in the Salon of 1767, as Jonah Siegel explains, derived from Wood's images
                  and adaptations by Hubert Robert (Siegel 30-32). Palmyra's lack of stratigraphy made
                  it an emblem of pure ruin, and in the widely circulated work of Volney, <em>The Ruins of Empires</em> (1791), Palmyra becomes the point from which all lessons about the decline of empire
                  are delivered. The frontispiece shows a view of Palmyra similar to the first plate
                  of Wood's <em>Ruins of Palmyra</em>, only it includes Volney in the scene as the focal point of the elevated perspective
                  that makes the view possible. The late Imperial site that had largely been absent
                  from the written record now stands as the epitome of ruin, the locus that, as the
                  symbol of a fate to be avoided and not imitated, delivers a very different set of
                  lessons from antiquity.</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/antiquarianism/images/SachsFig2Thumb.jpg" alt="Constantine Volney. Frontispiece, The Ruins of Empires (1791). Courtesy of Webster Library, Concordia University , Montreal." class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>In his role as the preserver of an unrecorded antiquity, Wood might be compared to
                  Thomas Percy and Joseph Ritson, among others, thus highlighting the link between popular
                  and classical antiquarians. Percy's <em>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</em> (1765), for example, shares with Wood's <em>Ruins of Palmyra</em> an interest in the role of poetry in the early stages of society and a belief that
                  this role changes as society progresses. Percy too sees poetry as the preserver of
                  a long cultural memory. He insists that the earlier minstrel ballads written in Northern
                  dialect are coincident with "the true spirit of chivalry" (xxii), and he repeatedly
                  emphasizes how the poems, when collected, preserve and propagate ancestral memory,
                  "rescuing from oblivion" the "taste, genius, sentiments, and manners" of illustrious
                  ancestors (xiv). Unlike Wood, Percy does not appeal to eyewitness experience; he bases
                  his collection on archival research and credits the many friends, libraries, and individuals
                  who shared their collections of printed ballads with him. Joseph Ritson, however,
                  shares Wood's emphasis on ethnographic and experiential authority. As Ritson notes
                  in his preface to <em>Scotish Song in Two Volumes</em> (1794), he "made repeated visits to different parts of Scotland for the purpose of
                  obtaining materials or information upon the subject" (ii). Such an appeal to ethnographic
                  authority, as Maureen McLane notes, becomes an increasingly important form of poetic
                  authority in the later eighteenth century, and "what had been a liability—a Scottish
                  birth and upbringing—was now boldly announced as a credential, such that the English
                  antiquarian had to find ways to compete" (72). Ritson's solution here might be understood
                  to draw upon Wood's earlier appeal to first-hand experience and an emphasis on the
                  interpretive understanding and "relish" that might be gained from contact with the
                  original sites of poetic composition.</p>
               <p>These brief comparisons with Volnay, Percy, and Ritson suggest two trajectories for
                  the later significance of <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em>: first, as an emblem of ruin and, second, as a contribution to increasingly sophisticated
                  thinking about the relation between works of art and the cultural conditions of their
                  production. This second trajectory contributes to that rejection of the aesthetic
                  as an autonomous category, which we associate now with the late eighteenth-century
                  ballad revival and which would be worked out in greater detail in Wood's theory of
                  Homer's orality.</p>
               <p>With this in mind, I want to speculate on the links between Wood's emphasis on poetic
                  geography articulated in the prefatory material to the <em>Ruins of Palmyra</em>, and his later publications on Homer. We have seen how <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> provides the basis for Wood's theory of the relation between cultural production
                  and the stages of social development, a theory that he would later apply to Homer
                  in elaborating his argument for Homeric orality. The recognition of the link between
                  orality and earlier stages of social development, though, would not have been possible
                  without the travel experience that led to the Palmyra volume. Much as later theorists
                  of orality like Milman Parry and Alfred Lord visited cultures thought to be in an
                  earlier state of social development to observe improvisational oral poetic performance,
                  Wood's description of his journey through the desert also suggests that Bedouin oral
                  poetry may have influenced his thinking about Homer. Wood notes that among the Bedouins,
                  "When the business of the day was over, coffee and a pipe of tobacco made their highest
                  luxury, and while they indulged in this, sitting in a circle, one of the company entertained
                  the rest with a song or story, the subject of love, or war, and the composition sometimes
                  extemporary" (<em>Palmyra</em> 35).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In Wood's final volume on Homer, attention is given not to images but to Wood's theory
                     of literature. But Wood's comment from the Palmyra volume about how the architecture
                     "gives light into the age which produced it" and his recognition of the extemporaneity
                     of Bedouin oral composition provides us with an important link between Wood's work
                     on Palmyra and his thinking on Homer. In both his preface to <em>Palmyra</em> and the various incarnations of his writing on the <em>Original Genius of Homer</em>, Wood suggests that the proper way to appreciate Homer—and by implication, all classical
                     literature—is to recognize the close connection between the work, the place of composition,
                     and the age or state of society that produced it. As he puts it: "A review of Homer's
                     scene of action leads naturally to the times, when he lived" (<em>Homer</em> iv). Wood, in all of his thinking about antiquity, is attempting to recreate a sense
                     of past ages by two approaches: eyewitness experience and ethnography. The first utilizes
                     the physical experience of classical landscapes, as we see most clearly when Wood
                     insists on Homer's accuracy through a comparison of his own travel experiences and
                     the conflict between Meneleus and Agamemnon over navigation routes in Book 3 of the <em>Odyssey</em> (Homer 34-61).

               </div>
               <p>The second approach, which I am characterizing as ethnographic, suggests that the
                  present native inhabitants of classical sites—especially those associated with the
                  East, like Palmyra and the Troade—provide a present example of the manners of earlier
                  ages of society. Certain comments in the <em>Original Genius</em> reveal Wood the ethnographer most clearly. After noting that the difficulty of reading
                  Homer comes from the need to reconcile ourselves "to usages and customs so very opposite
                  to our own," Wood explains that "we found the manners of the Iliad still preserved
                  in some parts of the East" (128). He continues, and in what Jim Porter has described
                  as "a kind of Homeric ethnography on modern day Bedouins" (333), he likens the Bedouins
                  found amidst the Palmyrene ruins to Hottentots and Cherokees. Subsequently, in a comparison
                  of heroic and Bedouin manners, he notes how unimportant is one's word of honor. "Ulysses,"
                  he concludes, "would form a perfect model for those, who wish to make their way in
                  [the desert] with security and respect" (140). Moments like this suggest that Wood
                  is a cultural comparativist working from a model of stadial development, which associates
                  certain kinds of manners with certain stages of social development. They further mark
                  his awareness of what we now call "uneven development," which creates the possibility
                  of travelling to the past by visiting supposedly less developed native cultures. This
                  is the same sort of logic, with its emphasis on the manners and cultural forms that
                  accompany certain ages of society, that Wood uses to support his suggestion that Homer
                  was an oral poet.</p>
               <p>Wood consistently frames his appreciation for Homer by emphasizing his ability to
                  provide a faithful, mimetic representation of the age in which he lived. Wood explains,
                  <span class="quote">‘We shall confine our inquiry to Homer's Mimetic Powers for whether we consider him
                     as a Geographer, Traveller, Historian, or Chronologer, whether his Religion and Mythology,
                     his Manners and Customs, or his Language and Learning... in these several views his
                     Imitation alone is the great object of our attention. We shall admit his antient title
                     of Philosopher only as he is a painter." (vii) ’</span> This, then, suggests a further link between <em>Original Genius</em> and <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em>, for just as in the earlier volume measured engraving attempted to replicate ancient
                  ruins in exact detail to help viewers picture the original sight and to "give light
                  into the age that produced them," Homer is praised for the most exact, mimetic representation
                  of the age in which he lived. "[H]is great merit," Wood claims, "seems to be that
                  of having transmitted to us a faithful transcript or...a correct abstract of human
                  nature...which belonged to his period of society" (<em>Homer</em> xiii). In both cases, in the actual experience of place that Wood emphasizes in <span style="font-style:italic">Original Genius</span> and in viewing its mimetic, engraved representation in <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em>, what Wood values is partly the experience itself, but more emphatically it is the
                  potential of experiences of visiting or viewing to illuminate earlier ages of society
                  and the value of their cultural production.</p>
               <p>Wood's notion of both travel and images as an empirical test for Homer's accuracy
                  and hence his literary merit helps to explain why an author preoccupied with Greece
                  in general and Homer in particular would choose to publish initially on a late imperial
                  Roman site, and Wood's emphasis on the link between the engravings of Palmyra and
                  insights into the age that produced its architecture in <em>The Ruins of Palmyra</em> underscores Wood's dominant interest in mimesis as a link between Palmyra and Homer.
                  Wood's interest in reading classical texts in the landscapes in which they were produced—in
                  what he calls "poetical geography," with its emphasis on ethnographic and experiential
                  strategies that extend interpretive authority beyond more typical text-based approaches
                  that we now call philology—can also be understood in relation to his use of mimesis
                  as the primary factor in judging cultural production. Further, the close connections
                  between Wood's earlier and later work detailed by this essay have implications for
                  how we understand the relation between popular and classical antiquarianism. Recent
                  scholarly interest in "popular antiquarianism" and a correspondent revival of interest
                  in local ballad culture have helped us to recognize a historical media environment
                  in the later eighteenth-century characterized by an understanding of the close connections
                  between literary works and their historical and geographical contexts; by an awareness
                  of the differences among orality, writing, and print; and by a belief that eyewitness
                  experience can illuminate the meaning and originality of earlier literature. This
                  essay's focus on Robert Wood has suggested that this environment has its roots not
                  only in the revival of literary nationalism that we associate with Romanticism later
                  in the century, but also in earlier antiquarian interest in the material remains of
                  classical civilizations.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">On this point, see also McDowell, who argues that "Literary texts are a valuable—if
               notoriously tricky—register of contemporary awareness of media shift" (233).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Acknowledging, of course, the irony that a work making such strong case for Homer's
               <em>lack</em> of writing should have "Writings" yolked into its title by a posthumous editor.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">For recent arguments about Wood and orality, see McLane and Slatkin; McDowell; Sachs.

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">For information on Wood's life, I am indebted to Spencer and Constantine. Special
               thanks also to Paul Jackson, librarian at the Institute for Classical Studies in London,
               for allowing me access to the Wood papers there. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Dawkins focused on natural history, including fauna, flora, etc.; Bouverie observed
               monuments; while Wood's primary interest was in the topography of the sites visited
               and their inscriptions.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">On this point, see: Pinto; Soros; and Griggs. My thanks to Tamara Griggs for calling
               my attention to these references. On the fate of visual discourse after the 1750s,
               with particular emphasis on debates over the cognitive utility of images from the
               1770s to the 1820s, see Smiles. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
