               <p class="noCount">This volume was designed at the University of Maryland by Michael Quilligan, Site
                  Manager at <em>Romantic Circles</em>. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</a> tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style applied by
                  Michael Quilligan. TEI renders text in archival quality for better preservation and
                  future access. Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions
                  of the XSLT transforms provided by the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. The image associated with this

               <p class="noCount">The <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</em> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation
                  of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation
                  of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <em>RCPS</em> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand,
                  dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other,
                  retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions
                  of today. <em>RCPS</em> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and most exciting critical
                  writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>
