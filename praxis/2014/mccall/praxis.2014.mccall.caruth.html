               <p>The centrality of Greek tragedy, and in particular Sophocles’ <em>Antigone</em>, as a conceptual object for German Idealism and Romanticism remains a vital source
                  of contemporary reflection concerning the conceptual, political, and ethical sources
                  of our own theoretical thought. Tom McCall’s 1988 essay, “The Case of the Missing
                  Body,” provides an important contribution to these issues through an original reading
                  of Friedrich Hölderlin’s translation of <em>Antigone</em> and his enigmatic notes on this work.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Tom McCall, “The Case of the Missing Body,” reprinted in this issue. Permission
                           to reprint generously granted by</span></div>
                  </div> McCall’s title signals a particular enigma concerning the problem of burial at the
                  heart of Sophocles’ play, which centers on the struggle between Antigone and Thebes’
                  king Creon over the corpse of her brother Polyneices. In McCall’s reading, Hölderlin’s
                  translation foregrounds the strange appearing and disappearing of the corpse in its
                  various attempted and failed burials, a drama that ultimately concerns the possibility
                  for this corpse—and consequently those around it—to achieve contact with the divine
                  and, more largely, to be inscribed in a world of meaning. More importantly, McCall
                  argues, the case of the missing body is not only the story of the corpse <em>in</em> the play, but also the story of what happens to the corpse in the movement <em>between</em> Sophocles’ Greek version and Hölderlin’s German version, a linguistic drama of translation
                  in which the corpse literally appears and disappears. Sophocles’ play, in Hölderlin’s
                  German, thus becomes, in McCall’s reading, an “allegory of translation” in which the
                  failure to bury Polyneices’ body dramatizes the destiny of the play as it is translated
                  by the modern Germans (“Hesperians”), whose destiny is itself defined by the very
                  necessity of translating Greek texts. The questions that begin and end Sophocles’
                  play, as McCall suggests—“what to <em>do</em> with the unsightly corpse, whether to bury it or not”—thus become equally demanding
                  questions about the way in which we understand the significance of translation as
                  a model for reading and for meaning-making in Hölderlin’s work. And the question of
                  the body is also the site of a fatal enigma that is carried over, translated—or not
                  translated—in our own theoretical confrontations with Romantic texts and in our own
                  attempt to respond to all texts, though particularly, perhaps, those in which we encounter
                  what remains of the dead.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>What is at stake in these questions is hinted at in the other meaning of McCall’s
                  title, “the case of the missing body,” which alludes to Hölderlin’s analysis of the
                  loss of vision or destiny in the moderns, who put their corpses—both actual and textual—in
                  cases. Hölderlin writes: <span class="quote">‘For this is the tragic for us: that, packed up very still in some sort of container,
                     we depart the realm of the living, not that—consumed in flames—we expiate the flames
                     which we could not tame.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                              150. I have modified Pfau’s translation to accord with McCall’s translatin in his
                              essay.</span></div>
                     </div>’</span> Whereas the Greeks practiced burial rites that enabled and displayed the contact with
                  the divine at the site of the dead body, the moderns, as McCall glosses this passage,
                  “hide from their eyes the sight of actual, visible translation between the two realms”
                  (62). This turning away from the site of contact, McCall suggests, refers not only
                  to the actual burial practices of the moderns, but also to the texts of the translated
                  Greek “tragedies” that serve the moderns as central sites of meaning-making. Modern
                  tragedy—which, McCall says, can only occur for Hölderlin at this moment within the
                  institution of translated Greek tragedy—also confronts the moderns with the problem
                  of contact between worlds, between ancient Greek visionary culture and modern experience,
                  between Greek text and German meaning. Turning away from the site of contact, the
                  moderns thus, in McCall’s words, “cannot [. . .] bear to witness the passage itself,
                  but must resort to the strongboxes, ‘containers,’ and protective coffin-concepts of
                  modern culture” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 16</a>). Protected by the coffin-concepts in which they encase the texts of Greek tragedy,
                  the moderns shelter themselves from the problem of translation, from what happens
                  if “the object of translation—the body, the dead, which for Hölderlin were represented
                  by ‘the Greeks’ and their original scripts—disintegrates and pollutes the holy, or
                  drives spirit out of its fragile embodiments.” For McCall, then, Hölderlin’s translation
                  of <em>Antigone</em> raises the question of what it means to face—to translate, and to read—the drama of
                  the corpse and the drama of language staged around it without simply slipping it back
                  inside its coffin. For what Hölderlin achieves as translator, McCall writes, is to
                  act “as an undertaker who opens a crypt in the dramatic process of ‘translating’ the
                  relics [. . .] to holier ground” (64). What does it mean, then, for a translation
                  to open a crypt? And how do we <em>read</em>, without simply entombing, the corpse at the heart of <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*%29antigo%2Fnh&amp;la=greek&amp;can=*%29antigo%2Fnh0">Ἀντιγόνη</a>’s, and <em>Antigonä</em>’s, drama of translation?</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>At the heart of this question is the problem of contact, or the manner in which Greek
                     tragedy, for Hölderlin, stages the means by which “the Spirit of Time and Nature”
                     confronts the sensory object of its interest: <span class="quote">‘The boldest moment in the course of a day or in a work of art is where the spirit
                        of the age and nature, when the heavenly which takes hold of man, and the object in
                        which he is interested, come to oppose one another most ferociously; because the sensuous
                        object only extends half of the way while the spirit awakens most powerfully where
                        the second half sets in.
                        <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                                 (3)
                                 </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Hölderlin, “Remarks on ‘Antigone,’” in Pfau, 110.</span></div>
                        </div>’</span> As McCall interprets these lines, the artwork at its boldest moment is to “exhibit
                     ‘Spirit’ (or the spirit-in-man) and the material object of its ‘interest’ <em>as</em> they are in themselves, each without its other half that completes it” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</a>). Tragedy is indeed, for Hölderlin, concerned with “that space, gap, vacuum, ‘stage,’
                     or moment of passage that separated immaterial powers and those material vehicles
                     of their potential empowerment [. . .] Tragedy is <em>about</em> this space [. . .] or stage of potential contact [. . .] and transport [. . .] of
                     sense and meaning” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 11</a>). But for McCall, strikingly, the “sensory object” in <em>Antigone</em> is not simply any object or body, but rather, he says, “none other than the exposed
                     body of Polyneices” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</a>). By interposing the corpse as the exemplary “object” to which spirit—or meaning—must
                     attach, McCall thus makes less certain, less dialectically smooth, the meeting between
                     what he goes on to interpret as the “philosophical drama” of attempted inspiration
                     or contact between ‘the spiritual (Concept, idea, Meaning [. . .]) and the material
                     (the visible body of Polyneices [. . .] the letter)” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</a>). Rather than two forces or movements, we thus have in tragedy, then, a focus on
                     an uncertain space or gap between the “immaterial powers and those material vehicles
                     of their potential empowerment,” a site “where Spirit hinges—or doesn’t hinge—onto
                     word (or art-work)” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 11</a>). Indeed, it is only of a corpse that McCall can write of this scene, elegantly,
                     that “the object (or body) makes absolutely no effort to reach out and touch Spirit,
                     but ‘reaches only half-way’—not unlike Michaelangelo’s Adam who languidly awaits the
                     inspiriting touch of God” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</a>).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The Greek tragedy—or at least <em>this</em> Greek tragedy, as I would elaborate on McCall’s argument, must then be (re)read as
                  staging a question about its own possibility, as text, to perform the rites, to enable
                  the contact between spirit and body, letter and meaning. For, as McCall points out,
                  Hölderlin does not say that Spirit actually makes contact with the body, but only
                  that it “‘wakes up quite forcefully’ [. . .] where its space, the ‘second-half,’ begins”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</a>). Does the spirit “flare into wakefulness where the body ends (or ends up),” McCall
                  asks, “or [. . .] simply [. . .] at the boundary of its own territory, which may still
                  be separated, by an unbridgeable lacuna, from the corporeal domain of things?” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</a>). The deadness of the corpse, its possible inaccessibility to the spirit, or meaning,
                  thus hinders the certainty of a philosophical solution (so often provided by the Germans
                  for Greek tragedy and for <em>Antigone</em> in particular) and indeed of any definite interpretation that could appropriate this
                  corpse to spirit—and this Greek corpus to modern sense. By showing that <em>Antigone</em> “exposes [human character] to the dangers of that possible lacuna of non-relation
                  that separates Spirit and object” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 13</a>), Hölderlin’s translation, McCall suggests, reveals an urgent question at the heart
                  of the tragedy: “Is there contact between the two, or isn’t there?” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 13</a>).</p>
            </div>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is this question that, as I read McCall, makes <em>Antigone</em> not only a central play for the Greeks—an exemplary Greek tragedy—but also an exemplary
                     tragedy for the moderns, who now must, as Hölderlin suggests in a letter to his friend
                     Böhlendorff, reread and estrange the inherited Greek corpus in order to confront the
                     radical difference, the problem of translation or contact, between the texts of the
                     ancients and those of the moderns who are determined by this very past. Just as the
                     Greeks have distanced themselves from their own “nature” in order to become who they
                     are, Hölderlin famously writes Böhlendorff in 1801, so too must the moderns distance
                     themselves from the Greeks (or rather the received forms in which they have inherited
                     them), as their own “nature,” in order escape their current predicament, which Hölderlin
                     calls “<span class="foreign">das Schicksallose, dysmoron</span>”: fatelessness, or the dwelling in mere “positivity,” in McCall’s words, the repetition
                     of received and unappropriated clichés with no relation to one’s historical situation.
                     At stake, as McCall argues in his essay “Ödipus Translator,” is thus the achievement
                     of an “authentic temporal destiny,” a destiny made possible only by confronting or
                     exposing oneself to the contact—or non-contact—between the two radically different
                     languages and texts that constitute the Germans and their cultural origins, an exposure
                     that must take place through translation, and more specifically the translation of
                     tragedy.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> <em>Antigone</em>, in staging the struggle over the exposed body, also stages the struggle for any
                     translation to confront—to have contact with—the spirit of the Greek tragedy itself,
                     in its courageous exposure of the dangers of decay, of a decomposition that takes
                     place at the site of passage, of the possibility of fragmentation of the material
                     “object.” The problem of “contact” is ultimately, then, a problem of the material
                     dimensions of languages in relation to each other, of a relation to linguistic foreignness—which
                     is already staged in the Greek tragic text—that may disable the translation of languages
                     as a translation of concepts.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Hölderlin’s translation, moreover, in exposing or de-crypting <em>Antigone</em>, produces something strange, a surprise that goes far beyond the question of what
                  constitutes the “Greek” or even a different, new and estranged foreignness that could
                  be re-appropriated by the Germans. For <em>Antigone</em>, as McCall points out, “is not about cremation at all, but about burial and its containers.”
                  The difficulty of burial does not only concern the exposure of Polyneices, but also
                  the entombment of Antigone. The tragedy thus exemplifies the <em>modern</em> problem of contact, the problem of its own translation <em>as it passes into the moderns</em> through their protective coffin-concepts: <span class="quote">‘[McCall writes t]hat “<span class="foreign">unterirdische Behausung</span>” [underground dwelling] and “<span class="foreign">gegrabene Kluft</span>” [dug-out chasm] in which Antigone is banished are hypberbolic figures for the “modern”
                     tragedy of excessive containment which may put bodies out of reach of spirit. This
                     play, then, has something to do with “modern tragedy” (“das Tragische bei uns”), and
                     so qualifies as an (ancient) tragedy about modern modes of representation and translation
                     which violate their spirits and bodies either by ‘grounding’ them too much, or not
                     enough. (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">"Case" par. 17</a>)’</span> <em>Antigone</em>, in McCall’s reading of Hölderlin’s translation, is a play that stages itself as
                  its own future, a destiny that also takes the form of its entombment in the coffin-concepts
                  of the moderns. The play thus raises the possibility that it is indeed impossible
                  to translate, because the enigma of this corpse and its translation refuses residence
                  even within its original language. But the conflict and drama of the play are precisely
                  about the <em>necessity</em> of translating, of honoring the dead and making contact with spirit, and of doing
                  so properly. Hölderlin’s task and McCall’s reading of it, as I would argue, suggests,
                  then, that translation is <em>most called for just where it is least possible</em>. The corpse is the place in which contact, the touching of two absolutely separate
                  worlds, is most urgently demanded, even as the gods turn away from humans, even as
                  the dead body refuses the touch of our own search for meaning. How translate, then,
                  how give this text, and this lifeless body, meaning, how find contact at this site?
                  What does Hölderlin <em>do</em>, McCall implicitly asks, with Polyneices’—and the text’s—corpse?</p>

               <p>Something unthinkable happens, McCall tells us, between Sophocles’ and Hölderlin’s
                  texts. This occurs in the first burial scene of Polyneices, the first attempted burial
                  that takes place after King Creon has mandated no burial for the attacker of his city,
                  and which we find out about from a guard who rushes to tell Creon the mysterious news:
                  </p>
               <blockquote class="quote"><span style="font-weight:bold">Guard:</span> Well, here it is. The corpse—someone has just given it burial and disappeared after
                  sprinkling thirsty dust on the flesh and performing the other rights that piety demands. <br/> <span style="font-weight:bold">Creon:</span> What are you saying?

                  The doer was someone who left no trace[. . .]. The dead man was veiled from us [had
                  been made invisible]—not shut within a tomb, but a light cover of dust was on him
                  [. . .] And no sign was visible that any beast of prey or any dog had approached or
                  torn him.

               </blockquote>
               <p>In the Greek text, the guard begins his speech by saying that he “doesn’t know” the
                  burier of the body because the body has been buried by someone who leaves no signs.
                  For the guard, this is remarkable, as is the fact that the mere sprinkling of dust—not
                  a true burial beneath the ground—has actually made the body disappear: “the dead man
                  was veiled [had been made invisible].” The disappearance of the body—and the disappearance
                  of the act of making it disappear—are staged in the Greek, McCall suggests, as the
                  very signature of the gods—not of Antigone, as is most often assumed—and may be precisely
                  the model of successful translation par excellence: a semi-divine act in which no
                  sign remains behind to decay or pollute. In the first burial scene, then, <em>Antigone</em> at least briefly stages what might have been the proper fate of the body, had it
                  been allowed to rest properly for the remainder of the play.</p>
               <p>But in Hölderlin’s text the “not knowing” of the guard is transformed into something
                  darker and more philosophical: “I do not know” becomes “<span class="foreign">Undenklich</span>,” “Unthinkable.” What is unthinkable is, in German, precisely the signlessness of
                  the the one(s) who buried the body, a line that, in translation, acquires the visionary
                  tone of Hölderlin’s later work: “<span class="foreign">Zeichenlos war der Meister</span> [Signless was the Master].” In its oracular tone and echoes of his later lyrics,
                  this line, McCall suggests, recalls Hölderlin’s frequent use of the term in his late
                  poetry to describe divinized poets. Another story is now inscribed in the play of
                  Sophocles: <span class="quote">‘The translation (“<span class="foreign">Zeichenlos war der Meister</span>”), then, appears to be telling its own tragedy within the original tragedy: while
                     telling Sophocles’ story about Gods who (seem to) intervene in human affairs in order
                     to cover over the “outrageous sight” of death, the line also tells Hölderlin’s story
                     about the <span class="foreign">Deus absconditus</span> of the Hesperians, which may be that “God” who can only presence himself “in the
                     form of death,” in, that is, figures of spirit absented from itself. But that absence
                     of signs, which in the Greek burial are the signs of a divine superintendency over
                     mortal affairs becomes in translation a more tragic sort of absence, since those signs
                     (we don’t see) left behind by the hand of Greek deity are no longer—in German—assignable
                     to the “Master” (God or vatic poet), who are “<span class="foreign">Zeichenlos</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">“Case” 17</a>).’</span> The unthinkable that the play tells about itself may be understood, then, as its
                  translation out of the world of successful translation; that is, the Greek tragedy’s
                  destiny as it attempts to pass over, and yet does not, into the language of the modern
                  Germans. In this way Hölderlin translates the Greek texts as telling a double story
                  (or non-story) of untranslatability: not a movement from translation to non-translation,
                  but a non-movement, or a juxtaposition, of a Greek text already allegorizing its own
                  impossible translation, and a German text unable to grasp even this message, unable
                  to face the history of an untranslatable language from which it, itself, emerges.</p>
               <p>From a certain perspective, Hölderlin’s translation <em>might</em> thus be read, following McCall’s interpretation, through the notion of Blanchot’s
                  “double infidelity” of gods and men that holds the two together, faithful, as they
                  turn away from each other: here, the language of Greek and the language of German
                  parting ways from each other just where translation should, but cannot take place,
                  telling a story of vigilance in the dark night of the gods’ absence. McCall offers
                  some implicit support for this story in another part of the passage, precisely where
                  the guard says that Polyneices’ body “had been made invisible (<span class="foreign">ho men gar ephanito</span>).” Hölderlin writes simply, “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>” (“there was nothing ceremonious/nothing to give burial rights to,” line 255). <span class="foreign">Feiern</span>, a word used by Hölderlin throughout his work as a word of celebration, had also
                  been used earlier in the Sophocles passage to describe the rites of burial that the
                  body, according, to the guard, indeed had been given (line 247). But by writing “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>” here, Hölderlin replaces the body that had been given burial rites by the gods (and
                  thus made invisible) with the absence of anything at all to which to give rites. The
                  words following “<span class="foreign">Nichts feierliches</span>”—<span class="foreign">es war kein grabmal nicht [no grave-monument]</span>—further abolish the Greek burial, McCall suggests. “No grave and no burial! What
                  has happened to the body?” McCall asks. “Far from being “made invisible,” it has literally
                  got lost in translation.” In shifting from an <em>invisible</em> body to <em>no body at all</em>, Hölderlin appears again to have inscribed in the translation a certain destiny of
                  loss: “It would appear, then, that the translation employs the mysterious burial of
                  a corpse as a means to announce the death of modern poetry, now no longer capable
                  of celeberating [. . .] the congruence of poetic signs and divine intentions and to
                  preserve bodies in translation” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 30</a>). If we note the fact that, according to McCall, the Greek text was <em>already</em> seen as allegorizing its own untranslatability, then the relation between Greek text
                  and German translation might be understood as a kind of radical structure of belatedness,
                  an absolute untouchability or lack of contact: a Greek text that is only readable
                  as a future in which it can no longer be translated, and a German text that repeats
                  this anticipatory language in the form of a traumatic loss of meaningful signs.</p>

               <p>Yet Tom McCall offers another reading as well, something that does not allow us to
                  “close the case” of the missing body in even this radicalized elegiac mode. At the
                  very point of absolute loss, of infinite loss one might say—between a body already
                  lost and a body only to return as the torn-up pieces of an unreadable text—McCall
                  begins to speculate, to turn to yet another text, a third text that interposes itself
                  in McCall’s own intrepretive process. Hölderlin had, apparently, been working with
                  the corrupt “Juntina” edition of Sophocles of 1555. The phrase Hölderlin translates
                  as “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>” (“Nothing to celebrate”)—which in the corrected Greek version is <span class="foreign">ho men gar ephanito</span> (“the dead man had been made invisible “)—is given by the Juntina edition as <span class="foreign">ouden gar ehanisto</span> (“Nothing had been made invisible”), that is, the <em>opposite</em> of what the correct Greek text actually says. Is it possible, McCall asks, that Hölderlin
                  might simply have been making a mistake, supposing that <span class="foreign">ephanito</span> (“had been made invisible”) was a form of the verb <span class="foreign">aphagnidzo</span> (“to render funeral rites to”), which had come up 8 lines earlier (in the word <span class="foreign">kaphgisteusas</span>) and translated by Höldelrin as “<span class="foreign">gefeirt</span>” (given funeral rites)? “The translator,” McCall writes, “Might simply have failed
                  to notice the small difference between a nu (v) and a gamma (y) and thus confused
                  “celebrate with due burial” with “make invisible.”</p>
               <p>“Nichts Feierlichs” (nothing to celebrate) might just be a simple mistake then. But
                  McCall reminds us that Hölderlin’s translations do tend to translate by commenting
                  on themselves, to face up to their own belatedness. Rather, he suggests, <span class="quote">‘“Nichts Feierlichs,’ then, might just be a phrase marking the translator’s real bafflement
                     when faced with the Greek phrase: <span class="foreign">ouden gar ephanisto</span> (“Nothing had been made invisible”). “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>” might well be a critical statement about the unreadability of the original: “There
                     is nothing (here) that is the (possible) object of (my) translation/celebration.”
                     At the moment when something goes wrong in the original (“for how could there <em>not</em> be a celebration”—Hölderlin might have thought—“when this was asserted 8 lines before?”),
                     there does the translator bring in his own “originals,” whose emblematic adjective
                     is “Feierlich”, to celebrate, into the text of translation, but he introduces them
                     in the form of a negation: “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>.”’</span> Hölderlin, McCall suggests, when faced with something unreadable in his text, something
                  <span class="foreign">undenklich</span>, unthinkable, imposes his own emblematic word just at the site of unreadability.
                  The task of the translator—the task of the poet—is achieved, or “given up” in this
                  juxtaposition of <span class="foreign">Nichts</span> (nothing) and <span class="foreign">Feierlich</span> (celebratable): “nothing for which to give burial rights,” and behind it, the giving
                  of burial rights, the dead body to be given its proper respect. Two letters coming
                  together, making contact, McCall thus suggests—or not making contact: nu (v) and gamma
                  (y): so similar and yet so different, touching and yet not touching in Hölderlin’s
                  text. Touching because they are confused with one another, not touching because that
                  confusion of letters, based on the unreadability of their difference, makes the text
                  a blank, a spot of unreadability for Hölderlin—right at the spot of the dead body.
                  Yet this is the place that Hölderlin also, McCall asserts, posits a new poetic figure:
                  <span class="foreign">feiern</span>, to give burial rights to, to celebrate.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><span style="text-decoration:underline">McCall’s</span> speculative reading, I would suggest, must also be read as an allegory, as we attempt
                     to know, or read, in this text before us, what will allow us to have contact with
                     its writer, and how to give proper respect to what is <span class="foreign">undenklich</span>, unthinkable, at the heart of his essay. McCall allegorizes for us, first of all,
                     the work of the later moderns—we who look back upon the Romantics as our past—a past
                     important less for its content, Paul de Man will say in an essay on Wordsworth and
                     Hölderlin, than for the fact that we have experienced it “only in its passing away.”

                     contact, an untranslatable text, for which, it seems “there is nothing to celebrate.”
                     Touching and not touching us, readable and unreadable, humorous and playful, and rigorously
                     attuned to the materiality and randomness of language—Tom’s work tells us, in the
                     face of our own desire either to struggle for contact or to turn away from his death,
                     to put him in his coffin, what Paul de Man once also warned: “True mourning is less
                     deluded. The most <em>it</em> can do is to allow for non-comprehension and enumerate non-anthropomorphic, non-elegiac,
                     non-celebratory, non-lyrical, non-poetic, that is to say, prosaic, or better, <em>historical</em> modes of language power.”
