            <div><em>In memory of Tom McCall</em></div>
            <p>The term “philology” tends to conjure images of dusty manuscripts squinted at by dusty
               professors. It might seem out of place in the discursive haunts of the Frankfurt school,
               broadly understood, whose major concerns were fighting fascism and resisting any number
               of formations and formulations of capitalism—especially of the “late” variety. A discipline
               whose name means something like “the love of words” hardly seems of a piece with such
               intellectual endeavors and their high stakes, both political and social. Something
               of the same suspicion might hold for post-structuralist—and specifically deconstructive—modes
               of analysis that, if undeniably text-based, were and are pervasively concerned with
               matters of difference, power, and institutional force. In both domains, some the “late”
               surprisingly strong appeals are made for or in the name of <em>philology</em>. When Hamlet, at a certain point in the play bearing his name, is asked what he is
               reading, he replies: “Words, words, words” (2.2.192). It’s not a very satisfying answer
               to Polonius who asked him. Perhaps it is even a sign of Hamlet’s perversity, if not
               quite his madness. What matters to Polonius is “matter,” as he makes explicitly, literally
               clear. Something is distinctly amiss when there is, or appears to be, an undue focus
               on words. Yet that is what philology, in the first instance, for better or worse,
               does. It attends to words: their senses, their sequences, even their sounds. In arguing
               for a “return to philology,” Paul de Man contends, only a little polemically, that
               literary analysis does and ought to scrutinize <em>how</em> meaning is produced in advance of any attempt to fix or even just to make sense of
               meaning (25). In its more meaning-oriented disciplinary fellow travelers, literary
               criticism and literary history, this too is often the case. Even historically oriented
               literary criticism—directed to the world outside the text—tends for at least a while
               to dwell, more or less poetically, with words as they are articulated.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Yet when old-school philology did what it does, it moved outward from the literary
                  text to its enveloping historical contexts, centering the text in question in something
                  of a series of concentric circles extending from the author’s life (inner and outer)
                  to his or her immediate literary and historical contexts (history of the pertinent
                  genre, for example, or the grand historical events, forces, or mode of production),
                  zones of more or less settled meaning thought to be formative for the production of
                  the text. What could be more sensible than that? Indeed, such protocols, when well
                  executed, have yielded all kinds of impressive, clarifying results. Think of the grand
                  tradition that goes from Giambattista Vico through Erich Auerbach to Edward Said and
                  beyond. Yet philological analyses prosecuted under this banner often come up short
                  on several counts. To begin with an exemplary lament from a philosopher who earned
                  his livelihood as a classical philologist from a tender age: “Ah, it is a sad story,
                  the story of philology! The disgusting erudition, the lazy, inactive passivity, the
                  timid submission.—Who was ever free?” (Nietzsche 3.325). Friedrich Nietzsche is arguably
                  the inaugurator of a counter-tradition that could be dubbed extreme philology.

                           on the idea and practice of such philology, one could rank Giambattista Vico and Friedrich
                           Schlegel. </span></div>
                  </div> He opined, in the unfinished “untimely meditation” titled “We Philologists,” that <span class="quote">‘The stance of the philologist towards antiquity is apologetic, or else dictated by
                     the view that what our own age esteems highly can likewise be found in antiquity.
                     The correct point of departure, however, is the reverse one, namely, to proceed from
                     an insight into our modern perversity and to look back: then much of what in antiquity
                     had heretofore been rebarbative will appear as profound necessity. (3.325; my translation)’</span> Brushing against the complacent, conservative philology of his time, Nietzsche struck
                  out to set the discipline on its head, as he did spectacularly in his first book, <em>The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music, </em>unleashing the force of the Dionysian for a too Apollonian academic discipline, not
                  just as a topic but as a performance, upending in the process any number of its <span class="foreign">idées fixes</span> and <span class="foreign">idées recues</span>, to say nothing of its guiding values.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf would write a stinging and not simply defensive,
                  much less naïve, critique, branding Nietzsche’s effort “<em>Zukunftsphilologie</em>” (“Future-Philology”)

                  </div> as a way to signify a fanciful relation to antiquity. But it was a charge Nietzsche
                  would in turn brandish as a kind of banner: “People believe philology is at an end—and
                  I believe that it has not yet begun” (325; my translation).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Something of the future Nietzsche envisioned took shape in the thinkers and texts
                  I address in what follows. I track the practice and some of the theory of “extreme”
                  philology, critical texts that occupy a place at the edge of a spectrum of a discipline
                  whose center has tended to be conservative in more ways than one, a discipline dedicated
                  to preserving and honoring classic(al) texts of the past, a discipline often bent
                  on consigning those texts to the past—embalming rather than just preserving—even as
                  it promotes their reading in the present.

                           but sympathetic to any number of Nietzsche’s contentions, see Karl Reinhardt, Glenn
                           Most, and James Porter. For a literally old-school, sharp history of classical philology
                           to the early twentieth century century, see Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. For a recent,

                  </div> The more or less Nietzschean counter-tradition is critical, skeptical, open to the
                  dark side and to the obscurity of texts, willing to admit the limits of its knowledge
                  as well as being not unaware of the pressure philologists in a given present can—and
                  in some sense should—apply to texts of the past.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Not all the philologists or quasi-philologists in this loose counter-tradition share
                           Nietzsche’s politics. Yet even Walter Benjamin, whose politics were usually quite
                           different from Nietzsche’s, invokes favorably the Nietzsche of the Untimely Meditations,
                           especially the second “On the Use and Abuse of History for Life,” which argues for
                           (among other things) a critical history and one directed against “the victors.” For
                           an acute reading of that Nietzsche essay in relation to nineteenth-century German
                           thinking on philology, see Glenn Most.</span></div>
                  </div> Most particularly, the discipline of philology, which is by definition committed to
                  making sense of texts, is, in the hands of these critical philologists, often geared
                  to confronting crucial and definitive moments when texts stop making sense, when philology
                  comes up against its own limits. This sort of stance need not have been and is not
                  in every respect “extreme” but it can come across as such, in contrast to the sometimes
                  sloppy humanist (and often bourgeois) complacency of so much that passes for philological
                  scholarship and understanding.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The readings and reflections I shall focus on from Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno,
                  and Tom McCall are characterized by attention to the complexity and violence of language
                  registered alternately by allegorical readings or simply by dwelling on what exactly
                  the text says, so far as one can know or articulate it. These procedures too can have
                  the force of radicality. The examples singled out cluster around the work of Friedrich
                  Hölderlin, the object of some of the most intense philological work, both practical
                  and theoretical, expended upon any post-classical author. Hölderlin is in this horizon
                  both a special and an exemplary case of a poet to seize on. “Discovered” in a major
                  way only very belatedly, roughly a century after the high-water mark of his creativity,
                  Hölderlin became, after the first good edition of his work by Norbert Hellingrath
                  in the second decade of the twentieth century, a touchstone and a cipher, with his
                  body of work enlisted in any number of struggles: ideological, aesthetic, and philosophical,
                  as Helen Fehervary has charted. One could see him alternately (and mutually exclusively)
                  as a fervent supporter of the French Revolution as well as of the rights of man/citizen
                  or as a harbinger of the “fatherland” to come, destined to take such horrific shape
                  in the era of Hitler. Something of a cultural history of Germany in the long twentieth
                  century could be written by tracking how this one poet was read and fought over left
                  and right by the left and the right, with, say, Georg Lukács, Adorno and Benjamin
                  on the one (left) hand, as it were, and on the “right” hand (including center-right,
                  in political terms) imposing figures such as Max Kommerell, and Martin Heidegger,
                  whose complex, adulatory readings throughout the 1930s and 1940s, including on the
                  theme of the fatherland, were of a piece with any number of tenets of fascist ideology,
                  even if his (non- or anti-mimetic) aesthetic principles bore little relation to the
                  run-of-the-mill Nazi “scholarship” and journalism devoted to the poet.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Kommerell was the author of numerous distinguished essays but also of one notorious
                           book from 1928 called The Poet as Führer in German Classicism (a book Benjamin reviewed
                           with decidedly mixed feelings in “Against a Masterpiece,” [Selected Writings 2.378-385]).
                           He was throughout the 1920s in the inner circle of the (Stefan) George-Circle, having
                           served as George’s secretary for several years and having studied with Friedrich Gundolf.
                           He broke from the circle at the end of the 20s. He became a party member of the NDSAP
                           in 1939.</span></div>
                  </div> The division even marks the two most extensive editions of Hölderlin, with Friedrich
                  Beissner’s so-called <em>Grosse Stuttgarte Ausgabe</em>, begun in the WWII years and supported by the Nazis on one side, and on the other
                  the so-called <em>Frankfurter Ausgabe</em> published beginning in the 1970s by the <em>Roter Stern</em> (Red Star) press, a publisher that wears its left-wing politics on its sleeve. The
                  acme of the right-wing use and abuse of Hölderlin came with the grotesque Nazification
                  of the poet, when tendentious selections of his work were made available to troops
                  in “field editions” by the hundreds of thousands in the Second World War. It seems
                  that any number of Nazis were happy to overlook the likelihood that when Hölderlin
                  said “fatherland” he most often meant Swabia, whose imperial pretensions were zero.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Hölderlin also poses a particular set of problems for philology, old-school and otherwise.
               If one of the main goals of traditional literary understanding is to get at, as far
               as possible, the author’s intention, that task is rendered more precarious than usual,
               given Hölderlin’s real and perhaps also sometimes feigned madness. His late poems
               are often signed “Scardanelli” and he gives a number of these poems, written between
               1806 and 1843, dates such as 1748, 1758, 1676, and, most chillingly, 1940—times when
               he was not by any measure alive. Any number of philologists/literary historians simply
               ascribe these to a period of madness, but dating the onset and severity of madness
               is not an easy thing at the best of times, and more difficult with the patchy records
               of Hölderlin’s life—to say nothing of the difficulty presented by what Paul de Man
               called “the madness of words” (122). Adorno reacts negatively to those who caution
               about the forbidding character of the difficulties of certain literary <em>oeuvres</em> (Georg Trakl, Hölderlin, Franz Kafka): such difficulties are spurs to understanding,
               not signals to throw up one’s hands and abandon all hope. What is more, subjective
               intention, for Adorno, even in the production of first-person lyric poetry, will be
               recognized as largely irrelevant. Philology, old-school and new, is to be mobilized
               but it cannot remain simply old-school.</p>

                     </div> He goes on to specify and to gloss at some length just what he means by philology,
                     a discipline one might think of as already rather circumscribed: <span class="quote">‘It seems to me [. . .] that, like all historical research, philology promises the
                        same joys that the Neoplatonists sought in the asceticism of contemplation, but in
                        this instance taken to the extreme. Perfection instead of consummation, the guaranteed
                        extinction of morality (without smothering its fire). It presents one side of history,
                        or better, one layer of what is historical, for which a person may indeed be able
                        to gain regulative and systematic, as well as constitutive, elementary logical concepts;
                        but the connection between them must remain hidden. I define philology, not as the
                        science or history of language, but as the <em>history of terminology</em> at its deepest level. In doing this, a most puzzling concept of time and very puzzling
                        phenomena must surely be taken into consideration. If I am not mistaken, I have an
                        idea of what you are getting at, without being able to elaborate on it, when you suggest
                        that philology is close to history viewed as a chronicle. The chronicle is fundamentally
                        interpolated history. Philological interpolation in chronicles simply reveals in its
                        form the intention of its content, since its content interpolates history. (176)’</span> One observes how the apparent delimitation of philology—a history <em>only</em> of terminology—nonetheless quickly leads to history in general and to one of its fundamental
                     narrative modes, the chronicle, just by virtue of the fact that one would have to
                     come to terms with terms over and in time. Benjamin is certainly right that the notion
                     of time entailed—elaborated by him elsewhere—is puzzling and he wonders aloud whether
                     his “oracular pronouncements about philology” would be of any use to Scholem (176).
                     One can imagine why Scholem, in a letter that does not survive, might have proposed
                     the chronicle as a historiographical analogue to philology. If the chronicle aims
                     to record in neutral, more or less objective fashion what is pertinent about a historical
                     event or series of events (one notes what is noteworthy, as it were), then it would
                     seem to correspond to philology’s goal of presenting or accounting for all that is
                     significant in a text. Benjamin would much later, in the theses “On the Concept of
                     History” drafted close to the end of his life, posit the chronicle as a model for
                     historiographical plenitude insofar as it does not distinguish between great and small,
                     thus allowing for the redemption, at some future date, of the totality of a given
                     past: <span class="quote">‘The chronicler who narrates events without distinguishing between major and minor

                     </div> Yet in Benjamin’s letter to Scholem of 1921 the chronicle is a rather different matter.
                     Benjamin determines it as “interpolated history,” a kind of intervention of history
                     in history.

                     </div> His model for interpolation, as he explains to Scholem, is the allegorical tale of
                     a miniature woman by Goethe, “Die neue Melusine” (“The new Melusina”), that is inserted
                     into the vast encompassing narrative of <em>Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</em> (<em>Wilhelm Meister’s Journeyman Years</em>). The fact of interpolation—even if the interpolation of a history—suggests an intervention,
                     a construction, not simply the neutral representation of what has happened, even if
                     that is what it “contains.” But the chronicle seems to be, in Benjamin’s conception,
                     representation <em>and</em> intervention, record <em>and</em> event. Benjamin writes to Scholem, after re-reading his correspondent’s (lost) letter:
                     “Chronicle, interpolation, commentary, philology—they all have <em>one</em> nexus” (<em>C </em>176). Each of the items in this series is at one time or other throughout Benjamin’s
                     corpus conceived, via a protocol or almost a habit of thought, as something other
                     than a belated mimetic version of what has preceded it.</p>

                  <p>The insistence on the desirability and inescapability of philology, reflected on so
                     searchingly in 1921, is never really left behind in Benjamin’s work, not even in what
                     turned out to be the last years of his life. When in the 1930’s Benjamin was devoting
                     a good deal of his energy to combating forms of fascism, he saw his massive, unfinished,
                     perhaps un-finishable book on Baudelaire and the Arcades as bound up with that struggle,
                     indeed part and parcel of his political thinking. The status of philology in all this
                     was rather fraught, as became clear in the exchanges between Benjamin and Adorno about
                     the former’s work on Baudelaire. Having eagerly awaited Benjamin’s long-in-the-works
                     work, Adorno, on first reading it, could not conceal his disappointment with what
                     Benjamin had produced, charging it especially with an inattention to <em>mediation</em> in its shuttling—one might say lurching—from the macro-and micro-economic to the works
                     of culture, which Benjamin had thought legible in Baudelaire’s poems and their milieu
                     of production (<em>CC </em>280ff).

                     </div> Countering Adorno’s various charges, Benjamin wrote back the following on December
                     9, 1938: <span class="quote">‘When you speak of a “wide-eyed presentation of mere facts” you are characterizing
                        the proper philological attitude. This had to be embedded in the construction as such
                        and not only for the sake of results. The indifference between magic and positivism
                        must, as you so aptly put it, be liquidated. In other words, the philological interpretation
                        of the author should be preserved and overcome [<em>aufgehoben</em>] in Hegelian fashion by the dialectical materialist. Philology is the examination
                        of a text, which, proceeding on the basis of details, magically fixates the reader
                        on the text. What Faust took home in black and white is closely related to Grimm’s
                        devotion to little things. They have in common that magical element whose exorcism
                        is reserved for philosophy, here to the final part. (<em>C</em> 587)’</span> The allusion to Goethe’s <em>Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy </em>invokes the episode where a student says “<span class="foreign">Denn, was man schwarz auf weiss besitzt,/ Kann man getrost nach Hause tragen</span>” (“What one possesses in black in white, one can take home with confidence [literally,
                     “consoled’]”), a saying that, when spoken in the presence of Mephistopheles, comes
                     across as naïve (lines 1966-67, “Studierzimmer” 2). The student sounds guilty of simply
                     taking the text at its word and partaking of the ethos of the wide-eyed-ness of (a
                     certain) philology. The other reference to the great philologist Jakob Grimm is perhaps
                     apocryphal; nonetheless, Benjamin invokes it at least twice, and one other place he
                     does so is in his essay “Rigorous Study of Art” where he praises this attention to
                     (even) insignificant things as “the spirit of true philology” (<em>SW</em> 2.668). Nothing, in principle, escapes philology, and in this it resembles, once again,
                     the chronicle, the mode of historiography that avoids weighing matters in a balance,
                     distinguishing between great and small, as Benjamin outlines it in the “Theses.” Everything
                     remains to be read, and to be read again, later, otherwise.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In his response to Adorno, what Benjamin conjures with one hand—the magic of philology’s
                  fixation on the text—is spirited away with the other hand, the more or less tight
                  fist of dialectical materialism, though one might not be mistaken in thinking Benjamin
                  wants to have it both ways, especially if we understand the emphasis in “sublated”
                  (“<span class="foreign">aufgehoben</span>”) as indicating preservation. (The term <span class="foreign">aufheben</span> can mean to negate, preserve and/or raise to a higher level, and often in Hegel means
                  all three at once.) Benjamin never had much time for Hegel, but the mechanism of <span class="foreign">Aufhebung</span> was congenial to him as a negatively dialectical concept/figure with affinities to
                  the dynamics of fulfillment or completion so crucial to how he thought culture and
                  history worked. In any event, Benjamin goes on to assuage Adorno on the score of a
                  certain philology’s eventual disappearance: <span class="quote">‘The appearance of closed facticity which attaches to a philosophical investigation
                     and places the investigator under its spell, fades to the extent that the object is
                     construed in an historical perspective. The base lines of this construction converge
                     in our own historical experience. (<em>CC </em>292)’</span> In these lines we glimpse the linkage of (the new, rethought) philology to the outlines
                  of Benjamin’s now familiar but still challenging theory of historical understanding
                  that entails, instead of grand historical, causal narratives, the <em>construction</em> and articulation of two moments: of the knowing and the known, the citing and the
                  cited. If there still is any lingering doubt about the import of philology for Benjamin’s
                  later thinking, one should consider this remarkable, lapidary pronouncement in the
                  drafts to his “Theses on the Concept of History,” which is also to say the theoretical
                  underpinnings of the Arcades project: “The historical method is a philological one”
                  (<em>SW</em> 4.405). Enigmatic in this form, the pronouncement is less so in the larger passage
                  from which it comes: <span class="quote">‘If one wants to consider history as a text, then one can say of it what a recent
                     author says of literary texts—namely, that the past has left in it images, comparable
                     to those registered by a light-sensitive plate. “The future alone has developer at
                     its disposal strong enough to allow the image to appear in all its details. Some pages
                     in Marivaux or Rousseau contain a secret sense, which the contemporary reader could
                     not have deciphered completely.” The historical method is a philological one, whose
                     foundation is the book of the world. “Read what was never written,” says Hofmannsthal.
                     The reader, to be thought of here, is the true historian. (<em>SW</em> 4.405; translation modified).’</span> It’s hard to overestimate how much of Benjamin’s work throughout the 1930s was devoted
                  to figuring out how history works, in general and in kinds and examples of its particulars.
                  It is thus of considerable importance for our understanding of the status of philology
                  in his thinking that he determines the historical method he outlines and practices
                  as a <em>philological</em> one. This seems consistent with his perhaps enigmatic pronouncement to Scholem that
                  philology required one to think through a “puzzling notion of time,” just what Benjamin
                  did from roughly 1920 to 1940. Over time Benjamin gradually crafted a theory of history
                  and its epistemology that stipulated that: <span class="quote">‘Articulating the past historically means recognizing those elements in the past which
                     come together in the constellation of one and the same moment. Historical knowledge
                     is uniquely and only possible in the historical moment. But cognition in the historical
                     moment, however, is always cognition of a moment. Insofar as the past gathers itself
                     together in a moment—in a dialectical image—it enters into the involuntary memory
                     of mankind. (<em>SW</em> 4.403; translation modified)’</span> That historical knowledge only occurs as a relation of one moment to another is one
                  reason why the models for it are reading and citation. Such knowledge is even enacted
                  <em>as</em> history, as the charged examples of revolution make plain: the French Revolution
                  “<em>cited</em>” the Roman one (Thesis XIV) and the revolutionaries of July 1830 reiterated Joshua’s
                  stopping of the sun (Thesis XV), along the lines of what Karl Marx had outlined as
                  revolution’s <span class="foreign">modus operandi</span> in the opening pages of <em>The Eighteenth Brumaire </em>(<em>SW</em> 4.395). It is not just that our knowledge of history is mediated by reading and citation:
                  it is <em>structured</em> as they are, as the encounter in and of a more or less determinate present with a
                  more or less determinate moment in and of the past, of one act of language with another,
                  or of an act of language with something other than language.</p>
               <p>In his response to Adorno on the charge of being too philological, Benjamin introduces
                  some other key categories pertinent to our thinking through the possibilities and
                  parameters of philology, categories that will be crucial for Adorno in his understanding
                  of Hölderlin and for his aesthetic theory in general: <span class="quote">‘If you think of other writings of mine, you will find that a critique of the attitude
                     of the philologist is an old concern of mine, and it is basically identical with the
                     critique of myth. Yet in each case it is this critique that provokes the philological
                     effort itself. To use the language of <em>Elective Affinities </em>[Benjamin’s essay on Goethe’s novel, not the novel itself] it presses for the exhibition
                     of the material content in which the truth content can be historically revealed. (<em>CC </em>292)’</span> Once again, Benjamin appears to have it both ways, defending the philological texture
                  of his Baudelaire work and saying he has long prosecuted a critique of the attitude
                  of the philologist. The inadequacy of some philology requires more, better, different
                  philology. Benjamin rightly invokes his “epoch-making” essay on <em>Elective Affinities</em>: there Benjamin elaborates a theory—adumbrated in the early Hölderlin essay—whereby
                  a work of art possesses both subject matter or material content (<span class="foreign">Sachgehalt</span>) and truth content (<span class="foreign">Wahrheitsgehalt</span>) in a dialectical, historically changing fashion. The effect of time passing is to
                  disentangle or pry apart these two aspects of the work that are conjoined at the moment
                  of production. According to Benjamin, a basic law of literature dictates that: “ [.
                  . .]the more significant the work, the more inconspicuously and intimately its truth
                  content is bound up with its material content.” With that passage of time, however,
                  “truth content always remains to the same extent hidden as the material content comes
                  to the fore” (<em>SW</em> 1.297). Critique, Benjamin maintains, is concerned with the truth content of a work
                  of art and commentary with its subject matter, but it becomes clear that the ideal
                  philologist—and later the historical materialist whose work is modeled on philology—necessarily
                  engages both, not least because the character of the relation between truth content
                  and subject matter alters with every significant change in and over time. Reading,
                  for this reason, is what Benjamin sometimes calls, after the German Romantics, “an
                  infinite task,” even if each and every reading is finite, punctual (<em>SW</em> 4.402).</p>

               <p>Let us turn now to Benjamin’s early (and in his lifetime, unpublished) essay modestly
                  entitled “Two Poems by Friedrich Hölderlin,” dating from the early years of the First
                  World War. It’s not easy to know what to make of this essay, considered by him and
                  others his first major literary study. It appears to have been a highly charged text
                  for him, not least as its subject matter—poems featuring the death of the poet or
                  readiness for death on the part of the poet—is intimately bound up with the then-recent
                  death of his friend, Friedrich Heinle, a poet who committed suicide rather than be
                  conscripted into military service. Yet quite aside from any personal resonance, it
                  is an elusive, oddly textured essay. One paragraph extends for almost five pages.
                  A good deal of it seems almost mystical (Scholem called it “deeply metaphysical” [<em>SW</em> 1. 36]), riddled with epigonal, arch-Goethean language: “inner form,” “innermost,”
                  “quintessence,” and so on. At one point Benjamin even uses the word “mystical” is
                  an apparently approving tone (<em>SW</em> 1.34). The essay was never published in his lifetime, and Benjamin did not return
                  to the central category explored in his text. Almost only readers of Benjamin would
                  do so, one of them being none other than Theodor Adorno.</p>
               <p>At the conceptual center of the essay is a category for which Benjamin had to fashion
                  an unheard-of word or dredge up a forgotten one: “<span class="foreign">das Gedichtete</span>.” It could be rendered as the “poeticized” or “poetized” (Ralph Waldo Emerson’s term,
                  adopted for the Harvard edition) or “poematized” (McCall’s rendition). “<span class="foreign">Das Gedichtete”</span> was, and is, a very unusual term. No less than Goethe used (perhaps coined?) the
                  term, if only in conversation, when he claimed “<span class="foreign">Das Gedichtete behauptet sein Recht, wie das Geschehene</span>” (“The poetized [i.e. what has become poetry] claims its right just as much as what
                  has happened”) but Goethe gives it no technical or special force (22.650). The term
                  seems not have taken hold for about one hundred years and then was invoked fleetingly,
                  though in charged circumstances.</p>
               <p>It is a term that, strikingly, Heidegger would later also invent—or re-invent—decades
                  after Benjamin. For all their massive differences, Benjamin and Heidegger find common
                  ground in this term and for a common reason, namely, a sense that the time-honored
                  metaphysical distinction between form and content seems inadequate to do justice to
                  whatever it is that Hölderlin writes, what he poetizes or poeticizes. Here is how
                  Benjamin characterizes what he, almost for the first time, calls <span class="foreign">das Gedichtete</span>: <span class="quote">‘As a category of aesthetic investigation, the poetized differs decisively from the
                     form-content model by preserving within itself the fundamental aesthetic unity of
                     form and content. Instead of separating them, it distinctively stamps in itself their
                     immanent necessary connection [. . .]. In the unity of form and content [. . .] the
                     poetized shares one of the most essential characteristics with the poem itself. It
                     too is built on the basic law of the artistic organism. It differs from the poem as
                     a limit-concept, as the concept of its task [<span class="foreign">Aufgabe</span>] not simply through some fundamental characteristic but solely through its greater
                     determinability [<span class="foreign">Bestimmbarkeit</span>]; the poetized is a loosening up of the firm functional coherence that reigns in
                     the poem itself, and it cannot arise otherwise than by disregarding certain determinations,
                     so that the meshing, the functional unity of the other elements is made evident. (<em>SW</em> 1.19)’</span> There are other glosses on and identifications of just what “<em>das Gedichtete</em>” is, such as “the synthetic unity of the intellectual and perceptual orders” (19)
                  but it is remarkable in the passage above that is said to be characterized “<em>solely</em> through its determinability” (my emphasis). “Determinability” is of those categories
                  Benjamin so often invokes featuring the suffix “-ability,” a gesture whose consequences
                  Samuel Weber has analyzed in exemplary fashion in <em>Benjamin’s -abilities</em>. Such terms denote the condition of possibility of the realization of “x” rather
                  than its empirical realization. “Determinability” is a term replete with virtuality.
                  As it happens, in the poems Benjamin singles out for scrutiny, the greater presence
                  or absence of determination will be not only a defining structural feature of <em>das Gedichtete</em> but also a value, such that the greater determination of one poem over another will
                  be the very sign of its superiority.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Benjamin uses the phrase “aesthetic commentary” to characterize his undertaking, “commentary”
                     usually having designated (more so in his day than ours) a mode of dealing with a
                     text engaged within the discipline of classical philology. Benjamin’s commentary is
                     in the spirit of what he thinks of as philology “in the expanded field,” one might
                     say, even if here he does not call it philology here.

                              rather than content.</span></div>
                     </div> Benjamin juxtaposes two poems of Hölderlin’s so-called mature period (he was around
                     thirty years old), poems so closely allied that they could be considered “versions”
                     of each other, as they share numerous identical or similar formulations and formal
                     features. The analysis is prosecuted in the mode of immanent critique. We are not
                     informed of any dates, nor given a recognizable historical content or a framework
                     in the history of ideas, nor much that is pertinent from the history of literature
                     or other examples of the genre. Even though “the poeticized” is considered a limit-concept
                     between life and poem, we are alerted that we will learn nothing of the poet’s life.
                     And yet Benjamin’s text, in a way that seems to go beyond quoting, paraphrasing, or
                     mimicking Hölderlin’s, engages “the living,” “the people,” and nothing less than the
                     cosmos. This all could still be understood as immanent criticism, as only having to
                     do with the imaginary of the poem, but when Benjamin repeatedly refers, for example,
                     to “this world” (<span class="foreign">diese Welt</span>) the analysis seems to burst, at moments, the immanent borders it erected in the
                     first place (<em>SW</em> 1.25, 32ff)</p>

                  <p>It is also immanent <em>critique</em> insofar as it allows for and demands judgment or evaluation, <span class="foreign">Beurteilung</span>, even judgment of its truth, which is not necessarily a concern of all philological
                     endeavors. Commentary usually entails going through everything of real significance
                     in a poem, down to, in the spirit of Jakob Grimm, its “details.” Benjamin might be
                     said to have done just that, in a dense twenty or so pages on two short poems. It
                     is literally an essay in “comparative literature,” though within one and the same
                     language, comparing what could be considered two poems with an elective affinity or
                     two versions of the “same” poem. In the confrontation, the first version, “Dichtermut”
                     (“The Poet’s Courage”), emerges as almost systematically lacking in relation to the
                     final version or later poem “Blödigkeit” (“Timidity”). Benjamin not only analyzes
                     but critiques the first version (or the first poem) in terms of its artificial mythologizing,
                     posing the negative category of mythology against what is, for the moment, the far
                     more positive category of myth, the latter implying a certain “inner greatness and
                     structure of the elements” (20).

                     of it deepening the earlier version.

                     literally invokes the category of truth. Whereas the second line of “Dichtermut” reads:

                     of the first: the second articulates the truth that the first failed to, the truth
                     of relationality. It performs its own truth of greater determination. From early on
                     in his thinking Benjamin tended to follow Friedrich Schlegel, the principal author
                     addressed in his dissertation, in his positing that the work of art, of its own accord,
                     called for critique—and that critique was not something accidental that might or might
                     not befall a work of art. The work of art, for which Schlegel’s model was Goethe’s <em>Wilhelm Meister</em>—a highly self-conscious, self-reflexive novel—is a medium of reflection, which is
                     also to say, for Schegel and for Benjamin after him, a medium of self-reflection.
                     Moreover, as self-reflection, the work of art is in some sense the first, more or
                     less encrypted instance of the very critique it calls for. The chain is, in principle,
                     infinite: there is no end to the call for critique. In our case: Hölderlin’s poems
                     demand the critique of a sort that Benjamin delivers, and Benjamin’s text arguably
                     provokes a reading along the lines delivered by Tom McCall.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The power of Tom McCall’s formidable essay “<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.plastic_poetic.html">Plastic Time and Poetic Middles: Benjamin’s Hölderlin</a>” lies in the tenacity with which he tracks the rhetoric and thinking of Benjamin
                  and the rigor with which he articulates the stakes involved. McCall rightly refrains
                  from inscribing Hölderlin, following Benjamin, into a tradition rife with a post-Platonic
                  and quasi-Biblical ethos of inspiration (or its naturalized equivalents, as in Wordsworth)
                  thought to have granted Romantic poetry a good deal of its authenticity and authority.
                  Instead McCall underscores how Hölderlin’s activity operates in the realm of what
                  the poet calls “lawful calculation.” It is governed by what McCall glosses as “a strict,
                  lawful, and rule-governed poetics, with its calculus and quasi-machinal functions”
                  (para. 3). Benjamin proposes, in keeping with such a poetics, a schema of functions
                  and relations that would account for how Hölderlin’s poetry works. As we have seen,
                  the two poems Benjamin elects to compare relate to each other in such a way that the
                  later poem emerges as a deepening, more intense, more determinate version of its predecessor.
                  Indeed, in some sense, its fulfillment: a motif and structure that characterizes a
                  dynamic built into each of Benjamin’s central categories of language, translation,
                  critique, and history.</p>
               <p>In the circumscribed context of Benjamin’s intense study of two short poems, the fulfillment—via
                  greater determination, deepening, and intensification—of one poem in a later one sounds
                  like an unequivocally good thing. That dynamic, is enveloped in a nexus of terms such
                  as “innermost,” “quintessence,” inner form,” all of which articulate aspects of <em>das Gedichtete</em>, the posited unity of form and content, as well as the unity of the intellectual
                  and perceptual orders. What could be better?</p>
               <p>McCall’s essay is tenacious in tracking any number of elements and rhetorical/conceptual
                  moves in Benjamin’s essay that work against any ideal notion of <em>das Gedichtete</em> or the “aesthetic organism” whose inner form it is. Honing in on the middle (<span class="foreign">Mitte</span>) Benjamin posits as organizing the Hölderlin poem which consists of its various “functions,”
                  McCall notes: <span class="quote">‘It is the multiplicity of functions that constitutes Benjamin’s special <span class="foreign">topos</span> of “the <em>Middle</em>” [<span class="foreign">die Mitte</span>] of the poem—which, as “the untouchable middle of all relation” (125), is not the
                     actual stanzaic mid-point of the poem but a conceptual repository for the irreducibly
                     unrecognizable modalities of the signifying process, and for the ultimately undiscoverable
                     relations linking already enacted meanings to their productive “functions.” The Benjaminian
                     <span class="foreign">topos</span> of “the Middle” is the means taken to mark out the way in which both the poem, and
                     the tradition informing it, become aporetic for criticism—no longer simple readable
                     and understandable, but more of a task—when the reading turns on the issue of calculation
                     rather than inspiration and its associated concepts. (para. 8)’</span> In what might sound like a bleak, extreme reformulation of Benjamin’s argument in
                  his reading of Hölderlin, McCall is in effect almost only noting and synthesizing
                  what Benjamin says in various passages and then drawing the consequences. Whereas
                  some readers of Benjamin might focus on the literally central notion of “the middle,”
                  McCall draws our attention to its qualification as “unapproachable” and has us pause
                  over it, not content to proceed to the possibly more satisfying or comforting notion/figure
                  of the middle. Here, and in general, McCall’s essay also has the virtue of tying Benjamin’s
                  analyses back to some of its sources in the poetological writings of Hölderlin, which
                  display an idealist framework and almost stubbornly balanced, dialectical prose that
                  is easy to misread if one emphasizes the play of its master terms and overlooks their
                  complicating qualifications. McCall’s rigor tracks Benjamin’s rigor tracking Hölderlin’s
                  rigor, and the result is that we see what is actually happening in the text.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The complexity of McCall’s analysis is raised a notch or two when he shows how the
                     passage from the “substance” poem of “Dichtermut” to the greater determination of
                     “Blödigkeit” in effect shows that the problematic identified with the posited notion
                     of “the middle” results in the project of a second-order “lyric of criticism”: <span class="quote">‘[. . .] at the “middle” of the poem “the sum-total of all functions” (124) is indeed

                        totality, that such identifications can exist only in the mode of a “task” [<span class="foreign">Aufgabe</span>] to be undertaken again and again, but destined to fail. The unavoidable incompleteness
                        of reading the lyric engenders the construct of “the poematized” [<em>das Gedichtete</em>], a sort of secondary “lyric of criticism” or metapoem abstracted from the actual
                        poem [<span class="foreign">das Gedicht</span>], imposed as a task and existing to make those relation-functions of the poem available
                        to criticism in a more visible and determinate form: “The principle of the poematized

                     poetry as “first philology”), and here we see a brilliant example of McCall extending
                     what in some sense is already present in Benjamin’s essay (“95 Theses” 26-7). By determining
                     the character of poetry as a matter of determinability and casting the latter of the
                     two poems as a matter of greater determination in relation to the first, the latter
                     poem in effect resembles the work of interpretive philology, which likewise consists
                     of articulating relations of greater determination (by deciding on some possibilities
                     and excluding others, even if the decision is to point to an ambiguity).</p>
               </div>
               <p>In the passage above, McCall in effect undermines in advance what could sound like
                  Benjamin’s triumphant proclamation of “the sole sovereignty of relation” that constitutes
                  <em>das Gedichtete</em>. But then here too he is really only following Benjamin’s lead, following Hölderlin,
                  by unpacking what is at stake and calling into question the character of that sovereignty,
                  as he does again in this related passage: <span class="quote">‘For Benjamin, the Hölderlin text is the self-reading (or metacommentary) of the inaccessibility
                     to analysis of its unity functions; the failure of penetration in this self-reading
                     [. . .] becomes the very condition of possibility for the phenomenal unity the poem
                     is able to achieve. The possibility of “materialization” [<span class="foreign">Versachlichung</span>], as of unity itself, arises from the <em>density</em> of relations “at the middle”—a density too “thick” (the <span class="foreign">dicht</span> of “<span class="foreign">Dichtung</span>”) in the interrelations of its functions to be differentiated in criticism. Aesthetic
                     unity depends here, as elsewhere, upon the impossibility of a complete critical disarticulation.
                     This density is associated with a certain “violence” of tragico-mythical relata [.
                     . .] the textual symptom of which is the displayed unity of the lyric. Immanence,
                     the poetic middle, is a function of the violence (forcefulness, density, “thickness”)
                     of those identity relations it harbors; without the closeness and tightness, i.e.
                     violence, of relations, there would be no (“untouchable”) immanence. (para. 17)’</span> The great theme of so many of Tom McCall’s essays—the violence of language, the violence
                  of the aesthetic—is elucidated here apropos the category at the center of Benjamin’s
                  essay, <em>das Gedichtete</em> as the “untouchable middle.” This phantom middle is said by Benjamin to be a “product
                  [<span class="foreign">Erzeugnis</span>] and object [<span class="foreign">Gegenstand</span>]” (<em>SW</em> 1.19) of the analysis, one more way in which the constructed (non-natural) synthetic
                  unity of the poem is like the philological project that will attempt to understand
                  it, with the task, the <span class="foreign">Aufgabe</span>, of philology responding to and in some sense repeating the task of the poem.</p>

                  <p>The specter of “<em>das Gedichtete</em>” surfaces again in Theodor Adorno’s late, formidable essay “Parataxis: On Hölderlin’s
                     Late Poetry.” Despite being a voracious reader of literature and much else, Adorno
                     could hardly be called a philologist. In responding to Adorno’s rather severe critique
                     of his work on Baudelaire, Benjamin opened one of his letters with the decidedly testy
                     line: “<span class="foreign">On est philologue ou on ne l’est pas</span>” (“Either one is a philologist or one is not”) (<em>C</em> 596). Yet this non-philologist, Adorno, whose writings on literature account for about
                     1/20<sup>th</sup> of his published work, and an equally small portion of the <span class="foreign">Nachlass</span>, comes to write about Hölderlin some fifty years after Benjamin’s essay on the poet,
                     and is clearly in his old and older friend’s debt. Adorno’s essay originated as an
                     address before the Hölderlin Society (<span class="foreign">Hölderlin-Gesellschaft</span>), which is to say, before an audience filled mainly with (modern) philologists.

                     </div> Adorno begins by acknowledging the many advances in the understanding of Hölderlin
                     via philology in the narrow and broad senses. Indeed, remarkable strides had been
                     made since, say, Nietzsche only had access to Hölderlin’s work in partial, unsatisfactory
                     fashion and when extended commentary on the poet’s corpus was almost non-existent.

                              “Brod und Wein’:ein exegetischer Versuch by Emil Petzold, a high school teacher.</span></div>
                     </div> But already in the opening paragraph, Adorno challenges what would have been axiomatic
                     for a good many in his audience: “The difficulty of these authors does not prohibit
                     interpretation so much as demand it. According that axiom, knowledge of literary works
                     would consist in the reconstruction of what the author intended. But the firm foundation
                     philology imagines it possesses has proved unstable” (“Parataxis” 109). Against the
                     pervasive tendency of philology to take authorial intention as a basis for guiding
                     interpretation, Adorno argues that “What unfolds and becomes visible in the works,
                     the source of their authority, is none other than the truth manifested objectively
                     in them, the truth that consumes the subjective intention and leaves it behind as
                     irrelevant” (110). Whereas this may be true in general, Adorno is interested in registering
                     its consequences in the vexed case of Hölderlin, for whom the subject has a special,
                     historically constituted status, not least for his singular (but in some respects,
                     not-so-singular) relation to language.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The “starting-point” for philology, Wilamowitz-Moellendorff contended in his history
                  of the discipline, is “a feeling of wonder in the presence of what we do not understand”
                  [“<span class="foreign">das Verwundern über das Unverstandene</span>”] (1). Adorno recognizes, as we noted above, that philology has proved itself capable
                  of putting us in a position to understand some texts and things better, and yet that
                  there are limits to that philological understanding even or especially regarding what
                  is arguably the most essential: <span class="quote">‘What philological explanation is compelled to clear out of the way nevertheless fails
                     to disappear from what first Benjamin and later Heidegger called “<em>das Gedichtete</em>,” that which has been composed poetically. This moment, which eludes the grasp of
                     philology, inherently demands interpretation. It is the moment that is obscure in
                     literary works, not what is thought in them, that necessitates recourse to philosophy.
                     (“Parataxis” 111-12)’</span> Adorno, who would have been among the first to read Benjamin’s unpublished essay,
                  invokes the notion of <em>das Gedichtete</em>, the poetized, as if it is an apt, useful category in thinking through Hölderlin.
                  In it, Adorno too sees a category that helps to overcome clunky distinctions of form
                  and content which he finds, unsurprisingly, not to have been thought through in sufficiently
                  (read, negatively) dialectical fashion. Yet unlike Benjamin, for whom the analysis
                  of <em>das Gedichtete</em> is the endpoint of the analysis, for Adorno the provocation for poetry and the poeticized
                  demand translation into philosophy. For Benjamin, as we saw, the dynamics of each
                  of language, translation, critique, and history demanded that any given entity be
                  thought in terms of translation and even fulfillment. Adorno specifies in no uncertain
                  terms that it is philosophy that is to come to terms with poetry, since poetry and
                  philosophy have a common object in <em>truth content</em>. But not just <em>any</em> philosophy or philosophical approach—Adorno’s essay features a stinging critique
                  of Heidegger as a reader of Hölderlin, in the same spirit as <em>The Jargon of Authenticity</em>, but here attack is more pointed. Though Heidegger can surely be admired for the
                  seriousness with which he takes Hölderlin’s poetry, Adorno sees him as making some
                  arch-philological and arch-philosophical errors in explicating Hölderlin—not least
                  in rendering him too philosophical—by focusing on what is enunciated as if it were
                  articulated in the mode of statements, <span class="foreign">Aussagen</span>. Certainly Hölderlin’s poetry is riddled, to an unusual degree, with quasi-philosophical
                  dicta such as “<span class="foreign">Es ereignet sich aber das Wahre</span>” (“But what is true emerges”) and the like. To Adorno’s mind, Heidegger, in his zeal
                  to enlist Hölderlin’s judgments on this or that matter of content (the fatherland,
                  truth, etc.) tends to sacrifice form and language, with all its complicated configurations,
                  such that Hölderlin’s poetry appears sometimes reduced to a series of more or less
                  debatable sayings or positions.</p>
               <p>The understanding of Hölderlin, however, is helped partly by Heidegger in taking up,
                  independently, the very category Benjamin too had stumbled on or had been forced to
                  invent. Adorno acknowledges the possibilities it affords for thinking through Hölderlin,
                  even as he does something a little different than either of his forerunners. As he
                  says in the following remarkable footnote: <span class="quote">‘The concretization of the poetic substance (<em>das Gedichtete</em>), a desideratum which Hölderlin too experienced as binding—his whole mature work
                     asks mutely how it is possible for a poetry that has shaken off the illusion of the
                     close at hand to become concrete—takes place only through language. The function of
                     language in Hölderlin qualitatively outweighs the usual function of poetic language.
                     If his poetry can no longer trust naively either to the poetically chosen word or
                     to living experience, it hopes to attain bodily presence through the constellation
                     of words and in fact from a constellation that is not satisfied with the form of the
                     logical judgment. As a unity, the latter levels out the multiplicity that lies within
                     the words; Hölderlin is after connection, which allows words, which are condemned
                     to abstractness, to sound, as it were, again. The first strophe from “Brod und Wein”
                     (“Bread and Wine”) is paradigmatic for this and extraordinarily effective. It does
                     not restore the simple, general words it uses but instead links them to one another
                     in a manner that reworks the strangeness proper to them (<span class="foreign">ihre eigene Fremdheit</span>), their simplicity, which is already an abstract quality, to make it an expression
                     of alienation (<span class="foreign">Entfremdung</span>). Such constellations have moved across into the paratactic, even where parataxis
                     does not emerge fully in the grammatical form or the construction of the poem. (339-340,
                     trans. modified)’</span> What Heidegger neglected, from Adorno’s vantage, was the texture of Hölderlin’s verse,
                  its rhetoric writ small and large: that includes the status of words (Hölderlin’s
                  odd abstractions that are nonetheless not usually philosophical), but even more the
                  signature stylistic/grammatical form of parataxis that gives Adorno’s essay its title.
                  In the hands of most writers and in the midst of many texts, parataxis is one figure
                  among others; yet clearly, for Hölderlin, parataxis—the sequencing of words and phrases
                  without logical connectors (and, though, if, etc.)—is no longer a strictly localized
                  figure of speech or thought, but a more pervasive trait informing how all units of
                  the poem do or not hang together (to translate a little too literally the German <span class="foreign">zusammenhängen</span>). In Hölderlin’s hands parataxis is pushed to point of challenging logic as such.
                  It is all the more so when combined with the self-conscious exploitation of inversion
                  (Longinus’ paradigm for sublime, anti-natural rhetoric) that “intensifies the violence
                  done to language” (136). Adorno continues: <span class="quote">‘Whether intentionally on Hölderlin’s part or simply by the nature of things, this
                     occasioned the sacrifice of the period [verse paragraph], to an extreme degree. Poetically,
                     this represents the sacrifice of the legislating subject itself. It is in Hölderlin,
                     with that sacrifice, that the poetic movement unsettles the category of meaning for
                     the first time. (136)’</span> This last is an astonishing claim, spelling the most serious sort of challenge for
                  philology, whose mission is usually predicated on the undoubted possibility of meaning,
                  even if sometimes recognized as hard to ascertain. This disruption adds to the complexity
                  of what is occasioned by Hölderlin’s practice, as outlined in the penultimate passage
                  from Adorno quoted above regarding <em>das Gedichtete</em>. It’s easy not to notice, but also hard to process Adorno’s claim about the strangeness,
                  the foreignness proper to words. In that passage one is almost lulled into thinking
                  by Adorno’s phrasing that he is about to say something closer to the opposite: is
                  not “properness” proper to words? Instead he insists that strangeness (<span class="foreign">Fremdheit)</span> is proper (<span class="foreign">eigen</span>) to them. Adorno was the author of two essays explicitly devoted to what he and we
                  tend to call “foreign” words (“On the Use of Foreign Words” and “Words from Abroad”).
                  The latter of these was a response to complaints registered about a radio address
                  he had given, an address peppered with occasional foreign words and phrases, something
                  that irked sections of his German-speaking audience. Adorno, who once opined in <em>Minima Moralia</em> that “German words of foreign derivation are the Jews of language” (110) offered
                  a spirited defense of these alien terms, these verbal Jews, invoking for his cause
                  Walter Benjamin, whose well-known theory of translation calls for translations to
                  mark themselves as foreign and not simply to dissolve into the so-called target language,
                  as if pretending one is not translating. In his <em>One-Way Street</em> (<em>Einbahnstrasse</em>) Benjamin had compared the polyglot man of letters to a surgeon who performs a difficult
                  operation on his idea and in doing so inserts “a foreign term as a silver rib” into
                  the idea, that is, something artificial or inorganic that nonetheless makes the patient
                  all the stronger when the organic rib was doing quite the opposite (<em>SW</em> 1.476). The startling thing about Adorno’s note on Hölderlin’s “poetic substance”
                  is that he is claiming that all words are foreign words. Hölderlin’s procedures restore
                  the original impropriety of words, the proper, if radical, impropriety, as it were,
                  masked by the seeming native or organic or non-foreign character of words as they
                  so often appear to so-called “native” speakers. The precarious movement of language
                  renders virtually everything a matter of transport, of metaphor, of translation. It
                  is no wonder, we are told, that on the occasion of Adorno’s address to the Hölderlin
                  society, some gasped, some got up and left.</p>

               <p>The work of Tom McCall inscribes itself in the tradition of “extreme philology” (with
                  particular and indeed the utmost attention to Hölderlin) or at the very least a philology
                  sensitive to the extremities of texts. We have already seen how McCall tracks and
                  deepens this sort of analysis in his reading of Benjamin reading Hölderlin. In coming
                  to a close, I want to highlight some aspects of McCall’s most direct engagements with
                  Hölderlin, readings that rival in their intensity and perspicacity the achievements
                  of his illustrious predecessors. </p>
               <p>McCall concentrates on Hölderlin’s notoriously eccentric translations of Sophocles,
                  as powerful as they are problematic. He sees in them much more than a failed attempt
                  by a poet on the cusp of madness and with a less-than-perfect grasp of ancient Greek
                  struggling with the local difficulties of translating two of the most imposing tragedies
                  in the canon. They are a performance of and reflection on the vexed historical and
                  linguistic relations obtaining between a modern German and an ancient Greek, a bridge
                  over something that Walter Benjamin, not for nothing, specified as abyssal. In his
                  famous essay on “The Task of the Translator,” Benjamin had contended that translations
                  were characterized by the “looseness” or the “fleeting” relation to the meaning of
                  the originals, for which the paradigm is Hölderlin’s project on Sophocles: <span class="quote">‘Confirmation of this as well as of every other important aspect is supplied by Hölderlin’s
                     translations, particularly those of the two tragedies of Sophocles. In them the harmony
                     of the languages is so profound that sense is touched by language only the way an
                     aeolian harp is touched by the wind [. . .]. Hölderlin’s translations in particular
                     are subject to the enormous danger inherent in all translations: the gates of a language
                     thus expanded and modified may slam shut and enclose the translator with silence.
                     Hölderlin’s translations from Sophocles were his last work; in them meaning plunges
                     from abyss to abyss until it threatens to become lost in the bottomless depths of
                     language. (<em>SW</em> 1.262)’</span> One of the surprising turns in the passage is the movement from what is plausibly
                  the “enormous danger” associated with Hölderlin’s work on Sophocles—on the brink of
                  madness—to the claim that such “enormous danger” is not only possible more generally
                  but “inherent in all translations.” Benjamin invokes a Hölderlinian phrase “from abyss
                  to abyss” in the act of suggesting that there is something exemplary about the counter-exemplary
                  translations by Hölderlin. They expose what is always already at stake.</p>

                  <p>Hölderlin’s translations were often understood, perhaps because of the combination
                     of madness and bad Greek, to be unduly literal renditions of Sophocles, or at least
                     their <span class="foreign">Wörtlichkeit</span>, as Benjamin stresses, a term usually translated as “literality” (indeed, one of
                     its senses) but which also can denote the character of being “word-for-word,” thus
                     also a matter of syntax. Tending to take, by and large, the word as the unit to be
                     translated, rather than the more usual (at least now) option of the sentence, Hölderlin
                     produces versions that are faithful (aside from errors!) at one level, but “monstrous”
                     (the word is Benjamin’s [<em>SW </em>1.260]) at another, because the word-for-wordness of the translation results in a
                     distinctly strange German text, verging on un-German.

                  <p>Something of the texture and power of McCall’s reading of Hölderlin’s procedure can
                     be registered by following his analysis of one of the famous locutions: Hölderlin’s
                     rendition of Zeus as, astonishingly, “<span class="foreign">Vater der Zeit</span>” (“father of time”). (What follows is part McCall, part my extrapolation or gloss

                     </div>) McCall understandably wonders why a virtually pure transliteration of the Greek
                     name Ζεύς as the German <em>Zeus</em> would not be a perfectly good, obvious choice, the identity of the two names being
                     bolstered by the familiarity with Zeus as a Greek god for any educated German. Here
                     what would get “lost in translation” would seem to be as minimal as can be. Moreover,
                     as McCall recalls, normally proper names stand outside the domain of units of language
                     that require translation. If anything need not be translated—and indeed resists translation—it
                     would be the proper name. At most, there is sometimes a transposition of some letters,
                     substituting the equivalents or near equivalents between the languages. And one might
                     think that in the translation of the name of a <em>god</em>, one should interfere as little as possible. Not only does Hölderlin not reproduce
                     the name literally, letter by letter, in German, he switches the category from proper
                     name to common noun, or a phrase made up of common nouns. Eschewing the obvious and
                     easy translation, Hölderlin opts for a charged, resonant and allegorizing “name” that
                     is hardly a name, indeed something closer to an epithet or gloss. McCall notes: “Holderlin’s
                     example undoes a fundamental linguistic distinction and shows that even the god—that
                     most proper of all entities—has to be re-denominated again and again, in a rhetorical
                     movement which we will be aligning with allegory” (“Wrathful Translation” para. 7).
                     “Father of time” renders, improperly, “Zeus,” providing a figuration where none seemed
                     required. Of the possible determinations of Zeus (from among all his characteristics
                     or attributes) Hölderlin singles out “father of time”—which is not just any identity
                     when it comes to translation and, for that matter, tragedy. It is in and through time
                     that Zeus becomes the “father of time.” The intervention of time makes Zeus appear
                     as the “father of time,” as the engenderer of time, the agent of the victory of the
                     Olympians over the Titans.

                              from nature. One way to conceive of this is that art, as the break from or with nature,
                              marks the beginning of time. </span></div>
                     </div> Zeus made possible his ultimate translation, in the fullness of time, as “father or
                     time.” The father of time is all the more just that, in and after (some) time, retroactively.
                     But how does this work as a translation? If Zeus is the “father of time” is that not
                     included, as it were, in the name Zeus? Why render him in just that and only that
                     way? It is at once more specific and more reductive to call Zeus “father of time.”
                     It makes explicit and allegorical what was only one aspect to which the name Zeus
                     possibly referred. Time is the very medium in which Zeus transforms and in such a
                     way that it renders it necessary or plausible for Hölderlin to (re)name Zeus “father
                     of time.”</p>

                     Sophoclean tragedies (both <em>Oedipus Tyrannos</em> and <em>Antigone</em>), namely the <span class="foreign">reissende </span>(tearing) texture of time. Following the famous analysis of the caesura, the counter-rhythmical
                     interruption required to balance the two unequal “halves” of each tragedy—a caesura
                     paradoxically featuring the appearance of the “pure word” such that representation
                     as such appears, in each play, in the oracular speeches of Tiresias—Hölderlin comments
                     on the wrath of Oedipus that takes the form of his relentless desire to know: <span class="quote">‘Hence, afterwards, in the scene with Creon, the suspicion: because an ungovernable

                     in opposite directions—<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">can be read at length in this volume</a>. Here I want only to call attention to the motif of “tearing” (“<span class="foreign">reissend</span>”) that McCall emphasizes and boldly translates as “lacerating.” The tragic hero here
                     follows time in its tearing, its rending, its lacerating. Oedipus tears, rends. This
                     tearing is part and parcel with, and partly the result of, Oedipus’ wrathful and “foolishly
                     wild search for consciousness” (321). The fragile unity of Oedipus’ consciousness
                     is torn apart via his own search for the identity of the man who caused the plague
                     plaguing Thebes, an unnecessary error, from Hölderlin’s vantage, insofar as Oedipus
                     interpreted Tiresias’ oracle “too infinitely” by paradoxically limiting the cause
                     to a single man when the oracle specified nothing of the kind. Oedipus interpreted
                     too broadly by narrowing in on the single man that will turn out to be none other
                     than himself. The search-and-destroy mission, which takes the form of knowing and
                     interpreting, unfolds all too quickly. As McCall notes in typically witty fashion: <span class="quote">‘[. . .] in the “baroque” translations of Greek tragedy (such as Hölderlin’s Sophocles),
                        allegory occurs at allegro pace; its sense are played out so fast—made and unmade
                        so often—that the text serves as a metacommentary on its own acts of sense-making,
                        and stages, beyond itself, the genesis and erasure of sense itself. (“Wrathful Translation”
                        para. 32) ’</span> It’s not a matter of indifference that Hölderlin names Zeus “father of time” in a
                     play, a dramatic tragedy that unfolds in time, and not just in any way, as McCall
                     makes clear. A tragedy is one of a small number of kinds of literary works that, insofar
                     as it is performed, can’t be stopped. One can’t put it down. The familiar tragic thematics
                     of fate and inevitability are rendered all the more forceful when unfolding in a headlong,
                     allegro allegory such as <em>Oedipus Tyrannos</em>. Time tears, lacerates in almost real time as it brings mythical, dynastic, <span class="foreign">longue-durée</span> forces to a head. The tearing in time ultimately rends and renders the tragic sufferer
                     out of time altogether: <span class="quote">‘He steps into the path of fate as the guardian of the natural power which tragically
                        removes man from his orbital of life, the very mid-point of his inner life, to another
                        world, and tears (<span class="foreign">reisst</span>) him off into the eccentric orbit of the dead. (<em>EL </em>318)’</span> Moreover, the spectators of this spectacle—even if death is beyond vision—are in their
                     turn torn or, as McCall would have it, lacerated. As Hölderlin remarks: <span class="quote">‘Hence in the chorus of the <em>Oedipus</em>, the lamenting and peaceful and religious elements, the pious lie (<em>If I am a soothsayer</em>, etc.), and the sympathy to the point of complete exhaustion towards a dialogue which,
                        in its angry sensitivity, will tear apart the souls of these very listeners. (324)’</span> Often one imagines the audience as the survivors of tragedy, who may or may not be
                     mirrored by characters within the play, along the lines of the chorus in so many Athenian
                     tragedies or of a Horatio to an expired Hamlet. Yet here not even the audience escapes
                     being torn apart. Hölderlin, as McCall recalls, contends that the very words of Sophoclean
                     tragedy are “deadly”—not just that they are about death. At every level, Hölderlin’s
                     tragic translations oscillate between the making and what McCall terms the erasure
                     of sense.“Everything,” Hölderlin posits in the remarks on <em>Oedipus</em>, “is speech against speech, which mutually cancel each other out” (323).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Philology is, in the very fabric of its being, dedicated to making sense of texts.
                  In the extreme case of Hölderlin, who is at the same time exemplary, philology confronts
                  literature in the act of unmaking sense even as much as it makes sense(s). Such philology
                  requires extreme measures to respond, in this case, to the Hölderlin translations
                  that McCall judiciously calls “critical.” In this the translations are not fundamentally
                  different from Hölderlin’s poetic works—works that are themselves sensibly understood
                  as what Hamacher calls “first philology.” In his grand endeavor McCall exemplifies
                  the sort of philosophically informed philology practiced by thinkers, such as Adorno
                  and Benjamin, not prone to smooth over difficulties of texts in order to encompass
                  them in some overarching discourse that makes eminently good sense. To make perfect
                  sense of Hölderlin: that way madness lies.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Among the possible precursors in critical philology together with (critical) reflections
               on the idea and practice of such philology, one could rank Giambattista Vico and Friedrich
               Schlegel. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">In many respects the discipline is clearly defined, at least in institutional terms,
               but for a searching argument on how it is difficult or impossible to delimit “philology”
               see Hamacher. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">An English translation of Wilamowitz-Moellendorff’s attack can be conveniently located
               <a class="link_ref" href="http://fordham.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=phil_babich">here</a>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">For first-rate accounts of the ethos and attitude of classical philology from “within”
               but sympathetic to any number of Nietzsche’s contentions, see Karl Reinhardt, Glenn
               Most, and James Porter. For a literally old-school, sharp history of classical philology
               to the early twentieth century century, see Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. For a recent,
               thorough account of Nietzsche’s philology and its relation to his contemporaries,
               see Christoph Benne. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Not all the philologists or quasi-philologists in this loose counter-tradition share
               Nietzsche’s politics. Yet even Walter Benjamin, whose politics were usually quite
               different from Nietzsche’s, invokes favorably the Nietzsche of the <em>Untimely Meditations</em>, especially the second “On the Use and Abuse of History for Life,” which argues for
               (among other things) a critical history and one directed against “the victors.” For
               an acute reading of that Nietzsche essay in relation to nineteenth-century German
               thinking on philology, see Glenn Most.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Kommerell was the author of numerous distinguished essays but also of one notorious
               book from 1928 called <em>The Poet as Führer in German Classicism</em> (a book Benjamin reviewed with decidedly mixed feelings in “Against a Masterpiece,”
               [<em>Selected Writings</em> 2.378-385]). He was throughout the 1920s in the inner circle of the (Stefan) George-Circle,
               having served as George’s secretary for several years and having studied with Friedrich
               Gundolf. He broke from the circle at the end of the 20s. He became a party member
               of the NDSAP in 1939.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">The next few pages on Benjamin rework material addressed in an earlier, differently
               focused essay of mine, “The Philosophy of Philology and the Crisis of Reading: Schlegel,
               Benjamin, de Man” (2010). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">See Thomas Schestag’s “Interpolationen: Benjamins Philologie” on Benjamin’s tendency
               to move from the small to the smallest in strangely apocalyptic fashion. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">For a superb set of reflections on the chronicle as interpolation, and more generally,
               for the status of interpolation for Benjaminian philology, see “Interpolationen: Benjamins
               Philologie.” </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">In a very fine analysis of the essay, and the fullest that we have, Alexander Honold
               is likely right to maintain that Benjamin’s project is “<span class="foreign">weniger philologisch als aesthetisch</span>” (“less philological than aesthetic”) (53), though that is partly a matter of texture
               rather than content.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">Across the spectrum of Benjamin’s diverse works the valence of the term “myth” can
               be charged as positive, negative, or neutral. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">McCall rightly notes the latter as an example of Hölderlin’s signature periphrasis
               (para. 18). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">For a painstaking analysis of the grand distinction between the two texts as examples
               of a “substance poem” and a “function poem,” see Peter Fenves. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">Readers coming to Benjamin’s essay from outside the German philosophical tradition
               might be surprised by the emphasis on truth, but such emphasis is virtually a constant
               in German aesthetic theory in Friedrich Schelling, G.W.F. Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger,
               Benjamin, Adorno, and more. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note19"><span class="noteLabel">19. </span><span class="noteBody">For an illuminating, thorough account of the occasion of the address and the polemical
               character of essay (written largely contra Heidegger), see Robert Savage, <em>Hölderlin after the Catastrophe: Heidegger—Adorno—Brecht</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note20"><span class="noteLabel">20. </span><span class="noteBody">There are exceptions to the rule, such as the astonishing monograph from 1896 <em>Hölderlins “Brod und Wein’</em>:<em>ein exegetischer Versuch</em> by Emil Petzold, a high school teacher.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note21"><span class="noteLabel">21. </span><span class="noteBody">The volume of the Frankfurt edition of the translations produces an interlinear version
               of the Greek text and a German one (not identical to Hölderlin’s, which is on the
               opposite page), which permits one to gauge the relative word-for-wordness of Hölderlin’s
               versions. See <em>Sämtliche Werke </em>of Hölderlin.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note23"><span class="noteLabel">23. </span><span class="noteBody">Hölderlin’s short ode “Natur und Kunst oder Saturn und Jupiter” (“Nature and Art or
               Saturn and Jupiter”) aligns, allegorically, Jupiter/Zeus with art and its difference
               from nature. One way to conceive of this is that art, as the break from or with nature,
               marks the beginning of time. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note23_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
