            <p>Ancient tragedy cuts deeply into the multidisciplinary span of concerns that make
               up critical theory in our time. Even without us seeming to foist our critical frameworks
               upon it indiscriminately, classical Athenian tragedy, on its own terms, fully engages
               the tensions that have defined nineteenth and twentieth-century critical traditions—traditions
               which could be said, broadly, to turn on the disjunction between the arbitrariness
               of signs, on the one hand, and the deep embeddedness of meanings in their historical
               traditions, on the other. When it comes to evaluating the wary modern translation
               of a Greek tragedy, virtually every major critical movement of the last two centuries
               may be brought into play. Entire traditions (such as “the humanities”) depend upon
               translations: by bringing disparate languages and national literatures into relations
               of continuity, such traditions forge their changing identities through the construction
               of constantly reinvented and retranslated pasts. Yet cultural institutions, like human
               consciousness, are highly selective, incorporating into themselves only what ensures
               the continuities of their own discourses. The same principle of selection operates
               at the micro-levels of individual translations. It is easy to underestimate what must
               go unnoticed if that text called “translation” is to do its work: concealments such
               as the myriad linguistic differences between target and source languages, their disparate
               idioms, and their heteromorphous grammatical modes and lexical features.</p>
            <p>In 1804 Friedrich Holderlin published his famous translations of Sophocles, <em>Antigonä</em> and <em>Ödipus der Tyrann</em>. Although notoriously free and often incorrect by scholarly criteria, these famous
               translations nonetheless emphasize something common to all translations but mostly
               hidden by all. By virtue of their literary qualities and charged thematics, Hölderlin’s
               translations can make legible translative differences which other, more correct or
               “sober” translations conceal. His translations repeat the original, but repeat it
               <em>in style</em>; they upstage it in a subversive repetition that seems to reverse chronological order
               and suggest how originals may be created through their translations. After all, what
               is a “Sophocles,” an “ancient Greek tragedy,” an “Oedipus,” if not a congeries of
               textual effects created through a certain text in front of the reader, a text that
               imparts a tone, a sense, a style “of Sophocles,” or “ancient tragedy”? Whatever a
               “Sophocles” is, it is only by virtue of that text (recalled to memory or physically
               before one) “now,” in the contemporaneous present. Even a Sophocles reading the original
               could only come to know his work through a textual present—in his case, a fifth-century
               BCE Athenian artistic amalgam of tragic, lyric, epic, legal and philosophical dictions.
               In Hölderlin’s translations, the imprint of this specific historico-linguistic time
               of the now (of reading and writing) is especially legible. As we will see in the last
               section of this essay, his translations construct time quite self-consciously through
               the stylistic figure of “voice.”</p>
            <p>Through their own stylistic features, the Sophocles translations thus impart a sense
               of their own constructedness as translations, a sense for the way in which originals
               are reconstituted retroactively as the verbal effect of a certain style and genre
               (namely, “translation”), the sense of what they bring, linguistically and historically
               speaking, into the text in order to give it—for the contemporary—the force of the
               original. Along with his contemporaries Tieck, Novalis and the Schlegels, Hölderlin
               recognized that a translation reproduces the dynamics of interpretation, so making
               readable the assumptions, inbred values, and linguistic devices which cohere into
               acts of signification—such assumptions and values which may attend the original, but
               which more properly, more surely, are constituents of the translation discourse itself,
               and which only by means of an insensible and secondary ascription of them back onto
               the original text can seem to derive primarily from it.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Indeed, after the Hölderlin translations of Pindar and Sophocles, the sober, straightforward
                  or “faithful” translation begins to look a little more illicit, as the following example
                  will show. “We must present the myth more conclusively” (<em>Sämtliche Werke: Frankfurter Ausgabe </em>415).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>“Wir müssen die Mythe nemlich überall beweisbarer darstellen.” Except for this translation,
                           which is from Pfau’s collection, all translations from the “Notes” are mine. Sämtliche
                           Werke: Frankfurter Ausgabe will hereafter be abbreviated FHA. </span></div>
                  </div> So runs one of the hieroglyphic statements in the “Notes to Antigone,” a commentary
                  appended by Hölderlin to his translation of that play. The “Notes” go on to provide
                  an example: “Zeus” should be translated “Father of Time” [<em>Vater der Zeit</em>] or “Father of Earth” [<em>Vater der Erde</em>]. Instead of the straightforward and (to all but Hölderlin) unobjectionable transliteration
                  of “Zeus” for <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*zeu%2Fs&amp;la=greek&amp;can=*zeu%2Fs0">Ζεύς</a>, the metaphorical paraphrase would enliven the bare proper name “in order to bring
                  it closer to our mode of representation” (<em>Werke und Brief </em>789). By putting on display the way in which the foreigner’s myth is appropriated
                  through the particular mechanisms of one’s own historico-linguistic modes of representation,
                  by showing the way in which the dead (“positive”) forms of the foreigner are “made
                  to speak” through the figural devices of the target language, the critical or self-reflexive
                  translation would foreground its own mythic emblems, thus offering the possibility
                  of a self-reading of its own sense-making. If the original is shown to depend upon
                  the particular historical and linguistic representational modes of the translator’s
                  language, the rendition of the original is shown to depend upon a <em>metaphor</em>—upon one metaphor (one myth) or another. The point here is less the rich thematic
                  meaning and dense polysemy of “<em>Vater der Zeit</em>” than the way in which such “wild” rhetorical swerves in the Hölderlinian translation
                  begin, after several readings, to hint at a heretofore unsuspected kindred rhetorical
                  violence that lurks in the most “sober” and referentially correct of translations
                  as well; the sober translation may be just as wild (“drunken”) but, by virtue of a
                  certain longstanding intellectual tradition of imbibing, can appear to be felicitous.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This manner of self-conscious presentation through which a translation displays its
               <em>modus operandi</em> is, in fact, not so unusual: as the material record of all the linguistic decisions
               made to render an alien text, any translation can be read as the metacommentary of
               its own acts of interpretation. If the translation itself could explain this point,
               it might say something like this: “What you are reading is, of course, the right translation;
               but, at the same time, it is also the logbook of all those choices I had to make in
               my own particular rendering of the original, a rendering that is necessarily circumscribed
               by my language, history, interpretative wariness.” Here, as elsewhere, translation
               is a performative (simulation) of the translated meaning—just as much as it is the
               (semantic) translation of that meaning, the two modes being, in fact, hard to differentiate.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Let us think of the original text as a dense mass of linguistic features: a complex
                  of amalgamated phonemes and morphemes, an interactive network of grammatical and rhetorical
                  forms, a language conglomerate whose semantic and syntactical devices can join and
                  disjoin in ways that are uniquely specific to that language. The idiosyncratic, self-conscious
                  style of Hölderlin’s translations reminds the reader that the original is being rendered
                  through an idiosyncratic representational mode—rendered, at any textual site, through
                  just a certain myth (mythology) or just a certain trope (tropology)—among countless
                  others possible in other languages. As it keeps staging its retro-constitutions of
                  the original, the critical translation has a stake in reminding us that the real thing
                  (the elusive original) is <em>not</em> (correctly, felicitously) named, or only named “with a figure.” To some translators
                  this common knowledge may be so common that they may scorn it as a mere truism that
                  glosses over the real skill needed to come up with those felicitous turns of phrase
                  that make up a translation. Or this common idea may appear to ignore the intense theorizing
                  that has spawned the worldwide discipline known as “translation theory”; yet Hölderlin
                  takes the commonplace to extremes when the stakes are so high—as here, in the translation
                  of the holy name. The translation of absolutes (such as divine names, or the names
                  of famous playwrights) depends crucially upon the textual mode of its re-presentation;
                  this is what “the Absolute” is for a Hölderlin (and other writers of the time, such
                  as Schlegel, Schelling and Novalis): always only a <em>Darstellung</em> of the Absolute before it is the Absolute itself.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy 27-37. </span></div>
                  </div> Whereas one less acute than a Hölderlin may be inclined to say—“There is no god outside
                  of literature”—Hölderlin would say, rather, “The literary is precisely where the god
                  is—or is not.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>This is all to say: the Sophocles of Hölderlin is an “infuriated” translation that
               sets in most ruthlessly where the felicitous translation appears to be most flawless.
               Thus: the Greek letters—Zeta (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=zw%2Fsain&amp;la=greek&amp;can=zw%2Fsain0&amp;prior=e)/ti">ζ</a>), Epsilon (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=telei%3D&amp;la=greek&amp;can=telei%3D0&amp;prior=zw/sain">ε</a>), Upsilon (υ), Sigma (ς) appear to correspond (or almost) to the German letters (z-e-v-s).
               Yet precisely this automatic translation is to be exposed by the critical translation
               as a linguistic and (as we will see) historical naiveté. Although the proper name
               may occasionally vary from language to language (“Zeus” may sometimes be “Jupiter”),
               it has no significant semantic component, and so can stay roughly equivalent across
               languages: English “Joseph” is French “Joseph” or Russian transliterated /zhozif/.
               Common names, on the other hand, require translation of the semanteme, which varies
               from language to language (“dog”—“<em>chien</em>”—“<em>perro</em>”); yet here, too, the radical variation of the signifier is considerably stabilized
               through its grounding in the referent—the dog itself, which appears to stay exactly
               the same across languages (but we know better: a dog in German is not the same as
               a dog in English). One may rephrase this by saying that both proper and common names
               are denominations; that is, neither occurs naturally but has to be denominated, posited
               again and again in incessant speech acts by means of signifiers that are, in various
               complex senses, “arbitrary.” Yet a great divide separates the two denominative speech
               acts. The denomination of the proper name is supposed to last forever—this is, after
               all, the ideality and ideology of the proper (and, as we will see, of the symbol).
               But the denominations of the common name keep changing as that common thing they name
               (e.g., “dog”) circulates from language to language. By treating the proper name (Greek
               “Zeus”) as a common name that must be translated (“<em>Vater der Zeit</em>”), Hölderlin’s example undoes a fundamental linguistic distinction and shows that
               even the god—that most proper of all entities—has to be re-denominated again and again,
               in a rhetorical movement which we will be aligning with allegory. In the Hölderlinian
               translation, the god is no more immune to the contingencies of linguistic process
               than the most common of common nouns—e.g., “dog.” Thus “<em>Vater der Zeit</em>” allegorizes the figure of correspondence hidden within the transliteration: German
               “Zeus” is as much a deviant figure as “<em>Vater der Zeit</em>.” The latter is the self-conscious performance of translation that implicates the
               transliteration as a performance just as wild.</p>
            <p>The very straightforwardness and apparent effortlessness of the transliteration exemplifies
               the particular aesthetic of Greek tragedy, a representational praxis which Hölderlin
               grounds in a Romantic notion of the symbol. Transliteration is essentially a symbolic
               mode, a monolingual fixation of names to spirits in a literality that lasts. The possibility
               of transliteration is the same possibility of naming the god in a solar language of
               stable meanings and apocalyptic perceptions in which “unification” [<em>Eineswerden</em>] prevails more than “separation” and severance [<em>Scheiden</em>], to anticipate a key distinction from the “Notes” that will figure in this essay.
               The stakes are high in this historico-philosophical critique of the “real” base, as
               here presented through the frame of transliteration: the real as the ideal correspondence
               of letters and spirits—a symbolic aesthetic where letters, the signifying elements
               between languages, are so closely, so internally fused as to be easily interchangeable—in
               which a defunct god can be given the same name as it once had in another semiotic
               system. Transliterating the god presupposes an Adamic language of origins that can
               institute lasting worlds of sense, linguistic worlds in which divinities may be translated
               into another language simply through a certain iconographic similarity of letters.
               <em>We</em> may take this possibility for granted, but not Hölderlin. For him, a translation
               is a labor of remembrance: the easier things are to translate, the more “the memory
               of the holy ones” is blotted out. The aesthetic of transliteration <em>must be</em> interrupted if the god is to be remembered.</p>
            <p>What is really at stake in translation—in the translation of a Greek tragedy? We may
               orient the question by sketching out what could be called the generalized aesthetic
               economy of Greek tragedy, at least the general form that economy has taken in received
               traditions of interpretation. Greek tragedy is famous for the way in which it links
               bodies in disastrous circumstances to the overarching spiritual powers of the cosmos.
               This propensity of tragic protagonists to be <em>lacerated</em> by something they <em>perceive</em> or <em>think</em>, this capability of tragic bodies to be restructured psychically, to be <em>grabbed</em> by an <em>idea</em>—to suffer and to learn from it—is the special domain of tragic representation, where
               catastrophe, pain and confusion come to be assimilated into a spiritual knowledge.
               As Tecmessa of <em>Ajax</em> laments, “Even in what we suffer I see the gods’ hand” (l. 950). Viewed from an atheological
               perspective, however, a secret pleasure lurks in this lament: the sense of protection
               by deity, implied in the context, where pain—or “madness” (<em>mania</em>) or “ruin” (<em>ate</em>)—are unquestioned signs of the divine that link the suffering body to apocalyptic
               vision. By contrast, bodies in sheer pain—without a language, without a mythical sphere
               of meaning—would only augur the indifference of gods, their withdrawal. In the self-contained
               symbolic cosmos of “the Greeks,” violent events such as murder, incest, and suicide
               are bound to mean—are aesthetically and religiously bound into meanings. It is this
               central feature of Greek tragedy, its ability to convert painful experience into cognitive
               insight—or represent conversion—that has intrigued generations of readers.</p>
            <p>At the same time there has been ascribed to tragedy the critical function to reveal
               what has been taken for granted—the normativity of the real—in the staging of its
               violent disruption. Through plot and characterization, this dramatic writing builds
               up the sense of calamity and channels it through the heroic body, where it can be
               felt along the blood and in the present moment; this derangement of the given order
               may then call attention to the givenness of that order. Yet even here, in the midst
               of “horrors, portioned to a giant nerve” (Keats I.175), even after the deep incision
               made by disaster in the order of things, even after this implicit critique, a meaningfulness
               prevails that is just as all-encompassing and powerful as that order destroyed. In
               fact, the deeper the gash, the more meaningful. The meaning of catastrophe for us
               may well be our inability to conceive of catastrophe outside of meaning.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To what preconceptions—religious yearnings or aesthetic expectations—does the representational
                  idiom of tragedy speak? What are the symbolic economies that guide, or have guided,
                  the Greek writing of disaster?

                  </div> The present essay hopes to articulate a response to such old and large questions,
                  a response to be worked out by this conjunction: Sophocles, Hölderlin, and the task
                  of translation. With its critical eye on the historical and linguistic <em>eccentricity</em> of ancient tragedy, the postclassical translation has the task of dismantling the
                  ancient text and putting it back together in a manner that would demonstrate the idiosyncrasy
                  or singularity of what before had seemed universal or “taken for granted.” But such
                  a demonstration has, all along, been the special province of tragedy; as we will see,
                  the critical translation of tragedy uncovers—and then falls into—a “vortext” common
                  to each.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It could even be argued that “criticism, <em>tout simple</em>, and in one way or another, has to do with the critical disarticulation of the symbolic
                  core of tragedy, especially after this complex genre, considerably simplified through
                  such lucid mimetic models as Aristotle’s, renders itself to critical judgment. For
                  the German translator-poet Hölderlin, tragedy—which presents “the world in small-scale”—is
                  an abyssal approximation to an unspeakable symbol: in his <em>Grund zum Empedokles</em> (1799), the more protagonists or readers fall into their tragic texts, the more the
                  symbol (as a new ideal or ideology, a new ground) asserts itself—as “the unspeakable,”
                  “<em>das nefas</em>”: as something at once linguistically and morally transgressive, a movement that
                  outstrips all articulation. In this fall into tragedy, the more one’s critical ground
                  gives way, the faster one falls “into” the symbol, a passage into tragic sublimity
                  that robs one of the ability to speak, even, or especially, when there may be words
                  to mark the fall. In <em>Antigone</em>, we will see (§5), “the symbol” is the corpse of Polyneices—the “corpse is the image
                  of his own destiny” (Bataille 44).

(“Anmerkungen zum Ödipus,” <em>FHA </em>16.257)</blockquote>
               <p>“The enormity” names a force-field of unsuspected magnitude with the capacity to bind
                  and unbind, either uniting consciousness, language, and the perceived world together
                  into substantial unities—or dispersing them. That capacity to conjoin such constituents
                  as matter and spirit, the visible and the intellectual, the sensuous and the abstract
                  into symbolic economies is truly an uncanny [<em>Un-geheure</em>] force—just as the capacity to disunite them.</p>
               <p>“Wrath” [<em>Zorn</em>], a significant and complex term in Hölderlin’s later poetry, connects violent figural
                  process with violent emotion, fusing the body to “the Enormity,” to create the enormous
                  suffering body of the tragic hero. Hölderlin’s Oedipus shares this impulse of the
                  strength of wrath. As the human vehicle of this energy, Oedipus is driven mad, “enraged”
                  in “the mad and frantic questing for a consciousness.” Driven by “wrathful curiosity”
                  [<em>zornige Neugier</em>], the “knowledge-desire” [<em>Wissen</em>] of Oedipus “provokes itself to know more than it can bear or grasp” in the encounter
                  with Teiresias; and, in the dialogue with Creon, “the true [. . .] Spirit suffers
                  in wrathful unmeasure [<em>im zornigen Unmass</em>], which, in destruction-joy [<em>zerstörungsfroh</em>], only follows lacerating time [<em>der reissenden Zeit nur folgt</em>].” In this “wrathful reading” of oracle-texts, the hero literally “follows time”
                  by rejecting and renouncing all meanings, in such a way that consciousness and self-identity
                  cannot be consolidated—a failure that is, precisely, the spirit of tragedy, the spirit
                  of (the) time.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The stronger the sense of domination by “the positive” becomes, the more the category
                     of the “spiritual” is opened—the “spiritual,” here as the flaring up of a desire that
                     exceeds all available determinations or “forms” of representation. “Wrath,” then,
                     signals the nonendingness of the process of disowning the signifier. Hölderlin’s Oedipus,
                     possessed by “wrathful curiosity,” converts the intransigence of the Sophoclean hero
                     into negative capability: whatever his character comes to know disintegrates before
                     the raging desire to know; whatever articulation he hits upon as “the case” is the
                     fleeting allegorical marker of something missed, something still to be signified.
                     In this allegorizing language there are no cognitive increments, no creeping realizations,
                     no deepening insights of consciousness—only the renewed process of renunciation. In
                     this tragic split of desire and knowledge, the hero is sent into a “frantic questing
                     after a consciousness” [<em>das närrischwilde Nachsuchen nach einem Bewusstsein</em>] (<em>Große Stuttgarter Ausgabe </em>199).

                              of authority, where now it is the servant who gives the law—is interpolated into the

                     to consolidating symbol, but in fact cannot be determined purely in the mode of one
                     or the other. On the one hand it is appropriate to align “wrathful reading” with a
                     certain kind of allegory, in which not one or another fixed “level of meaning” is
                     intended (e.g., reading Homer as Christian allegory), but a kind of enervated or “infuriated”
                     allegory that suggests the endlessness of allegorical process and the permanent non-coinciding
                     of signifier and signified which enables that process. Thus the hypercritical spirit
                     (of Oedipus) keeps perceiving, “limitlessly” and in rage, a still unsignified excess
                     of spirit. This is precisely what “<em>Geist</em>” <em>is</em>, or at least the <em>Geist</em> of tragedy: a structure of opposition [<em>Entgegen-setzung</em>] and non-convergence between a readerly/writerly consciousness and those (oracle)
                     texts which would “mirror” it; a consciousness which then only <em>intensifies</em> its self-scrutiny—awakens the responsibility for reading its texts with as many eyes
                     as possible—to the degree it keeps failing to find itself formulated in them. Spirit
                     is this excess—this “enormity” as the enormous difference between consciousness and
                     language, played out in a frenetic allegory where vital-internal forces are permanently
                     estranged from their external formulations.

                     moorings and displaced by radical translation into another historical, cultural and
                     linguistic space: Hellenic “Zeus” (a paternal figure) is rendered into a Germanic
                     “<em>Vater</em>” who comes back to refigure the original—tearing it from its proper name, out of
                     its extended symbolic body, and relocating it in the historico-linguistic field of <em>allegory</em>: “Father of Time.” If symbolic language refers to the mythopoetic capability of a
                     language, its ability to deliver meanings that last, allegorical language denotes
                     the regressive character within language that resists not so much meaning, as settled
                     and definitive meaning, the stabilized truths of common reading. With origins in Babel
                     rather than Thebes, the kind of allegory at issue here generates a historical language
                     which follows the path of separation [<em>Scheiden</em>], its senses becoming dispersed, incessantly differentiated, non-translatable, embedded
                     in the local and idiomatic, never arising above its materials, resisting totality.
                     The symbolic (which aligns with “the mythic”) and allegorical (“the historical”) coexist
                     as contrastive linguistic modes in any given text, but it makes a great difference
                     whether one gives weight to the mythical or to the historical modes of a text. Hölderlin
                     calls their conflict “the Enormity” [<em>das Ungeheure</em>] to denote that textual site, imagined by speculative criticism, where the centripetal
                     forces of symbolic binding exist in violent equation alongside the centrifugal forces
                     of allegorical unbinding. The spirit of tragedy dwells in this violence, dwells “in
                     wrath” between them, as a monstrous mix of each.

                     is the amalgam of each. The Time-Spirit [<em>Zeitgeist</em>] of the moderns operates in the textual spaces in between allegory and symbol, becoming
                     symbol in order to be allegory—and vice-versa. “Wrath,” the energizing force of “the

               <p>In the law of tragedy, what seems to be certain knowledge or secure identity—absolute
                  unification—is the symptom of a deep violence, a deep gash of formation that the symbol
                  cuts into the unconditioned. “Death” itself qualifies as a supreme instance of “unification,”
                  in the Romantic sense of a unification with natural elements. A concise definition
                  of symbol and allegory will help the exposition. “Whereas the symbol postulates the
                  possibility of an identity or identification, allegory designates primarily a distance
                  in relation to its own origin, and, renouncing the nostalgia and the desire to coincide,
                  it establishes its language in the void of this temporal difference” (de Man 207).
                  Recalling once again the formulation of tragic process in “the Notes”: “the enormity
                  [. . .] comprehends itself in this way: unchecked unification [symbolic activity]
                  purifies itself through unchecked separation [allegory].” Hölderlin’s wrathful spirit
                  of tragedy shuttles back and forth between a momentary halting [“unification,” <em>Eineswerden</em>] and a transition away from that halt [“separation,” <em>Scheidung</em>] that ends in further determinations. While properly speaking both “unification”
                  and “separation” are moments of inscription, in the former, sense coalesces into inscription,
                  congeals into stasis, while “separation” refers to a movement away from inscription
                  into dissolution; thus the “becoming unified” is the “<em>possibility</em> of an identity” (emphasis added) and the “separation” is “a distance in relation
                  to its own origin.” As a “coupling” of human and divine, as the “union” of natural
                  and human, “the enormity” qualifies as a symbolic identity; yet, as wrathful union,
                  as “one in wrath,” Hölderlin’s symbol of “the enormity” is self-critical, always turned
                  against itself as it keeps trying to keep open the original gap between signifier
                  and signified that is always being collapsed in symbolic processes. Allegory can be
                  itself—can be the movement away from identifications and lasting determinations—only
                  by coming to a halt, postulating “identity” in momentary determinations, which then
                  are to be left behind, cancelled out as its means to intensify its “search for a consciousness”
                  and move on toward further allegorizations. Hölderlin had renounced the proper name
                  “Zeus” because it was “too” symbolic, insufficiently temporary, not allegorical enough.
                  But he had not completely renounced the charge of the symbol: god=father. Father “Zeus”
                  remains a symbolic “father,” only now this father self-consciously fathers allegorical
                  concepts: father of time, father of earth.</p>

               <p>A historico-philosophical axiom informs our subject matter: as the familiar story
                  goes, there is a great historical divide between “us” (moderns) and “them” (ancients),
                  a difference which the critical translation of the ancients keeps trying to reassert.
                  Greek tragedy, with its specific representational mode, is no longer possible for
                  postclassical historical thinking. Hölderlin had extolled “the clarity of the presentation,”
                  the crystalline lucidity of representations in the Homeric epic, as the major Greek
                  achievement, which we moderns have then inherited as our second-nature. In this perspective,
                  clear and distinct perceptions may owe their existence mostly to recycled memory-citations;
                  what seem to be our clearest empirical perceptions might owe their very sharpness
                  and seeming “objectivity” to “positivity,” as the unbreakable habit that keeps repeating
                  the same (already formulated) Greek senses, which only through custom and automatism
                  have come to be known as “the truth,” the unique and best sense.</p>
               <p>Developing a notion derived from Winckelmann, Schiller, and others, Hölderlin postulates
                  the fundamental mode of Greek tragedy to be a “naïve” one in which words are “actual
                  and deadly” [<em>das Tödlichfaktische, der wirkliche Mord aus Worten</em>—“the actual death from words”] (“Anmerkungen zur Antigonä” in <em>FHA</em> 16.418). In this particular Greek orientation toward texts, “words” can have a direct
                  contact with the material world; their rhetorical force to maim or kill, to drive
                  mad, apotheosize or impart understanding may be remarked in the apocalyptic fictions
                  of Greek tragedy, with its curses, its omens and shattering revelations.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thus in a letter Hölderlin could state that the Greeks had achieved a “sureness” in
                     “the phenomenalization of concepts”; this production of an art world made of clear
                     and certain senses constituted the “highest mode of the sign” (<em>FHA </em>2.921).

                     The eminently readable language of the Greeks could make real contact with the material
                     world; their representational mode can touch “<span class="foreign">matériellement la vérité</span>” (Mallarmé, cited in Benjamin IV.I.17); but such immediacy of word and world is no
                     longer possible for us “moderns” or belated “Hesperians,” for whom the “naïve-visionary”
                     language of the Greeks can only be an “aesthetic fallacy” or “artistic mistake” [<em>Kunstfehler</em>].

                              the Sophocles translations: “I hope to present Greek art—which is strange to us due
                              to its national customs and mistakes [Fehler]—in a more lively manner to the public,

                              mistake [Kunstfehler], where it occurs” (FHA 2.925). The “oriental” is that aspect
                              of Greek “sobriety” or “representational clarity” which had to be rhetorically suppressed,
                              or taken for granted, as the price to pay for its lucid forcefulness.</span></div>
                     </div> Over time, the original creations of the ancients lead us—their successors—down the
                     path of increasing abstraction and lost definition, for their art forms could only
                     be produced in the “naïve” climate of <em>Greek </em>representation now impossible for historically self-conscious modernity. While the
                     Greek art of representation had created a world accessible to the senses, the belated
                     moderns end up only mimicking the original (Greek) acts of phenomenalization. The
                     moderns may try to “say the same,” yet there is no corresponding production of a sense-certain
                     world. The vast, anterior “intertext” of tradition stands between the most proper
                     part of the modern and the modern body; the very mark of the belated text is its ingrained
                     failure to connect with materiality, but this failure to be Greek is also what gives
                     belated, “Romantic” writing its potential to read the Greek text critically—to “translate”
                     it. Hölderlin suggestively characterizes Romantic textual praxis as so many allegories
                     of force, whereby cultural formations and discourses are always being (allegorically)
                     “forced more resolutely back toward earth” (<em>entschiedener zur Erde zwinget</em>) by “<em>our</em> Zeus.” The dominant tendency [<em>Haupttendenz</em>] of Romantic writing is its incessant allegorical drive toward a greater phenomenality.
                     This drive is the symptom of the moderns’ “weak point,” their inability “to meet with
                     something” [<em>etwas treffen zu können</em>] (<em>FHA </em>16.418).

                              immanence in The Origin of the German Tragic Drama, Hölderlin associates tragedy with
                              “the deepest interiority.” In Benjamin, allegoresis, working from within the symbolic
                              nexus, attempts to spin out of such immanence; it tries but ultimately fails, leaving
                              in its wake the debris of citations, which serve to generate tragic affect in the
                              form of melancholia. In other words, the unassimilated “citationality” is put in the

                     meaning. Bad translation and bad literature have this in common: both repress historical
                     differences in their pretence to be falsely “Greek.” Hölderlin’s translations would
                     expose this <em>attempt</em> to be Greek, so making manifest the latent gravitation of the “belated” mode of representation

                  between names and bodies (physical or spiritual), trying to separate them, displace
                  them into the mode of allegory. The genre of tragedy, famous for the way it aligns
                  linguistically mediated knowledge with bodily or spiritual states, is the very place
                  to display how far this attempt to drive a wedge between words and things, gods and

                     of their classical inheritance. The belated ones (“Hesperians”) are doomed to live

                     of emotion in significant discourses of the last two centuries. “Rage” [<em>Zorn</em>] and “suspicion” [<em>Ahnung</em>] later take the more subdued form of Nietzschean <em>ressentiment</em> (bearing a grudge); Freud will attach the names of <em>Lust</em> and <em>Unlust</em> [pleasure and unpleasure], as their emotive concomitants, to the stabilization and
                     destabilization of the instinct forces within the psychic economy; in another modulation,
                     “wrath” is toned down into the less rabid but steadier <em>Trauer</em> [mourning] and melancholy which marks the modern tragic consciousness in the work

                     tragedy, the play of mourning or <em>Trauerspiel</em>, keeps signifying that the sense cannot be fixed, with the result that the sense
                     of engendering allegory itself (allegoresis) is signified. A given meaning always
                     points to another meaning, as if to say: “It is not really, not entirely, <em>this</em> sense here which is meant, but <em>another</em> one, further down the signifying chain.” Or: “Perhaps it <em>is</em> this sense—but not the way it’s being read, <em>now</em>. In any case, the sense is not this, not here, not now—except for the sense of this
                     allegorical signpost pointing elsewhere. In other words, the sense is ‘falling,’ moving
                     elsewhere. So just keep reading.” The allegory in Benjamin’s <em>Trauerspiel</em> is sped up to the point where the allegorical sense truly seems to happen with vertiginous
                     “fleetingness”: “As those who fall somersault as they fall, so the allegorical intention
                     would fall prey to the vertigo [<em>dem Schwindel</em>] of its ungrounded depths [<em>ihrer grundlosen Tiefe</em>] [. . .]” (I.I.405). In both Baroque <em>Trauerspiel</em>, but even more so in the “baroque” translations of Greek tragedy (such as Hölderlin’s
                     Sophocles), allegory occurs at allegro pace; its senses are played out so fast—made
                     and unmade so often—that the text serves as a metacommentary on its own acts of sense-making,
                     and stages, beyond itself, the genesis and erasure of sense itself.

                              thrown into temporality by belatedness. The novelist tries to achieve the “relationship
                              to totality” that could be achieved in the classical epic: the novel “approximates
                              as closely as possible” the “organic” (i.e., the continuous and “natural” epic, where
                              meaning and form exist in the closure of a symbiotic relation), but that approximation
                              “is nevertheless not a true-born organic relationship, but a conceptual one which
                              is abolished again and again” (76).</span></div>
                     </div> Benjamin chooses Hölderlin as exemplar of the good translation because the distinctive
                     feature of the latter’s translation style is its “fleetingness”—its provisionality,
                     tentativeness, self-staging specificity, or idiosyncrasy as translative style.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In tragedy, “the enormity [. . .] purifies itself.” Absolute self-purification could
                  only be reached with the total erasure of all meaning—yet then there could be no movement
                  “away,” no <em>abjection</em> of the tragic word. In the words of one writer, “interpretation is directed not so
                  much at the meaning as towards reducing the non-meaning of the signifiers, so that
                  we may rediscover the determinants of the subject’s entire behaviour” (Lacan 212).
                  The wrathful translation reverses this and could be said to <em>augment</em>, thematically and tonally, the non-meaning of the signifier. “Fleetingness” points
                  up the specific modality of a given translation—the fact that it takes the original
                  and touches just a piece of it, making that fragmentation stand for the whole. In
                  the wrathful translation, the classical roles of long-term suppression (of some transgression)
                  and the sudden remembering of the same are inverted, making such lines as Oedipus’
                  momentous self-recognition “All too true!”—his anagnorisis at line 1182 (melodramatized,
                  idealized, and possibly even knowingly ironized in Hölderlin’s rendition: “<span class="foreign">Das Ganze kommt genau heraus</span>!” [“The Whole comes out exactly!”])—remind us of what has to be suddenly forgotten
                  whenever clear understanding is to come.</p>

               <p>It stands to reason that the “purification” to be accomplished in translated tragedy
                  should involve the connection of two extremes: the utterly sacred and the utterly
                  profane, a God and a corpse, and the linkage between them that has to be asserted
                  again and again as the connection between them—once “purified”—keeps vanishing. In
                  keeping with the ancient institution of tragedy, the purification has a purely ritualistic
                  aspect that exceeds any mere cognitive insight or thematic expression. </p>
               <p>The key passage (quoted above) on the self-purifying “enormity” from the “Notes to
                  Oedipus” recurs in the “Notes to Antigone.” Comparing the two articulations, “the
                  enormity” of the Oedipus turns into “the unmediated God” of Antigone, each coming
                  to seize itself purely, to “purify” itself: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">[. . .] the Enormity [<em>das Ungeheure</em>], as god and humankind couple it, and as, without limit, the force of the natural
                  [<em>die Naturmacht</em>] and the most internal part of the human are one in wrath [<em>im Zorn Eins wird</em>], comprehends itself in this way: unchecked unification [<em>Eineswerden</em>] purifies itself through unchecked separation [<em>Scheiden</em>]. (“Notes to Oedipus”)<br/><br/> [. . .] the unmediated God, one with the human [. . .] [through] the infinite Inspiriting

                  itself, and the God is present in the figure of death [<em>in der Gestalt des Todes</em>]. (“Notes to Antigone”)</blockquote>
               <p> In these extreme compressions, “the enormity” or “the unmediated god” is to “grasp
                  itself” through the scrutiny—the overview—of those processes by which identity is
                  articulated, constantly made, undone, and revised. Critical readers will accede to
                  such grasping only asymptotically, according to their own negative capabilities. The
                  purifying insight comes from the tragic realization that all determinations are, at
                  least to wrathful vision, absolutely equal. <em>Alles ist Rede gegen Rede</em> (<em>FHA </em>16.257). In the symbolic mode of “unchecked unification” [<em>das granzenlose Eineswerden</em>] there can be (or seem to be) unquestioned points of contact, actual conjunctures
                  of language and physical bodies; the allegorical mode of “unchecked separation” [<em>granzenloses Scheiden</em>] drives a wedge between the body and the word and tries to pass through the space
                  it had seemed to open. The original connection is not so much severed as altered in
                  a process that may be called “loosening,” which Hölderlin understood, in the “Notes
                  to Oedipus,” as “the remembrance of the holy ones” [<em>das Gedächtnis des Himmlischen</em>].</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Here we may speak of a <em>topos</em> of evanescent sense that characterizes the wrath-driven language of tragedy—and translation
                     of tragedy: this would be a metalanguage of signification that stages the production
                     and destruction of determinations. The faster that process of making and unmaking
                     sense on the stage of tragic language, the more “wrath” (“mourning,” <em>ressentiment</em>, <em>jouissance</em>, etc.) is generated as the aesthetic affect. Compared to original works, whose figurations
                     are more durable, being more “symbolic”—less unraveled by the exegetical actions of
                     allegory or translation—the antithetical, countering art of allegorical unraveling
                     is self-referential in the way that it intimates that its institutions of meaning
                     are already on their way to erasure. This is to say that the kind of translation at
                     stake here knows itself as the continuous performance of the act of naming, and its
                     “sense” is a metalanguage displaying its incessant acts of denominating.

                              motif, finding the latter to be the hallmark of tragic language especially: “the original

                     </div> Whereas stationary translations (those not falling) are the <em>semantic</em> translations of meanings (e.g., Greek <em>physis</em>=English “nature”), “fleeting” translations (which are also stationary at other levels)
                     impart an added sense of themselves as the performative <em>simulation</em> of translated meanings.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Returning now to the passage from the “Notes to Antigone”: if “the God” can be said
                  to appear anywhere in <em>Antigone</em>, it is in the rotting corpse of Polyneices, the most obvious thematic referent for
                  the “figure of death.” For the “corpse” is the <em>locus classicus</em> of “the sacred” in this drama that works through the consequences of its central
                  figural equation. The unburied body is a signifier for the holiness of the traditional
                  laws that sanction burial and that, consequently, are so sure, so deeply embedded
                  in social practice, that they cannot be countermanded by any merely temporal authority.
                  They are fully outside of discourse, outside of all contestation—and thus “unwritten.”
                  To allegorize this symbolic equation means, in the present argument, to “separate”
                  [<em>heilig sich scheidend</em>] its terms, to show “primarily a distance” between what, in the original text, appears
                  as a “unification” [<em>Eineswerden</em>]: corpse=sacred law. What would it mean to translate this god? To “purify” the connection
                  between the corpse and it? To disarticulate—and to rearticulate—that connection from
                  the vantage of “the infinite”?</p>
               <p>The equation is complex enough on its own terms. We recall that the Creon of <em>Antigone</em> issues an edict that forbids the burial of the slain traitor, Polyneices, whose corpse
                  stands for the merely historical language of the king (Creon), his political edict
                  that begins to rot the moment it is issued. But the corpse also stands for the necessity
                  of sacred law that will overpower the edict and hide the rot. The law that hides the
                  corpse must be absolutely decisive—sacrosanct—to the degree that the body is an unholy
                  decay. In this play family ties, the blood bond of siblings, make common cause with
                  the sacred laws; the family is as holy an institution as rotting corpses are an unholy
                  decay. If the body were not rotting, not such “an outrage,” not famous, not royal,
                  and had no family ties, the laws that demanded its burial might begin to look less
                  transcendent, less purely “religious” and more a merely hygienic or cosmetic expedient.
                  If one in full-blown amnesia could discover the body, the latter could appear as “purified”
                  in the sense required—it would appear, that is, as a <em>separate thing</em>, on its own and outside of any cultural ties, in those few moments before the natural
                  aversion to corpses takes hold, causing even the amnesiac (who never quite forgets
                  everything) to withdraw. Allegorical process—the “purification” mentioned in Hölderlin’s
                  commentary—strives to reach that separate thing as it would present itself in amnesia,
                  yet in the full-blown consciousness of the impossibility of ever completely forgetting.
                  Hölderlin had posited the particular spirituality of the Hesperians to be the <em>Deus absconditus</em>; their “God” can only manifest itself “in the form of death,” in, that is, figures
                  of spirit absented from itself. “Purification” entails a “deformation” in the sense
                  of an emptying out of existential contents that leaves behind the desanctified and
                  abstract vessels of signification.</p>
               <p>The primary symbolization driving the equation “dead body”=“the sacred” is, of course,
                  that between nature (body) and culture (laws): the rotting body literalizes natural
                  process, a tremendous power, an “enormity,” which then gets channeled into the cultural
                  law (which needs visible embodiment) through the symbolic linkage. “Nature” flows
                  into “culture,” and the law grows more numinous as the body rots. But the task of
                  allegorization is separation, “a distance in relation to its origin”—where “origin”
                  may be one of either terms, the body or the sacred law. As postulated, the task of
                  translation involves bringing to light the (concealed) palimpsests which invisibly
                  hold together what appear to be the clear, certain senses of Greek tragedy, in a demonstration
                  in which even those palimpsests have been destabilized and are “falling” into a dispersal
                  of mediations. If, for example, tragic horror could translate, as if by magic, abstract
                  mental contents into immediate representations of the horrible—a rotting corpse representing
                  the “unwritten laws” of tradition (<em>Antigone</em>), or the notion that one’s wife is really one’s mother—this ancient translation is
                  to be encountered in a critical movement of dispersion that can never quite dissolve
                  the original linkage, but that can gain a deeper awareness of its constructed nature
                  as pre-analytically given norm—of its being a symbolization, a product of repeated
                  mediations rather than an occurrence that occurs by itself and without discursive
                  mediation.</p>
               <p>Still, could one possibly separate out the body from that nexus of claims (of family,
                  of the state, of religious tradition) made upon it? Would this entail seeing the body
                  as a merely biological event or “thing”? Even this would be to allegorize it otherwise,
                  but the reallegorization would still qualify as a “separation” of the original terms.
                  Or, inversely, what would happen to the sacred law of burial if the power of nature,
                  the corpse-power (“<em>die Naturmacht</em>,” in Hölderlin’s terms), were siphoned away from it? It would look more like a mere
                  artifice of culture sanctioned only by convention. <em>Antigone</em> would then be a play about conflicting but equally justified political positions
                  (cf. Hegel’s reading of <em>Antigone</em> as a tragic conflict of “individual rights” versus “state rights”) rather than, as
                  traditionally and classically, a play about the fatal hiatus between the politico-cultural
                  order and the raw, sovereign power of deity, which cannot be signified, named, or
                  assigned—or, rather, can be, when the signifier is a corpse: when “the God” [<em>der Gott</em>] may appear “in the form of death” [<em>in der Gestalt des Todes</em>], as the “Notes to Antigone” put it (<em>FHA </em>16.417).</p>

                     also close the essay as a whole.</em>]</p>
               <p>[T]he “wrathful translation” foregrounds what remains hidden in most other translations,
                  whose voice—its principle of continuity—is muted; in Hölderlin’s, it is notable, remarkable,
                  singular. Hölderlin translates the Greek, but translates it into the hymnic vocality
                  of Hölderlin. By foregrounding their own voice, his vociferations put on display their
                  principle of translational continuity, making one mindful that all translations employ
                  specific principles of unification. One may read the rhetorical forcefulness of his
                  hymnic-oracular style as a signifier for the singularity of a style; that style renders
                  the original, but the style is one of many possible, a contingent mode of unification
                  that is taken for granted in such common texts as newspapers and translations. “Wrath”
                  is a reaction to the fallacy of the natural style, the one that usually goes unnoticed.
                  The “wrathful” translation imparts a sense of the contingency of styles that render.</p>
               <p>The legendary “faithfulness” ascribed to a given translation always depends—at some
                  level of scrutiny—upon a ritual burial of the original. All translations “repeat”
                  the original—or, more precisely, they claim to represent it. Without self-justification,
                  they pass off their own substitutive proposals as the “original” or anterior meaning.
                  The notion of “passing,” passing as a member of another race or gender—or a body passing
                  for buried—is appropriate here, where one thing is accepted as something else through
                  a deception at once dramatic and transgressive.</p>
               <p>The farther one pushes the common notion that meaning gets “lost in translation,”
                  the more translation looks to be not so much the <em>repetition</em> of the original than a textual performance that <em>simulates</em> such a repetition through careful scholarship and crafty composition. A language
                  is an integral unity, its formal and semantic registers so closely bound together
                  that the original sense cannot be transferred and repeated in another language without
                  always being fragmented and displaced into other “senses,” with their own translative
                  refigurations and realignments of sense. But that genre called translation works as
                  a powerful textual charm in which the idea of <em>simulation</em> (not the same as repetition) is played down; if it were not, the text would begin
                  to look arbitrary (more like just another original), as if it were merely fabricating
                  meanings instead of translating them. Whatever is inscribed on the seductive pages
                  of “translation” is instantaneously granted the meaningfulness and status of “translation”;
                  even the most woefully inept attempt to render a foreign text may be a “bad” translation,
                  but it is still a translation. From this angle, translations are the performatives
                  of translation, that discourse which acts as if it were “saying the same”—which it
                  does, but through a complex pantomime. Translations are paintings often mistaken for
                  mirrors.</p>

               from the “Notes” are mine. <em>Sämtliche Werke: Frankfurter Ausgabe</em> will hereafter be abbreviated <em>FHA. </em></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">It should be noted that the issue goes well beyond economies of “suffering” translated
               into “learning,” as in the Aeschylean <em>pathos mathos </em>formula; goes beyond such moral axioms as “the doer suffers” [<a class="link_ref" href="numbering.xml">δράσαντι</a> <a class="link_ref" href="styles.xml">παθεῖν</a>] (<em>Libation Bearers</em> l. 313). Such maxims as “suffering is learning” are <em>made possible by</em> a superstructural complex encompassing a range of personal, public, and business
               practices, customs, responsibilities—together with the pleasures and displeasures,
               privileges or penalties, honor and shame that society metes out to support the status
               quo. By the “self-contained symbolic cosmos” above we mean the ancient Athenian socio-political
               life-world that binds individuals into specific networks of reciprocal relations (such
               as “helping friends and harming enemies”) to form the hierarchical relations of power,
               within the interlocking spheres of family and polis, between men and women, mortals
               and gods, parents and children, subjects and rulers.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">In another context Julia Kristeva catches this <span class="foreign">mise-en-abîme</span> in the following citation (emphasis mine): <span class="quote">‘In a world in which the Other has collapsed, the aesthetic task—<em>a descent into the foundations of the symbolic construct</em>—amounts to retracing the fragile limits of the speaking being, closest to its dawn,
                  to the bottomless ‘primacy’ constituted by primal regression. Through that experience
                  [. . .] ‘subject’ and ‘object’ push each other away, confront each other, collapse,
                  and start again—inseparable, contaminated, condemned, at the boundary of what is assimilable,
                  thinkable: abject. Great modern literature unfolds over that terrain. (18)’</span> In his essay on translation, Walter Benjamin speaks of the meaning in Hölderlin’s
               Sophocles translations as “falling from abyss to abyss,” falling into the “groundless
               depths of language” [<em>bodenlosen Sprachtiefen</em>] (4.1.21). Tragedy, translation, and psychoanalysis are alike in that they never
               quite “get to the bottom of” their respective subject which tend to recede—or dissolve—before
               their respective critiques. See my “Oedipus Contemporaneous.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">See, for instance, Aeschylus <em>Agamemnon </em>l. 160-2: “Zeus: whatever he may be, if this name/ pleases him in invocation/ thus
               I call him [. . .].” For a few instances of an <em>internal </em>activity ascribed to an external Zeus, see Aeschylus, <em>Suppliants</em> l. 86-7: “May his will, if it’s Zeus’s, be well,/ His will not easily traced”; <em>Suppliants </em>l. 1057: “How am I to see through the mind a Zeus, an abyssal sight [<em>opsin abusson</em>],” my translation.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">This quest is ended in a remarkable way. This is when, as the “Notes to Oedipus” explain
               it, “the spirit” of Oedipus “is conquered by the simple brute speech of his servant”
               (i.e., the “shepherd of Laius”). A revolutionary political motif—the complete inversion
               of authority, where now it is the servant who gives the law—is interpolated into the
               raging stream of negations, bringing closure but not bestowing consciousness. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">The notion of “opposition”—the oppositionality of articulations, “thesis” and “antithesis”—has
               a particular significance in German Idealism. As Klaus Düsing notes, Hegel and Hölderlin
               were at one time (1801 Jena) quite close in their understanding of binary opposition
               itself as the structural signifier of an irremediable excess not subject to dialectical
               sublation, such as the presence of the infinite in the finite consciousness. Hegel
               will later make that difference be the drive-spring into higher unity. See “Die Theorie
               der Tragödie bei Hölderlin und Hegel,” 59. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Compared to the numerous critical writings on Hölderlin’s poetic corpus, relatively
               few have been devoted to the poet’s Sophocles translations. To list a few of the latter:
               Friedrich Beißner, <em>Hölderlins Übersetzungen aus dem Griechischen</em>; Wolfgang Schadewaldt, “Hölderlins Übersetzung des Sophokles”; Karl Reinhardt, “Hölderlin
               und Sophokles”; Wolfgang Binder, “Hölderlin und Sophokles”; Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe,
               “The Caesura of the Speculative”; Jean Beaufret, <em>Hölderlin et Sophocle</em>; Antoine Berman, <em>L’Epreuve de L’Etranger: Culture et Traduction dans L’Allemagne Romantique</em>; Gerhard Kurz, “Zur Hölderlins Anmerkungen”; Lawrence Ryan, "Hölderlin's <em>Antigonä</em>”; Bernhard Böschenstein, “Gott und Mensch in den Chorliedern der Hölderlinschen Antigonä”;
               Jochen Schmidt, “Tragödie und Tragödientheorie. Hölderlins Sophokles-Deutung.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Whereas allegory foregrounds the process of symbolization, the connecting of disparate
               items into figural equations, the symbol conceals that process, for there the connections
               appear, by definition, to be “natural,” automatic or self-generating: the symbolic
               linking of “wind” to “spirit,” for example, or to “breath” or “inspiration” occurs
               almost seamlessly and seems to “partake of the reality which it renders intelligible”
               (Coleridge 661). Allegory, which tries to take nothing for granted, links its terms
               more self-consciously; it would just as well link “wind” to something unnatural (“bed”)
               or abstract (“love”) as to something “natural.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">See the letter to Böhlendorff of November 1802: “The view of antiquity has given me
               an impression, which makes not only the Greeks more comprehensible to me, but also
               the highest in art [<em>das Höchste der Kunst</em>]—art, which even in the highest movement and phenomenalization of concepts [<em>Phänomenalisierung der Begriffe</em>], and everything seriously intended, even in these cases everything stays and maintains
               itself, so that the sureness in this sense is the highest mode of the sign [<em>die höchste Art des Zeichens</em>].”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">See Hölderlin’s letter of 28 September 1803 to Friedrich Wilmans, the publisher of
               the Sophocles translations: “I hope to present Greek art—which is strange to us due
               to its national customs and mistakes [<em>Fehler</em>]—in a more lively manner to the public, that I accentuate the oriental, which that
               art denied, and correct their artistic mistake [<em>Kunstfehler</em>], where it occurs” (<em>FHA</em> 2.925). The “oriental” is that aspect of Greek “sobriety” or “representational clarity”
               which had to be rhetorically suppressed, or taken for granted, as the price to pay
               for its lucid forcefulness.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Hölderlin’s speculative reading of the “ancients”/”moderns” <em>topos</em> suggests a way to reframe some of the significant projects of Anglo-European Romanticism.
               Rousseau’s <em>Discourse on the Origin of Inequality </em>and Wordsworth’s “Preface to the Second Edition of the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>,” for instance, bemoan the loss of sense in the creeping abstractness of cultural
               productions; their own projects rise up to meet this loss, whether (in Rousseau’s
               case) to remind us of the ever-widening “distance between the mere sensation and the
               most simple knowledge” of an object or (in Wordsworth’s case) to justify a poetic
               diction that would be the “spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">“Grund zum Empedokles,” in <em>FHA</em> 1.871. Anticipating the Benjaminian notion of abyssal immanence in <em>The Origin of the German Tragic Drama</em>, Hölderlin associates tragedy with “the deepest interiority.” In Benjamin, allegoresis,
               working from within the symbolic nexus, attempts to spin out of such immanence; it
               tries but ultimately fails, leaving in its wake the debris of citations, which serve
               to generate tragic affect in the form of melancholia. In other words, the unassimilated
               “citationality” is put in the service of an aesthetics of the modern “untragedy” of
               <em>Trauerspiel</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               in the “Commentary to Antigone”: “[. . .] since the Fate-less, the <em>dusmoron</em>, is our weak point” (<em>FHA</em> 16.418).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Could we rank the speed with which subjects are ripped out of language as meaning-laden
               discourse and thrown into language as sheer velocity? For example: Schiller’s category
               of “the sentimental” and Nietzsche’s <em>ressentiment</em> appear to be subdued, slower forms of Hölderlin’s more infuriated “wrath” or <em>Zorn</em>; while Benjamin’s melancholic genius of Baroque <em>Trauerspiel</em>—caught in the frenetic activity of incessant allegorization—could be said to reject
               meanings nearly as vigorously as Hölderlin’s Oedipus. “To be named,” says Benjamin,
               “is to have the premonition of melancholy. But how much more if not named but only
               read—and read with uncertainty, through the allegorist.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               The novelist tries to achieve the “relationship to totality” that could be achieved
               in the classical epic: the novel “approximates as closely as possible” the “organic”
               (i.e., the continuous and “natural” epic, where meaning and form exist in the closure
               of a symbiotic relation), but that approximation “is nevertheless not a true-born
