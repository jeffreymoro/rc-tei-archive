                  <p>Hölderlin’s translations of Sophocles occupy an ambiguous place in his work. Composed
                     and published during his most intense period of lyric creativity (1801-1805), the
                     Sophocles translations are generally regarded as highly significant, if not central,
                     achievements in that complex of texts collectively periodized as the poet’s <em>Spätwerk</em>, mostly associated with the late hymns and lyric fragments. In spite of numerous
                     allusions to, and citations from, the Sophocles-project, the subject has elicited
                     only a handful of monographs
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Beissner published the first full-length study in 1933: Hölderlins Übersetzungen aus
                              dem Griechischen; W. Schadewaldt, “Hölderlins Übersetzung des Sophokles”; K. Reinhardt,

                     </div>, and the question remains: does Hölderlin’s writing during this period culminate
                     in the Sophocles translations, or do the latter—in their wild swerves from the original
                     and their arcane meanings—rather announce the onset of the poet’s loss of sense in
                     the onset of mental illness? It is of course possible to answer, “yes” to both questions;
                     but however the critic answers these and other questions, it appears that the translations
                     (of both Pindar and Sophocles) exist at the boundaries of our classifications and
                     pose challenges to our present practices and capacities of evaluation and appreciation.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Vastly outnumbered as it is by the score of books and essays on the late hymns, or
                  on <em>Hyperion</em>, or Hölderlin’s own tragedy <em>Empedokles</em>, the relative paucity of commentary devoted to the translations is not hard to understand.
                  The obscure idiom of the “Notes” (<em>Anmerkungen</em>) attached to <em>Antigone </em>and <em>Oedipus Tyrannus</em> stands as a hermeneutical obstacle to those who would seek to interpret the translations
                  themselves; and these latter are themselves rife with turns of phrase and word usages
                  that are as “difficult” as any in the late lyrics. If we allow the figure of speech
                  that gives voice and spirit to texts (and many of Hölderlin’s lyrics are mediations
                  on the possibility of this figure), then the spirits and voices of the Sophocles translations
                  are more diffuse or elusive than those which the reader soon feels, or imagines, to
                  be present in the late hymns. The characteristic “voices” of the lyrics are indeed
                  recognizable in the translations—as in the German rendition of the famous first stasimon
                  of <em>Antigone</em>, the <em>polla ta deina </em>ode. But such lyric or hymnic voices are mixed in with other voices, or nonvoices,
                  which are hard to identify and which seem to come out of the nowhere of a purely linguistic
                  conjuration. From one point of view at least, these often inscrutable tonalities can
                  be compared to the latest lyrics—those written after 1806, during the years of Hölderlin’s
                  institutionalization: in both the translations and the productions of the last phase,
                  the speaker can conceal himself behind poetic statements which are hard to assign
                  to any recognizable person. The predictable rhyme and regular meter of the last or
                  latest lyrics creates a mask of poetic cliché effacing or distancing the sense of
                  the personal; just as the <em>dramatis personae </em>speaking the lines of <em>Antigonä </em>are neither Sophoclean nor really Hölderlinian, but can appear as characters beyond
                  our ken and kinship, with those disembodied voices of textual pasts and futures which
                  Hölderlin’s translations bring into play. If these texts resist the reader’s attempt
                  to give them recognizable voices and spirits—if we don’t know just <em>who </em>is speaking and to what purposes—then the task of interpretation and classification
                  can be awkward.</p>
               <p>There exists another reason why such scant attention has been given to the Sophocles
                  translations, despite their acknowledged importance. The literary tradition, like
                  human consciousness, is highly selective and incorporates into itself only what insures
                  the continuity of its own discourse. As an indispensable instrument of the <em>traditio imperii</em>, translation plays its crucial role in the constitution of literary history; but
                  tradition prefers to define its high moments and monuments by reference to original
                  works rather than to translated ones. The work of literature is supposed to rise from
                  the depths of the authorial consciousness; especially in the Romantic text, claims
                  to originality are based on the sense of an origination from “within,” that place
                  which modernity has assigned as the domain of imagination, or aesthetic and ethical
                  freedom. But a translation can’t originate from this region directly—<em>its </em>origin is already “outside,” in another always more original text. How can the Romantic
                  translator vie with the Romantic author for originality, when the former has already
                  yielded up so many of his authorial prerogatives to another, always more original
                  and originary author—original works appear to live up to and fulfill, better than
                  translations do, commonsense and contextualist assumptions about written texts: namely,
                  that literature is mimetic, responding to and representing the psychological experience
                  and socio-historical conditions of authors. No matter how creative or “original” it
                  may be, a translation is valued just because it is derivative: it re-represents, as
                  an interpretation and a rewriting, what the original author felt, said, thought, or
                  created. There are no texts in our literary halls of fame that are there as translations
                  because to accord to a work classed as “translation” the status of a canonical “original”
                  would be to discard deeply embedded presuppositions about artistic autonomy and to
                  accept instead another model of literature—one in which non-mimetic influences (such
                  as linguistic or intertextual ones) would prevail over personal, representation, and
                  historical assumptions.</p>
               <p>Two essays on Hölderlin’s Sophocles translations may serve to illustrate how the binary
                  opposition “original”/”translation” becomes the framework within which the critic
                  is compelled to work, even when his own insights suggest that this framework may be
                  inadequate. A central problem for those who write on Hölderlin’s translation will
                  be how to account for—or what to do with—their wild deviations from the original,
                  their semantic and tonal swerves from it, and, in general, their radical revision
                  of their own “efficient cause” (Steiner 72); and the specific task of those who operate
                  wholly within the above binary system is to elaborate strategies and ideologies which
                  save <em>Antigonä </em>and <em>Ödipus der Tyrann as translations</em> (as repetitions and representations of Sophocles) while acknowledging them as <em>originals </em>(as repetitions and representations of “Hölderlin”). But this reconciliation of the
                  text under the two aspects of secondary, belated “translations” and primary, original
                  “originals” is not so reasonable as may appear at first glance.</p>
               <p>“The <em>Antigonä </em>carries to extremity the radicalization of lexical and syntactic means, the shift
                  from sequential-logical conventions and from the external reference of ordinary discourse
                  to an internalized coherence of metaphor and image-clusters” writes George Steiner
                  in a recent study of Hölderlin’s <em>Antigone </em>(67). Steiner thus does full justice to the radicality and “self-consuming anarchy”
                  of the translations; the latter “seem to prefigure Mallarmé’s text” in their “‘paratactic,’
                  which is to say ‘discontinuous’ [. . .] fragmented mode of relation” (16). But Steiner
                  then keeps the recognized linguistic anarchy and violence of the <em>Antigonä</em> well contained within “the ideal [. . .] of fusion, of a homecoming (tragically frustrated)
                  to oneness between consciousness and the world” (69). Although this Return of the
                  temporally alienated consciousness to modern Hesperia along the path of translation
                  is “tragically frustrated,” Hölderlin’s fracturing and disruption of the Sophoclean
                  text reflect, for Steiner, the “record of a pilgrimage out of inner exile” (69). The
                  “extra-territoriality” of Hölderlin’s translation—its excesses and idiosyncrasies
                  which defy interpretation—creates (in the economy of Steiner’s exegesis) the need
                  for the aesthetically compelling myth of a tragic romance which can explain and account
                  for the translator’s excesses: Hölderlin commits “treason” against Sophocles, but
                  this is a “loving treason of a rare kind” (105). The Modern betrays the Ancient, his
                  master, only in order to become, in the affective pathos of this “tragedy of translation,”
                  the “transmutation of the Greek original into its ‘wholeness’” (80).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wolfgang Schadewaldt’s work on Hölderlin’s Sophocles translations provides a second
                     example of how the wildness of these translations—their “obscurity,” “isolation,”
                     and “aberrancy”
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)

                     </div>—is inscribed within a normative vision of literature which privileges the original
                     over the translation, even when the latter is promoted to the status of (almost) original
                     literature. In Schadewaldt’s argument, the more “original” (=refractory, insubordinate,
                     or “wayward”) the translation is, the more “Hölderlinian”; but the more Hölderlinian,
                     the more “Sophoclean” the text becomes, because poets are best at fathoming the latent
                     designs of other poets. In this way the very “idiosyncrasies” of the translator, and
                     his many “swerves” from the original text, lead “to the most astonishing of insights
                     into the essence of Greek tragedy” (279). Schadewaldt does enumerate a number of unfruitful
                     mistranslations of the Greek, but he goes on to say that “the majority of Hölderlin’s
                     linguistic errors are creative errors.” Although the translations are full of “the
                     strangest riddles” and eccentricities, their hieroglyphic and arcane idiom still stands—for
                     Schadewaldt—under the aegis and in the service of a “universal truth” having to do
                     with the essence of tragedy. Hölderlin’s “creative errors” (as opposed to his “linguistic”
                     ones) and riddling phrases are at one and the same time a “new discourse” [<em>Neusprache</em>] and a “restatement” or “repetition” [<em>Nachsprechen</em>] of Sophocles and the discourse of the original.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Yet how else can we read <em>Antigonä</em>, for example, except <em>as </em>a translation? Is it not, after all, a “translation”? Doesn’t “<span class="foreign">Geist der Liebe</span>” translate the Greek word <em>eros</em>, à la Hölderlin, in the sense it takes in the third stasimon of <em>Antigone</em>, just before the heroine stages (in the <em>kommos</em>) her own “encrypting”? However idiosyncratic “<span class="foreign">Geist der Liebe</span>” is for <em>eros</em>, isn’t the substitution in the end a legitimate revision of the anarchic and destructive
                     Greek “libido” into a Romantic energy and <em>Vereinigungsphilosophie</em><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> that strives for synthesis and reconciliation? Again, isn’t a translation supposed
                     to draw upon the special resources of its language in order to achieve a palingenesis
                     of the original Spirit [<em>Geist</em>] in the words of the translation, and thus to make the difficult passage between
                     two different semiotic systems and historical epochs? There are many examples that
                     could be cited where the passage between original and translation—insofar as that
                     passage can be said to take place at all—is much harder to subsume or sublate as instances
                     of “translation.” But the above example, where <em>eros</em> becomes “<span class="foreign">Geist der Liebe</span>,” may exemplify a “passage” and “translation” that is just as problematic as other,
                     much more obscure moments, since “<span class="foreign">Geist</span>” and “<span class="foreign">Liebe</span>” are especially suited to generate a fog that hides the lacunae of always potential
                     non-relations between “Greek” texts and “Hesperian” ones. There is enough textual
                     evidence to suggest that Hölderlin was using the translations as a pretext to write
                     towards some unknown (style or sense) in order to bring about some radical mutation
                     in literary language. In this case, the Sophoclean original could have served as a
                     “pre-text” authorizing an experiment whose purpose was to elaborate a writing that
                     would be resistant to the “positivity” of tradition, with its exhausted conventions
                     and depleted resources.

                     </div> The translations would, then, (Hölderlin’s argument implies) attempt to forge a discourse
                     that can escape or elude those figures which provide the designs for one’s unfateful
                     history (<em>dysmoron</em>); but such an escape can only be attempted <em>in </em>and <em>through</em> a translation of the authoritative and nomothetic Original—whose own fate-fulness
                     is what causes the impotence of modern, belated writing. Translation in Hölderlin’s
                     context thus describes an encounter of Hesperian modes of figuration (“<span class="foreign">vaterländische(n)</span>,” “<span class="foreign">Vorstellungsarten</span>” [<em>FHA</em> 418]) with themselves in their unfallen, original and lapidary, state. Translation
                     is a way to restate or refigure oneself at the origin, and a way to repeat and recycle
                     modern (unfateful or “positive”) figures; but the repetition has the purpose of erasing
                     the original, which is remembered (repeated) in order to be forgotten. Whether these
                     two facets (translating, remembering, repeating the original vs. forgetting or effacing
                     it in one’s own originations) should be structured as a dialectic (as Steiner’s and
                     Schadewaldt’s arguments do), or whether these two moments should be conceived as an
                     irreconcilable difference (non-dialectical, admitting of no, or little, mutually illuminating
                     reciprocity)—is a question that implicitly informs the following sections of this
                     essay, whose concern is more to provide material for a consideration of the question,
                     than to answer it. We turn now to the play <em>Antigone</em>, which is about a translation, that “translation” of the body of the slain Polyneices
                     to the Otherworld where it is to be hallowed but kept out of sight; yet the attempts
                     to bury (translate, render) it all end in failure, and at the end the corpse gets
                     torn to pieces, rent rather than properly rendered to Hades. We propose, then, to
                     investigate the theme of burial in the <em>Antigone</em>—or rather the attempted burial ending in the <em>sparagmos</em> of the body—as an articulation and philosopheme about translation in general, and
                     about Hölderlin’s translations of <em>Antigone </em>in particular.</p>

                              history of interpretation of Antigone. As the most popular play (Greek or otherwise!)
                              of the nineteenth century, Antigone owes its popularity not to the body of Polyneices
                              but to Antigone, the heroine who incarnates a feminine intuition that remains true
                              to itself and to those family values its champions even when faced with death. The
                              ideaization of the female as sister no doubt offered an ethic more socially viable

                     </div> As the constant object of dialogue and <em>agon</em>, the body is the decomposing source of the play’s conflicts and catastrophes. It
                     reveals character in generating their antithetical discourses, since they are always
                     uttering words over it, and about it, in their attempts to appropriate it for their
                     own purposes and tell different stories about it. The questions that begin and end
                     the play are questions about the body: what to <em>do </em>with the unsightly corpse, whether to bury it or not, where to put it, and what will
                     be the psychological, political, and aesthetic consequences if it is (or isn’t) buried.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In this essay we are considering the play <em>Antigone </em>(both Sophocles’ and Hölderlin’s texts) as an allegory of translation, centered in
                  the brouhaha over burial and funeral rite. Greek tragedy characteristically discomposes
                  human institutions by disclosing (or, in the present case, unearthing) possibilities
                  customary suppressed and concealed—such as incest, parricide, and decaying bodies.
                  To approach the theme of burial as exemplification or literalization of translation
                  (which, when it means “say the same thing in another language,” is always figural)
                  is by no means alien to Hölderlin’s own theory and practice of translation, as this
                  section hopes to demonstrate. There are three attempts to bury (translate) the body,
                  and each one fails; the <em>Antigone</em> is accordingly about what happens when translation doesn’t take place. In this allegory
                  of failed translation, the object of translation—the body, the dead, which for Hölderlin
                  were represented by “the Greeks” and their original scripts—disintegrates and pollutes
                  the holy, or drives spirit out of its fragile embodiments. At the end we are left
                  with pieces of Polyneices but no Polyneices, and the Gods announce their rage in the
                  bloodied semiotic vehicles of Teiresias’ omen—the birds who literally rend each other
                  to pieces.</p>
               <p>Greek tragedy has fascinated Hölderlin and others because of its technique of staging,
                  even as collision and rupture, the conjuncture of the natural and supernatural. In
                  the “Notes” to his plays and elsewhere, Hölderlin scrutinizes the place or <em>topos </em>of contact between divine and human, and interrogates this place or moment as to the
                  modes and means of relation and communion, or non-relation and difference, achieved
                  or achievable between the ordinary and the uncanny. Two passages will help to suggest
                  how tragedy, in Hölderlin’s eyes, is concerned with that space, gap, vacuum, “stage,”
                  or moment of passage that separates immaterial powers and those material vehicles
                  of their potential empowering and inhabiting. To Hölderlin, then, tragedy is <em>about</em> this space where Spirit hinges onto word (or art-work)—or doesn’t hinge—or where
                  “God” erupts into human temporality and grasps “man” (or doesn’t do so); and tragedy,
                  being about this space or stage of potential contract, is also about that transport
                  (or obstruction) of sense and meaning in the passage of meaning between two languages.
                  It should come as no surprise to anyone acquainted with Hölderlin’s thought that the
                  linguistic problem of translation is inextricably bound up with theological and existential
                  issues.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The first passage, taken from the “Notes to Antigone,” dissects the moment of “translation”
                     by freezing “the Spirit of Time and Nature” in the moment of its “wildest” confrontation
                     with that “sensory object” in which it (or man) is interested: <span class="quote">‘Der kühnste Moment eines Taglaufs oder Kunstwerks ist, wo der Geist der Zeuir und
                        Natur, <span class="foreign">das Himmlische</span>, was den Menschen ergreift, und der Gegenstand, für welchen er sich interessiert, <em>am wildesten gegeneinander stehen</em>, weil der sinnliche Gegenstand nur eine Hälfte weit reicht, der Geist aber <em>am mächtigsten erwacht</em>, da, wo die zweite Hälfte angehet. In diesem Momente muß der Mensch sich am meisten
                        festhalten, deswegen steht er auch da am offensten in seinem Charakter. (<em>FHA </em>412, my emphases)’</span> At its “boldest moment,” the “Kunstwerk” (in this case, the tragedy <em>Antigonä</em>) or “<span class="foreign">Taglauf</span>” (consciousness in the historical and temporal cycles of its percipience) is to exhibit
                     “Spirit” (or the spirit-in-man) and the material object of its “interest” <em>as </em>they are in themselves, each without its other half that completes it. Without that
                     sensory object which it desires to spiritualize, acculturate, or translate, spirit
                     is a dervish whirling in a vacuum, or frenzied nothingness; and the sensory objects
                     of spiritual quest manifest themselves in this hiatus as truly inert, dead matter,
                     or matter reduced to what it would be without the saving aura of spiritual appropriation
                     and desire. As is clear from the context of this citation from the “Notes,” that “sensory
                     object” of Spirit’s attentions in none other than the exposed body of Polyneices.

                              his translation of Antigone ll. 499ff.: “Was wagtest du ein solches Gesetz zu brechen?”
                              (Creon)—“Darum, mein Zeus berichtete mirs nicht, Noch hier im Haus das Recht der Todesgötter,”
                              etc. (Antigone). This exchange marks the climax in the protagonists’ agon, which is
                              all about the body of Polyneices and the “crime” of burying it.</span></div>
                     </div> But it is important to note that this philosophical drama which the “Kunstwerk” boldly
                     presents stages a scene of <em>potential</em> or <em>attempted</em> inspiration or contact between the spiritual (Concept, Idea, Spirit, Meaning, “<span class="foreign">das Himmlische</span>”) and the material (the visible body of Polyneices, physical bodies in general, the
                     letter). That is, the object occupies the “first-half,” while the domain of Spirit
                     [<em>Geist</em>] inhabits the “second-half.” The object (or body) makes absolutely no effort to reach
                     out and touch Spirit, but “reaches only half-way”—not unlike Michelangelo’s Adam who
                     languidly awaits the inspiriting touch of God. We are not told that Spirit actually
                     makes contact with the body, but only that it “wakes up quite forcefully” [<em>am mächtigsten erwacht</em>] where its space, the “second-half,” begins. It is unclear whether Spirit begins
                     precisely where the body ends (or “ends up”), or whether it simply begins or flares
                     into wakefulness at the boundary of its own territory—which may still be separated,
                     by an unbridgeable lacuna, from the corporeal domain of things, objects, and bodies.</p>
               </div>
               <p>“In this moment [<em>In diesem Momente</em>] man must get a grip on himself the most,” presumably because the daemonic energy
                  of awakened Spirit and matter would reveal human character (“<span class="foreign">steht er auch da am offensten in seinem Charakter</span>”) by exposing it to the dangers of that possible lacuna of non-relation that separates
                  Spirit and object. Is there contact between the two, or isn’t there? Can we speak
                  of a passage and transport between the two, or rather can there be only a hiatus,
                  “caesura,” or abyss dividing them? The “man” who thus confronts this question is thus
                  not only the generic “man” represented by the tragic hero and heroine, but also the
                  reader and translator of bold works of art, culture, and nature [cf. “Taglauf”]. Their
                  own “spirits” (here to be identified generally with the drive and desire that invests
                  “sensory objects” with meaning) are revealed in that very moment when they compelled
                  to witness that the objects (bodies, words) of their interests always remain potentially
                  untouched and “unspirited” by their attempts to appropriate and master them.</p>
               <p>In Hölderlin’s philosophical tableau (preceding citation), then, we see “the Spirit
                  of Time and Nature” provoked by the heterogeneity and inertia of its object into a
                  sheer vigilance, one reflecting all the difficulty or impossibility of making contact
                  or otherwise engaging that object. At issue is what happens in the passage (or non-passage)
                  between Spirit as “transcendental [i.e., as yet unfigured] Signified” and its material
                  or sensory signifiers. Tragedy itself, then—and the <em>Kunstwerk</em> in general—is the attempted mode of transport and translation across the gap between
                  Gods and bodies. We might concretize this somewhat abstract exposition (which is forced
                  on us by the abstractions of the “Notes”) by taking the funeral ritual (and the first
                  burial passage in the <em>Antigone</em>) as an example of the means of transport and translation across the “gap” outlined
                  above.</p>
               <p>The salient features of Hölderlin’s philosopheme—the waking Spirit, its indifferent,
                  lackadaisical object, the ambiguity about the contact between the two, and the capacity
                  of that ambiguity to reveal “character”—are all features of burial rituals. The way
                  in which a culture deals with its dead does provide a kind of index to that culture.
                  Those mythic spells (=Hölderlin’s “das Himmlische”) that a people weaves around its
                  dead in order to sanctify and hallow them (or: get rid of, “forget” them by “remembering”
                  them with grave and epitaph) can well reveal (cf. “<span class="foreign">steht er auch da am offensten in seinem Charakter</span>”) the historico-spiritual nature of a culture. Whether they operate by inhumation,
                  cremation, mummification, or exposure of the body to birds (as in Zoroastrian customs),
                  or to the elements (Amerindians), funerary conventions are crucial in the life of
                  a culture: these rituals all aim to close the gap between <em>animus</em> and <em>corpus</em>, and such closure then allows the members of a community to envision themselves as
                  participants of dramas larger and more meaningful than the individual tragedies of
                  biological extinction.</p>
               <p>A passage from a well-known letter to Böhlendorff explicitly thematizes the sense
                  of “tragedy” [<em>das Tragische</em>] as a genre or sentiment <em>about </em>the attempted closure and enclosure of the dead, their transport out of the world
                  of the living: <span class="quote">‘Denn das ist das Tragische bei uns, daß wir ganz stille in irgendeinem Behälter eingepackt
                     vom Reiche der Lebendigen hinweggehen, nicht daß wir in Flammen verzehrt die Flamme
                     büßen, die wir nicht zu bändigen vermochten. (<em>Sämtliche Werke und Briefe</em> 2.913)’</span> Understood as a reference both to the literary genre and to tragic misfortune, “what
                  is tragic for us” has to do with the fact that “we depart the realm of the living”
                  while “packed up very still in some sort of container.” Modern tragedy (“<span class="foreign">das Tragische bei uns</span>”)—which after the <em>Empedokles</em> project could only occur within the institution of <em>translated</em> Greek tragedy—finds its central emblem or master trope in the coffin, which can be
                  so emblematic of “the tragedy” of Hesperian representation because it is the vehicle
                  of transport and transformation by which the dead are “translated” from the corporeal
                  to the spiritual realm. Playing on the meanings of “<span class="foreign">das Tragische</span>,” Hölderlin comments on the loss of visionariness among the moderns, whose tropologies
                  (modes of transport, metaphorical resources) are designed to hide from their eyes
                  the sight of the actual, visible translation between the two realms—such as cremation
                  (“the flames”) would exhibit. Whether the moderns have lost faith in the possibility
                  of such translation and “passage between,” or whether they simply cannot tolerate
                  the unmediated contact with the daemonic energies that flare up (or “wake up”) in
                  that funerary passage of cremation, they cannot in any case bear to witness the passage
                  itself, but must resort to the strongboxes, “containers” [<em>Behälter</em>], and the protective coffin-concepts of modern culture. This modern mode of transport
                  is, the citation suggests, potentially deluded: whereas “the Greeks” can be sure of
                  translation, can be sure that the spirit takes over as the body turns to ashes (because
                  they <em>watch</em> this happening), the moderns watch their bodies go intact into the container, which
                  then gives the illusion that it will preserve the body <em>intact</em>, but which will rather just conceal the disintegration of the body. The implication
                  of Hölderlin’s observation to his fellow tragedian Böhlendorff is that modern tragedy
                  is under the spell of a double bind: if the body were destroyed in full view, and
                  annihilated in the flame, the modern would lose <em>mastery</em> of the sacred (since it would either consume consciousness in its own conflagration;
                  or the sacred would withdraw or vanish altogether, for the sight of the disintegrating
                  body would call the spiritual into question, and perhaps even destroy it, along with
                  the body); but, in retaining his mastery and control of the sacred by transporting
                  bodies (away from the living) in the coffin the modern never knows if translation
                  takes place, since the transmutation of the body into spirit—if it takes place—is
                  hidden within the coffin, which itself is hidden underground.</p>
               <p><em>Antigone</em>, though, is not about cremation at all, but about burial and its containers. That
                  “<span class="foreign">unterirdische Behausung</span>” and “<span class="foreign">gegrabene Kluft</span>” into which Antigone is banished are hyperbolic figures for the “modern” tragedy
                  of excessive containment which may put bodies out of reach of spirit. This play, then,
                  has something to do with “modern tragedy” (“<span class="foreign">das Tragische bei uns</span>”), and so qualifies as an (ancient) tragedy about modern modes of representation
                  and translation which violate their spirits and bodies either by “grounding” them
                  too much or not enough. Antigone’s “burial” is diametrically opposed to that of Polyneices,
                  her brother and alter-ego; she is buried too much, and he too little. But the focus
                  of our inquiry is the corpse. Hölderlin went so far as to read this corpse, both the
                  <em>arche </em>and <em>telos </em>of Spirit, as the <em>locus classicus</em> of the Absolute, or the place where “the unmediated God” is to manifest itself as
                  a figure in the text of translation; as such, the corpse—with its catastrophes of
                  interrupted burial—marks out the space of possible translation: between languages,
                  between the living and the dead, between “Spirit” and its self-figurations, and between
                  the textual <em>corpus </em>of Sophocles and that of Hölderlin. If we keep in mind that the western literary canon
                  itself was for Hölderlin a sort of “container” or pervasive coffin-text that hid the
                  Sophoclean <em>corpus</em> from view and put it out of our hermeneutical reach (thereby preserving <em>us </em>from it), then we might compare Hölderlin’s undertaking as translator to that of an
                  undertaker who opens a crypt as the first act in the dramatic process of “translating”
                  the relics of a newly canonized saint to holier ground.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">3. The first burial of the <em>Antigone</em> (lines 245ff)</span></h2>
               <p>The issue of the previous two sections can be crystallized and fruitfully complicated
                  through a comparison of the German and Greek texts at the moment of the first burial
                  passage. Creon had issued an edict mandating the execution of anyone who buries Polyneices,
                  the attacker of Thebes and thus its archenemy. The frightened and evasive guard tells
                  the enraged king that the body has been buried under very mysterious circumstances:
                  nobody saw just who buried the corpse, and the perpetrator has left no traces of himself
                  or herself at the scene of the crime. In Wolfgang Schadewaldt’s rendition: <span class="quote">‘Denn da war keiner Hacke Schlag noch einer Schaufel/ Aushub. Hart war die Erde, trocken,
                     ohne Riß,/ Und auch von keinem Wagen nicht befahren/ Mit Rädern, sondern da war keine
                     Spur/ Von irgendeinem Täter. —Als es uns/ Der zeigte, der die erste Tagwacht hatte,/
                     Kam’s alle als ein unbegreiflich Wunder an./ Der Tote war verschwunden—nicht zu Grab
                     gebracht,/ Nur leicht—wie um Befleckung zu vermeiden/ —Lag Staub darauf. Und keine
                     Spuren/ Zu sehn von einem Raubrier, einem Hund,/ Daß er gekommen und an ihm gezerrt.
                     (115)’</span> The unsigned burial is an “unmanageable wonder” [<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qau%3Dma&amp;la=greek&amp;can=qau%3Dma0&amp;prior=pa=si">θαῦμα</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=dusxere%5Cs&amp;la=greek&amp;can=dusxere%5Cs0&amp;prior=qau=ma">δυσχερὲς</a>] both because it has occurred—unbelievably—under their very noses, and also because
                  these “body-guards” have failed in their duty and may have to pay for it with their
                  lives.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It can be plausibly argued that the Gods buried Polyneices in this first burial, and
                     not Antigone (as is usually assumed)—who is caught performing the second burial at
                     ll. 407ff. The chorus afterwards ventures the opinion that the burial was “god-imposed”
                     [<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qeh%2Flaton&amp;la=greek&amp;can=qeh%2Flaton0&amp;prior=kai%5C">θεήλατον</a>], but Creon vehemently rejects this suggestion on the grounds that “the Gods would
                     never bury a traitor” (cf. lines 282-3); he instead suspects hired subversives, perhaps
                     members of Polyneices’ party who transgress the edict just to challenge his authority.
                     The divine has intervened elsewhere in Greek literature to protect the dead from decomposition,
                     and the entire play testifies to the grave sacrilege of unburied bodies.

                              “Divine and Human Action in Sophocles: the two burials of Antigone.”</span></div>

               </div>
               <p>We dwell momentarily on the presence of the divine in this burial scene because this
                  first “translation” of the body takes place in a context of the uncanny and the supernatural.
                  As an inscription of divine care for or “interest” in the body, the non-signs (in)visible
                  on the gravesite function as emblems of the play’s own deep-rooted idealism and of
                  its theology. In asking to be read as the signature of the very Gods to the deed of
                  burial, the signlessness (which the passage describes at length) suggests that the
                  Hand of God may be at work in all burials and translations: these latter two are each
                  of them operations that require the collaboration of deity in their arduous tasks
                  to veil from us the sight of disintegration, whether of bodies or books and their
                  meanings (which disintegrate if they are not translated). Both translation and burial
                  are a means of avoiding the materiality of signs, and this ability to conjure away
                  the material dimension (of things)—which is rooted in the local and specific, and
                  which therefore cannot be translated or buried without violating the thing—is a sorcery
                  that has to enlist the aid of supernatural forces, which themselves leave no marks.
                  </p>
               <p>The actual burial, which here is very much a sorcery, is described at line 255. At
                  the beginning of his report, the guard had told Creon that “somebody just buried the
                  body” (ll. 245-6), and he reiterates this fact at line 255: <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=o%28&amp;la=greek&amp;can=o%283&amp;prior=parh=n">ὁ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=me%5Cn&amp;la=greek&amp;can=me%5Cn0&amp;prior=o(">μὲν</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ga%5Cr&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ga%5Cr2&amp;prior=me%5Cn">γὰρ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29fa%2Fnisto&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h%29fa%2Fnisto0&amp;prior=ga%5Cr">ἠφάνιστο</a> (“The [dead man] had been made invisible”). (Schadewaldt: “<span class="foreign">Der Tote war verschwunden</span>”.) <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29fa%2Fnisto&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h%29fa%2Fnisto0&amp;prior=ga%5Cr">ἠφάνιστο</a> is the pluperfect passive of <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29fa%5En-i%2Fzw&amp;la=greek&amp;can=a%29fa%5En-i%2Fzw0">ἀφανίζω</a>, meaning “to make something <em>aphantos</em>, unseen.” Careful readers should be a bit disturbed or intrigued by this assertion
                  of the guard, since the body has not “really” been buried. That is, this burial is
                  a small miracle in itself, one exemplifying the sense of preternatural legerdemain
                  of the one (or One) who performed it: this “burial” is purely ritual or figural, since
                  it consists of just a few handfuls of dust scattered over the corpse in a symbolic
                  gesture to ward off the taboo or curse of the unburied dead. The corpse, that is,
                  is still “there,” and very much visible. The words “had been made invisible” used
                  by the guard to describe the burial is then a figure of speech, but one made so efficacious
                  by the magic coating of dust that the figure turns into literal description: the body
                  <em>is </em>translated away into its proper realm, for the animals so eager to tear into it—“a
                  meal for birds and dogs” (205-6)—can’t see it and so leave it untouched.</p>
               <p>Before observing how Hölderlin translates this uncanny translation, we should first
                  get a general sense of the verbal ambience of both the Greek and the German passages,
                  which are set out in full below (Greek lines 245-58). The Greek text below differs
                  from Hölderlin’s text (a corrupt Florentine edition) at one place, which I shall indicate
                  later on. </p>

The sentry’s rushing hypotactical discourse suggests, it is true, the excited <em>homme du peuple</em> that he is, especially when his speech is contrasted with Creon’s (preceding) introductory
                  address (ll. 162-210), with its balanced locutions and magniloquent phraseology of
                  kings. Still, the guard does manage to unfold the “wonder hard to behold” of the burial
                  with some logic and precision. He takes care to narrate even this quite remarkable
                  occurrence in a rhetoric of order and lucidity (as in “neither [. . .] nor” [<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29%2Fte&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29%2Fte1&amp;prior=d'">οὔτε</a> [. . .] <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29%2Fte&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29%2Fte1&amp;prior=d'">οὔτε</a>] [l. 257]; or cf. the simile “as” in 256 which implies some presence of mind). It
                  is as if this rational framework would, by seeking to contain the great mystery of
                  the burial within the bounds of the <em>logos</em>, thus offer it up in palatable form to the (political) reason of the king.</p>

                  <p>Hölderlin’s guard, however, nullifies all subtlety. The German elides the plastic
                     and delicate particles of the Greek and thus imparts to translation a disconnected
                     and asyndetic construction. Hölderlin’s efforts to preserve the Greek word order taxes
                     the German syntax with inversions (“<span class="foreign">Nirgend war von einem Karst/ Ein Schlag</span>”) and troubles the sense with ellipses (cf. the omitted verbs in “<span class="foreign">Und dicht das Land; der Boden ungegraben</span>”). The style of the translator’s late hymns has been compared to the syntagmatic

                              also compares the translations with Baroque Trauerspiel in his Ursprung des deutschen

                     </div>, and this comparison is no less apt for the Sophocles translations; especially in
                     the later play <em>Antigonä</em> a mild dyslexia comes through as a result of the translator’s efforts to foreground
                     the individual word by deleting syntax.

               <p>This foregrounding radically alters the tonality of the passage. Whereas the Greek
                  account of the burial is recounted and narrated by one who successfully masters his
                  fear of the king, the German account comes across as being declaimed and intoned by
                  a wild-eyed prophet. The Greek reports the burial in the locutionary mode of recollection
                  and <em>oratio obliqua</em>, while the German in a sense performs the event in its very utterance, which here
                  itself becomes an <em>Ereignis</em>. The inflections of the German guard approximate those of a zealous preacher—perhaps
                  not unlike on who recited the Bible for hours to the seminarians during the translator’s
                  schooling at the <em>Stift</em> in Tübingen.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This comparison helps in specifying the pitch or verbal thrust of Hölderlin’s German,
                     which is theological and absolute. To Creon’s question (“Who would ever dare such
                     a thing—”), the guard responds with two words which hardly receive any emphasis: <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29k&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29k0&amp;prior=*fu/lac">οὐκ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi%29%3Dd%27&amp;la=greek&amp;can=oi%29%3Dd%270&amp;prior=ou)k">οἶδ’</a> (“I can’t say,” “I don’t know,” 249). Yet the first thing one notices in Hölderlin’s
                     rendition is the extravagant “<span class="foreign">Undenklich</span>” for the unexceptional <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29k&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29k0&amp;prior=*fu/lac">οὐκ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi%29%3Dd%27&amp;la=greek&amp;can=oi%29%3Dd%270&amp;prior=ou)k">οἶδ’</a>. Compared to the more sober translations—such as Schadewaldt’s “<span class="foreign">Ich weiß es nicht</span>” or Kuchenmüller’s “<span class="foreign">Ich weiß nicht</span>” (Kuchenmüller 14)—Hölderlin’s rendering takes the reader (with some violence) out
                     of Sophocles’ text and translates one into the immensities of another textual place,
                     that “<span class="foreign">Wüste der Spekulation</span>”

                     “<span class="foreign">undenkliche Zeit</span>,” or in Kant’s phrase in the first <em>Critique</em>, where parallel lines are said to run out “into the Unthink-like” [<em>ins Undenkliche</em>], into a place where thought has no place. Hölderlin had identified tragedy, translated
                     or original, with a modern writing of the Absolute: “<span class="foreign">Undenklich</span>” recalls the word “<span class="foreign">Undenkbare(m)</span>” in an apothegm from the “Notes to Antigone,” where tragedy stages “man’s understanding”
                     as it roams around “as under [the realm of] the Unthinkable” [<em>des Menschen Verstand, als unter Undenkbarem wandelnd</em>] (<em>FHA </em>413).

                              involve what Hölderlin calls (in Grund zum Empedokles) the “Nichtdenken des Unbekannten,”

                  The Greek specifies and qualifies as it unfolds the details of the burial. <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29ll%27&amp;la=greek&amp;can=a%29ll%270&amp;prior=troxoi=sin">ἀλλ᾽</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29%2Fshmos&amp;la=greek&amp;can=a%29%2Fshmos0&amp;prior=a)ll'">ἄσημος</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%28rga%2Fths&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%28rga%2Fths0&amp;prior=a)/shmos">οὑργάτης</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=tis&amp;la=greek&amp;can=tis1&amp;prior=ou(rga/ths">τις</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29%3Dn&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h%29%3Dn3&amp;prior=tis">ἦν</a> (line 252) means “The doer was someone (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=tis&amp;la=greek&amp;can=tis1&amp;prior=ou(rga/ths">τις</a>) who was sign-less.” There were many possible “doers,” so the statement implies,
                  but this particular one had the characteristic of being without sign. Yet Hölderlin
                  makes a “big Idea” out of the Greek, which in itself is a highly significant phrase,
                  but it remains only informational. “<span class="foreign">Zeichenlos war der Meister</span>,” however, is oracular and suggests, in a way the Greek does not, other, wider contexts—whether
                  the semiotic manifestations of deity in general, the absence of their mark on graves,
                  or engravings. “Zeichenlos war der Meister,” that is, easily recalls the gnomic tonalities
                  of the translator’s <em>Spätwerk</em>, whose intertextual presence in the Sophocles (and Pindar) translations often supply
                  interlinear glosses (as here: “<span class="foreign">Ein Zeichen sind wir, deutungslos,/ schmerzlos sind wir und haben fast/ die Sprache
                     in der Fremde verloren</span>”—from “Mnemosyne”).</p>
               <p>“<span class="foreign">Meister</span>,” for <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%28rga%2Fths&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%28rga%2Fths0&amp;prior=a)/shmos">οὑργάτης</a>, also has strong lyrical overtones. The Greek word is poised in a delicate semantic
                  balance between criminal “perpetrator” and masterful “artificer,” and so reflects
                  the guard’s ambivalence as to whether the burial is a miracle of divine artifice or
                  a felony crime. “<span class="foreign">Meister</span>,” however, removes this fine ambiguity, and places the emphasis on the sense of “craftsman”
                  or “virtuoso.” “<span class="foreign">Meister</span>” is, of course, a common trope in the translator’s lyrics for authors and architects,
                  whether Gods (e.g., “<span class="foreign">Mein Meister und Herr</span>!” apostrophizing Christ in “Der Einzige”) or divinized poets (“<span class="foreign">Wenn nur vollendet sein Bild und fertig ist der Meister</span>” in “Friedensfeier”). The translation (“<span class="foreign">Zeichenlos war der Meister</span>”), then, appears to be telling its own tragedy within the original tragedy: while
                  telling Sophocles’ story about the Gods who (seem to) intervene in human affairs in
                  order to cover over the “outrageous sight” (ll. 205-6) of death, the line also tells
                  Hölderlin’s story about the <em>Deus absconditus</em> of the Hesperians, which may be that “God” who can only presence himself “in the
                  form of death,” in, that is, figures of spirit absented from itself (cf. “<span class="foreign">der Gott, in der Gestalt des Todes, gegenwärtig ist</span>” [<em>FHA </em>417]). But that absence of signs, which in the Greek burial are the signs of a divine
                  superintendency over mortal affairs becomes in translation a more tragic sort of absence,
                  since those signs (we don’t see) left behind by the hand of Greek deity are no longer—in
                  German—assignable to the “<span class="foreign">Meister</span>” (God or vatic poet), who are “<span class="foreign">Zeichenlos</span>.”</p>
               <p>The statement “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>” amplifies the theme about the disjunction between Authors and Signs which the translation
                  appears to be telling. But “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>” (“There was nothing ceremonious”) is a very odd way to translate the remarkable
                  Greek phrase “The body had been made invisible” [<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=o%28&amp;la=greek&amp;can=o%283&amp;prior=parh=n">ὁ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=me%5Cn&amp;la=greek&amp;can=me%5Cn0&amp;prior=o(">μὲν</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ga%5Cr&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ga%5Cr2&amp;prior=me%5Cn">γὰρ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29fa%2Fnisto&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h%29fa%2Fnisto0&amp;prior=ga%5Cr">ἠφάνιστο</a>]. Not being quite sure how to construe Hölderlin’s rendition, one notes the participle
                  “<span class="foreign">gefeiert</span>” (eight lines before) for <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ka%29fagisteu%2Fsas&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ka%29fagisteu%2Fsas0&amp;prior=palu/nas">κἀφαγιστεύσας</a>—“having performed proper burial rites.” “<span class="foreign">Feiern</span>” is evidently deployed in the sense of “bury” or “commemorate with a funeral,” with
                  the result that the immediate contextual meaning of “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>” would be “No funeral or burial took place.” But this negates the burial which very
                  definitely took place in the Greek, and which provides the central dramatic motivation
                  for the entire episode. The words following “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>” further abolish the miraculous Greek burial: “<span class="foreign">Es war kein Grabmal nicht</span>” (correctly, for <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=tumbh%2Frhs&amp;la=greek&amp;can=tumbh%2Frhs0&amp;prior=h)fa/nisto">τυμβήρης</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=me%5Cn&amp;la=greek&amp;can=me%5Cn1&amp;prior=tumbh/rhs">μὲν</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29%2F&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29%2F0&amp;prior=me%5Cn">οὔ</a>—“There was no grave-monument”). Hence no grave and no burial! What has happened to
                  the body? Far from being “made invisible,” it has literally got lost in translation.</p>
               <p>Hölderlin’s lyrical intertext is echoed once again in the phrase “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>.” “<span class="foreign">Feier</span>,” “<span class="foreign">feierlich</span>,” and “<span class="foreign">feiern</span>” recur in the late lyrics, and refer to that celebration and ceremony that poetry
                  is meant to be. A common motif in Hölderlin’s <em>Spätwerk</em> is to recount how the Poem of the Moderns is to come into being <em>as </em>the commemoration and celebration of Greek letters. Yet it becomes ever more difficult
                  a task to revive Greek text-events (such as Sophoclean tragedy or Pindaric Ode) in
                  the hymn, elegy, or translation, since the modern tropologies and mythologies of “celebration”
                  grow less and less able—in the passage of time, and as both the perdurance and alterity
                  of the precursor’s originations seem more and more inescapable to understand, and
                  so to tell about, their very origins in Greece. The Moderns are to hymn themselves
                  by singing the Ancients, since the poetic celebration of the Ancients is the means
                  by which the moderns repossess and re-appropriate for their own purposes the poetic
                  discourse of the ancients, which they are constrained to use. If they are properly
                  celebrated, the Greeks can speak Hesperian, or speak for them; but if the Greeks are
                  not celebrated, if “no celebration of poetry takes place,” or if “there is nothing
                  that is the object of a celebration” (“<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>”), then the Hesperians lose their voice and themselves remain untranslated into recognition.
                  It would appear, then, that the translation employs the mysterious burial of a corpse
                  as a means to announce the death of modern poetry, now no longer capable of celebrating,
                  as the Greek original, the congruence of poetic signs and divine intentions, their
                  secret affiliations, and their capacity to translate bodies, and thus words, into
                  other contexts which preserve their souls and meanings intact. Hölderlin’s guard,
                  who later delivers an obsequy on that spirit (who appears not to have been celebrated),
                  tellingly refers to himself as “<span class="foreign">den Geisterlosen</span>” (“the one without Geist,” rendering line 274, “the ill-fated one”).</p>
               <p>Yet the “case of the missing body” is far from closed. More philological evidence
                  must be taken into consideration. In Hölderlin’s Greek text, the “Juntina” edition
                  of 1555, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29k&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29k0&amp;prior=*fu/lac">οὐ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi%29%3Dd%27&amp;la=greek&amp;can=oi%29%3Dd%270&amp;prior=ou)k">δ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=me%5Cn&amp;la=greek&amp;can=me%5Cn1&amp;prior=tumbh/rhs">ὲν</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ga%5Cr&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ga%5Cr2&amp;prior=me%5Cn">γὰρ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29fa%2Fnisto&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h%29fa%2Fnisto0&amp;prior=ga%5Cr">ἠφάνιστο</a> (“<em>Nothing </em>had been made invisible”) supplies the Greek words corresponding to the fatal half-line
                  “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>.” The Juntina says nearly the <em>opposite</em>, then, of the reading given in most other (better) editions, which is (as we have
                  seen) <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=o%28&amp;la=greek&amp;can=o%283&amp;prior=parh=n">ὁ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=me%5Cn&amp;la=greek&amp;can=me%5Cn0&amp;prior=o(">μὲν</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ga%5Cr&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ga%5Cr2&amp;prior=me%5Cn">γὰρ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29fa%2Fnisto&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h%29fa%2Fnisto0&amp;prior=ga%5Cr">ἠφάνιστο</a> (“the [dead] man had been made invisible”). Yet even this corrupt reading could have
                  been read in such a way as to salvage the burial, instead of flatly stating that it
                  didn’t take place. “Nothing had been made invisible” could have been taken to mean,
                  “Everything was as clear as day”—i.e., “nothing had been hidden from us,” “we recognized
                  the terrible deed of burial.” Yet Hölderlin <em>may </em>not have been reading, interpreting, and so saving the text; he might not have been
                  thinking, just here (at line 255) about Greek burials and how best to translate them
                  into modern (non)burials. Rather, he might simply have been making a mistake, supposing
                  (erroneously) that <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29fa%2Fnika&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h%29fa%2Fnika0&amp;prior=i%5Ew=">ἠφάνι</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*mou%2Fsas&amp;la=greek&amp;can=*mou%2Fsas0&amp;prior=po/leos">σ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=th%5Cn&amp;la=greek&amp;can=th%5Cn1&amp;prior=a)">τ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29si%2Fan&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29si%2Fan0&amp;prior=th%5Cn">ο</a> (“had been made invisible”) was a form of the verb (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29fagn-i%2Fzw&amp;la=greek&amp;can=a%29fagn-i%2Fzw0">ἀφαγνίζω</a>) (“to render funeral rites (to)”), which had come up eight lines earlier in the word

                  the small difference between a <em>nu</em> (ν) and a <em>gamma </em>(γ), and thus—while under the influence of the nearby <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ka%29fagisteu%2Fsas&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ka%29fagisteu%2Fsas0&amp;prior=palu/nas">κἀφαγιστεύσας</a>—confused <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29fagn-i%2Fzw&amp;la=greek&amp;can=a%29fagn-i%2Fzw0">ἀφαγνίζω</a> (to Hölderlin=“celebrate with due burial”) with <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29fa%5En-i%2Fzw&amp;la=greek&amp;can=a%29fa%5En-i%2Fzw0">ἀφανίζω</a> (“make invisible”).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Does the “philological” thesis that the translator made a mistake annul the one previously
                     proposed, which we might call the “thematic” or “allegorical” explanation? Does the
                     theory about the simple mistake make otiose the theory that Hölderlin translates Sophocles
                     by thematizing the limitations of modern poetic rituals—limitations which impinge
                     upon the translator’s consciousness when it is faced with “the Absolute,” in the form
                     of the first burial, with its prodigiously efficacious burial ritual and its aura
                     of supernatural protection? The philological account is in fact no less conjectural
                     than the “thematic” one. Previous expositions of Hölderlin’s translation, and recently
                     Seifert’s work on the Pindar translations, have demonstrated that Hölderlin frequently
                     mistranslated on purpose, in order to align the lexical register and rhetorical implications
                     of the translations with those of his own poetic discourse.

                     </div> One could even speak of an index of refraction by which the Greek is often “bent”
                     on its passage into the German in order to fit into a lyrical intertext. Although
                     “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>,” for example, might well be a mistake (unconscious misprision), it is impossible
                     to know with any certainty whether Hölderlin knew what he was doing when he wrote
                     these words. Other “mistakes” are more certainly classifiable as genuine mistakes,
                     such as <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=fu%3Dlon&amp;la=greek&amp;can=fu%3Dlon0">φῦλον</a> (“people”) misunderstood for <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=fu%2Fllon&amp;la=greek&amp;can=fu%2Fllon0">φύλλον</a> (“leaves” at <em>Oedipus Tyrannus </em>l.19). Yet each deviation is to be evaluated in its own individual circumstances and
                     specific context, and questions about the translator’s conscious intentionality will
                     often be complex or undecidable.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The “allegorical” reading of the passage does show one tendency of Hölderlin’s translations:
                  they “translate” by commenting on their relation to the original. Such phrases as
                  “<span class="foreign">Undenklich</span>,” “<span class="foreign">Zeichenlos war der Meister</span>,” “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>,” “<span class="foreign">der gekommen und</span> zerrissen” have a metacritical function that comments upon or evaluates the original
                  either <em>while </em>translating it, or <em>instead </em>of translating it. That is, “<span class="foreign">Undenklich</span>,” for example, translates (albeit somewhat oddly) the guard’s <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29k&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29k0&amp;prior=*fu/lac">οὐκ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi%29%3Dd%27&amp;la=greek&amp;can=oi%29%3Dd%270&amp;prior=ou)k">οἶδ’</a>, but it also evaluates “Sophocles” and “the Greeks,” as well as the relation that
                  the translator’s understanding and linguistic means bear to the original text, its
                  form and content. In this way Hölderlin translates Sophocles in order to speak about
                  himself, or rather to allow his language to say whatever it wants when it is compelled
                  to face up to its own belatedness in the self-conscious confrontation with the language
                  of Sophocles—“<span class="foreign">Das Träumerischnaive. Eigentliche Sprache des Sophokles</span>” (<em>FHA</em> 413).</p>
               <p>“<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>,” then, might just be a phrase marking the translator’s real bafflement when faced
                  with the Greek phrase <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29k&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29k0&amp;prior=*fu/lac">οὐ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi%29%3Dd%27&amp;la=greek&amp;can=oi%29%3Dd%270&amp;prior=ou)k">δ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=me%5Cn&amp;la=greek&amp;can=me%5Cn1&amp;prior=tumbh/rhs">ὲν</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ga%5Cr&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ga%5Cr2&amp;prior=me%5Cn">γὰρ</a> <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29fa%2Fnisto&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h%29fa%2Fnisto0&amp;prior=ga%5Cr">ἠφάνιστο</a> (“Nothing had been made invisible”). “<span class="foreign">Nichts Feierlichs</span>” might well be a critical statement about the unreadability of the original: “There
                  is nothing (here) that is the (possible) object of (my) translation/celebration.”
                  At the moment when something goes wrong in the original (for “how could there <em>not </em>be a burial-celebration”—so Hölderlin might have thought—“when the text has asserted
                  this very event eight lines before?”), there does the translator bring in his own
                  “originals,” whose emblematic adjective is “Feierlich,” into the text of translation,
                  but he introduces them in the form of a negation: “<em>Nichts</em> Feierlichs.” Where the original is unreadable, the translator resorts to profanity.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">The fact that Hölderlin often adhered closely to the Greek syntax, and mimed it in
               the German word order, doesn’t weaken the point being made here that Hölderlin was
               carrying out his own experiments in the textual laboratory of Sophocles. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Cf. Paul de Man’s “The Return to Philology”: to “return” to philology means “to read
               a text closely as a text and not to move at once into the general context of human
               experience or history” (23).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Citations from “Anmerkungen zur Antigonä” will be abbreviated <em>FHA</em> (<em>Frankfurter Ausgabe</em>).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">The thematic importance of the body of Polyneices has largely been obscured by the
               history of interpretation of <em>Antigone</em>. As the most popular play (Greek or otherwise!) of the nineteenth century, <em>Antigone </em>owes its popularity not to the body of Polyneices but to Antigone, the heroine who
               incarnates a feminine intuition that remains true to itself and to those family values
               its champions even when faced with death. The ideaization of the female <em>as sister</em> no doubt offered an ethic more socially viable (for a rising bourgeoisie) than the
               female as wife, mother, mistress, or friend, since the sister figure would allow the
               spectator/reader to be titillated by the young, beautiful, and nubile heroine, while
               at the same time the audience morality could be assuaged by that heroine’s non-sexual
               love for a family member, which is meant to take precedence over all erotic impulses.
               But Antigone’s love for her brother (her “brotherly love”) depends for its very purity—its
               elevation over the sexual—upon the deadness of her brother, for this deadness kills
               the possibility of incest (very much a skeleton in the family closet), and raises
               her love to the status of a Christian <em>agape</em>. One should recall that the body of her brother is totally destroyed—as if to eradicate
               in this <em>sparagmos</em> all possibility of any sexual attachment between the heroine and her loved one, and
               thus assure the complete spirituality of her love.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Hölderlin writes this paragraph as a commentary to the preceding lines taken from
               his translation of <em>Antigone</em> ll. 499ff.: “<span class="foreign">Was wagtest du ein solches Gesetz zu brechen</span>?” (Creon)—“<span class="foreign">Darum, mein Zeus berichtete mirs nicht, Noch hier im Haus das Recht der Todesgötter</span>,” etc. (Antigone). This exchange marks the climax in the protagonists’ <em>agon</em>, which is all about the body of Polyneices and the “crime” of burying it.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">In <em>Iliad </em>24.610-12, the gods bury Niobe’s children. Hektor’s body is also saved from putrefaction.
               Arguments for the divine burial in <em>Antigone</em> may be found in Marsh McCall, “Divine and Human Action in Sophocles: the two burials
               of Antigone.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Norbert von Hellingrath first pointed out the stylistic parallels between Hölderlin’s
               translations of Sophocles and Baroque poetry. Cf. <em>Hölderlins Vermächtnis</em>. Walter Benjamin also compares the translations with Baroque <em>Trauerspiel </em>in his <em>Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Cf. Kurt Bartsche, <em>Die Hölderlin-Rezeption im deutschen Expressionismus.</em></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">The phrase occurs in a letter (1.1.1799) to his brother: “<span class="foreign">Kant ist der Moses unserer Nation, der sie aus der ägyptischen Erschlaffung in die
                  freie, einsame Wüste der Spekulation führt, und der das energische Gesetz vom heiligen
                  Berge bringt</span>” (<em>StA </em>6.1.304).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">Such a realm would be the Unconditioned expanse outside of the Kantian <em>a priori </em>structures of experience, or the speculator’s surmise of the unlimited historical
               and political possibilities not (yet) realized. Any path taken across this “desert”—whether
               the inscribing pens of “Reason” or in the transport of bodies in burial rites—would
               necessarily involve what Hölderlin calls (in <em>Grund zum Empedokles</em>) the “<span class="foreign">Nichtdenken des Unbekannten</span>,” i.e., the radical forgetting of the desert terrain, a place whose only landmarks
               are those paths retraced again and again in sand.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
