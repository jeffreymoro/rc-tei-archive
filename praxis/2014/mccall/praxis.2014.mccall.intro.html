               <p>This volume of <em>Romantic Circles Praxis</em> takes its inspiration from the writings on tragedy, translation and twentieth century
                  literary theory by the late comparatist Thomas J. McCall, who died suddenly in January
                  2011 after returning from a mountain trekking trip in Nepal.

                           in Comparative Literature at Yale University and was teaching at the University of
                           Houston-Clear Lake at the time of his death.</span></div>
                  </div> Tom McCall was a highly respected Romanticist and literary theorist whose important
                  early work on Friedrich Hölderlin’s translations of Sophocles ultimately developed
                  into a broader critical speculation concerning the theoretical stakes of Hölderlin’s
                  translations, and his poetics, for German romantic thought and for twentieth century
                  theory more generally. Assembled here are three of McCall’s essays from across his
                  abbreviated career: on Hölderlin’s translation of <em>Antigone</em>, on Walter Benjamin’s early essay “Two Poems of Friedrich Hölderlin,” and on the
                  notion of “allegorical” translation as it can be interpreted from Hölderlin’s writings
                  and translations of both <em>Oedipus</em> and <em>Antigone</em> as well as their inflection in Benjamin’s work. (This last piece was a later reconsideration
                  of Hölderlin that remained unplublished at the time of McCall’s death.)

                  </div> These essays are the point of departure for three accompanying critical pieces by
                  Romanticists and literary theorists who have been engaged with McCall’s work: my own
                  reflections on McCall’s early writing on Hölderlin, Ian Balfour’s skillful explication
                  of McCall’s reading of Benjamin in relation to Benjamin’s and Theodor Adorno’s thoughts
                  on philology, and David Ferris’s moving tribute to McCall’s work on tragedy in the
                  form of a meditation on the elegiac tradition and a reading of Shelley’s elegy for
                  John Keats, a Romantic writer whose life was also cut short. The three pairs of essays,
                  taken together, underscore the crucial role of Hölderlin’s notions of translation
                  and poetics in Romantic theory and in contemporary thought, in particular as his ideas
                  have been transmitted through the work of Walter Benjamin. These critical explorations
                  also help us understand the importance of Tom McCall’s work in proposing a radicalized,
                  Hölderlinian theory of tragedy and translation that lingers on in twentieth- and twenty-first
                  century theoretical writing.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">I</span></h2>
               <p>What binds McCall’s three essays—on translation and tragedy, on poetry and poetics,
                  and on an “allegorical” tradition of translation and critique—is a single thread that
                  emerges from a dramatic scene. McCall’s critical endeavors begin with the struggle
                  over a corpse: the conflict between Antigone and Creon over the burial of her brother,
                  Polyneices. At the site of the exposed body, McCall suggests, in the question of Polyneices’
                  burial at the heart of this Greek play, Hölderlin locates a <em>problem of translation</em>—the passage between mortal and divine. In Hölderlin’s rendering of the play, this
                  problem of passage or translation will ultimately bind the Greeks’ interpretation
                  of the burial’s (and non-burial’s) significance <em>in</em> the play with the Germans’ attempt to find their own significations <em>of</em> the Greek text. What arises in the Greek play as a problem of passage (or lack of
                  passage) from one realm to the other will thus become, in Hölderlin’s rendering of
                  the play, the very problem of translation from Greek to German; the struggle over
                  a (Greek) burial is translated as a problem of <em>German</em> destiny. In this sense the question of contact with the divine is bound up, for Hölderlin,
                  with the problem of another kind of encounter: the encounter that may or may not take
                  place in the translation of the Greek play into another language and another time;
                  the very possibility—or impossibility—of contact with the Greek in the modern German
                  text. What would it mean to take account of this struggle, of the risk of exposing
                  this corpse, in the very act of translation?</p>
               <p>It is this <em>problem of contact</em> that is central to McCall’s surprising and evocative reading of the self-allegorizing
                  dimension of Hölderlin’s <em>Antigone</em> translation, as I suggest in my reading of “The Case of the Missing Body,” and it
                  also serves as a figurative and conceptual crux of interpretation that leads across
                  McCall’s writing in this volume. Indeed, in his later essay on Benjamin’s poetics
                  as they emerge from Hölderlin’s poetry and theory, this question of contact takes
                  another turn. Here the difficulty of translation is reiterated, somewhat differently,
                  in the critical problem of approaching the “untouchable Middle” of the poem, the incalculable
                  heart of a poetic text determined through calculable law. What is a criticism, McCall
                  asks us to consider, that both approaches this center and dares <em>not to touch</em> it?</p>
               <p>In his final return to Hölderlin’s translations, which are inflected by his reading
                  of Benjamin’s <em>Origins of German Tragedy</em>, McCall names, or rather renames, this literary and critical undertaking that is
                  both a mode of translation and a poetics; he calls it “wrathful translation” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">"Wrathful Translation" par. 33</a>). This enterprise takes its name and its significance from McCall’s own translation
                  and appropriation of Hölderlin’s <em>Zorn</em>, the word the poet uses to describe Oedipus’s wrathful quest for what is “more than
                  consciousness can bear or grasp” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">par. 16</a>). “Wrath,” McCall suggests, “signals the nonendingness of the process of disowning
                  the signifier” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">par. 17</a>), a critical engagement with textuality that emerges from a specific Romantic reading
                  of its classical past. This quest beyond any assimilable meaning—which arises, for
                  the wrathful translator, in the act of encountering foreign texts—extends beyond the
                  specific problem of translation. At the heart of this practice is the refusal of a
                  translator, a critic, or a reader to grasp too eagerly for (a final) sense; that is,
                  to secure the literary tradition by interring it in its symbolic aesthetic and moral
                  significance. In searching, endlessly, beyond signification, the critic’s hold on
                  sense is “loosened” and the encounter with the text repeatedly estranged. “It could
                  even be argued that ‘criticism’ <em>tout simple</em>,” McCall proposes, “has to do with the critical disarticulation of the symbolic core
                  of tragedy, especially after this complex genre, considerably simplified through such
                  lucid mimetic models as Aristotle’s, renders itself to critical judgment” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">par. 12</a>) In the critical act, as in the act of translation, there is a struggle over the
                  very possibility of contact with a literary text no longer conceivable in a symbolic
                  mode.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II</span></h2>
               <p>This reformulation of criticism puts McCall’s readings of Hölderlin, Ian Balfour suggests,
                  in an alternative line of thinking that accompanies and questions the modern aesthetic
                  tradition of literary criticism, an alternative tradition that Balfour calls “extreme
                  philology” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.balfour.html">"Extreme Philology" par. 2</a>). Extreme philology emerges from the Romantic critics (including such writers as
                  Friedrich Schlegel) and extends into the twentieth century in thinkers such as Walter
                  Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, and Paul de Man. McCall’s essay on Benjamin’s “Two Poems
                  of Friedrich Hölderlin” likewise insists on the importance of this early work of the
                  German critic as an important contribution to an anti-aesthetic or anti-symbolic criticism,
                  a tradition of “poetic calculation” (rather than “poetic inspiration”) that pays close
                  attention to the “mechanical” operations of a poem and the resistant details of poetic
                  language. Starting with the description of the “calculable law” (a notion taken from
                  Hölderlin) and the “functions” of the poem that operate according to this law, Benjamin
                  ultimately ends up, McCall explains, at an incalculable core: “To surpass the sublimity
                  of the sublime,” he remarks, “is to become something wholly prosaic [. . .] in an
                  inversion that Benjamin precisely specifies as an ‘untouchable sober-prosaic figure’
                  and that he links to a poetological term called a ‘Caesura’” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.plastic_poetic.html">"Plastic Time" par. 11</a>). This Hölderlinian use of the term, McCall elaborates, “is a means to thematize
                  the real resistance of such ‘untouchability’ to critical appropriation” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.plastic_poetic.html">par. 21</a>). The Benjaminian notion of the caesura—the site of a significatory break or gap—is
                  drawn from Hölderlin’s “Remarks on <em>Oedipus</em>,” and exemplifies another way in which tragedy passes into its translations—from
                  Greek to German, from drama to poetry to criticism—at the very site of its own lacunae:
                  at the places where it cannot simply be grasped or touched.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The end of McCall’s essay on Benjamin could be said both to exemplify, and to allegorize,
                     this work of extreme philology, when the argument turns to Benjamin’s citation of
                     the final lines of Hölderlin’s “Blödligkeit” (“Timidity”) as an example of the “striking
                     caesura,” of the “untouchable middle” of the poem. Benjamin writes: <span class="quote">‘How much [Hölderlin] signifies the untouchable middle of all relation is embodied
                        most powerfully in the last two verses [. . .] “and (we poets) bring one of the heavenly
                        ones. And ourselves we bring capable hands.” So the poet is no longer seen as form,
                        but only still as principle of form, the Delimiter, the one still carrying even his
                        own body.

                        </div>’</span> These enigmatic lines of Benjamin, for McCall, illustrate the caesura of the poem
                     in the peculiar Hölderlinian parallel by which the poet brings both “one of the heavenly
                     ones” and “capable hands,” a juxtaposition that estranges, and indeed literalizes,
                     the hands of the poet, as if they were something that could be merely carried or “brought.”
                     It is “the juxtaposition of the theophanic and the technological (capable hands, which
                     Hölderlin elsewhere calls the <em>mechane</em>),” McCall suggests, “that constitutes the caesura, which here strikes the reader
                     as the Hölderlinian-Benjaminian project to realize, always only imperfectly, the complete
                     separateness and distantiation that the perfectly ‘sober’ unity of lyric demands”
                     (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.plastic_poetic.html">par. 22</a>). In McCall’s reading, we might elaborate, the point of possible contact—between
                     the god and the poet, whose hands, writing the poem, would seem so close to the divine—is
                     the place where any contact by means of <em>sense</em> becomes impossible, as the poetic figure of “hands” becomes literally unrecognizable.
                     Yet the realization of this “sober” dimension of the poem is also “holy”—a “holy-sober”
                     style that might be seen as an imperative for the poet, for the translator, and, somewhat
                     differently, for the critic.</p>

               <p>What does it mean for this act of translation, of poetic composition, or of criticism
                  to be given the name of “wrath,” an affect that, in his final essay in this issue,
                  McCall associates with a line of critical affects including Kant’s <em>Wohlgefallen</em> (satisfaction) and Benjamin’s <em>Trauer</em> (mourning)? In translating McCall’s “Wrathful Translation” in his own title, “Mournful
                  Translation,” David Ferris suggests that this question can only be approached through
                  another passage: not from ancients to Romantics, or from Greek to German, but from
                  the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries, from Greek to (Hölderlinian and Benjaminian)
                  German, or in this case, from German to English. In the modern elegy, which Ferris
                  illustrates with Shelley’s “Adonais,” the affect of mourning effectively translates
                  the endless wrathful quest of the tragic hero and, like Hölderlinian translation,
                  puts into question its own mournful yearning for sense. “Wrath” and ”mourning” could
                  perhaps be said to take part in a history of affects that are always engaged with
                  their own translation, with the attempt <em>to pass over</em> that both drives and frustrates the aesthetic and poetic endeavours.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wrathful translation, as McCall defines it, is indeed a quest that refuses to settle
                     on any signification, a self-staging and self-questioning “allegorical” process—a
                     term McCall borrows from Benjamin’s discussion of the Baroque mourning-play and from
                     Paul de Man’s reformulation of the distinction between allegory and symbol. To translate
                     in wrath is not to consolidate, but rather to disperse sense, even as one seeks to
                     translate the text at hand. “[The translation’s] senses are played out so fast, made
                     and unmade so often” McCall writes, “that [it] serves as a metacommentary on its own
                     acts of sense-making, and stages, beyond itself, the genesis and erasure of sense”
                     (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">"Wrathful Translation" par. 32</a>). It is this dispersal of sense that is passed on in “mournful translation,” in its
                     modulation of the tragic legacy.

                     “translate” (a) death into a knowable name or subject, to confer on it sense and a
                     delimitable place in time so that grief might be purged in a poetic act of catharsis.
                     In its own elegiac quest, the mournful translation is thus most effective—and affective—in
                     its refusal to conclude at this place of rest. Shelley’s “Adonais,” in Ferris’s own
                     mournful reading, can be said to “translate” grief most powerfully through its very
                     withholding of the mourned one’s name in its ultimately unreadable title, and in its
                     transferring of mourning onto the name of the “sad Hour” that the poem calls up and
                     through which it denudes time itself of the comforting conclusion to grief.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">IV</span></h2>
               <p>In this context, it is perhaps significant that all of the essays in this issue can
                  be said to center around, and convey, literary and critical acts of mourning: the
                  attempt of Antigone to bury her dead brother; the unstated mourning of Benjamin in
                  his essay “Two Poems of Friedrich Hölderlin” which, Ian Balfour suggests, is “intimately
                  bound up with the then recent death of his friend, Friedrich Heinle” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">par. 10</a>); and Shelley’s elegiac response to the death of John Keats. These scenes have now
                  also become, for those of us writing in this volume, the textual sites of a very present
                  mourning, in our own attempts to pass between the living and the dead. This wrathful
                  yearning and this frustrated mourning may be the only way, indeed, that translation
                  ever takes place, in the passing on of an affect that refuses to be grasped. The precariousness
                  of such a passage may also find, perhaps, its own allegory in the fate of the mourners
                  about whom we all have written here: the early death of Antigone in the tomb to which
                  she was consigned by Creon; the suicide of Benjamin during WWII that strangely repeats,
                  though in very different circumstances, the suicide in WWI of Friedrich Heinle; and
                  the early death of Shelley, just one year after “Adonais”—a poem that uncannily anticipates,
                  in the lines of its final stanza, his accidental death at sea. The translation from
                  dramatist to poet, from poet to critic, and from theorist to theorist, takes place
                  through the precariousness of a grief, and a textual transmission, that, as Shelley
                  laments in his poem, may “itself be mortal.” It is indeed this mortality, McCall has
                  revealed to us, that incites the yearning (the wrath, the mourning) of translation,
                  and what prevents it from ever coming to an end.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In this context, too, we might also return to McCall’s careful elucidation of the
                     quest for contact that Hölderlin passes on to us from the heart of tragic drama. The
                     critical endeavor (in its wrath or grief) can never simply grasp or hold onto what
                     lies before it, but may nonetheless pass on what Sam Weber has called the “touch of
                     translation,”

                           the original fleetingly and only in the infinitely minute point of its meaning, in
                           order to pursue its own course following the law of fidelity, in the freedom of the

               Translation and Theory: A Tribute to the Work of Thomas J. McCall.” I am grateful
               to Deborah White for her assistance in moving the panel from presentation to publication
               at RCP. I also want to express profound thanks to Professor Kevin McNamara, Tom McCall’s
               colleague and good friend, who took salvaged Tom’s papers after his death and provided
               both materials and endless assistance in gather together Tom’s work. I would also
               like to note the support of Tom’s sister Terry McCall, who also provided invaluable
               support and materials before and after the panel. Additional materials were provided
               by Cynthia Chase, Andrzej Warminski, David Ferris, and Ian Balfour. Luke Donahue gave
               excellent editorial advice for the entire issue. Tom’s writing on tragedy, translation
               and violence is being edited by me and Kevin McNamara under Tom’s chosen title <em>Vortexts: Essays on Tragedy, Translation and Violence</em>, as well as a manuscript he had completed before he died entitled <em>Romantic Origins of Theory.</em></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
